The method is well suited for a distributed architecture, where the routing of analog signals over long paths is minimized. A clock is routed serially to the sampling heads placed at the nodes of analog test voltages. This sampling head present at each test node, which consists of a pair of delay cells and a pair of flip-flops, locally converts the test voltage to a skew between a pair of subsampled signals, thus giving rise to as many subsampled signal pairs as the number of nodes. To measure a certain analog voltage, the corresponding subsampled signal pair is fed to a delay measurement unit to measure the skew between this pair. The concept is validated by designing a test chip in a UMC 130-nm CMOS process. Sub-millivolt accuracy for static signals is demonstrated for a measurement time of a few seconds, and an effective number of bits of 5.29 is demonstrated for low-bandwidth signals in the absence of sample-and-hold circuitry.", "paper_title": "Time-Based All-Digital Technique for Analog Built-in Self-Test", "paper_id": "WOS:000330216600013"}
