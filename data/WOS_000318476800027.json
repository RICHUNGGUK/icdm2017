We present in detail the numerical schemes for the scalar case and its generalization to multichannel (vectorial) images. Then, we discuss their implementation in digital image denoising. The results outperform the resolution of the dual equation based on the gradient descent approach and pave the way for more advanced numerical strategies.", "paper_title": "Box Relaxation Schemes in Staggered Discretizations for the Dual Formulation of Total Variation Minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000318476800027"}
