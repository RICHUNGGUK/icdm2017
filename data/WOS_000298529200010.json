We study the problem of determining whether there is an infinite path where either (i) all colors occur with a fixed asymptotic frequency, or (ii) there is a constant that bounds the difference between the occurrences of any two colors for all prefixes of the path. These properties can be viewed as quantitative refinements of the classical notion of fair path in a concurrent system, whose simplest form checks whether all colors occur infinitely often. Our notions provide stronger criteria, particularly suitable for scheduling applications based on a coarse-grained model of the jobs involved. In particular, they enforce a given set of priorities among the jobs involved in the system. We show that both problems we address are solvable in polynomial time, by reducing them to the feasibility of a linear program. We also consider two-player games played on finite colored graphs where the goal is one of the above frequency-related properties. For all the goals, we show that the problem of checking whether there exists a winning strategy is Co-NP-complete. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
