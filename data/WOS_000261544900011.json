By following the principle of maximum information preservation, this paper formulates the model selection problem as a problem of selecting an optimal kernel-induced space in which different classes are maximally separated from each other. A scatter-matrix-based criterion is developed to measure the \"goodness\" of a kernel-induced space, and the kernel parameters are tuned by maximizing this criterion. This criterion is computationally efficient and is differentiable with respect to the kernel parameters. Compared with the leave-one-out (LOO) or k-fold cross validation (CV), the proposed approach can achieve a faster model selection, especially when the number of training samples is large or when many kernel parameters need to be tuned. To tune the regularization parameter in the KLDA, our criterion is used together with the method proposed by Saadi et al. (2004). Experiments on benchmark data sets verify the effectiveness of this model selection approach.", "paper_title": "A Kernel-Induced Space Selection Approach to Model Selection in KLDA", "paper_id": "WOS:000261544900011"}
