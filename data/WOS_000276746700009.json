We also show that the converse is true for the class of languages indexed by countable scattered linear orderings, but false in the general case. As a corollary we prove that the inclusion problem for rational languages of words indexed by countable linear orderings is decidable.", "paper_title": "Logic and Rational Languages of Words Indexed by Linear Orderings", "paper_id": "WOS:000276746700009"}
