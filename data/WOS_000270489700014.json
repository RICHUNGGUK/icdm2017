The formulized paradigm of multidisciplinary collaborative simulation for complex engineering systems is principally analyzed. An IEEE HLA and web services based framework is proposed to provide a heterogeneous, distributed and collaborative running environment where multidisciplinary modeling, running management and post-processing of collaborative simulation are undertaken. The mechanism of multidisciplinary collaborative modeling, disciplinary model transformation, and time-synchronized simulation advancement are studied in detail. A prototype with the functions of multidisciplinary modeling, running management and post-processing for collaborative simulations is developed, and a typical complex engineering system is chosen as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach towards collaborative simulation.", "paper_title": "A solution of multidisciplinary collaborative simulation for complex engineering systems in a distributed heterogeneous environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000270489700014"}
