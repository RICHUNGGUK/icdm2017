Cutting tool condition monitoring is certainly the important monitoring requirement of unintended machining operations. A multi-purpose intelligent tool condition monitoring technique for metal cutting process will be introduced in this paper. The knowledge based intelligent pattern recognition algorithm is mainly composed of a fuzzy feature filter and algebraic neurofuzzy networks. It can carry out the fusion of multi-sensor information to enable the proposed intelligent architecture to recognize the tool condition successfully.", "paper_title": "The application of B-spline neurofuzzy networks for condition monitoring of metal cutting tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500137"}
