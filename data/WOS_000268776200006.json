In this paper, we propose the Bandwidth Management Strategy 1 (BMS1), Bandwidth Management Strategy 2 (BMS2) and reservation scheme with Fuzzy controller for improving CRP (call rejection probability) of real-time services. Simulation result shows that the proposed methods outperform our previous work under real-time services, such as UGS, rtPS and ertPS.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Bandwidth Management and Reservation Scheme in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000268776200006"}
