Differently stated, given a set of game situations imperfectly described, we want to understand how general and abstract norms provide at least the starting point for a norm-based equilibrium selection reasoning procedure which in the end will be able to determine which equilibrium point, belonging to perfectly described games, will be played as the unique solution of each inperfectly described game. In order to solve such a problem we introduce a selection process based on the reformation of default logic in terms of possibility theory.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy logic and default reasoning model of social norms and equilibrium selection in games under unforeseen contingencies", "paper_id": "WOS:000253123700004"}
