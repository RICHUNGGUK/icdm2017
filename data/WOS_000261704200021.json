Using the discrete dynamical system determined by the stroboscopic map, we show that there exists an infection-free periodic solution. Further, we show that the infection-free periodic solution is globally attractive when the period of impulsive effect is less than some critical value. Using a new modelling method, we obtain a sufficient condition for the permanence of the epidemic model with pulse vaccination. We show that time delay, pulse vaccination can bring different effects on the dynamic behavior of the model by numerical analysis. Our results also show the time delay is \"profitless\". The main feature of this paper is to introduce time delay and impulse into the SEIR epidemic model and to give pulse vaccination strategies. (C) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
