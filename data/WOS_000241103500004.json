We exploit the classification of verbs into syntactico-semantic classes. This article describes our first step to automatically identify verbs of communication and to assign the prototypical frame to them. The method of identification is evaluated against two versions of VALLEX and FrameNet 1.2. For the purpose of frame generation, a new metric based on the notion of frame edit distance is outlined.", "paper_title": "Czech verbs of communication and the extraction of their frames", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500004"}
