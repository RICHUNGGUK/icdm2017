New mean-square exponential stability and L-2 performance criteria are developed based on the delay partition Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method and generalized Finsler lemma which is applicable to stochastic systems. The analytical results are established without involving any model transformation, estimation for cross terms, additional free-weighting matrices, or tuning parameters. Numerical examples are presented to verify that the proposed approach is both less conservative and less computationally complex than the existing ones.", "paper_title": "Stability and L-2 Performance Analysis of Stochastic Delayed Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000295584100013"}
