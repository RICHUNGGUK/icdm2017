The task is to find a set of vertices of total minimum weight to be removed from G, such that in the remaining graph no cycle contains a vertex of S. We show that this problem can be solved in time O(1.8638 (n) ), where n=|V|. This is a consequence of the main result of this paper, namely that all minimal subset feedback vertex sets of a graph can be enumerated in time O(1.8638 (n) ).", "paper_title": "Enumerating Minimal Subset Feedback Vertex Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000332582900010"}
