The differential configuration is achieved by introducing the differential log-domain wave equivalent. The resulting filters inherit the good characteristics of the wave active filters, are very modular and easy to design. The method is demonstrated by a design example and its validity is verified through simulations results.", "paper_title": "DIFFERENTIAL LOG-DOMAIN WAVE ACTIVE FILTERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000262648200008"}
