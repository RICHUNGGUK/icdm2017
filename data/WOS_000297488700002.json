Early work has shown that consistency checking of complete networks of basic CDC constraints is tractable, while reasoning with the CDC in general is NP-hard. This paper shows, however, that if some constraints are unspecified, then consistency checking of incomplete networks of basic CDC constraints is already intractable. This draws a sharp boundary between the tractable and intractable subclasses of the CDC. The result is achieved by a reduction from the well-known 3-SAT problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier By.
