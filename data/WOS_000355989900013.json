As it is often the case in prior work that the quality of tracking (QoT) heavily depends on high accuracy in localization or distance estimation, which is never perfect in practice. These bring a cumulative effect on tracking, e.g., target missing. Recovering from the effect and also frequent interactions between nodes and a central server result in a high energy consumption. We design a tracking scheme, named t-Tracking, aiming to achieve two major objectives: high QoT and high energy efficiency of the WSN. We propose a set of fully distributed tracking algorithms, which answer queries like whether a target remains in a \"specific area\" (called a \"face\" in localized geographic routing, defined in terms of radio connectivity and local interactions of nodes). When a target moves across a face, the nodes of the face that are close to its estimated movements compute the sequence of the target's movements and predict when the target moves to another face. The nodes answer queries from a mobile sink called the \"tracker\", which follows the target along with the sequence. t-Tracking has advantages over prior work as it reduces the dependency on requiring high accuracy in localization and the frequency of interactions. It also timely solves the target missing problem caused by node failures, obstacles, etc., making the tracking robust in a highly dynamic environment. We validate its effectiveness considering the objectives in extensive simulations and in a proof-of-concept system implementation.", "paper_title": "Local Area Prediction-Based Mobile Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000355989900013"}
