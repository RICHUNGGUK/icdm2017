In V2V communications mobility plays a major role in yielding frequency dispersion of the channels, and thus accurately modeling of Doppler effect becomes a challenging issue as the two fundamental assumptions of the Jack's model may not be valid due to time-varying channel characteristics in V2V communication systems. In this paper, we present a practical model to characterize V2V communication channel and its corresponding Doppler spread spectrum is derived. In addition, we will study the impact of inter-carrier interference (ICI) generated in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based V2V communication system. Compared with the classical Jake's channel model, our proposed new channel model is more accurate and fits in particular well for the performance assessment of vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems.", "paper_title": "Channel Modeling and Inter-Carrier Interference Analysis for V2V Communication Systems in Frequency-Dispersive Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000274252200002"}
