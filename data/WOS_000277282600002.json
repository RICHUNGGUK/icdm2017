Whilst they can learn from raw data to solve sophisticated recognition and analysis problems, the acquired knowledge remains hidden within the network architecture and is not readily accessible for analysis or further use: Trained networks are black boxes. Recent research efforts therefore investigate the possibility to extract symbolic knowledge from trained networks, in order to analyze, validate, and reuse the structural insights gained implicitly during the training process. In this paper, we will study how knowledge in form of propositional logic programs can be obtained in such a way that the programs are as simple as possible-where simple is being understood in some clearly defined and meaningful way.", "paper_title": "Extracting reduced logic programs from artificial neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000277282600002"}
