From the perspective of e-manufacturing any production equipment and its control functions do not exist alone, instead becoming a part of the holistic operation system with distant monitoring, remote quality control, and fault diagnostic capabilities. The key to this new paradigm is the accessibility to a remotely located system and having the means of responding to a changing environment, which is better suited for today's rapidly changing environment. Within the framework of the web-enabled robotic system, this paper focuses on the remote maintenance schemes with an emphasis on condition-based maintenance strategies. Real-time monitoring of robot harmonic drive systems and operational status have been attained over the Web. A mathematical modeling of system availability has been derived in order to account for other failures that might occur in the subsystems of the robot. Compared to the schedule-based maintenance strategies, the proposed approach shows great potential for improving overall production efficiency, while reducing the cost of maintenance.
