These systems adapt to changing conditions by monitoring the building and using local communication and computation for determining the best evacuation paths. The first system, called distributed evacuation system (DES), comprises a network of decision nodes (DNs) positioned at specific locations inside the building. DNs provide people with directions regarding the best available exit. The second system, called opportunistic emergency support system (OESS), consists of mobile communication nodes (CNs) carried by people. CNs form an opportunistic network in order to exchange information regarding the hazard and to direct the evacuees towards the safest exit. Both DES and OESS employ sensor nodes deployed at fixed locations for monitoring the hazard. We evaluate the spatial systems using simulation experiments with a purpose-built emergency simulator called DBES. We show how parameters such as the frequency of information exchange and communication range affect the system performance and evacuation outcome.", "paper_title": "Spatial Computers for Emergency Support", "paper_id": "WOS:000327713600002"}
