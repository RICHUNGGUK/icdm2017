The effectiveness of test methods for such circuits can therefore be measured in terms of the coverage obtained for unmodeled faults. In this paper, we present a new defect-oriented dynamic LFSR reseeding technique for test-data compression. The proposed technique is based on a new output-deviation metric for grading stuck-at patterns derived from LFSR seeds. We show that, compared to standard compression-driven dynamic LFSR reseeding and a previously proposed deviation-based method, higher defect coverage is obtained using stuck-at test cubes without any loss of compression.", "paper_title": "Defect-Oriented LFSR Reseeding to Target Unmodeled Defects Using Stuck-at Test Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000296459300019"}
