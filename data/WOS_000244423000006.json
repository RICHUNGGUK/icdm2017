To support the integration of clinical genomics information with clinical practice and research, information technologies should enable the semantic association of patient-specific genetic data (e.g., gene variants) with the patient's phenotypic information. To create such genotype-phenotype associations effectively, information technologies should consider relevant data from patient medical records along with information from biomedical knowledge sources. in this paper, we describe how these challenges are addressed by Clinical Genomics Level Seven (CGL7), a set of Web services for clinical-genomics decision-support applications that follow the HL76 (Health Level 70) Clinical Genomics standard for the representation and exchange of clinical genomics data.", "paper_title": "The seventh layer of the clinical-genomics information infrastructure", "paper_id": "WOS:000244423000006"}
