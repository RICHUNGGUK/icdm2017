(2015) [2], a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional containing the fuzzy line-integral Lyapunov function (LILF) has been introduced to deal with the problem of the stability analysis and stabilization for Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems with time delay. And less conservative stability and stabilization conditions are achieved. However, the special structural information about the line-integral Lyapunov matrices is overlooked in [2], which is harmful to the validity of the main results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
