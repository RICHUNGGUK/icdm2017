In our method, compressed 2D video is analyzed by extracting motion vectors. Using the motion vector maps, depth maps are built for each frame and the frames are segmented to provide object-wise depth ordering. These data are then used to synthesize stereo pairs. 3D video synthesized in this fashion can be viewed using any stereoscopic display. In our implementation, anaglyph projection was selected as the 3D visualization method, because it is mostly suited to standard displays.", "paper_title": "Real-time 2D to 3D video conversion", "paper_id": "WOS:000208118800002"}
