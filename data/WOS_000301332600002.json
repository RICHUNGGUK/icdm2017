Firstly, degree aware node splitting method is introduced. Then, the nodes and links of the network are mapped on the squares and steps of the corresponding chessboard. Subsequently, the probing signals are sent periodically to detect the network status in real-time manner. Once the link failure is detected, according to returned fault information, the link failure is located by searching the static mapping table. In the case of achieving failure localization of any link failure, the localization time and cover length of links are analysis. Numerical results show that the link failure can be located effectively and rapidly by the proposed strategy with less network resources utilized.", "paper_title": "Knight's tour-based fast fault localization mechanism in mesh optical communication networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000301332600002"}
