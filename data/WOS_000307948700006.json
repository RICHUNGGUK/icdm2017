Their power can be further increased by the Berger and Boos confidence interval method, where a p-value is found by restricting the common binomial probability under H-0 to a 1 - gamma confidence interval. We studied the average test power for the exact unconditional z-pooled test for a wide range of cases with balanced and unbalanced sample sizes, and significance levels 0.05 and 0.01. The detailed results are available online on the web. Among the values 10(-3), 10(-4), ... , 10(-10), the value gamma = 10(-4) gave the highest power, or close to the highest power, in all the cases we looked at, and can be given as a general recommendation as an optimal gamma.", "paper_title": "The exact unconditional z-pooled test for equality of two binomial probabilities: optimal choice of the Berger and Boos confidence coefficient", "paper_id": "WOS:000307948700006"}
