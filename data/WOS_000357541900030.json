The Navier-Stokes equations are coupled to bulk and surfaces PDEs for the surfactant concentrations. At the interface adsorption, desorption and stress balances involving curvature effects and Marangoni forces have to be considered. A parametric finite element approximation for the advection of the interface, which maintains good mesh properties, is coupled to the evolving surface finite element method, which is used to discretize the surface PDE for the interface surfactant concentration. The resulting system is solved together with standard finite element approximations of the Navier-Stokes equations and of the bulk parabolic PDE for the surfactant concentration. Semidiscrete and fully discrete approximations are analyzed with respect to stability, conservation and existence/uniqueness issues. The approach is validated for simple test cases and for complex scenarios, including colliding drops in a shear flow, which are computed in two and three space dimensions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
