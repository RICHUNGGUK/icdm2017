However, when applied to the on-bottom stability analysis of pipelines under random storm loading, hundreds, if not thousands, of models must be incorporated with structural elements in a three-dimensional analysis and simultaneously solved. This necessitates extremely efficient and accurate numerical integration techniques. This paper scrutinizes constitutive integration algorithms within both explicit and implicit frameworks, and applies them to a two-surface mixed hardening model that describes the force-displacement behaviour of a pipe partially embedded in sand. Detailed solutions are provided, allowing implementation of the pipe-soil model into any standard structural finite-element program. Through use of practical examples, the efficiency and accuracy of the solution methods are assessed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
