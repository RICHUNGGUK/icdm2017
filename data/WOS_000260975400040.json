We prove that determining if a digraph G contains H-free k-induced subgraphs is Omega(N-2)-evasive. Then we construct an is an element of-tester to test this property. (An E-tester fora property Pi is guaranteed to distinguish, with probability at least 2/3, between the case of G satisfying Pi and the case of G being is an element of-far from satisfying Pi.)The query complexity of the E-tester is independent of the size of the input digraph. An (E,)is an element of-tester fora property Pi is an E-tester for Pi that is furthermore guaranteed to accept with probability at least 2/3 any input that is delta-close to satisfying Pi.
