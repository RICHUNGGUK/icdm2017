This is most often found within web pages with dynamic content. This paper proposes a very simple and effective detection method for SQL injection attacks. The method removes the value of an SQL query attribute of web pages when parameters are submitted and then compares it with a predetermined one. This method uses combined static and dynamic analysis. The experiments show that the proposed method is very effective and simple than any other methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
