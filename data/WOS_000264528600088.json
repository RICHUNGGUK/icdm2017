For purposes of better Customer relationship management, data mining technology is commonly used to analyze large quantities of data about customer bargains, purchase preferences, customer churn, etc. This paper aims to propose a recommender system for wireless network companies to understand and avoid customer churn. To ensure the accuracy of the analysis, We use the decision tree algorithm to analyze data of over 60,000 transactions and of more than 4000 members, over a period of three months. The data of the first nine weeks is used as the training data, and that of the last month as the testing data. The results of the experiment are found to be very useful for making strategy recommendations to avoid Customer churn. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
