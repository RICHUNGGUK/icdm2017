To attain this objective a properly arranged chromosome is needed to ensure that building blocks will survive the application of recombination operators. The proposed algorithm periodically rearranges the order of genes in the chromosome while the actual information about the inter-gene dependencies is calculated on-line through the run. Standard 2-point crossover, operating on the adapted chromosomal structure, is used to generate new solutions. Experimental results show that this algorithm is able to solve separable problems with strong intra building block dependencies among genes as well as the hierarchical problems.", "paper_title": "A selecto-recombinative genetic algorithm with continuous chromosome reconfiguration", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400097"}
