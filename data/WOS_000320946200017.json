The design of the processor core was custom implemented in IBM's 90 nm CMOS technology and occupies 0.115 mm(2) silicon area with approximately 70% area utilized by core circuits. The processor shows a peak throughput performance of 75 MOPS/mW. Benchmarking results show estimated throughputs of 9.5, 21.36, 39.78, 170.88, and 4.54 MSamples/s for variants of 2-D discrete cosine transform (DCT), 4 x 4 H. 264 integer transform, and 2-D discrete wavelet transform, respectively. Our analysis shows that the proposed design provides approximately 4-8 times higher throughput for 2-D DCT when compared against popular architectures.", "paper_title": "Throughput/Resource-Efficient Reconfigurable Processor for Multimedia Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000320946200017"}
