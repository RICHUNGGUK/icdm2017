Here we report on our identification of a major source causing such degradation and illustrate how the electrical properties of an old batch of liquid crystal can be restored by a regenerative agent. This approach, which is demonstrated to be quite efficient, entails simply soaking the agent in the liquid crystal. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
