The total active mode power consumption, the clock power, and the average leakage power of the multi-V(th) sequential circuits are reduced by up to 55%, 29%, and 53%, respectively, while maintaining similar speed and data stability as compared to the circuits in a single threshold voltage (single-V(th)) tied-32 nm-gate FinFET technology. Furthermore, the area is reduced by up to 21% with the new sequential circuits as compared to the circuits with single-V(th) tied-gate FinFETs.", "paper_title": "Multi-Threshold Voltage FinFET Sequential Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000285844200016"}
