The purpose of an NMO is to generate oscillatory motion, and to this end we pose an optimization problem for finding values of certain design parameters such that optimized systems generate desired motions using a minimal amount of energy. A fully nonlinear model of NMOs is presented and a detailed discussion of the design problem and its numerical treatment is given. Two numerical examples are provided to illustrate how NMOs could work and the usefulness of the proposed design methodology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
