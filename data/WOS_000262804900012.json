The proposed method relies on finding a linear ordinary system that possesses the same stability property as the fractional order system. In this way, instead of performing the stability analysis on the fractional order systems, the analysis is converted into the domain of ordinary systems which is well established and well understood. As a useful consequence, we have extended two general tests for robust stability check of ordinary systems to fractional order systems. (C) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
