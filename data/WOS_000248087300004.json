In this paper PI-partitions are introduced and used to simplify the computation of the PI-index on those graph that admit nontrivial PI-partitions. Partial Hamming graphs that in particular contain many important chemical graphs fall into this category. For several of them the PI index is obtained explicitly. PI index is also studied on Cartesian product graphs. In particular, a simple formula for the PI index of powers of bipartite graphs is obtained.", "paper_title": "On the PI index: PI-partitions and cartesian product graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000248087300004"}
