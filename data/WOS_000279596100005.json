However, some deficiencies have been revealed and recognized as a major obstacle to achieving secure and seamless handover in mobile scenarios. HOKEY (Handover Keying) Working Group in IETF is standardizing low-latency EAP re-authentication and key distribution protocols to address these deficiencies.
