A short routine check_irred is included to chek the irreducibility of a matrix, whose rows are supposed to be a set of cone edges used by coneA OR coneB. For the coneA and coneB functions, the vector to project is provided by the user, along with the cone specifications, the vector. For coneB, the cone edges are provided. The coneA and coneB algorithms have been coded and compiled in C++, and are called by R. The qprog function transforms a quadratic programming problems into a cone projection problem and calls coneA. The constreg function does estimation and inference for parametric least-squares regression with constrainst on the parameters (using coneA). A p value for the \"one-sided\" test is provided. The shapereg function uses coneB to provide a least a least-squares estimator for a regression function with several choices of constraints including isotonic and convex regression function, as well as significance of the effects are also provided.
