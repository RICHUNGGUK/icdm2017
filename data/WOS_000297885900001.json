Our method includes three core techniques. Firstly, a rigid registration is introduced, using a line search method within a level set framework. The method automatically finds the time step for the iterative optimization processes. The order for finding the optimal translation, rotation and scale is derived experimentally. Secondly, a single reconstructed shape is created from a shape distribution of a previously acquired learning set. The reconstructed shape is applied to guide the active contour evolution. Thirdly, our method balances the impact of the shape prior versus the image guidance of the active contour. A mixed stopping condition is defined based on the stationarity of the evolving curve and the shape prior constraint. Our method is completely non-parametric and avoids taking linear combinations of non-linear signed distance functions, which would cause problems because distance functions are not closed under linear operations. Experimental results show that our method is able to extract the desired objects in several circumstances, namely when noise is present in the image, when the objects are in slightly different poses and when parts of the object are invisible in the image.
