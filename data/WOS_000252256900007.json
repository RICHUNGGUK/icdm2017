Concatenating a linear precoder as an inner encoder with an outer (convolutional) encoder produces a powerful code with a limited decoding complexity. Linear precoders are examined and optimized for two scenarios: using i) a noniterative decoding strategy and ii) an iterative decoding strategy under a perfect feedback assumption. The precoder design is based on an information-theoretical approach, on the one hand, and a pairwise error probability (PEP) analysis, on the other hand. Both approaches render convenient precoder design rules. For a binary phse-shift keying (BPSK) signal set, the optimal precoders that result from these rules are also derived. Numerical results confirm the analytical findings and simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.", "paper_title": "Linear precoders for bit-interleaved coded modulation on AWGN channels: Analysis and design criteria", "paper_id": "WOS:000252256900007"}
