Only limited work has been reported for assessing video quality under different spatial and temporal resolutions. In this paper, we consider a wider scope of video quality assessment in the sense of considering multiple dimensions. In particular, we address the problem of evaluating perceptual visual quality of low bit-rate videos under different settings and requirements. Extensive subjective view tests for assessing the perceptual quality of low bit-rate videos have been conducted, which cover 150 test scenarios and include five distinctive dimensions: encoder type, video content, bit rate, frame size, and frame rate. Based on the obtained subjective testing results, we perform thorough statistical analysis to study the influence of different dimensions on the perceptual quality and some interesting observations are pointed out. We believe such a study brings new knowledge into the topic of cross-dimensional video quality assessment and it has immediate applications in perceptual video adaptation for scalable video over mobile networks.", "paper_title": "Cross-Dimensional Perceptual Quality Assessment for Low Bit-Rate Videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000261310700009"}
