Such profiles can be modeled using linear or nonlinear regression models. In this paper we use artificial neural networks to detect and classify the shifts in linear profiles. Three monitoring methods based on artificial neural networks are developed to monitor linear profiles. Their efficacies are assessed using average run length criterion. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
