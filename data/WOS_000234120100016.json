The Beltrami equation is obtained using Harmonic map theory, and therefore the existence and uniqueness of a solution is guaranteed. The nonlinear solver strategy is based on Newton-Krylov methods, preconditioned here with a multigrid-based method for scalability. Numerical experiments performed for both grid adaptation and grid alignment are presented and demonstrate optimal scaling under grid refinement. We therefore conclude that such a fully nonlinear approach is indeed feasible and efficient. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
