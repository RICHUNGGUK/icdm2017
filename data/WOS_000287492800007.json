In this study, it was verified that asymmetric yielding in FE models can be captured using the Drucker-Prager yield criterion (DPYC), and can provide better results than simulations using the VMYC. A sensitivity analysis on parameters defining the DPYC (i.e. the degree of yield asymmetry and the yield stress settings) was performed, focusing on the effect on bone failure. In this study, the implementation of a larger degree of yield asymmetry improved the prediction of the fracture location; variations in the yield stress mainly affected the predicted failure force. We conclude that the implementation of asymmetric yielding in case-specific FE models improves the prediction of femoral bone strength.", "paper_title": "Implementation of asymmetric yielding in case-specific finite element models improves the prediction of femoral fractures", "paper_id": "WOS:000287492800007"}
