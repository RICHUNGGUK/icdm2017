Whereas efficient algorithms are known for computing the Fr,chet distance of polygonal curves, the same problem for triangulated surfaces is NP-hard. Furthermore, it remained open whether it is computable at all. Using a discrete approximation, we show that it is upper semi-computable, i.e., there is a non-halting Turing machine which produces a decreasing sequence of rationals converging to the Fr,chet distance. It follows that the decision problem, whether the Fr,chet distance of two given surfaces lies below a specified value, is recursively enumerable. Furthermore, we show that a relaxed version of the Fr,chet distance, the weak Fr,chet distance can be computed in polynomial time. For this, we give a computable characterization of the weak Fr,chet distance in a geometric data structure called the Free Space Diagram.", "paper_title": "Can We Compute the Similarity between Surfaces?", "paper_id": "WOS:000272902500004"}
