As an application of the theory, we analytically derive nonlinear visual receptive fields and show that their optimal stimuli, as well as the orientation and frequency tuning, are in good agreement with previous simulations of complex cells in primary visual cortex (Berkes and Wiskott, 2005). The theory suggests that side and end stopping can be interpreted as a weak breaking of translation invariance. Direction selectivity is also discussed.", "paper_title": "A Theory of Slow Feature Analysis for Transformation-Based Input Signals with an Application to Complex Cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000286133600001"}
