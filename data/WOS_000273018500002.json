A critical step of the CA algorithm is the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis of a coded matrix. The size of this matrix affects drastically the analysis computational cost. As the size of the matrix increases, the method becomes computationally expensive or even impossible. In this paper we propose an alternative scheme that overpasses this limitation, without affecting the results accuracy. A set of Monte Carlo simulations and real data applications showed the efficiency of the proposed approach over the standard one, especially in the case of \"tall\" data sets.", "paper_title": "Multiple correspondence analysis for \"tall\" data sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000273018500002"}
