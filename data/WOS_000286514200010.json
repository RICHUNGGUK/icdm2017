Specifically, for every fixed finite field, Gamma(q), p is an element of (0, 1 - 1/q) and epsilon > 0, it is proved that with high probability a random linear code C in F(q)(n) of rate (1 - H(q)(p) - epsilon) can be list decoded from a fraction p of errors with lists of size at most O(1/epsilon). This also answers a basic open question concerning the existence of highly list-decodable linear codes, showing that a list-size of O(1/epsilon) suffices to have rate within epsilon of the information-theoretically optimal rate of 1 - H(q)(p). The best previously known list-size bound was q(O(1/epsilon)) (except in the q = 2 case where a list-size bound of O(1/epsilon) was known). The main technical ingredient in the proof is a strong upper bound on the probability that l random vectors chosen from a Hamming ball centered at the origin have too many (more than Omega(l)) vectors from their linear span also belong to the ball.", "paper_title": "On the List-Decodability of Random Linear Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000286514200010"}
