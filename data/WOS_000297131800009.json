The present study visualized the flow induced by Tetrahymena pyriformis of size 45-50 mu m, which swam freely and via stimulation by galvanotaxis in a PDMS micro-chamber using a micro-particle image velocimetry system. The results showed that the maximum velocity of the induced flow was around 430 mu m/s for free swimming and 700 mu m/s for galvanotactic-controlled swimming. Due to the applied electric field, the electro-osmosis flow led to increased velocity of roughly 135 mu m/s at 3 V/mm. The increased velocity stems from the increased motility of the cell under the electric field. Therefore, it was demonstrated that galvanotaxis can control the swimming direction and increase the induced velocity.", "paper_title": "Quantitative measurement of dynamic flow induced by Tetrahymena pyriformis (T. pyriformis) using micro-particle image velocimetry", "paper_id": "WOS:000297131800009"}
