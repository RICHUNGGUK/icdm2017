The proposed waveform uses bipolar sustain pulses, except for the last sustain pulse of each sub-field, to suppress undesired sustain discharges between facing electrodes; these sustain discharges degrade picture quality. The waveform uses a unipolar pulse for the last sustain to reduce the time lag of the address discharge. A reset waveform was designed for the long-gap high-Xe PDP and implemented in the drive waveform. The proposed waveform was tested on a 12% Xe 42-in. XGA (1024 x 768) single-scan AC POP which had a sustain discharge gap of 180 mu m. The measured dark luminance was 0.16 cd/m(2), full-white luminance was 284 cd/m(2), and luminous efficiency was 1.617 lm/W. The sustain voltage margin was higher than 10 V at the operating point.
