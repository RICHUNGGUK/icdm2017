Transportation information has been identified as one of the most appreciated functionalities of a PET. We model the tourist planning problem, integrating public transportation, as the time-dependent team orienteering problem with time windows (TD-TOPTW) in order to allow PETs to create personalised tourist routes in real-time. We develop and compare two different approaches to solve the TD-TOPTW. Experimental results for the city of San Sebastian show that both approaches are able to obtain routes in real-time.
