Any weakly optimal entanglement witness can be written as the form of W-wopt = sigma- c(sigma)(max) I, where c(sigma)(max) is a non-negative number and I is the identity matrix. We show the relation between the weakly optimal witness W-wopt and the eigenvalues of the separable states sigma. Further we give an application of weakly optimal witnesses for constnicting entanglement witnesses in a larger Hilbert space by extending the result of [P. Badziag et al, Phys. Rev. A 88, 010301(R) (2013)], and we examine their geometric properties.", "paper_title": "CHARACTERIZATION AND PROPERTIES OF WEAKLY OPTIMAL ENTANGLEMENT WITNESSES", "paper_id": "WOS:000380117800002"}
