Recovering the original high-resolution image from its LR counterpart while at the same time removing the aliasing artifacts is a challenging image interpolation problem. Since a natural image normally contains redundant similar patches, the values of missing pixels can be available at texture-relevant LR pixels. Based on this, we propose an iterative multiscale semilocal interpolation method that can effectively address the aliasing problem. The proposed method estimates each missing pixel from a set of texture-relevant semilocal LR pixels with the texture similarity iteratively measured from a sequence of patches of varying sizes. Specifically, in each iteration, top texture-relevant LR pixels are used to construct a data fidelity term in a maximum a posteriori estimation, and a bilateral total variation is used as the regularization term. Experimental results compared with existing interpolation methods demonstrate that our method can not only substantially alleviate the aliasing problem but also produce better results across a wide range of scenes both in terms of quantitative evaluation and subjective visual quality.", "paper_title": "Multiscale Semilocal Interpolation With Antialiasing", "paper_id": "WOS:000300559700016"}
