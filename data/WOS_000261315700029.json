Design/methodology/approach - The multiplicative perturbation of exponentially bounded regularized C-cosine functions is generally studied by the Laplace transformation. However, C-cosine functions might not be exponentially bounded, so that the new method for the multiplicative perturbation of the nonexponentially bounded regularized C-cosine functions should be applied. In this paper, the property of regularized C-cosine functions is directly used to obtain the desired results. Findings - The new results of the multiplicative perturbations of the nonexponentially bounded C-cosine functions are obtained. Originality/value - The new techniques differing from those given previously in the literature are employed to deduce the desired conclusions. The results can be applied to deal with incomplete second order abstract differential equations which stem from cybernetics, engineering, physics, etc.", "paper_title": "Multiplicative perturbations of incomplete second order abstract differential equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000261315700029"}
