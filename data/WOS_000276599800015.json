To address this problem, we propose a new unidirectional proxy re-encryption scheme, and prove its chosen-ciphertext security in the adaptive corruption model without random oracles. Compared with the best known unidirectional proxy re-encryption scheme proposed by Libert and Vergnaud in PKC'08, our scheme enjoys the advantages of both higher efficiency and stronger security.", "paper_title": "CCA-secure unidirectional proxy re-encryption in the adaptive corruption model without random oracles", "paper_id": "WOS:000276599800015"}
