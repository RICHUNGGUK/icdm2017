NDNFLA aims to find the discriminant feature of samples by maximizing the between-class feature line (FL) scatter and minimizing the within-class FL scatter. At the same time, the neighborhood is preserved in the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Neighborhood Discriminant Nearest Feature Line Analysis and Its Application to Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000315976100014"}
