Conventional CDMA CAC schemes cannot fully support DiffServ QoS (Quality of Service) and seamless handoff due to lack of consideration on service priority and seamless mobility. Therefore, in order to achieve QoS guarantee for each service class, seamless fast-handoff, and high utilization of the scarce wireless resource, we define a code assignment policy and an adaptive access permission scheme taking each user's service priority and mobility into consideration. For that purpose, in the proposed scheme, the DQRUMA/CDMA is combined with the new code assignment scheme and the adaptive access permission probability (APP). Numerical examples show that the forced termination ratio of handoff calls is guaranteed to be much less than the blocking ratio of new calls for a seamless fast-handoff while proposed scheme provides QoS guarantee for each service class efficiently.
