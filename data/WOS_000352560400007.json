We investigate the question of which role should the helper act to improve the secrecy, to jam, or to relay. Two transmission schemes are investigated: 1) direct transmission scheme (DTS) with jamming and 2) relay transmission scheme (RTS). We consider both the path-loss and fading-in channel models and define a notion of distance normalized signal-to-noise-ratio (DN-SNR) to account for propagation. The ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) is adopted as the performance metric and semi-closed-form expressions of ESR for the two schemes are derived. Additionally, optimal power allocations in both low and high DN-SNR regimes are characterized analytically. We give the performance comparison of the two schemes from the perspective of energy efficiency in the low DN-SNR regime, and characterize the secrecy degree of freedom in the high DN-SNR regime. In the high DN-SNR regime, DTS provides higher secrecy rate compared with RTS, while in the low DN-SNR regime, RTS outperforms DTS. Furthermore, we show that eavesdropper's position impacts greatly on security.", "paper_title": "Secrecy Transmission With a Helper: To Relay or to Jam", "paper_id": "WOS:000352560400007"}
