Using divisor numbers other than powers of 2 (2 (n) ) for quadrature generation, reduces the required frequency range of the VCO, hence the number of VCO circuits, in multi-band frequency synthesizers. In the proposed synthesizer, VHF, UHF and L-band frequencies are covered with only one VCO. This is achieved by using a novel divide-by-3 circuit which produces precise I/Q LO signals. The VCO tuning range in this design is 2,400-3,632 MHz which is covered by a 6-bit switched-capacitor bank. A fast adaptive frequency calibration block selects the closest VCO frequency to the target frequency by setting the coarse-tuning code prior to the start of phase lock. A programmable charge pump is used to reduce variations in PLL characteristics over the frequency range. The synthesizer has been fabricated in a 0.18 mu m CMOS technology and the die area is 1.7 x 1.6 mm(2). It consumes 27 mA from a 1.8 V power supply. Measurement results show operation of the proposed divide-by-3 circuit over the entire VCO frequency range. The synthesizer quadrature output phase noise for UHF and VHF bands is <-131dBc/Hz at 1.45 MHz offset.", "paper_title": "Single-VCO multi-band DTV frequency synthesizer with a divide-by-3 frequency divider for quadrature signal generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000279214200003"}
