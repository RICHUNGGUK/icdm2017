The names of these children may appear on three different administrative lists: medical; birth; and death records. We assume diffuse prior distributions on the marginal probabilities of a name appearing on each record and on the various odds ratios modeling the interactions of these lists. Samples from the posterior distribution are generated using a modified sample-resample technique. A Bayesian log-linear model is developed and the posterior distribution is sampled from a Markov chain generated using the Metropolis algorithm. These two approaches are compared in terms of their interpretability and computational complexity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
