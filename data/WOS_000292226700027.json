We propose a method based on a vector field distance transform of the mesh to process. It is a volume-based implicit surface modeling, which provides an alternative representation of meshes. We use an adaptive 3D convolution kernel applied to the voxels of the distance transform model. Weights of the kernel elements are determined according to the angle between the vectors of the implicit field. We also propose a new adaptation of the Marching Cubes algorithm in order to extract the isosurface from the vector implicit field after the filtering process. We compare our method to the previous one introduced using the vector field representation and to other feature preserving adaptive filtering algorithms. According to error metric evaluations, we show that our new design provides high quality filtering results while better preserving geometric features. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
