In particular, we show how Temporal Equilibrium Logic, which introduces modal operators as those typically handled in Linear-Time Temporal Logic (LTL), can be encoded into Infinitary Equilibrium Logic, a recent formalisation that allows the use of infinite conjunctions and disjunctions. We prove the correctness of this encoding and, as an application, we further use it to show that the semantics of the temporal logic programming formalism called TEMPLOG is subsumed by Temporal Equilibrium Logic.", "paper_title": "An infinitary encoding of temporal equilibrium logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000367692200018"}
