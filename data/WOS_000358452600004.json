(The best known bound is 0.4352n.) In fact, computer simulation suggests that the bound our method provides is about 0.438n. Our method uses invariant Gaussian processes on the d-regular tree that satisfy the eigenvector equation at each vertex for a certain eigenvalue . We show that such processes can be approximated by i.i.d. factors provided that |gimel| <= 2 root d-1. We then use these approximations for gimel=-2 root d-1 to produce factor of i.i.d. independent sets on regular trees. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
