With a fixed relay location, an adaptive PA strategy at the source and relay under a sum power constraint that minimizes the system outage probability is presented. With a fixed PA strategy, the optimal relay location is derived. We then propose to jointly optimize PA and relay location. It is shown that employing more destination antennas and/or choosing an appropriate relay location can significantly save the power needed at the relay. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed PA and relay positioning algorithms.
