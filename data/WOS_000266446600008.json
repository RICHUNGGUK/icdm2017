When a dissimilarity measure is used, it is normally required to be a distance metric. However, when a similarity measure is used, there is no formal requirement. In this article, we have three contributions. First, we give a formal definition of similarity metric. Second, we show the relationship between similarity metric and distance metric. Third, we present general solutions to normalize a given similarity metric or distance metric. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
