The limited energy resources of sensor nodes are consumed in computation and especially in communication. To reduce power consumption for the sensor network, this paper presents a new data gathering scheme based on the hypercube topology. The hypercube-based data gathering scheme collects data from all sensor nodes to the base station through the communication tree of the constructed hypercube. It shortens communication delay by parallel transmission and replaces dead nodes through reconfiguration. Data gathering by the distributed hypercube and binary tree is also provided.", "paper_title": "Hypercube-based data gathering in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000248237300014"}
