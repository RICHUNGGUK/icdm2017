The generative power of this model is compared with certain array grammars generating array languages. It is shown that geometric arrays such as hollow rectangles and hollow squares can be generated by parallel array P systems with a priority relation on the rules. The advantage of the proposed variant is that the number of membranes necessary for generating certain array language is reduced in the constructions as array generation devices.", "paper_title": "Parallel Array-rewriting P Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000344303500009"}
