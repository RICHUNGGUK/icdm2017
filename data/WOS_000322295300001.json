We prove that for each one-way nondeterministic automaton with n states there exist Parikh equivalent one-way and two-way deterministic automata with e(O(root n.lnn)) and p(n) states, respectively, where p(n) is a polynomial. Furthermore, these costs are tight. In contrast, if all the words accepted by the given automaton contain at least two different letters, then a Parikh equivalent one-way deterministic automaton with a polynomial number of states can be found. Concerning context-free grammars, we prove that for each grammar in Chomsky normal form with h variables there exist Parikh equivalent one-way and two-way deterministic automata with 2(O(h2)) and 2(O(h)) states, respectively. Even these bounds are tight. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
