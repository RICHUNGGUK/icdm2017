The novelty of this formulation with respect to existing ones is the fact that it always converges to the physical solution, even when it is singular. We have performed a detailed stability and convergence analysis of the formulation in a simplified setting. From the convergence analysis, we infer that a particular type of meshes with a macro-element structure is needed, which can be easily obtained after a straight modification of any original mesh.", "paper_title": "Analysis of an Unconditionally Convergent Stabilized Finite Element Formulation for Incompressible Magnetohydrodynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000361901600005"}
