A notable advantage of this approach is that it involves only continuous optimization of model parameters, which is substantially simpler than discrete optimization of cluster assignments. However, existing methods still involve nonconvex optimization problems, and therefore finding a good local optimal solution is not straightforward in practice. In this letter, we propose an alternative information-maximization clustering method based on a squared-loss variant of mutual information. This novel approach gives a clustering solution analytically in a computationally efficient way via kernel eigenvalue decomposition. Furthermore, we provide a practical model selection procedure that allows us to objectively optimize tuning parameters included in the kernel function. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Information-Maximization Clustering Based on Squared-Loss Mutual Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000328061400004"}
