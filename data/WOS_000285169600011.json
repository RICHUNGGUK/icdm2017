After giving conditions under which the solution processes continuously depend on the parameters random compact sets are used to model the parameter uncertainty. This leads to continuous set-valued stochastic processes whose properties are investigated. Furthermore, we define analogues of first entrance times for set-valued processes called first entrance and inclusion times. The theoretical concept is applied to a simple example from mechanics.
