The new method generates automatic thresholds by comparing the chemical signal with the calculated signal from polynomial fitting in the iterative processes. The signal peaks are cut out consecutively in the iterative processes so the polynomial fitting will finally give a good estimation of the baseline. Simulated data and real data from capillary electrophoresis experiment are used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.
