First, a novel CNN cell output function is proposed. Its main goal is to control input and output dynamic ranges. Afterwards, this 2-layer CNN is further programmed to achieve generic piecewise Chevyshev polynomials that approximate a nonlinear function.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear mappings with Cellular Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000242119100037"}
