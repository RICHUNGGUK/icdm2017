Then, we establish a general fuzzy programming solution model based on synthesizing effect function (denoted by BSE-FGM, for short), and give the concrete application demonstration. Finally, we analyze the model through an example. All the results indicate that our method not only includes the existing fuzzy programming methods, has better structural feature, but also can, effectively merge the decision preferences into the solution, so it can be widely used in many fields such as complicated system optimization and artificial intelligence.", "paper_title": "FUZZY PROGRAMMING THEORY BASED ON SYNTHESIZING EFFECT AND ITS APPLICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000281072400018"}
