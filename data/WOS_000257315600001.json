In this chapter, we provide an overview of the context for this work as well as various procedures being undertaken for evaluating the effectiveness of this activity including such topics as modelling the proposed performance of the new machines, evaluating the proposed architectures, understanding the languages used to program these machines as well as understanding programmer productivity issues in order to better prepare for the introduction of these machines in the 2011-2015 timeframe.", "paper_title": "DARPXs HPCS program: History, models, tools, languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000257315600001"}
