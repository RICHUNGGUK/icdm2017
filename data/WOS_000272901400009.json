This paper presents a spherical clipping method to Compute the minimum distance between a point and a clamped B-spline surface. The surface patches outside the clipping sphere which do not contain the nearest point are eliminated. Another exclusion criterion whether the nearest point is on the boundary curves of the surface is employed, which is proved to be superior to previous comparable criteria. Examples are also shown to illustrate efficiency and correctness of the new method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
