By combining feature extraction techniques such as path line integration and tensor accumulation, we compute time-varying strain vector fields that build the foundation for a number of feature extraction and visualization techniques. The proposed field segmentation, clustering, histograms and multi-volume visualization techniques facilitate an intuitive understanding of three-dimensional strain in such flow fields, overcoming limitations of previous methods such as 2-D line plots and slicing. We present applications of our approach to an artificial time varying flow data set and a real world example of stationary flow in a subduction zone and discuss the challenges of processing these geophysical data sets as well as the insights gained.", "paper_title": "Visualizing Strain Anisotropy in Mantle Flow Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000297317200013"}
