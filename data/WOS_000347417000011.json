Transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are two of the best-studied gene regulatory mechanisms. However, the architecture and feature of GRNs by TFs and miRNAs in breast cancer and its subtypes were unknown. In this study, we investigated the GRNs by TFs and miRNAs with emphasis on breast cancer classifier genes at system level.", "paper_title": "Gene regulatory networks by transcription factors and microRNAs in breast cancer", "paper_id": "WOS:000347417000011"}
