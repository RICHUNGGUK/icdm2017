This platform is aimed to test parallel and distributed architectures and applications. The main characteristics of SIMCAN are flexibility, accuracy, performance, and scalability. Thence, the proposed platform has a modular design that eases the integration of different basic systems on a single architecture. Its design follows a hierarchical schema that includes simple modules, basic systems (computing, memory managing, I/O, and networking), physical components (nodes, switches, ... ), and aggregations of components. New modules may also be incorporated as well to include new strategies and components. Also, a graphical configuration tool has been developed to help untrained users with the task of modelling new architectures. Finally, a validation process and some evaluation tests have been performed to evaluate the SIMCAN platform. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
