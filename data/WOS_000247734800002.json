The paper presents a novel methodology for the extraction and recognition of symbol features from topographic maps. The method proceeds by separating the map into its constituent layers and then attempting to recognize the features in different layers on the basis of symbol-specific geometrical and morphological attributes. Text strings have also been separated. The Output is obtained in the form of an 'e-map' that is vectorized and hence is suitable for GIS. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system a simple database along with a query processing facility is constructed integrating the information obtained from the e-map and 'some' user inputs. The methodology has been observed to perform quite satisfactorily.", "paper_title": "Extraction and recognition of geographical features from paper maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000247734800002"}
