The aim of this paper is to address this problem. Methods: Few attempts have been made in the past to build knowledge-based medical systems that possess both argumentation and explanation capabilities. Here we propose an approach based on Dung's seminal calculus of opposition. Results: We have developed a new tool, arguEIRA, which is an extension of the existing EIRA system. In this paper we extend EIRA by providing it with an argumentation-based justification system that formalizes and communicates to the clinicians the reasons why a patient response is anomalous. Conclusion: Our comparative evaluation of the EIRA system against the newly developed tool highlights the multiple benefits that the use of argumentation-logic can bring to the field of medical decision support and explanation.
