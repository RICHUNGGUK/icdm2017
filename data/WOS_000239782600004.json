It provides a simple way to achieve asymptotic stability by a decoupling method for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems. The adaptive fuzzy sliding-mode control system is composed of a fuzzy controller and a compensation controller. The fuzzy controller is the main rule regulation controller, which is used to approximate an ideal computational controller. The compensation controller is designed to compensate for the difference between the ideal computational controller and the adaptive fuzzy controller. Fuzzy regulation is used as an approximator to identify the uncertainty. The simulation results for two cart-pole systems and a ball-beam system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the method. In addition, the experimental results for a tunnelling robot manipulator are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy sliding-mode control with rule adaptation for nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239782600004"}
