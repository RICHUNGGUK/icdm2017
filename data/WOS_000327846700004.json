We extend the notion of branching process to account for the dates of the occurrences of events and thus define a symbolic unfolding for PSwPNs. In the case of TPNs we also propose a method based on our so-called time branching processes to compute a finite complete prefix of the symbolic unfolding. The originality of our work relies on a precise handling of direct conflicts between events, and the analysis of their effects on the constraints between the firing dates of those events.", "paper_title": "Symbolic unfolding of parametric stopwatch Petri nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000327846700004"}
