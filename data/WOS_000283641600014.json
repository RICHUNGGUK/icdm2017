Thus, routing in ad-hoc networks is very much energy-constrained. Continuous drainage of energy degrades battery performance as well. If a battery is allowed to intermittently remain in an idle state, it recovers some of its lost charge due to the charge recovery effect, which, in turn, results in prolonged battery life. In this paper, we use the ideas of naturally occurring ants' foraging behavior (Dorigo and Stuetzle, 2004) [1] and based on those ideas, we design an energy-aware routing protocol, which not only incorporates the effect of power consumption in routing a packet, but also exploits the multi-path transmission properties of ant swarms and, hence, increases the battery life of a node. The efficiency of the protocol with respect to some of the existing ones has been established through simulations. It has been observed that the energy consumed in the network, the energy per packet in the case of EAAR are 60% less compared to MMBCR and the packets lost is only around 12% of what we have in AODV, in mobility scenarios.
