Good agreements between forecasted and actual flow-rates were obtained. The artificial intelligence algorithm uses only two input variables (day of the week and average daily flow-rate of day before) and one output variable (predicted average daily flow-rate). Using three months data for training the network, a long-term forecast (one month) is made with average errors below 10%. Results were compared with those obtained by applying the Census Method II (a commonly used decomposition/recomposition time series method) observing that forecast made by the NFWFFM is more accurate than the one made by this commonly used statistical method.
