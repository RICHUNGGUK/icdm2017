The extension is intended to meet the industrial need to sequence various products so that the work required and completed at the workstations over time is as constant as possible. Several approaches are proposed to formulate the problem, giving rise to different models. Four models are selected, and their performances are compared after running the Gurobi solver, using instances from the literature and a case study of the Nissan powertrain plant in Barcelona.
