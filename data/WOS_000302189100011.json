Hence, this application note describes the use of a second-generation current conveyor (CCII) to improve the electrical circuit, plus a voltage buffer is used to significantly reduce the loading effect. A personal computer is integrated with LabVIEW software for data collection, analysis and processing. This forms a highly-effective measurement system which improves the portability of the measurement instrument. Within the frequency range 100 Hz-1 MHz, two groups of precision resistance-capacitance are adopted: 49.98 k Omega, 1.01 nF; 49.98 k Omega, 9.8 nF to execute the measurement simulation. The results of simulation measurement show that all the errors are within 5%, and the relative standard deviation within 0.30%, and these confirm that the system is highly accurate and precise in this implementation. Carrot is chosen as the target object for practical evaluation, for which the electrical impedance spectrum is a circular arc with its circular center below the real axis. Results for carrot are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
