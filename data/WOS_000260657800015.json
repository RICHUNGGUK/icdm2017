Estimation and control algorithms that take into account control input constraints are developed by using a Lyapunov-based procedure, ensuring stability and convergence under a persistency of excitation condition. Here, we assume that the temperature information along the reactor is the only available on-line measurement to estimate the unmeasured objective function at the reactor exit. Numerical application of the proposed method shows that the resulting feedback algorithm steers the system to its optimum using a non-distributed jacket temperature actuation. The time evolution of the cost function is compared with an idealized distributed version of the algorithm presented previously. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
