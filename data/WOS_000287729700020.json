Group technology is used to increase the productivity for manufacturing high quality products and improving the flexibility of manufacturing systems. Cell formation is an important step in group technology. It is used in designing good cellular manufacturing systems. The key step in designing any cellular manufacturing system is the identification of part families and machine groups for the creation of cells that uses the similarities between parts in relation to the machines in their manufacture. There are two basic procedures for cell formation in group technology. One is part-family formation and the other is machine-cell formation. In this paper, we apply a fuzzy relational data clustering algorithm to form part families and machine groups. A real data study shows that the proposed approach performs well based on the grouping efficiency proposed by Chandrasekharan and Rajagopalan. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
