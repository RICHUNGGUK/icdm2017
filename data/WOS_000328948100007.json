Based on our analysis on the relationships between image histogram and contrast enhancement/white balancing, we first establish a generalized equalization model integrating contrast enhancement and white balancing into a unified framework of convex programming of image histogram. We show that many image enhancement tasks can be accomplished by the proposed model using different configurations of parameters. With two defining properties of histogram transform, namely contrast gain and nonlinearity, the model parameters for different enhancement applications can be optimized. We then derive an optimal image enhancement algorithm that theoretically achieves the best joint contrast enhancement and white balancing result with trading-off between contrast enhancement and tonal distortion. Subjective and objective experimental results show favorable performances of the proposed algorithm in applications of image enhancement, white balancing and tone correction. Computational complexity of the proposed method is also analyzed.", "paper_title": "Generalized Equalization Model for Image Enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000328948100007"}
