In this model, the opinion of an individual is affected by those of their acquaintances, but opinion changes (analogous to spin flips in an Ising-like model) are not allowed. We focus on the influence of advertising, which is represented by external magnetic fields. The inter play and competition between temperature and fields lead to order-disorder transitions, which are found to also depend on the link density and the topology of the complex network substrate. The effects of advertising campaigns with variable duration, as well as the best cost-effective strategies to achieve consensus within different scenarios, are also discussed.", "paper_title": "ADVERTISING AND IRREVERSIBLE OPINION SPREADING IN COMPLEX SOCIAL NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000267868100001"}
