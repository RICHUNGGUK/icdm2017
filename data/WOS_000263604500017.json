In this paper, we investigate the joint problem of optimal path selection and rate allocation for multiple video sessions in a wireless mesh network. We present a mathematical formulation to optimize the application level performance (i.e., video distortion) in the context of path selection and rate allocation. For this complex optimization problem, we propose a branch-and-bound based solution procedure, embedded with the Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT) that can produce (1 - epsilon)-optimal solutions for any small epsilon. This result is significant as it not only provides theoretical understanding of this problem, but also offers a performance benchmark for any future proposed distributed algorithm and protocol for this problem. Simulation results are also provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the solution procedure.", "paper_title": "On Path Selection and Rate Allocation for Video in Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000263604500017"}
