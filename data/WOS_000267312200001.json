Delay-dependent and delay-independent stability criteria are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The proposed criteria are less conservative and restrictive than other existing criteria since they are based on an equivalent neutral model transformation or parameterized transformation. Examples are given to illustrate advantages of our approach. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
