Paint Selection facilitates users to progressively make a selection by roughly painting the object of interest using a brush. More importantly, Paint Selection is efficient enough that instant feedback can be provided to users as they drag the mouse. We demonstrate that high quality selections can be quickly and effectively \"painted\" on a variety of multi-megapixel images.", "paper_title": "Paint Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000269278000049"}
