A significant share of energy usage is due to indoor lighting. Although methods exist for design and control of intelligent lighting systems, the task of real-world lighting assessment and verification remains only partly addressed. This paper describes foundations for design of a robot to conduct regular and automated audits of lighting quality in office buildings, with emphasis on the modeling of its behavior. The proposed model uses the Concurrent Communicating Lists (CCL) notation, which allows it to be easily simulated, executed, and formally verified. The CCL behavior model is discussed in the context of Knowledge-Behavior-Platform (KBP) robotic architecture proposed as a practical model runtime environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
