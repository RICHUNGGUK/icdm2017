These methods assume that measurement errors vary independently over time. Empirical evidence, however, indicates substantial temporal dependence, possibly related to changes in observing conditions. Dependence complicates the period analysis in several respects: selection of a \"best\" period among several local optima, estimation of the light curve, and evaluation of uncertainty about period and light curve estimates. This article presents methods designed to accommodate dependent errors. An analysis of several data sets shows that the proposed approach can produce substantially different and arguably better results compared with other methods. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
