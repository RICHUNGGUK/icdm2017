The proposed non-linear models contain seven descriptors, five of them are of the usual molecular type corresponding to the solutes and the other two describe the solvent as a bulk. The descriptors of both models are similar, and comparable to those obtained in previous studies for phenols and benzoic acids. The statistical results of the correlations, for the training, prediction, and validation sets of the two families are very good, with R-2 approximate to 0.98 and rills error approximate to 0.3 pK units. The information encoded ill the descriptors allows an interpretation of the dissociation process studied based oil the specific and non-specific solute-solvent interactions.", "paper_title": "QSPR Prediction of pK for Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids and Anilines in Different Solvents", "paper_id": "WOS:000260683400003"}
