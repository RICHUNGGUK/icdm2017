In this paper, we consider modelling the reliability of such devices by an exponential lifetime distribution in which the failure rate is assumed to be a function of some covariates and that the observed data are binary. The Bayesian approach, with three different prior settings, is used to develop inference on the failure rate, lifetime and the reliability under some settings. A Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out to show that this approach is quite useful and suitable for analysing data of the considered form, especially when the failure rates are very small. Finally, illustrative data are analysed using this approach.", "paper_title": "The Bayesian approach for highly reliable electro-explosive devices using one-shot device testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000270155600006"}
