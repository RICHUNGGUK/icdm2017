The pacing scheme is implemented at the wireless TCP sender as well as at the Internet gateway, and reacts according to the direction of TCP flows running across the wireless network and the Internet. Moreover, we analyze the causes for the unfairness of oncoming TCP flows and propose a scheme to throttle aggressive wired-to-wireless TCP flows at the Internet gateway to achieve nearly optimal fairness. The proposed scheme, which we denote as TCP with Gateway Adaptive Pacing (TCP-GAP), does not impose any control traffic overhead for achieving fairness among active TCP flows and can be incrementally deployed since it does not require any modifications of TCP in the wired part of the network. In an extensive set of experiments using ns-2 we show that TCP-GAP is highly responsive to varying traffic conditions, provides nearly optimal fairness in all scenarios and achieves up to 42% more goodput for FTP-like traffic as well as up to 70% more goodput for HTTP-like traffic than TCP NewReno. We also investigate the sensitivity of the considered TCP variants to different bandwidths of the wired and wireless links with respect to both aggregate goodput and fairness.
