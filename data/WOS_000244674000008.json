This model, in later years, has been studied for engineering applications such as auto-association and classification. The analogue nature of the model motivates analogue VLSI implementations. However, the dimension and complexity of such system poses many obstacles to an analogue electronic implementation; one such is the massive interconnectivity which size increases with the square of the number of inputs (channels). We suggest a multiplexing procedure that puts the burden of interconnectivity over a digital system that is simpler to design and makes the analogue system more treatable. The procedure naturally samples the signals. To avoid smoothing filters, a discrete-time solution was also employed. Although with such approach the time resolution is reduced, the advantages overcome the detriments. Previous work has shown that the model can be efficiently discretized using DSP techniques, resulting on a system that is able to predict, on sample-by-sample basis, the behaviour of the VLSI circuit, allowing for a simple and flexible way to adjust the circuit parameters. We present the measured circuit results that are further confronted with the digital implementation.", "paper_title": "Freeman olfactory cortex model: A multiplexed KII network implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000244674000008"}
