This new design paradigm greatly emancipates network innovation. This paper introduces the background of SDN technology with its design principles, explains its differentiation, and summarizes the research efforts on SDN network architecture, components and applications. Based on the observation of current SDN development, this paper analyzes the potential driving forces of SDN deployment and its future trend.", "paper_title": "A survey on software defined networking and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000368588400001"}
