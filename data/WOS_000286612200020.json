In this paper we investigate properties of the orthogonal shuffle on trajectories, as well as several types of language equations using this language operation. As a corollary, we obtain several properties of orthogonal catenation, orthogonal literal shuffle and orthogonal insertion.", "paper_title": "ORTHOGONAL SHUFFLE ON TRAJECTORIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612200020"}
