In the proposed method, LBP eigenfaces are generated by first mapping the original image space to the LBP space and then projecting the LBP space to the LBP eigenface subspace by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, LBP eigenfaces capture both the local and global structures of face images. In the experiments, the proposed LBP eigenfaces are integrated into two types of classification methods, Nearest Neighbor (NN) and Collaborative Representation-based Classification (CRC). Experimental results indicate that the classification with the LBP eigenfaces outperforms that with the original eigenfaces and LBP histogram.", "paper_title": "Face Recognition Using LBP Eigenfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784400031"}
