In particular, our new parsing engine handles (1) full scannerless context-free grammars with (2) regular expressions as right-hand sides for defining nonterminals. YAKKER also includes (3) facilities for binding variables to intermediate parse results and (4) using such bindings within arbitrary constraints to control parsing. These facilities allow the kind of data-dependent parsing commonly needed in systems applications, particularly those that operate over binary data. In addition, (5) nonterminals may be parameterized by arbitrary values, which gives the system good modularity and abstraction properties in the presence of data-dependent parsing. Finally, (6) legacy parsing libraries, such as sophisticated libraries for dates and times, may be directly incorporated into parser specifications. We illustrate the importance and utility of this rich collection of features by presenting its use on examples ranging from difficult programming language grammars to web server logs to binary data specification. We also show that our grammars have important compositionality properties and explain why such properties are important in modern applications such as automatic grammar induction. In terms of technical contributions, we provide a traditional high-level semantics for our new grammar formalization and show how to compile grammars into nondeterministic automata. These automata are stack-based, somewhat like conventional push-down automata, but are also equipped with environments to track data-dependent parsing state. We prove the correctness of our translation of data-dependent grammars into these new automata and then show how to implement the automata efficiently using a variation of Earley's parsing algorithm.", "paper_title": "Semantics and Algorithms for Data-dependent Grammars", "paper_id": "WOS:000274028100036"}
