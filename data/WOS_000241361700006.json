When the WSNV for a firm increases insufficiently, the stock price movement is often placid. When the WSNV increases significantly, the stock price movement is often oscillatory. A method of determining the amplitude of worth-noting significant increase on the WSNV is presented, by automatically inflating the standard deviations with different scales for the firms of different sizes. A measure of significant changes of stock prices is defined. Based on statistics and neural networks, the associations between these measures are mined through experiments. The results of the study provide us with the new clues to the microstructure of the stock market from the vision of the Internet news.", "paper_title": "Mining associations between web stock news volumes and stock prices", "paper_id": "WOS:000241361700006"}
