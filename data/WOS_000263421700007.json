Besides the model itself, the paper also presents a retrieval algorithm that exploits FROM features through the application of fuzzy operations that uses this knowledge to extend a user's query based on these fuzzy associations. Experimental results have shown that retrieval with FROM presented better overall performance than other fuzzy-based approaches for information retrieval.
