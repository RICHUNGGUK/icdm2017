In comparison with fixed networks or traditional mobile cellular networks, some new security issues have arisen with the introduction of MANETs. Routing security, in particular, is an important and complicated issue. In this work, we propose a two-tier authentication scheme for cluster and individual sets, in MANETs. The first tier, based on a hash function and the MAC concept, provides fast message verification and group identification. The second tier, based on secret sharing technology, provides secure user identification. The scenario of two-tier authentication can prevent internal and external attacks, including black holes, impersonation, routing table overflows and energy consummation attacks.
