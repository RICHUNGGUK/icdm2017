Aiming at energy optimization in 60GHz wireless data centers (WDCs), we investigate virtualization technology to assign virtual resources to minimum number of servers, and turn off other servers or adjust them to the state of low power. By comprehensive analysis of wireless data centers, we model virtual network and physical network in WDCs firstly, and propose Virtual Resource Mapping Packing Algorithm (VRMPA) to solve energy management problems. According to VRMPA, we adopt packing algorithm and sort physical resource only once, which improves efficiency of virtual resource allocation. Simulation results show that, under the condition of guaranteeing network load, VPMPA algorithm can achieve better virtual request acceptance rate and higher utilization rate of energy consumption.", "paper_title": "Energy-aware Virtual Resource Mapping Algorithm in Wireless Data Center", "paper_id": "WOS:000334499600006"}
