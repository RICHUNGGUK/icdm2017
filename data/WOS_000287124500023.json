As the main goal, it learns the optimal classification and at the same time, it learns the best sequence of council with previously designed local decision experts to reach the former optimal classification strategy. Local experts are in fact local classifiers who have learned the sub-optimal decision making based on just a portion of the whole feature space. The methodology is that in the first stage we generate different feature spaces by binning the features according to their potential relevance and then randomly selecting from the bins. At the second stage, we train a classifier for each of the resulting feature subsets. Finally, we use a continuous Q-learning variant for learning a combiner for the predictions of these classifiers which is the key contribution of the paper. Actually, the meta-learner in the last stage learns to combine different global models, each induced from a different feature subset. The domain of medical diagnosis (specifically Arrhythmia recognition) by using UCI datasets is opted as the benchmark. The acquired classification rate certifies that the proposed approach is quite comparable with the results have been reported so far. Moreover, this recognition is achieved by as few consultations as possible which is another key different merit for our approach.", "paper_title": "LEARNING WITH WHICH LOCAL DECISION EXPERT TO CONSULT NEXT CASE STUDY: ARRHYTHMIA DIAGNOSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287124500023"}
