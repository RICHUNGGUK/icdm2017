So we can use blossom algorithms and duality principle to deduce the derivative equations of these curves and surfaces. Thus, the rational L spline curve and surface are defined and constructed based on blossom algorithms and ensuring the continuity of L curve segment and surface patch. Next, we prove that rational L spline curve and surface are the generalization of many interpolation or approach parameter curves and surfaces (Lagrange, rational Lagrange, Bezier, rational Bezier, B spline, NURBS curves and surfaces, etc.). These recurrence curves and surfaces are used to establish the universal storage data file format for different CAD systems.", "paper_title": "Recursive curves and surfaces in Grassmann space for computer modeling and animation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300131"}
