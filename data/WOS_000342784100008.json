A probabilistic range query returns all the data objects within a specific range from the query object with a probability no less than a given threshold. In this paper, we assume that each uncertain object stored in the database is associated with a multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution, which describes the probability distribution that the object appears in the multi-dimensional space. A query object is either a certain object or an uncertain object modeled by a Gaussian distribution. We propose several filtering techniques and an R-tree-based index to efficiently support probabilistic range queries over Gaussian objects. Extensive experiments on real data demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic Range Querying over Gaussian Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784100008"}
