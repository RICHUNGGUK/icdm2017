Although the importance of interactive social experiences has long been recognized, current methods for studying complex multimodal interactions are lagging. This paper outlines a systems approach for characterizing fine-grained temporal dynamics of developing social interaction. We provide best practices for capturing, coding, and analyzing interaction activity on multiple -temporal scales, from fractions of seconds (e. g., gaze shifts), to minutes (e. g., coordinated play episodes), to weeks or months (e. g., developmental change).", "paper_title": "Methodological Considerations For Investigating the Microdynamics of Social Interaction Development", "paper_id": "WOS:000324583800008"}
