Motivated with the adaptation of the human vision system, we propose the curve mapping (CM) function to adjust the illumination conditions of the images. The lighting parameter of CM function is determined by the intensity distribution of the images. Therefore the CM function can adjust the images according to their own illumination conditions adaptively. The CM method will abandon no information of the original images and bring no noises to the images. But it will enhance the details of the images and adjust the images to the proper brightness. Consequently the CM method will make the images more discriminative. Experimental results show that it can improve the performance of the face detection with the CM method as a lighting-filter.", "paper_title": "Curve mapping based illumination adjustment for face detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100063"}
