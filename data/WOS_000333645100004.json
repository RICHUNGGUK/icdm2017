One of the better solutions to meet such demands is improving the government's EGS capability (EGSC). However, few studies discuss the issues. The purpose of this study was to employ capability management perspectives to develop theoretical linkages and path relationships among the components of EGSC. Comprehensive validation was further conducted through path analysis (PA) using structural equation modeling methods based on the data collected from 102 cities of the 26 provinces in Mainland China. The study unveiled the structure of EGSC, and PA results provided government policy makers or information technology managers insight into enhancing EGSC through the improvement of the components' performance.", "paper_title": "Study on the Framework of e-Government Services Capability: An Empirical Investigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000333645100004"}
