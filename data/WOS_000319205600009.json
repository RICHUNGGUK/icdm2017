The proposed method improves the standard particle swarm optimisation algorithm with a dynamic social interaction model that enhances the interaction among swarms. In addition, we integrate constraints provided by temporal continuity and strength of person detections in the framework. This allows particle swarm optimisation to be able to track multiple moving targets in a complex scene. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method robustly tracks multiple targets despite the complex interactions among targets that lead to several occlusions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
