By stab(H; k) we denote the minimum size among the sizes of all (H; k)-vertex stable graphs. In this paper we present a first (non-trivial) general lower bound for stab(H; k) with regard to the order, connectivity and minimum degree of H. This bound is nearly sharp for k = 1.", "paper_title": "General lower bound on the size of (H; k)-stable graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000350685200002"}
