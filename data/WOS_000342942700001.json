Wireless sensor networks (WSN), as a new field of research, have broad application prospects. This paper proposes a Web of Things- (WoT-) based remote monitoring system that takes full advantage of wireless sensor networks in combination with the CAN bus communication technique that abstracts the underground sensor data and capabilities into WoT resources to offer services using representational state transfer (REST) style. We also present three different implemented scenarios for WoT-based remote monitoring systems for coal mine safety, for which the system performance has been measured and analyzed. Finally, we describe our conclusions and future work.", "paper_title": "Web of Things-Based Remote Monitoring System for Coal Mine Safety Using Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000342942700001"}
