In our constructions, we make use of any binary sequences with ideal 2-level autocorrelation, a special shift sequence as well as the perfect binary sequence or sequence (0,1,1) in the interleaved structure to get the new sequences. Except for the most autocorrelation values of our new sequences, we find that the unexpected autocorrelation values only occur four or two times in each period no matter how long the period is. We state that the sequences have a good autocorrelation in this case. In particular, the autocorrelation distribution of our sequences is determined.", "paper_title": "New Constructions of Binary Sequences with Good Autocorrelation Based on Interleaving Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304800050"}
