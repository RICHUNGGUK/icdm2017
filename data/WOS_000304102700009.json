Bilateral relations can be expanded into triadic relationships and the complex dynamic process will produce a wide range of possible evolutionary trajectories. The essential feature of innovation is knowledge integration and creation. From different dimensions the knowledge will be integrated at knowledge-flow level and organizational level. In this paper, a self-organizing model of knowledge integration in collaborative innovation and its working processes including the nucleation and autopoiesis processes are introduced. Problem about degree of knowledge integration in collaborative innovation is discussed and a new comprehensive categorization method is suggested. Finally a case study is described.", "paper_title": "KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION IN COLLABORATIVE INNOVATION AND A SELF-ORGANIZING MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000304102700009"}
