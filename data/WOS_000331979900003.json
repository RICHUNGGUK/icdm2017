We formulate a simple optimization for estimating vertical or horizontal translations of the frame. The optimization goal is to find the best match between energies (squared norms) of rows (columns) of the image and the reference frame. The shift estimate is calculated as the minimizer of the least squares, maximum deviation or the sum of absolute deviations criterion. However, the first criterion is preferred, the last two almost always gave the same results when the noise level is low. The proposed method is faster than the FFT based phase-correlation approach. An iterative version of the algorithm is presented which is very reliable and usually converges in at most two iterations. A randomized version of the method which reduce further the computational cost for large images problems is also proposed. Experimental results are provided and discussed.", "paper_title": "Estimation of horizontal and vertical translations of large images based on columns and rows mean energy matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000331979900003"}
