The proposed scheme is based on the difficulty of calculating discrete logarithms problem. All the session keys can be used against the known key attacks, man-in-the middle attacks, replay attacks or forgery attacks. The security and efficiency of our proposed scheme are presented Compare with other schemes, the proposed scheme can generate more session keys in one session. Therefore, the propose scheme is more efficient than the others.", "paper_title": "A n(2)+n MQV Key Agreement Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000316841900004"}
