A short 2R settling time of 75 ns (150 ns for lower-rate operation), a high receiver sensitivity of -31.3 dBm, and a large loud/soft ratio of 25.3 dB are demonstrated at 2.5/5/10 Gb/s in burst-mode operation. Allowing multi-rate operation without external reset signals, it shows great potential for use in emerging symmetric 10G-GPON systems and allows for more flexible future optical access networks.", "paper_title": "Experiments on a 10 Gb/s Fast-Settling High-Sensitivity Burst-Mode Receiver With On-Chip Auto-Reset for 10G-GPONs [Invited]", "paper_id": "WOS:000311794600010"}
