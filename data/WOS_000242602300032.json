Based on the pre-defined instruction/operator sets, a flexible neural tree model can be created and evolved. This framework allows input variables selection, over-layer connections and different activation functions for the various nodes involved. The FNT structure is developed using genetic programming (GP) and the parameters are optimized by a memetic algorithm (MA). The proposed approach was applied for two real-world problems involving designing intrusion detection system (IDS) and for breast cancer classification. The IDS data has 41 inputs/features and the breast cancer classification problem has 30 inputs/features. Empirical results indicate that the proposed method is efficient for both input feature selection and improved classification rate. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
