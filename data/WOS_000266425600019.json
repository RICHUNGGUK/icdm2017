By proper selection of the amount of cyclic delay, an improved fine carrier frequency offset estimator is derived. By computer simulation, the proposed estimator is shown to benefit from properly chosen delay parameter and perform robustly.", "paper_title": "Delay Selection for Improved Frequency Estimation in OFDM-Based FM Systems with Cyclic Delay Diversity", "paper_id": "WOS:000266425600019"}
