However, most power control algorithms proposed so far are impractical, because previous work usually makes such perfect assumptions as uniform transmission ranges, location-awareness, and so on. In this paper, we propose REG (Relative Energy-cost Graph), an algorithm to derive a novel proximity graph, which is optimal in the sense of sparseness while preserving the least energy consumption path between any two nodes. And based on REG, we further put forward a new practical power control algorithm PREG (Practicalized REG) for heterogeneous networks. Our theoretical analyses and simulation results show that PREG has a better performance than other power control algorithms thanks to its high practicality and energy efficiency.", "paper_title": "PREG: A practical power control algorithm based on a novel proximity graph for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240084000058"}
