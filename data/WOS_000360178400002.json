This is particularly true for file sharing peer-to-peer networks, considered the vast number of nodes participating to these systems. To address such problem, this paper proposes a peer-to-peer file sharing model organized in two logical layers. The lower layer is composed of a set of peers providing the files to be shared. The upper layer includes a set of super peers organized to form a distributed hash table, whose purpose is indexing files and peers, including their availability status. Following a sleep-and-wake approach, energy saving is achieved by letting peers cyclically switch between normal and sleep modes, where the time passed in normal mode by a peer depends on the number of files it provides. An energy-saving algorithm and an associated file search and retrieval strategy are proposed within this model. Simulation results show that more than 50% of energy can be saved using the proposed model and that more than 80% of file downloads start with no additional delay compared with a network in which all peers are always powered on.
