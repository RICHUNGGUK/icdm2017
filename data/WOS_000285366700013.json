The key concept of window functions is to sort the input relation and to compute the aggregate results during a scan of the sorted relation. For multi-dimensional OLAP queries with aggregation groups defined by a general theta condition an appropriate ordering does not exist, though, and hence expensive join-based solutions are required. In this paper we introduce theta-constrained multi-dimensional aggregation (theta-MDA), which supports multi-dimensional OLAP queries with aggregation groups defined by inequalities. theta-MDA is not based on an ordering of the data relation. Instead, the tuples that shall be considered for computing an aggregate value can be determined by a general theta condition. This facilitates the formulation of complex queries, such as multi-dimensional cumulative aggregates, which are difficult to express in SQL because no appropriate ordering exists. We present algebraic transformation rules that demonstrate how the theta-MDA interacts with other operators of a multi-set algebra. Various techniques for achieving an efficient evaluation of the theta-MDA are investigated, and we integrate them into concrete evaluation algorithms and provide cost formulas. An empirical evaluation with data from the TPC-H benchmark confirms the scalability of the theta-MDA operator and shows performance improvements of up to one order of magnitude over equivalent SQL implementations.
