To address this problem, this paper presents a method for estimating diastolic mechanical parameters of the left ventricle (LV) from cine and tagged MRI measurements and LV cavity pressure recordings, separating the passive myocardial constitutive properties and diastolic residual AT. Dynamic C-1-continuous meshes are automatically built from the anatomy and deformation captured from dynamic MRI sequences. Diastolic deformation is simulated using a mechanical model that combines passive and active material properties. The problem of non-uniqueness of constitutive parameter estimation using the well known Guccione law is characterized by reformulation of this law. Using this reformulated form, and by constraining the constitutive parameters to be constant across time points during diastole, we separate the effects of passive constitutive properties and the residual AT during diastolic relaxation. Finally, the method is applied to two clinical cases and one control, demonstrating that increased residual AT during diastole provides a potential novel index for delineating healthy and pathological cases.
