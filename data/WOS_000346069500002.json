The new algorithm searches for the optimal solution on a global solution space while maintaining the advantage of simplicity and computational efficiency. Both a theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate the validity of the new algorithm.", "paper_title": "An iterative orthogonal forward regression algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000346069500002"}
