Problem formulation in a wave frame of reference is presented. The governing nonlinear analysis is carried out under the assumption of small wave number. Explicit expressions of the pressure gradient, the stream function, the magnetic force function, the axial induced magnetic field, the current density distribution, the temperature, and the concentration distribution are derived. The effects of embedded parameters are also examined.
