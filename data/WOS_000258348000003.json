This paper presents the universal data model platform (UDMP) which introduce the data-centric design revolution into the electronic system-level (ESL) design to support better cooperation of design individuals. UDMP provides (1) a set of universal data models to help both university researches and industry, and (2) an application programming interface (API) based mechanism for data exchanging to eliminate the inefficiency of traditional low-bandwidth formatted files. Thereby the cooperative work of ESL design and the efficiency of design iteration can be improved. As primary experiments, we apply the concepts of UDMP to two case studies. The heterogeneous graph modeling demonstrates how UDMP unifies the similar graph models in a flexible way, and the simplification of an interface synthesis flow which consists three individual algorithms obtains a running time reduction by about 10% for selected designs.
