We group them in chapters on Numerical Analysis, Harmonic Analysis, Algebra and Number Theory, and Probability Theory. We do not provide a comprehensive survey of all tools, but focus on a few of them, including reproducing and covariance kernels, Littlewood-Paley theory, Riesz products, Minkowski's fundamental theorem, exponential sums, diophantine approximation, Hoeffding's inequality and empirical processes, as well as other tools. We illustrate the use of these methods in QMC using examples. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.
