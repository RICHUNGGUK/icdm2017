Risk engineering is used as a foundation. Financial impact (penalty) quantification with various compensation policies is applied, and business-relevant risk measures are used during the risk assessment. Then, risk mitigation strategies are evaluated to select the appropriate risk response. The approach is presented in networks with energy profiles supporting a sleep mode. An effective heuristic is used to assign flows, and it is shown that the energy-efficiency performance is substantially independent of the recovery methods selected for riskmitigation. It is also demonstrated that backup resources can be switched off in the normal state without having a considerable impact from a financial viewpoint.", "paper_title": "Energy-efficiency versus resilience: risk awareness view on dimensioning of optical networks with a sleep mode", "paper_id": "WOS:000358169300005"}
