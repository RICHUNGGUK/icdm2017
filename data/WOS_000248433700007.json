First, seed cells and region growing criteria are specified. Then an object partition framework is defined on the basis of region growing segmentation. Size filtering is applied to objects and connected components labelling identifies background and foreground objects that are parametrically represented on the basis of elevation and slope. K-means classification reveals a set of clusters. The interpretation of the spatial distribution of clusters assisted by the interpretation of cluster centroids, allows for the identification of the building class, as well as building sub-classes with different geomorphometric characteristics.
