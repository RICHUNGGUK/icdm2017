In this paper we propose a two-stage stochastic integer programming model for the integrated optimization of power production and trading which include a specific measure accounting for risk management. We solve the model by means of a novel enumerative solution approach that exploits the particular problem structure. Finally, we report some preliminary computational experiments.
