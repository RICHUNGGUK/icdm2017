In that way, a bifurcation analysis can easily be performed. In the classical approach, the reduction to invariant manifolds requires smoothness of the system which is typically not given for nonsmooth systems. For that reason, techniques have been developed to extend such a reduction procedure to nonsmooth systems. In the present paper, we present such an approach for systems involving sliding motion. In addition, an analysis of the reduced equation shows that the generation of periodic orbits through nonlinear perturbations which is usually related to Hopf bifurcation follows a different type of bifurcation if nonsmooth elements are present, since generically symmetry is broken by the nonsmooth terms.
