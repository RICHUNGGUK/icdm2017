It focuses on the working flow of the AVE-based CPFR. On this basis, it proposes the AVE-related CPFR mechanism grounded on grid, and further analyzes its working principles, grid methods matching the AVE-related CPFR working flow, the strengths of this mechanism as well as the n-tier prediction working flow. In addition, it constructs the selection model of credit-granting guarantee approaches and provides evidence for it. Under this mechanism, credit risk in the AVE enterprises can be optimized, and the AVE chain matches the working mechanism of CPFR in their capacities of real-time resource sharing, n-tier resource allocation, mission assignment, control, and supervision. It is hoped that the distance management and risk blockage could be achieved in supply chains within AVE enterprises by establishing a strong self-organized and self-control working chain.", "paper_title": "AVE-CPFR WORKING CHAINS ON THE BASIS OF SELECTION MODEL OF COLLABORATIVE CREDIT-GRANTING GUARANTEE APPROACHES", "paper_id": "WOS:000277689200007"}
