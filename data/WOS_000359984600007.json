Most MemPUFs in the literature have unreliable bit generation and/or are incapable of generating more than one response-bit per cell. Hence, we propose a novel MemPUF exploiting the unique characteristics of spin-transfer torque magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) that can overcome these issues. Bit generation in our STT-MRAM-based MemPUF is stabilized using a novel automatic write-back technique. In addition, the alterability of the magnetic tunneling junction state is exploited to expand the response-bit capacity per cell. Our analysis demonstrated the advantage of our scheme in reliability enhancement (bit-error rate from similar to 10(-1) to similar to 10(-6) in the worst case under varying conditions) and response-bit capacity per cell improvement (from 1 to 1.48 bit). In comparison with the conventional MemPUFs, our approach is also better in terms of the average chip area and energy for producing a response-bit.", "paper_title": "Highly Reliable Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM-Based Physical Unclonable Function With Multi-Response-Bits Per Cell", "paper_id": "WOS:000359984600007"}
