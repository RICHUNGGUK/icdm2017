We then give a quite tight lower bound of the achievable sum-rate of the network with the proposed strategy to measure the performance. The sum-rates achieved by the proposed strategy is compared with other schemes without considering the DC in design in simulations, which shows that the proposed strategy outperforms the existing methods when RS is close to BS.", "paper_title": "Efficient Linear Transmission Strategy for MIMO Relaying Broadcast Channels with Direct Links", "paper_id": "WOS:000209695900004"}
