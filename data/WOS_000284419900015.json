We propose a quantizer structure with continuous Voronoi regions and derive its optimality conditions using probability analysis. Our design involves construction of a novel bit-mapping scheme. The optimized power control codebook resembles channel optimized scalar quantizers (COSQs). Also, the diversity gain of the communication system under study is characterized with both nonzero and vanishing feedback error probabilities.", "paper_title": "Outage Behavior of Slow Fading Channels With Power Control Using Partial and Erroneous CSIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000284419900015"}
