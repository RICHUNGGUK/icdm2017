We present predictive neural and k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) models for hearing improvements after middle ear surgery for chronic otitis media. The studied data set comprised 150 patients characterised by the set of input variables: age, gender, preoperative audiometric results, ear pathology and details of the surgical procedure. The predicted (output) variable was the postoperative hearing threshold. The best neural models developed in this study achieved 84% correct predictions for the test data set while the k-NN model produced only 75.8% correct predictions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
