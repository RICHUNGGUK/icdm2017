However, numerical experiments conducted by Babadi and Tarokh revealed that Gold codes, which have a dual distance of 5, also possess such a randomness property. Hence, the interesting question was raised as to whether or not the stringent requirement of large dual distances can be relaxed in the theorems in order to explain the mysterious randomness of Gold sequences. In this paper, we improve the results of Babadi and Tarokh on several fronts and provide an affirmative answer to this question.", "paper_title": "On a Question of Babadi and Tarokh", "paper_id": "WOS:000344524100044"}
