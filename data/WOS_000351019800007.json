The algebraic properties of generalized extended fuzzy implications are discussed ondifferent algebras of fuzzy truth values. On this basis, fuzzy-valued fuzzy implications are constructed from arbitrary fuzzy implications and t-norms. Moreover, a fuzzy-valued fuzzy implication is identical with a generalized extended fuzzy implication on the algebra of fuzzy values, when they are induced by exactly the same continuous fuzzy implication and same upper semicontinuous t-norm.
