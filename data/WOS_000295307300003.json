The major improvement over existing TESs is that the construction uses only the encryption function of the underlying block cipher. Consequently, this leads to substantial savings in the size of hardware implementation of TES applications such as disk encryption. This improvement is achieved without loss in efficiency of encryption and decryption compared to previously known schemes. We further show that the same idea can also be used with a stream cipher which supports an initialization vector (IV) leading to the first example of a TES from such a primitive.
