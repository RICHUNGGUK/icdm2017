This process is known as spontaneous device association. A wide range of interactive protocols and techniques have been demonstrated in both research and practice, predominantly with a focus on security aspects. In this article, we survey spontaneous device association with respect to the user interaction it involves. We use a novel taxonomy to structure the survey with respect to the different conceptual models and types of user action employed for device association. Within this framework, we provide an in-depth survey of existing techniques discussing their individual characteristics, benefits, and issues.", "paper_title": "A Survey of User Interaction for Spontaneous Device Association", "paper_id": "WOS:000340820600008"}
