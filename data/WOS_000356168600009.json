First, we briefly describe main features of the standards for biometric face images. Available scientific databases have been checked for compliance with these biometric standards. During the research we have considered both the correctness of extraction (location) of the face from the image as well as the correctness of the identification (based on the eigenfaces approach). To the tests we have used the face databases that allow to study tolerance to illumination and face positions. We have compared various face detection techniques and analyzed minimum requirements for the resolution of facial images. Finally, an influence of the resolution reduction on the FAR/FRR of the recognition is presented.", "paper_title": "Influence of low resolution of images on reliability of face detection and recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000356168600009"}
