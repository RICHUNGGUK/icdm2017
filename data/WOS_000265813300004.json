The method is illustrated for a Bezier and a B-spline curve. Furthermore, its utility for fairing curves under torsion-sign constraints in quadratic-programming context, is illustrated for a pair of Bezier curves. Finally, it is shown that the obtained results remain useful if, besides the User-selected free control point, neighboring ones are permitted to vary within convex polyhedra. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
