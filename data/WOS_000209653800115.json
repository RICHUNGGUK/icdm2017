This paper analyzes the challenges of building a simulation platform for 5G considering the emerging new technologies and network architectures. Based on the overview of evaluation methodologies issued for 4G candidates, challenges in 5G evaluation are formulated. Additionally, a cloud-based two-level framework of system-level simulator is proposed to validate the candidate technologies and fulfill the promising technology performance identified for 5G.", "paper_title": "Challenges of System-Level Simulations and Performance Evaluation for 5G Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209653800115"}
