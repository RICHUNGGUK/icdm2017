To adapt this, a low-cost Inter frame mode decision (MD) algorithm is proposed for H. 264/AVC encoder to reduce the computational complexity of the original encoding procedure in this paper. The information extracted from macroblock (MB), such as energy, temporal domain mode similarity and so on, which can be used to pre-estimate the optimal mode of the MB is investigated and utilized to eliminate the redundant mode candidates. The performance evaluations including quantitative analysis and PC simulations show that the proposed algorithm is an energy-efficient source coding because it can reduce around 85% Inter frame encoding time with little quality loss. It can be widely implemented in green mobile networking systems with H. 264/AVC standard to realize the real-time video signal coding.", "paper_title": "Low-Cost H.264/AVC Inter Frame Mode Decision Algorithm for Mobile Communication Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000304658200012"}
