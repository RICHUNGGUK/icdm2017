This work uses real 3D dense point cloud data acquired with a scanner using a stereo photogrammetry technique. Since the point clouds are in varied orientations, by applying a non-iterative registration method, we automatically transform each point cloud to a canonical position. Unlike the iterative ICP algorithm, our non-iterative registration process is scale invariant. An efficient B-spline surface-fitting technique is developed to represent 3D faces in a way that allows efficient surface comparison. This is based on a novel knot vector standardisation algorithm which allow a single B-Spline surface to be fitted onto a complex object represented as a unstructured points cloud. Consequently, dense correspondences across objects are established. Several experiments have been conducted and 91% recognition rate can be achieved.", "paper_title": "3D face recognition based on non-iterative registration and single B-spline patch modelling techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100072"}
