This paper examines the integration of multi-server and state dependent queues and the robustness properties in these queueing network models. It is also shown that the topological arrangements problem (TAP) in a finite queueing network is NP-Hard. Extensive computational results are included to test the properties of these network models to changes in service times, buffers, and other MHS network parameters. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
