For the first three classes, we prove tight O (n) bounds on the maximum number of edges that a graph having a dominating induced matching may contain. By applying these bounds, and employing existing O (n + m) time algorithms we show that they can be reduced to O (n) time. For claw-free graphs, we describe a variation of the existing algorithm for solving the unweighted version of the problem, which decreases its complexity from O (n(2)) to O (n), while additionally solving the weighted version. The same algorithm can be easily modified to count the number of DIM's of the given graph. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
