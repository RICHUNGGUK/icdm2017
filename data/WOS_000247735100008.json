Our aim is to search for keywords typed by the user in a large collection of digitized printed historical documents. The proposed method consists of the following stages: (1) creation of synthetic image words; (2) word segmentation using dynamic parameters; (3) efficient feature extraction for each word image and (4) a retrieval procedure that is optimized by user feedback. Experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Keyword-guided word spotting in historical printed documents using synthetic data and user feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000247735100008"}
