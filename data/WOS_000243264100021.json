Jobs of type 0 are generated randomly according to a Poisson stream. Jobs of types 1 to N are non-queue types which may or may not be available for completion by the server. To optimally allocate the server's time to these jobs, we formulate a finite state semi-Markov decision process model to this environment. With this model, the optimal stationary policies can be numerically determined via a policy-iteration algorithm. We also discuss the practical applications of this model to tele-service and tele-marketing operations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
