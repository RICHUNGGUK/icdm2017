In this paper, we first describe a side channel attack on Enocoro-128v2. We show that all secret key bytes of Enocoro-128v2 can be recovered by correlation power analysis, and it is shown by an experiment that around 6000 traces are needed to recover the secret key on SASEBO-GII (Side-channel Attack Standard Evaluation Board). We second propose a countermeasure with threshold implementation technique, which allows Enocoro-128v2 to be resistant against correlation power analysis as long as less than 10(5) traces are used.", "paper_title": "Correlation Power Analysis and Countermeasure on the Stream Cipher Enocoro-128v2", "paper_id": "WOS:000320218000004"}
