The proposed method has fully taken into account the correlation of the R, G and B plane of a color image. The amount of information embedded the R plane and the B plane determined by the difference of the corresponding pixel value between the G plane and the median of G pixel value in each pixel block. Furthermore, two sophisticated pixel value adjustment processes are provided to maintain the division consistency and to solve underflow and overflow problems. The most importance is that the secret data are completely extracted through the mathematical theoretical proof.", "paper_title": "A novel data hiding for color images based on pixel value difference and modulus function", "paper_id": "WOS:000349356400003"}
