First approach relies on computation of the optimal exercise boundary while the second relies on classification of continuation and exercise values. We also evaluate the performance of both the algorithms in a desktop grid environment. We show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in a heterogeneous computing environment, and identify scalability constraints due to the algorithmic structure. (C) 2010 IMACS.
