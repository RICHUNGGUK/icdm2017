The device is novel due to its innovative design. It is a new type of reflective oximeter, which has a concave structure for housing the optical source and sensor. The neo-reflective sensor module of the device is designed to send the sensor data to a nearby intelligent mobile phone using wireless data transmission. The pulse oximeter has been developed and calibrated, and the calibration curve was analyzed. The innovative design of this pulse oximeter would enable the user to wear the low-cost device on one wrist continuously throughout the day, without the inconvenience of a conventional finger pulse oximeter.", "paper_title": "A Neo-Reflective Wrist Pulse Oximeter", "paper_id": "WOS:000209653800116"}
