We develop a simple algorithm to schedule a subset of M active users for data transmission. We first identify a set of L candidate users that should provide channel information feedback. We then select M active users among the L candidates based on joint consideration of their effective channel gains and directions. We derive an asymptotic upper bound for the sum rate gap between the maximum sum rate of the M selected active users, achieved by dirty paper coding, and the full sum capacity of the original MIMO broadcast channel. Utilizing the upper bound, we show that the sum rate gap can be reduced to meet user requirement by suitably choosing a large but still finite L. Furthermore, we also investigate the performance of the low complexity zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) for the active users.", "paper_title": "On Wireless Downlink Scheduling of MIMO Systems With Homogeneous Users", "paper_id": "WOS:000278812000027"}
