The proposed approach consists of two main steps. In the first step, a robust covariance matrix is determined using the minimum covariance determinant algorithm. In the second step. an eigen-analysis of the robust correlation matrix is performed to derive the robust control limits of the proposed multivariate chart. Our experimental results illustrate the much better fault detection performance of the proposed method in comparison with existing statistical monitoring and process controlling charts.
