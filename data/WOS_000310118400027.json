This study focuses on building a model for high performance project teams. First, success and failure factors are evaluated across aspects of a project team that affect team effectiveness. Second, effective teams are analyzed to clarify what defines a high performance project team. Third, this analysis is combined with past results to build a model for high performance project teams. The model for high, performance project teams is evaluated by fuzzy multi-criterion decision-making (fuzzy MCDM). The results show that all of the criteria have interactions, but that team effectiveness standard is the most influential dimension. On the contrary, the team process is the least influential dimension. From the viewpoint of experts, the most important ones of the 17 evaluation criteria are performance and satisfaction.", "paper_title": "A FUZZY MCDM APPROACH TO BUILDING A MODEL OF HIGH PERFORMANCE PROJECT TEAM - A CASE STUDY", "paper_id": "WOS:000310118400027"}
