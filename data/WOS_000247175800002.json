These graphs not only show the inner contour of the pipe but also integrate the intensity of the echoes employed to create the profile. The enhanced profile is generated by superimposing the peak intensity from the returning echoes at the calculated x, y, and z coordinates where it reflected from the pipe wall. The proposed method is capable of showing anomalous conditions, inside pipes filled with liquid, with dimensions smaller than the theoretical lateral and axial resolution of the transducer, in contrast to traditional methods where these kinds of defects are not disclosed. The proposed inspection method and its capabilities were validated through the realization of simulations and experiments. The presented approach was particularly developed with the aim of scanning internal sections of pipes filled with liquid using rotary ultrasonic sonars, but it is expected that this research could be expanded to the inspection of other submerged structures, such as water tanks, or pressurized vessels.", "paper_title": "An ultrasonic profiling method for the inspection of tubular structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000247175800002"}
