The efficiencies of these cryptosystems depend on the computation of the bilinear pairings. In this paper, a new efficient algorithm based on double-base chains for computing the Tate pairing is proposed for odd characteristicp > 3. The inherent sparseness of double-base number system reduces the computational cost for computing the Tate pairing evidently. The new algorithm is 9% faster than the previous fastest method for the embedding degree k = 6.", "paper_title": "Efficient Tate pairing computation using double-base chains", "paper_id": "WOS:000257394000009"}
