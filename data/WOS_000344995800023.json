The communication limitations, including measurements quantization, signal transmission delay, and data packet dropout, frequent in many practical networked control systems (NCSs) are considered. By transforming the residual system into an input-output form consisting two interconnected subsystems via a two-term approximation to the state delay variables, sufficient conditions are established. Under these conditions, the residual system is stochastically stable with a prescribed H-infinity level with the help of the scaled small gain (SSG) theorem developed for stochastic systems. Furthermore, the fault detection filter design approach is presented. A numerical example is also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Fault Detection for Discrete Systems With Network-Induced Nonlinearities", "paper_id": "WOS:000344995800023"}
