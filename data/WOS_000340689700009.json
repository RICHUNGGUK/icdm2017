However, few work in this area has been extended to the WLAN. In this paper, we propose a wireless multi-step attack pattern recognition method (WMAPRM) based on correlation analysis with the main attributes of the IEEE 802.11 frame. The method consists of six steps: clustering wireless intrusion alerts, constructing a global attack database, building candidate attack chains, filtering candidate attack chains, correlating multi-step attack behaviors and recognizing multi-step attack patterns. Experimental results in real world environment show that WMAPRM is capable of identifying highly correlated multi-step attack patterns such as WEP crack with ARP + Deauthentication Flood, WEP crack with wesside-ng, config file stealing attack and authentication session hijack attack etc. The method is expected to improve both wireless intrusion detection and prevention performance in practical WLAN security scenarios.
