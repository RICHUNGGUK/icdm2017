A RFID reader recognizes tags through communication over a shared wireless channel. When multiple tags transmit their IDs simultaneously, the tag-to-reader signals collide and this collision disturbs a reader's identification process. Therefore, tag collision arbitration for passive tags is a significant issue for fast identification. This paper presents two adaptive tag anticollision protocols: an Adaptive Query Splitting protocol ( AQS), which is an improvement on the query tree protocol, and an Adaptive Binary Splitting protocol (ABS), which is based on the binary tree protocol and is a de facto standard for RFID anticollision protocols. To reduce collisions and identify tags efficiently, adaptive tag anticollision protocols use information obtained from the last process of tag identification. Our performance evaluation shows that AQS and ABS outperform other tree-based tag anticollision protocols.", "paper_title": "Tag-splitting: Adaptive collision arbitration protocols for RFID tag identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000245901100004"}
