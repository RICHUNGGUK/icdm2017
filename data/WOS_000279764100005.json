For elastic traffic, it is the total completion time, not the delay constraint of a single packet or the short-term throughput requirement, that directly affects the quality-of-service (QoS). At the same time, the energy consumption should be minimized in order to prolong the battery lifetime of the mobile station (MS). In this paper, we propose energy efficient schedulers that consider throughput and energy saving simultaneously. Through extensive simulations, we compare the proposed schemes with the conventional scheme where a mobile terminal stays awake until all the pending packets are completely serviced. The simulation results show that our schemes outperform the conventional one in terms of utility, i.e., user satisfaction, which is defined as inversely proportional to the multiplication of weighted service completion time and energy consumption.
