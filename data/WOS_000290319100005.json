For three types of boundary conditions, delay-dependent criteria are established by the Lyapunov--Krasovskii functional approach, respectively. The obtained results are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Numerical examples illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach are provided.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis for delayed genetic regulatory networks with reaction-diffusion terms", "paper_id": "WOS:000290319100005"}
