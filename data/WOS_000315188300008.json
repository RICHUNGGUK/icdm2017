The left-censored sample and Type-II right-censored sample are special cases of this scheme. Point and interval reconstructors for lost failure times are obtained, while the underlying distribution is exponential. To illustrate the performance of the proposed procedures, two numerical examples based on the real data sets are presented. In the case of two-parameter, a simulation study has been done and also the sensitivity of the results to deviations from the true distribution is investigated.", "paper_title": "Bayesian reconstruction of the missing failure times in exponential distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000315188300008"}
