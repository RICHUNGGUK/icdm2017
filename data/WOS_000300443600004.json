We consider the number of states needed for transducers used in minimal descriptions of arbitrary strings and, as our main result, show that the state-size hierarchy with respect to a standard encoding is infinite. We consider corresponding hierarchies yielded by more general computable encodings and establish that for a suitably chosen computable encoding every level of the state-size hierarchy can be strict.", "paper_title": "STATE-SIZE HIERARCHY FOR FINITE-STATE COMPLEXITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000300443600004"}
