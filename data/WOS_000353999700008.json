While higher speeds improve latency, they also draw a lot of power. Thus we adopt a threshold-based policy that uses higher speeds under higher workload conditions, and vice versa. However, it is unclear how to select \"optimal\" thresholds. For that we use a stochastic fluid-flow model with varying processing speeds based on fluid level. First, given a set of thresholds, we develop an approach based on spectral expansion by modeling the evolution of the fluid queue as a semi-Markov process (SMP) and analyzing its performance. While there are techniques based on matrix-analytic methods and forward-backward decomposition, we show that they are not nearly as fast as the spectral-expansion SMP-based approach. Using the performance measures obtained from the SMP model, we suggest an algorithm for selecting the thresholds so that power consumption is minimized, while satisfying a quality-of-service constraint. We illustrate our results using a numerical example.", "paper_title": "Obtaining Optimal Thresholds for Processors with Speed-Scaling", "paper_id": "WOS:000353999700008"}
