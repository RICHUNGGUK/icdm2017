However, in areas those have previous experience of a disaster, people frequently voice the lack of audibility of the disaster reduction broadcast. In this research, we conducted a questionnaire survey on the residents in the central area of Ishinomaki City, Miyagi Prefecture, who are the victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake Disaster, on the audible quality of outdoor public address (PA) speakers of the disaster reduction broadcasting system so as to understand the current state of such broadcasts and to propose ideal methods of sending and receiving information at the time of a future disaster.", "paper_title": "A Survey on the Audible Quality of Outdoor Public Address Speakers for the Disaster Reduction Broadcasting System in the Central Area of Ishinomaki City", "paper_id": "WOS:000359467200011"}
