By selectively admitting objects into the cache, the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the amount of disk I/O on a Web cache while maintaining a high hit ratio. The proposed algorithm adaptively adjusts its own admission control parameter, requiring no user-supplied parameters. Through extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "An Effective Self-Adaptive Admission Control Algorithm for Large Web Caches", "paper_id": "WOS:000265703000018"}
