First, the primary principle of speed control by regulation of input energy is studied, the feature of which is to regulate the speed and the step length synchronically. The method of Poincare mapping is used to prove the stability of speed control in the common range. Second, a method of speed control for an 18 DOFs bipedal 3D robot, which is characterized by the two-point-foot, is proposed. The method is developed on the basis of the 3D walking pattern proposed previously, with the new function of speed regulation being added in. The simulations show that the performances of regular walking, acceleration, and deceleration are effective and stable, and therefore verify the feasibility of the proposed method. Furthermore, some walking features, such as the walking efficiency and lateral control, are demonstrated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
