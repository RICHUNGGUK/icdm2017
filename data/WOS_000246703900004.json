NP-complete sets and PSPACE-complete sets are polynomial-time many-one autoreducible. Complete sets of any level of PH, MODPH, or the Boolean hierarchy over NP are polynomial-time many-one autoreducible. EXP-complete sets are polynomial-time many-one mitotic. If there is a tally language in NP boolean AND coNP - P, then, for every epsilon > 0, NP-complete sets are not 2(n(1+epsilon))-immune. These results solve several of the open questions raised by Buhrman and Torenvliet in their 1994 survey paper on the structure of complete sets. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
