In particular, we propose QuERy, a novel framework for integrating entity resolution (ER) with query processing. The aim of QuERy is to correctly and efficiently answer complex queries issued on top of dirty data. The comprehensive empirical evaluation of the proposed solution demonstrates its significant advantage in terms of efficiency over the traditional techniques for the given problem settings.", "paper_title": "QuERy: A Framework for Integrating Entity Resolution with Query Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000386425900004"}
