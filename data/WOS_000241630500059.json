The paper argues that construction informatics has elements in common with both natural sciences, mathematics, technology as well as humanities and therefore a broad scope of methodological apparatus is available, including that of humanities. Some current methods are criticized and action research and Socratic methods suggested as an alternative.", "paper_title": "Methodologies for construction informatics research", "paper_id": "WOS:000241630500059"}
