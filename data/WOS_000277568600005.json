The notion can be generalized for arbitrary language operations. We consider decidability properties of language orthogonality and the solvability of language equations involving the orthogonal concatenation operation. We establish a tight bound for the state complexity of orthogonal concatenation of regular languages.", "paper_title": "Orthogonal Concatenation: Language Equations and State Complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000277568600005"}
