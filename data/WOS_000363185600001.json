In this paper, we focus on the user-level interference under multicasting scenarios. Rather than the traditional pairwise way of D2D communications, we propose to implement the information exchanging through a groupwise way. Through introducing the idea of network coding, the proposed scheme is able to utilize the interference as valid signals to enhance the receiving performance, instead of only managing or controlling it. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results prove that the proposed scheme achieves better SINR performance and lower resources occupation than the traditional pairwise D2D transmission schemes.", "paper_title": "Exploiting the User-Level Interference Based on Network Coding in D2D Underlaid Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000363185600001"}
