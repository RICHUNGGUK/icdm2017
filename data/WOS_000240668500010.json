This observation invites an exploration of nonlocal manifold learning algorithms that attempt to discover shared structure in the tangent planes at different positions. A training criterion for such an algorithm is proposed, and experiments estimating a tangent plane prediction function are presented, showing its advantages with respect to local manifold learning algorithms: it is able to generalize very far from training data (on learning handwritten character image rotations), where local nonparametric methods fail.", "paper_title": "Nonlocal estimation of manifold structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000240668500010"}
