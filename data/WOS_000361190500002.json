Mobile robotic units, flexible and exchangeable end effectors, equipped with automated integration capabilities are used to achieve a highly reconfigurable and autonomous line as opposed to the existing fixed assembly lines, which are difficult to be reconfigured. In a study for the automotive assembly case, the benefits of the new paradigm over the traditional assembly schemes are quantified with the help of different simulated operational conditions.", "paper_title": "The new assembly system paradigm", "paper_id": "WOS:000361190500002"}
