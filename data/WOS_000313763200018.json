We define team activity recognition as the process of identifying team behaviors from traces of agent positions over time; for many physical domains, military or athletic, coordinated team behaviors create distinctive spatio-temporal patterns that can be used to identify low-level action sequences. This article focuses on the novel problem of recovering agent-to-team assignments for complex team tasks where team composition, the mapping of agents into teams, changes over time. We suggest two methods for improving the computational efficiency of the multi-agent plan recognition process in these cases of changing team composition; our proposed approach is robust to sensor observation noise and errors in behavior classification.", "paper_title": "Activity Recognition for Dynamic Multi-Agent Teams", "paper_id": "WOS:000313763200018"}
