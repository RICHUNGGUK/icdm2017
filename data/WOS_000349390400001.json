This article experimentally analyses the behavior of different decision tree-based hierarchical multilabel classification methods based on the local and global classification approaches. The approaches are compared using distinct hierarchy-based and distance-based evaluation measures, when they are applied to a variation of real multilabel and hierarchical datasets' characteristics. Also, the different evaluation measures investigated are compared according to their degrees of consistency, discriminancy, and indifferency. As a result of the experimental analysis, we recommend the use of the global classification approach and suggest the use of the Hierarchical Precision and Hierarchical Recall evaluation measures.", "paper_title": "AN EXTENSIVE EVALUATION OF DECISION TREE-BASED HIERARCHICAL MULTILABEL CLASSIFICATION METHODS AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000349390400001"}
