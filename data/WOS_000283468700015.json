Crack identification is one of the most important aspects in structural health monitoring, because the collapses of concrete bridges are mostly due to occurrence and propagation of initial cracks. In this paper, metal wire has been adopted to form a regular crack detecting network on concrete structures. The method along with the related system has the ability to real time monitor the occurrence, propagation, length and location of initial crack on the surface of concrete structures.", "paper_title": "A CRACK MONITORING METHOD FOR CONCRETE STRUCTURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000283468700015"}
