In this paper, we present a novel framework for teaching performance evaluation based on the combination of fuzzy AHP and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. Specifically, after determining the factors and sub-factors, the teaching performance index system was established. In the index system, the factor and sub-factor weights were then estimated by the extent analysis fuzzy AHP method. Employing the fuzzy AHP method in group decision-making can facilitate a consensus of decision-makers and reduce uncertainty. On the basis of the system, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method was employed to evaluate teaching performance. A case application was also used to illustrate the proposed framework. The application of this framework can make the evaluation results more scientific, accurate, and objective. It is expected that this work may serve as an assistance tool for managers of higher education institutions in improving the educational quality level. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
