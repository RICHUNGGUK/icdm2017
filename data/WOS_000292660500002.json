We explored how multimedia-mediated disclosure of informed consent prior to surgery influenced the learning process and learning outcomes of patients. A total of 107 samples were obtained from patients with degenerative knee arthritis. Our research indicated that multimedia-mediated disclosure outperformed other more traditional method in that it enhanced learning, interest, remembering, comprehension, and satisfaction. Also learning motivation and interest were positively and strongly correlated with perceived comprehension and satisfaction. Furthermore, learning interest was more influential in improving the process than was learning motivation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
