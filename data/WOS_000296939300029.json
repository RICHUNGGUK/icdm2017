Conventional stereotactic frame-based or fiducial-based approaches provide accurate registration but are not patient-friendly. This study proposes a frameless cranial IGS system that uses computer vision techniques to replace the frame or fiducials by with the natural features of the patient. To perform a cranial surgery with the proposed system, the facial surface of the patient is first reconstructed by stereo vision. Accuracy is ensured by capturing parallel-line patterns projected from a calibrated LCD projector. Meanwhile, another facial surface is reconstructed from preoperative CT images of the patient. A proposed Marker-added ICP algorithm (M-ICP) is then used to register the two facial-data sets, which brings the anatomical information from the CT images to the physical space. Compared with the adaptive ICP algorithm [8], experimental results reveal that the M-ICP algorithm is more practical and the registration accuracy is under 3-mm target registration error. Moreover, optical-based spatial digitizing devices can be integrated to further enhance surgical navigation. Anatomical information or image-guided surgical landmarks can be projected onto the patient by the projector to obtain an immersive augmented-reality environment.", "paper_title": "A MEDICAL AUGMENTED-REALITY SYSTEM FOR IMAGE-GUIDED SURGERY USING MARKER-ADDED ICP", "paper_id": "WOS:000296939300029"}
