Recent studies have suggested that such networks might contain selfish nodes, which develop their strategies by considering only their own objectives. Extremely selfish nodes, called free-riders, might even refuse to share their resources with the network, thus making overlay service unavailable to the nodes that depend on them. The authors use a game-theoretic approach to evaluate the selfish-node mechanism and increase quality of service (QoS) by detecting and excluding free-riders.", "paper_title": "Increasing QoS in selfish overlay networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237731900004"}
