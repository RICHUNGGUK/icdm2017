It also embraces an Internet based subsystem for remote monitoring and controlling of the WSNs. Different from existing platforms and interfaces, our design is general, extensible and not constrained for specific applications. More importantly, it paves the way for improving the data processing efficiency and avoiding data execution congestion. It proposes the idea utilizing the advantages of existing professional mathematical software tools, such as Matlab, Mathematica and Maple, to process the WSN data. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
