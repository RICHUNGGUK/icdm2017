Recently, a primal-dual neural network based on linear variational inequalities (LVI) was developed by Zhang et al. for the online solution of linear-programming (LP) and quadratic-programming (QP) problems simultaneously subject to equality, inequality and bound constraints. For the final purpose of field programmable gate array (FPGA) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) realization, we investigate in this paper the MATLAB Simulink modeling and simulative verification of such an LVI-based primal-dual neural network (LVI-PDNN). By using click-and-drag mouse operations in MATLAB Simulink environment, we could quickly model and simulate complicated dynamic systems. Modeling and simulative results substantiate the theoretical analysis and efficacy of the LVI-PDNN for solving online the linear and quadratic programs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
