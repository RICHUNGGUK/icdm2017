Nevertheless, inductive techniques can ease the adaptation knowledge acquisition bottleneck by enabling useful knowledge to be elicited from the case-base (CB). Application of neural networks that use the knowledge available in the CB to (i) generate a desired mapping from differences between a query and retrieved cases, (ii) to minimise those differences and hence (iii) to adapt retrieved cases so that an optimal solution to a query is found is studied in this paper. This adaptation method is suitable for CBR systems that use numerical-valued attributes for describing a case.", "paper_title": "Case-based adaptation for product formulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000266246200004"}
