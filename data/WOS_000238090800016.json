It allows programmers to create interactive, dynamic web applications with state on a high level of abstraction. The key element of this toolkit is the Data element. An Data element can be regarded as a self-contained object that stores values of a specified type. Generic programming techniques enable the automatic generation of HTML-forms from these types. These forms can be plugged into the web application. The Data elements can be interconnected. Complicated form dependencies can be defined in a pure functional, type safe, declarative programming style. This liberates the programmer from lots of low-level HTML programming and form handling. We illustrate the descriptive power of the toolkit by means of a small, yet complicated example: a project administration. The Data Toolkit is an excellent demonstration of the expressive power of modern generic (poly-typical) programming techniques.", "paper_title": "iData for the world wide web - Programming interconnected web forms", "paper_id": "WOS:000238090800016"}
