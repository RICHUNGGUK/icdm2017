FT-MPI provides the fault-tolerance necessary at this scale, but presents some issues when crossing multiple administrative domains. Using the H2O metacomputing framework, we add cross-administrative domain inter-operability and \"pluggability\" to FT-MPI. The latter feature allows us, using proxies, to transparently replace one vulnerable module - its name service - with fault-tolerant replacements. We present an algorithm for improving performance of operations over the proxies. We evaluate its performance in a comparison using the original name service, OpenL-DAP and current Emory research project HDNS.", "paper_title": "FT-MPI, fault-tolerant metacomputing and generic name services: A case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000241557200014"}
