It uses two unobtrusive psychophysiological measures to penetrate people's emotional space: heart rate variability and the variability of the fundamental frequency of the pitch of the voice. In addition, two experiments are described that validate these measures. Future systems can utilize such technology to sense people's emotions and adopt suitable persuasion strategies.", "paper_title": "Communication and persuasion technology: Psychophysiology of emotions and user-profiling", "paper_id": "WOS:000238092800021"}
