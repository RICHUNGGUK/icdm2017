Using Wilcoxon signed rank test we showed that VLA outperformed PLS by producing models with statistically superior results for a structurally diverse set of compounds comprising eight chemical families. Thus, CoMFA/VLA models are successful in prediction of the endocrine disrupting potential of environmental pollutants and can be effectively applied for testing of prospective chemicals prior their exposure to the environment.
