In this paper, we discuss some questions regarding the definition of a general framework for evaluation of symbol recognition methods. The discussion is centered on three key elements in performance evaluation: test data, evaluation metrics and protocols of evaluation. As a result of this discussion we state some general principles to be taken into account for the definition of such a framework. Finally, we describe the application of this framework to the organization of the first contest on symbol recognition in GREC'03, along with the results obtained by the participants.", "paper_title": "A general framework for the evaluation of symbol recognition methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000247734900006"}
