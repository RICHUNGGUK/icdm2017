GL-APA is derived from the M-estimationbased nonlinear cost function extended for evaluating multiple error signals dealt with in the affine projection algorithm (APA). By considering the non-linearity of the gradient, we carefully formulate an update equation consistent with multiple input-output relationships, which the conventional APA inherently satisfies to achieve fast convergence. We also newly introduce a scaling rule for the nonlinearity, so we can easily implement GL-APA by using a predetermined primary function as a basis of scaling with any projection order. This guarantees a linkage between GL-APA and the gradientlimited normalized least-mean-squares algorithm (OL-NLMS), which is a conventional algorithm that corresponds to the GL-APA of the first order. The performance of GL-APA is demonstrated with simulation results.", "paper_title": "Gradient-limited affine projection algorithm for double-talk-robust and fast-converging acoustic echo cancellation", "paper_id": "WOS:000245194000012"}
