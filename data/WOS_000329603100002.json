In most of these hybridizations, the PSO uses the Global topology. However, other topologies were designed to improve the performance of the PSO. In the literature, it is well known that the performance of the PSO depends on its topology, and there is not a best topology for all problems. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the effect of eight PSO topologies on performance of the PSO-ELM. The results showed empirically that the Global topology was more promising than all other topologies in optimizing the PSO-ELM according to the root mean squared error (RMSE) on the validation set in most of the evaluated datasets. However, no correlation was detected between this good performance on the RMSE and the testing accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
