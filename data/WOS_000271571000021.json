The SEM components examined include condenser lens I and 2 and objective lens (coarse and fine) referred to as CL1, CL2, OL-Coarse, and OL-Fine. For a systematic modeling of SEM resolution (R), a face-centered Box-Wilson experiment was conducted. Two sets of data were collected with or without the adjustment of magnification. Root-mean-squared prediction error of optimized GRNN models are GA 0.481 and 1.96 x 10(-12) for non-adjusted and adjusted data, respectively. The optimized models demonstrated a much improved prediction over statistical regression models. The optimized models were used to optimize parameters particularly under best tuned SEM environment. For the variations in CL2 and OL-Coarse, the highest R could be achieved at all conditions except a larger CL2 either at smaller or larger OL-Coarse. For the variations in CL1 and CL2, the highest R was obtained at all conditions but larger CL2 and smaller CL1. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
