A graph is 2-realizable if and only if it is a partial 2-tree, i.e., a subgraph of the 2-sum of triangles in the sense of graph theory. We show that a graph is 3-realizable if and only if it does not have K-5 or the 1-skeleton of the octahedron as a minor.", "paper_title": "Realizability of graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000244453300001"}
