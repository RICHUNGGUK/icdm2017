However, unlike traditional social and work groups, very little research has addressed the individual and collective characteristics influencing MOSN group membership decisions. This paper is concerned with the roles of leader and member personality and values characteristics in the formation of MOSN groups. Using data from 583 MOSN group members (including 38 leaders), we investigated three hypotheses concerning: 1) the presence of personality and values homogeneity, 2) the congruence between leader and member personality and values, and 3) whether leadership style is related to modal personality and values. We found partial support for all three hypotheses, which implies that MOSN group membership decisions are related to the personality and values traits of the leader. Findings suggest that in a clicks-and-mortar organization, an IS functional manager may consider enlisting personnel having the traits desired of the MOSN group membership to serve as the group leader. Furthermore, replacing the leaders of strategically important MOSN groups should be done with regard to personality and values continuity, since likely changes in the composition of the group may also change its strategic orientation.
