Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected from 506 participants in South Korea, where convergence home robots with a combination of multiple functions have rapidly penetrated the marketplace. A hierarchical moderated regression model was employed in order to analyze the data. Findings - The results show that functional, epistemic, and emotional values are important factors affecting intentions to purchase convergence home robots. In addition, consumers' innovativeness shows a moderating effect on the relationship between emotional value and purchase intentions. This result showed that the effect of emotional value has a greater influence on purchase intentions for the high consumer innovativeness group than for the low consumer innovativeness group. Practical implications - Marketers should focus not only on functional value, but also on the hedonic value represented by the emotional value, as well as the epistemic value that convergence home robots. provide, especially to innovative consumers in the marketplace. Consumer innovativeness is a useful variable to divide value-based segments in convergence products. Originality/value - As technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, the convergence of technology has shifted people's lifestyles. However, it was not until a few years ago that convergence products were investigated. It is necessary for researchers to understand the factors influencing intentions to purchase convergence products, as well as the consumption value and consumer innovativeness that consumers place on these products in order to accurately direct marketing efforts. This paper contributes to that understanding.", "paper_title": "The consumption values and consumer innovativeness on convergence products", "paper_id": "WOS:000308336300001"}
