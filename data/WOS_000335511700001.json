Best practice guidelines for the mesh generation of stretched boundary layer grids exist for the finite volume or finite difference discretizations. A similar resolution of boundary layers with DG schemes can be achieved with a coarser grid because of the subgrid resolution of the DG scheme. High order schemes incorporate the possibility of high order element mappings, resulting in different resolution properties inside the element. In this paper, we show that the use of an internal element mapping in combination with a stretched grid can be used to reduce the error of the boundary layer approximation by an order of magnitude in comparison with the classical linear internal element mapping. The boundary layer is modeled by a one-dimensional singular perturbation problem. In addition, we discuss the construction of the element mappings by interpolation and investigate the limits of the stretching function such that the resulting element Jacobian remains positive. A parameter study shows the influence of the element mapping for different polynomial degrees on the solution.
