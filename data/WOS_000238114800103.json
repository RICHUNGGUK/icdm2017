In this paper, we suggest a multicast OLSP (Optical Label Switched Path) establishment mechanism for supporting high bandwidth multicast services. For the establishment of the multicast OLSP, we propose a new multicast tree generation algorithm VS-MIMR (Virtual Source-based Minimum Interference Multicast Routing) that finds the minimum interference path between virtual source nodes. We also suggest an entire OVPN control mechanism to adapt the operation of the routing and signaling protocols of GMPLS.", "paper_title": "Multicast OLSP establishment scheme in OWN over IP/GMPLS over DWDM", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800103"}
