The original cover image can be recovered without any distortion after data extraction if the stego-image remains intact, and conversely, the hidden data can still be extracted correctly if the stego-image goes through JPEG compression to some extent. A cover image is divided into a number of non-overlapping blocks, and the arithmetic difference of each block is calculated. By shifting the arithmetic difference value, we can embed bits into the blocks. The shift quantity and shifting rule are fixed for all blocks, and reversibility is achieved. Furthermore, because the bit-0- and bit-1-zones are separated and the particularity of the arithmetic differences, minor changes applied to the stego-image generated by non-malicious attacks such as JPEG compression will not cause the bit-0- and bit-1-zones to overlap, and robustness is achieved. The new embedding mechanism can enhance embedding capacity and the addition of a threshold can make the algorithm more robust. Experimental results showed that, compared with previous schemes, the performance of the proposed scheme is significantly improved.", "paper_title": "Robust lossless data hiding scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000275537900003"}
