Moreover, most of the current techniques are either too complex to be applied on a large amount of data or miss the extraction of vital security insights for forensic purposes. In this paper, we elaborate a software framework for spam campaign detection, analysis and investigation. The proposed framework identifies spam campaigns on-the-fly. Additionally, it labels and scores the campaigns as well as gathers various information about them. The elaborated framework provides law enforcement officials with a powerful platform to conduct investigations on cyber-based criminal activities. (C) 2015 The Authors.
