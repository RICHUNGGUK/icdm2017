A new categorical motivation for lattice-valued frames is given from presheaves, and then, under the assumption that L be a complete chain, it is established that standard category-theoretic properties (completeness, cocompleteness, factorization structures) hold for L-Frm (the category of L-frames and L-frame morphisms), properties which are a platform for the \"upper\" free functor L and \"lower\" free functor R used in Part II to give a broad range of applications of chain-valued frames to lattice-valued topology.
