Based on a reliable and valid scale of Internet addiction, the purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of the general population of Internet addiction with psychometric evidence and to identify associated psychosocial and health consequences. Out of a representative survey of the German population (N = 2512) the leisure time Internet users (n = 1382) were queried by standardised questionnaires on Internet addiction, depression, anxiety (HADS) and depersonalisation (CDS-2). According to strict criteria of the Assessment of Internet and Computer Game Addiction (AICA-S), 2.1% of the sample was characterised as addicted by meeting criteria of craving, withdrawal symptoms, tolerance, etc. These reported daily Internet use, excessive online times. The majority reported additional adverse psychosocial and health consequences. Risk factors were male gender and social factors (unmarried, unemployment, students, low income). Online gambling, social networks, gaming chats and pornography were preferentially used by Internet addicts. Assessment of Internet addiction requires a multifaceted approach; the AICA-S is an instrument suitable for further epidemiological study.", "paper_title": "Prevalence of internet addiction in the general population: results from a German population-based survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000337355700009"}
