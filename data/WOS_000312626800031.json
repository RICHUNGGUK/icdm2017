The y-scrambling method was used to test if there is a chance correlation in the developed SVM model. In the meantime, five-fold cross validation of these machine learning methods results in the prediction accuracies of 87.2-92.5% for hPXR activators and 73.8-87.8% for hPXR non-activators, and the prediction accuracies for external test set are 93.8-95.8% for hPXR activators and 86.7-92.8% for hPXR non-activators. Our study suggested that the tested machine learning methods are potentially useful for hPXR activators identification. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
