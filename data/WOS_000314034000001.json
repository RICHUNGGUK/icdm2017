Subsequently we give the classification of the Novikov algebras of dimension 3 over and , as well as the classification of the 4-dimensional Novikov algebras over whose associated Lie algebra is nilpotent. In particular this includes a list of all 4-dimensional commutative associative algebras over .", "paper_title": "Classification of Novikov algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000314034000001"}
