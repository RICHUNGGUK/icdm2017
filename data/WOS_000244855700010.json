Compared with the first derivative-based edge detectors such as Sobel operator, the Laplacian operator may yield better results in edge localization. Unfortunately, the Laplacian operator is very sensitive to noise. In this paper, based on the Laplacian operator, a model is introduced for making some edge detectors. Also, the optimal threshold is introduced for obtaining a Maximum a Posteriori ( MAP) estimate of edges.", "paper_title": "Laplacian operator-based edge detectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000244855700010"}
