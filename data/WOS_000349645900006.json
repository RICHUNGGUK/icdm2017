The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the continuous search for new alternative solutions to prevent or alleviate these concerns. It particularly deals with the development of decision support system based on a data fusion for the management and control of traffic at signalized intersections. The role of such systems is to manage the existing infrastructure to ease congestion and respond to crises. The proposed system is based on multi-detector data fusion, a data processing function that combines imperfect information collected from systems involving several detectors. The developed system is then tested on a virtual junction, and the results obtained are reported and discussed. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a new traffic light control based on multi-detectors data fusion theory. The system uses a new multi-detectors data fusion method for traffic data analysis. Moreover, the system integrates a method for the estimation of the reliability degree of different detectors taking into account their imperfection and the conflict between them. These estimated reliability degrees are combined using Dempster's rule of combination. Findings - The paper provides a decision support system for traffic regulation at intersection based on multi-sensors. It suggests the fusion of captured data by many sensors for measuring information. The system use the Belief Functions Theory for information fusion and decision making using combination and decision rules. Originality/value - The paper proposes a new Adaptive Traffic Control System based on a new data fusion approach that include a method for the estimation of the reliability degree of different detectors taking into account their imperfection and the conflict between them. These estimated reliability degrees are combined using Dempster's rule of combination.", "paper_title": "Decision fusion for signalized intersection control", "paper_id": "WOS:000349645900006"}
