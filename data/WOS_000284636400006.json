By reducing the input grey degree we optimise the input of the neural network to make it more rational for learning and training of neural networks. Simulation results verified the efficiency of the proposed algorithm by comparing its performance with that of FBBP and classic back-propagation (BP). The results showed that the proposed algorithm has the characteristics of fast training and strong ability of generalisation and it is an effective learning method.", "paper_title": "A kind of BP neural network algorithm based on grey interval", "paper_id": "WOS:000284636400006"}
