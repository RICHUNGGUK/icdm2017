Compared with attribute based signature (ABS), ASBS is more flexible and efficient in managing user attributes and specifying signing policies. We present a practical construction of ASBS and prove its security in the standard model under three subgroup decision related assumptions. Its efficiency is comparable to that of the most efficient ABS scheme.", "paper_title": "Attribute Set Based Signature Secure in the Standard Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000354983500014"}
