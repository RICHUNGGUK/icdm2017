This paper introduces a system for monitoring regional frequencies in power grid developed as an advanced research project for intelligent wide-area protective relaying in South Korea. The system is implemented by modeling an actual 345 kV transmission system of South Korea using EMTP-RV and by measuring voltages and currents at five regions. The frequencies are estimated using our previous proposed method, a frequency estimation algorithm with gain compensation. The monitoring system implemented is used to examine frequency propagation effects and various fault conditions. Simulation results showed that the proposed system could achieve good performance regarding the frequency monitoring under both steady states and dynamic fault conditions.", "paper_title": "A frequency monitoring system development for wide-area power grid protection", "paper_id": "WOS:000319747200002"}
