This paper shows a method to classify non-geometric terrain properties using image sequences obtained from onboard cameras. Our method is based on a Dynamic Texture analysis, which is a technique to estimate scene motion in image sequences. Using Dynamic Textures, we can incorporate a motion cue to classify not only soil types but also the velocities of a rover relative to terrain surface representing slippage due to terrains. First, we briefly show a learning algorithm for Dynamic Textures. Then we propose a combined distance measure for classification. Combining distance measures is useful to handle different properties of terrain, that is, a static property such as soil types and a dynamic property such as the velocities. The effectiveness of the combined distance measure for improving classification performance is demonstrated through experimental runs of two rover testbeds on sand pits. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
