The TOJ paradigm is important to understanding how the body image is dynamically sustained in our daily life. Our aim is to show one possible example of how the TOJ deficit could be consistently expressed in the dynamical systems framework. According to the study reported by Yamamoto and Kitazawa, using the genetic algorithm, we reconstruct the crossed-hand effect with a recurrent neural network, and show that it was caused by slow relaxation dynamics near the critical point in our model agent. Moreover, by using the same agent, we demonstrate the occurrence of the deficit in response to three successive stimuli which may help reveal the mechanism of TOJ deficit in the real human case.", "paper_title": "Dynamical Systems Interpretation of Reversal of Subjective Temporal Order Due to Arm Crossing", "paper_id": "WOS:000280926600001"}
