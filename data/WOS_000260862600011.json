As its color features, color autocorrelograms of the hue and saturation component images in HSV color space are used. As its texture features, BDIP and BVLC moments of the value component image are adopted. The color and texture features are extracted in multiresolution wavelet domain and combined. The dimension of the combined feature vector is determined at a point where the retrieval accuracy becomes saturated. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields higher retrieval accuracy than some conventional methods even though its feature vector dimension is not higher than those of the latter for six test DBs. Especially, it demonstrates more excellent retrieval accuracy for queries and target images of various resolutions. In addition, the proposed method almost always shows performance gain in precision versus recall and in ANMRR over the other methods.", "paper_title": "Content-Based Image Retrieval Using Multiresolution Color and Texture Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000260862600011"}
