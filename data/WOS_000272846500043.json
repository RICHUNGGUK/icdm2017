The intrusion of spam e-mails persecute the users and waste the network resources. Traditionally, machine learning and statistical filtering systems are used to filter out spam e-mails. However, there is no unique method can be successfully applied to classify spam e-mails. It is necessary to apply multiple approaches to detect spam and effectively filter out the increasing volumes of spam e-mails. In this paper, an ensemble approach, based on decision tree, support vector machine and back-propagation network, is applied to classify spam e-mails. The proposed approach is based on the characteristics of the spam e-mails. The spam e-mails are categorized into 14 features and then the ensemble approach is performed to classify them. From simulation results, the proposed ensemble approach outperforms other approaches for two test datasets. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
