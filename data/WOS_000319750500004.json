An analytical expression is developed for the availability of such systems having operational stages, and a necessary and sufficient condition is derived for a non-trivial optimal rate of periodic maintenance to exist. Numerical procedures for finding the optimal rate of periodic maintenance are given, and examples are presented.", "paper_title": "Optimal Preventive Maintenance Rate for Best Availability With Hypo-Exponential Failure Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000319750500004"}
