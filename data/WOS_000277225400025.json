However, such inter-population LD differences can be leveraged to narrow the search for common causal variants responsible for the association signals observed. The ability to assess and quantify LD variations among populations is thus expected to contribute to both replication and. ne-mapping stages of GWAS.", "paper_title": "varLD: a program for quantifying variation in linkage disequilibrium patterns between populations", "paper_id": "WOS:000277225400025"}
