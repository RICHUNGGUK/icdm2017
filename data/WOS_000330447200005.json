A Hilbert-style axiomatization of ECTL is defined by adding the schemata for all G(phi -> epsilon ) -> (there exists GF phi -> there exists GF epsilon), there exists GF phi <-> there exists F(phi boolean AND there exists X there exists GF phi), for all G(phi -> there exists X there exists F epsilon) -> (epsilon -> there exists GF phi) and for all FG phi <-> is not an element of there exists GF is not an element of phi to the axioms of CTL. We prove its soundness and completeness with respect to arbitrary and finite models, i.e. equivalence of the following three conditions: (i) phi is provable in this axiomatization of ECTL; (ii) phi is valid in any model; (iii) phi is valid in any finite model.", "paper_title": "An axiomatization of ECTL", "paper_id": "WOS:000330447200005"}
