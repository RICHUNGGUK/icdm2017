Both the image and the edge variables are incorporated by coupling them into two different PDEs. It is shown that the initial-boundary value problem has global in time dissipative solutions (in a sense going back to P.-L. Lions), and several properties of these solutions are established. Some numerical examples are given to highlight the denoising nature of the proposed model along with some comparison results.", "paper_title": "On a System of Adaptive Coupled PDEs for Image Restoration", "paper_id": "WOS:000329234700003"}
