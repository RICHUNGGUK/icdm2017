Flood management systems involve a variety of complexities, such as multiple uncertainties, dynamic variations, and policy implications. This paper presents an inexact probabilistic-possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients (IPP-FRC) model for flood management in a hybrid uncertain environment. IPP-FRC is capable not only of tackling multiple uncertainties in the form of intervals with fuzzy random boundaries but of addressing the dynamic complexity through capacity expansion planning within a multi-region, multi-flood-level, and multi-option context. The possibility and necessity measures used in IPP-FRC are suitable for risk-seeking and risk-averse decision making, respectively. A case study is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology for facilitating flood management. The results indicate that the inexact degrees of possibility and necessity would decrease with increased probabilities of occurrence, implying a potential tradeoff between fulfillment of objectives and associated risks. A number of decision alternatives can be obtained under different policy scenarios. They are helpful for decision makers to formulate the appropriate flood management policy according to practical situations. The performance of IPP-FRC is analyzed and compared with a possibilitybased fractile model.", "paper_title": "An Inexact Probabilistic-Possibilistic Optimization Framework for Flood Management in a Hybrid Uncertain Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000359262400014"}
