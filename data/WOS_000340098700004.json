These protocols can be applied under any global, clustered, or partitioned job-level fixed-priority scheduler and support mutual exclusion, reader-writer exclusion, and k-exclusion constraints. Notably, the reader-writer and k-exclusion protocols are the first analytically-sound suspension-based multiprocessor real-time locking protocols of their kind. To formalize a notion of \"optimal blocking,\" precise definitions of what constitutes \"blocking\" in a multiprocessor real-time system are given and a simple complexity metric for real-time locking protocols, called maximum priority-inversion blocking (pi-blocking), is introduced. It is shown that, in a system with m processors, Omega(m) maximum pi-blocking is unavoidable. This bound is shown to be asymptotically tight with the introduction of the O(m) multiprocessor locking protocol (OMLP) family presented herein, which includes protocols that ensure an upper bound on maximum pi-blocking that is approximately within a factor of two of the lower bound. In addition to the coarse-grained asymptotic bounds, detailed blocking bounds suitable for schedulability analysis are derived using holistic blocking analysis. Based on the detailed bounds, the proposed locking protocols are compared with each other and with previously-proposed protocols in an empirical schedulability study involving more than one billion task sets. In this study, the OMLP was found to perform better than two variants of the classic (but non-optimal) multiprocessor priority-ceiling protocol (MPCP).", "paper_title": "The OMLP family of optimal multiprocessor real-time locking protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000340098700004"}
