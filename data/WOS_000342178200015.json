These algorithms are implemented in a large-scale distributed environment to scale to massive data sets. To accelerate these large-scale graph-based iterative computations, we propose delta-based accumulative iterative computation (DAIC). Different from traditional iterative computations, which iteratively update the result based on the result from the previous iteration, DAIC updates the result by accumulating the \"changes'' between iterations. By DAIC, we can process only the \"changes'' to avoid the negligible updates. Furthermore, we can perform DAIC asynchronously to bypass the high-cost synchronous barriers in heterogeneous distributed environments. Based on the DAIC model, we design and implement an asynchronous graph processing framework, Maiter. We evaluate Maiter on local cluster as well as on Amazon EC2 Cloud. The results show that Maiter achieves as much as 60x speedup over Hadoop and outperforms other state-of-the-art frameworks.", "paper_title": "Maiter: An Asynchronous Graph Processing Framework for Delta-Based Accumulative Iterative Computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000342178200015"}
