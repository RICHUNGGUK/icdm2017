Adopting a comprehensive view of IT investments disclosure mechanisms, we found that IT disclosure quality was positively associated with information quality. Specifically, our results showed that an increase in quantitative information in IT disclosure could improve the information environment in the market, thereby reducing the perception of information risk among market participants. We also found that managers' disclosures were less quantitative when the IT investment was more asset-specific in relation to higher agency costs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
