In this paper, we develop explicit recursive representations for multiserver tandem queues with blocking. We demonstrate the application of these recursive representations with simulations of large-scale tandem queueing networks. We compare the computational efficiency of these representations with two other popular discrete-event simulation approaches, namely, event scheduling and process interaction. Experimental results show that these representations are seven (or more) times faster than their counterparts based on the event-scheduling and process-interaction approaches.", "paper_title": "Generalized Lindley-Type Recursive Representations for Multiserver Tandem Queues with Blocking", "paper_id": "WOS:000284937900004"}
