This problem can be formulated as an optimization problem by taking user equilibrium as a constraint. A min-max bilevel program is formulated for a signal-setting problem. A new hybrid search heuristic is proposed to exploit the maximum capacity of road network using delay-minimizing signal settings. For a road network with maximum capacity, a tractable computation scheme is presented to effectively determine a delay-minimizing signal-setting. Numerical computations are performed at two benchmark signal-controlled road networks. The proposed heuristic has been demonstrated successfully to solve the min-max signal-setting problem. As compared to conventional alternatives, the proposed heuristic has been empirically demonstrated highly effective in terms of delay rate reduction. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
