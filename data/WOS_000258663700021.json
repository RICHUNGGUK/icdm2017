The problem is reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations that are solved by the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Numerical results of coupled Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations, coupled modified KdV equations, coupled KdV system and Boussinesq system are obtained. The present results are in good agreement with the exact solutions. Moreover, the method can be applied to a wide class of coupled nonlinear evolution equations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
