Using the functionals of TB09 we calculated the band gaps of some semiconductors and compared the results with previous calculations and experiments. We showed that combining GGA pseudo-potential with TB09 functionals would improve greatly the band gaps compared with the GGA calculations. The details of our implementation and code samples are also given. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
