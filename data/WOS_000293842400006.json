The contribution consists of two aspects. First, compared with the existing techniques which apply a single state feedback law, the feedback MPC is utilised, which applies a sequence of feedback control laws. Second, for systems with input delay, an augmented polytopic uncertainty description is invoked to remove the input delay. By feedback MPC, the conservativeness of the traditional MPC is reduced. By the augmented system description, the difficulties in handling the input delay, such as inability to deal with some unstable system matrices in the previous robust MPC literature, are overcome. Two simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Constrained feedback robust model predictive control for polytopic uncertain systems with time delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000293842400006"}
