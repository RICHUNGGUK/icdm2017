The heart of our method is a guided topology editing algorithm. Given a source model and a user-provided target shape, the algorithm modifies the source so that the resulting model is topologically consistent with the target. Our algorithm permits removing or adding various topological features (e.g., handles, cavities and islands) in a common framework and ensures that each topological change is made by minimal modification to the source model. To create the target shape, we have also designed a convenient 2D sketching interface for drawing 3D line skeletons. As demonstrated in a suite of examples, the use of sketching allows more accurate removal of topological artifacts than previous methods, and enables creative designs with specific topological goals.", "paper_title": "Editing the topology of 3D models by sketching", "paper_id": "WOS:000248914000045"}
