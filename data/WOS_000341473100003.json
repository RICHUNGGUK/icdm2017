We review prior literature and derive a model of trust transfer and continued usage. Our results show that trust in the public e-service mediates the influence of both trust in the public administration and trust in the Internet on continuance intentions. Trust was influenced by e-service quality and recommendations from public administrations and interpersonal sources. The relationship between interpersonal recommendations and trust in the e-service was nonsignificant; we found a strong moderating influence of time consciousness. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
