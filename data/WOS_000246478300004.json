These diagrams can help understand the specification for stakeholders who are not familiar with the B method, such as customers or certification authorities. The paper first discusses some rules for a preliminary derivation of a class diagram. It then studies the consistency of the concepts preliminarily identified from an object oriented point of view. A formal concept analysis technique is used to distinguish between consistent classes, attributes, associations and operations. The proposed technique is to incrementally add operations to the formal specification which automatically result in evolutions of the class diagram.", "paper_title": "Object oriented concepts identification from formal B specifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000246478300004"}
