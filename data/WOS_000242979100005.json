Although several clustering algorithms have been proposed to deal with marketing segmentation problems, a soundly method seems to be limited. In this paper, support vector clustering (SVC) is used for marketing segmentation. A case study of a drink company is used to demonstrate the proposed method and compared with the k-means and the self-organizing feature map (SOFM) methods. On the basis of the numerical results, we can conclude that SVC outperforms the other methods in marketing segmentation.
