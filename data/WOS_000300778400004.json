We use jitter-free probability as the main performance metric to study Quality of Data delivery (QoD). A new model that incorporates both bandwidth and data availability of P2P network is proposed. Our model relies on a sharing factor that models data availability among all peers. We simulate on a minimalistic network to demonstrate how to apply the analytical model to design a P2P video streaming system with a very low jitter rate. Our simulation experimental results reveal that the lower bound on jitter-free probability is indeed effective to reflect the QoD of the entire system. Our model captures the impact of many design choices, including upload bandwidth limit, peer selection strategies, and video stream chunking schemes.", "paper_title": "Quality of Data Delivery in Peer-to-Peer Video Streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000300778400004"}
