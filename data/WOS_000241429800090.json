Liquid crystal spatial light modulators (SLM) on transmission and on reflection modes with different resolutions were investigated. A good match between numerical simulation and optically reconstructed holograms on both SLMs was observed. The resolution of the optically reconstructed images was comparable to the resolution of the SLMs.", "paper_title": "Reconstruction of computer generated holograms by spatial light modulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800090"}
