Given the linear primary structure of genetic material, this process is natural to study from a theoretical perspective using formal language theory. We abstract the process of genetic transposition to operations on languages and study it combinatorially and computationally. It is shown that the power of such systems is large relative to the classic Chomsky Hierarchy. However, we are still able to algorithmically determine whether or not a string is a possible product of the iterated application of the operations.", "paper_title": "Theoretical and computational properties of transpositions", "paper_id": "WOS:000291060900010"}
