Reproducible computational research, in which all details of computations-code and data-are made conveniently available to others, is a necessary response to this crisis. The authors review their approach to reproducible research and describe how it has evolved over time, discussing the arguments for and against working reproducibly.", "paper_title": "Reproducible Research in Computational Harmonic Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000261998800003"}
