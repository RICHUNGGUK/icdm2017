Series of analyses were performed to determine the optimum architecture of utilized methods using the trial and error process. Several ANNs and ANFISs are constructed, trained and validated to predict p wave in the investigated carbonate reservoir. A comparative study on prediction of p wave by ANN and ANFIS is addressed, and the quality of the target prediction was quantified in terms of the mean-squared errors (MSEs), correlation coefficient (R (2)) and prediction efficiency error. ANFIS with MSE of 0.0552 and R (2) of 0.9647, and ANN with MSE of 0.042 and R (2) of 0.976, showed better performance in comparison with MLR methods. ANN and ANFIS systems have performed comparably well and accurate for prediction of p wave.", "paper_title": "A comparative study of artificial neural network and adaptive neurofuzzy inference system for prediction of compressional wave velocity", "paper_id": "WOS:000342204600019"}
