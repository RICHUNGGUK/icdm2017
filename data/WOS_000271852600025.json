Using communication and network technologies, web-based learning is performed remotely, bi-directionally and interactively, beyond the limitations of time and space. Current technology enables remote access to laboratory equipment via the Internet, which is particularly useful for part-time students learning. The web-based human interface laboratory platform enables Students to access expensive or highly specialized laboratory equipment which may otherwise be unavailable to students. This article establishes user-friendly and efficient technology for interactive, and on-line laboratory experiment learning utilizing the web. In its current configuration, the proposed method provides a learning platform to students using the actual mechatronics module. Preliminary assessment of the human interface laboratory platform is encouraging and demonstrates its effectiveness in helping students understand the concepts, which is necessary to master basic technologies for developing web-based mechatronics monitoring and control systems.", "paper_title": "DEVELOPMENT OF WEB-BASED HUMAN INTERFACE LABORATORY PLATFORM FOR MECHATRONICS MODULE", "paper_id": "WOS:000271852600025"}
