The scheme is based on the L-REP decomposition, which classifies the triangular faces of a polyhedron into a set of layered tetrahedra. In the multi-LREP these layered tetrahedra are grouped into regions of a space subdivision. The paper also describes an efficient method for constructing the L-REP decomposition and how the multi-LREP can be applied to speed up two L-REP applications: the point-in-polyhedron inclusion test and the ray-scene intersection. An experimental comparison with other point-in-polyhedron tests is presented as well.", "paper_title": "The multi-LREP decomposition of solids and its application to a point-in-polyhedron inclusion test", "paper_id": "WOS:000282123700003"}
