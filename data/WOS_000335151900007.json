In this paper, we focus on communicating reliably over an additive white Gaussian noise channel using such an energy harvesting sensor node. An important part of this paper involves appropriate modeling of energy harvesting, as done via various practical architectures. Our main result is the characterization of the Shannon capacity of the communication system. The key technical challenge involves dealing with the dynamic (and stochastic) nature of the (quadratic) cost of the input to the channel. As a corollary, we find close connections between the capacity achieving energy management policies and the queueing theoretic throughput optimal policies.", "paper_title": "Capacity of Gaussian Channels With Energy Harvesting and Processing Cost", "paper_id": "WOS:000335151900007"}
