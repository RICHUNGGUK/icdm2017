This method allows for the solution of the governing differential equation to be calculated in the form of an infinite series with components which can be easily calculated. The HAM utilizes a simple method to adjust and control the convergence region of the infinite series solution by using an auxiliary parameter. The results obtained are presented, and six terms are sufficient to obtain an approximation solution that is very accurate. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
