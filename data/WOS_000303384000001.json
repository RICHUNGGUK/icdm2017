Different methods to extract sets of local and a global features from the target sample are detailed. Also a normalization by confidence voting method is used in order to decrease the final equal error rate (EER). Each set of features is processed by a single expert, and on the other approach proposed, the decisions of the individual classifiers are combined using weighted votes. Experimental results are given using a subcorpus of the large MCYT signature database for random and skilled forgeries. The results show that the weighted combination outperforms the individual classifiers significantly. The best EER obtained were 6.3 % in the case of skilled forgeries and 2.31 % in the case of random forgeries.", "paper_title": "Confidence voting method ensemble applied to off-line signature verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000303384000001"}
