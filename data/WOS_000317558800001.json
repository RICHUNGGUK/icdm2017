The spherical 3PSS-1S mechanism is a low weight and reduced dimension parallel mechanism that allows spherical movements providing the requirements needed for the serial-parallel robotic arm for needle insertion guidance. The solution of its direct kinematic is computed with a numerical method based on the Newton-Raphson formulation and a constraint function of the mechanism. The input-output velocity equation is obtained with the use of screw theory. Three types of singular postures are identified during simulations and verified in the real prototype. The 3PSS-1S can perform pure rotations of +/- 45 degrees, +/- 40 degrees, +/- 60 degrees along the x, y, z axes respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
