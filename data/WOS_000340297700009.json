The existence of bright regions and dark regions has been shown to have a serious negative impact on the performance of face recognition systems. This paper proposes a solution to this problem based on self-quotient image (SQI) processing method. In this method, bright and dark areas are processed separately without changing the essential characteristics of the image of the face. The dark and light areas are processed separately by SQI. Experimental results indicate that this Single-Light-Region and Single-Dark-Region SQI method removes the adverse effect of multi-bright and multi-dark areas better than competing methods.", "paper_title": "ILLUMINATION PROCESSING IN FACE RECOGNITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000340297700009"}
