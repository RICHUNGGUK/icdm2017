In the proposed approach, the speech/music decision rule is derived by the SVM by incorporating optimally weighted features derived from the SMV based on a minimum classification error (MCE) method. This method differs from that of the previous work in that different weights are assigned to each feature of the SMV a novel process. According to the experimental results, the proposed approach is effective for speech/music classification using the SVM.", "paper_title": "Discriminative Weight Training for Support Vector Machine-Based Speech/Music Classification in 3GPP2 SMV Codec", "paper_id": "WOS:000274505900036"}
