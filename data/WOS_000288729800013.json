To take advantage of multicore chips, multiple applications will run simultaneously. As a consequence, the traffic interferences between applications increases and the performance of individual applications can be seriously affected. In this paper, we improve the individual application performance when several applications are simultaneously running. This proposal is based on the virtualization concept and allows us to reduce execution time and network latency in a significant percentage. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
