The model uses a Gaussian noise and a refractory function to describe the stochastic membrane potential fluctuation and the refractory effect during the neural firing, respectively. The proposed model is characterized by its computation ease and efficiency. Results of the model-based simulation showed that the neural firing produced an enhanced temporal representation of the stimulus waveform at the high-rate electrical stimulation. It was also found that there was an optimal pulse width to represent the temporal structure of the stimulus waveform. The proposed model would facilitate the further investigation of AN's response to different input stimulations, and help us to develop novel electrical stimulation strategies for cochlear implants in the future.
