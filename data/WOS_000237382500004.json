Most routing protocols designed for MANETs assume connected networks. Such a restriction directly, limits the application domains of MANETs. In this paper, we study the problem of providing time-critical data delivery in sparse ad hoc networks where network partition can last for a long period, without imposing any restrictions oil the node mobility. Supporting real-time communication with unconstrained mobility is important to many mission-critical applications such as battlefields and search and rescue in large-scale disaster areas. In this paper, we propose microrouting networks consisting of tiny nodes similar to sensors but without transducers (called microrouters) as a substrate for time-critical data delivery in sparse MANETs. We describe the microrouting protocol for the resulting hybrid network which exploits the fact that microrouters are stationary, but art, constrained by, energy and memory. Key features of the microrouting protocol design include stateless architecture and localized route repair. We demonstrate the viability of the microrouting network architecture via detailed simulation evaluation. Our results show that microrouting networks running the microrouting protocol efficiently extend the connectivity of sparse MANETs and provide high packet delivery ratios.", "paper_title": "MicroRouting: A scalable and robust communication paradigm for sparse ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237382500004"}
