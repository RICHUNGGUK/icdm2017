The case study is a multiproduct batch plant for the production of four recombinant proteins. Given the important combinatorial aspect of the problem, the approach used consists in coupling a stochastic algorithm, indeed a genetic algorithm (GA) with a discrete-event simulator (DES). Another incentive to use this kind of optimization method is that, there is no easy way of calculating derivatives of the objective functions, which then discards gradient optimization methods. To take into account the conflicting situations that may be encountered at the earliest stage of batch plant design, i.e. compromise situations between cost and environmental consideration, a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) was developed with a Pareto optimal ranking method. The results show how the methodology can be used to find a range of trade-off solutions for optimizing batch plant design. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
