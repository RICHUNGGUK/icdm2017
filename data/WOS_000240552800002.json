It is shown that acceleration feedback allows an exact tracking of the motor position, irrespective of the non-linear flexibilities of the axes and of the measurement disturbances. This easy-to-tune algorithm whose main control parameters are the modal masses of the motor and load part, and only consists of a positive acceleration feedback plus a PD controller, has been validated on an industrial robot with orthogonal axes.", "paper_title": "Control of an industrial robot using acceleration feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000240552800002"}
