However, the widespread use of video surveillance violates the privacy rights of the people. Many authors have addressed the privacy issues from various points of view. In this paper we propose a novel, on-demand selectively revocable, privacy preserving mechanism. The surveillance video can be tuned to view with complete privacy or by revoking the privacy of any subset of pedestrians while ensuring complete privacy to the remaining pedestrians. We achieve this by tracking the pedestrians using a novel Markov chain algorithm with two hidden states, detecting the head contour of the tracked pedestrians and obscuring their faces using an encryption mechanism. The detected pedestrian face/head is obscured by encrypting with a unique key derived from a master key for the privacy preservation purpose. The performance evaluations on many challenging surveillance scenarios show that the proposed mechanism can effectively and robustly track as well as identify multiple pedestrians and obscure/unobscure their faces/head in real time.", "paper_title": "Privacy enabled video surveillance using a two state Markov tracking algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000300669000006"}
