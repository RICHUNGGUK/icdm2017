The popularity of video streaming, however, places a burden on the underlying network infrastructure. This is because it needs to be capable of delivering significant amounts of data in a time-critical manner to users. The Video-on-Demand (VoD) distribution paradigm uses a unicast independent flow for each user request. This results in multiple duplicate flows carrying the same video assets that only serve to exacerbate the burden placed upon the network. In this paper we present OpenCache: a highly configurable, efficient and transparent in-network caching service that aims to improve the VoD distribution efficiency by caching video assets as close to the end-user as possible. OpenCache leverages Software Defined Networking technology to benefit last mile environments by improving network utilisation and increasing the Quality of Experience for the end-user. Our evaluation on a pan-European OpenFlow testbed uses adaptive bitrate video to demonstrate that with the use of OpenCache, streaming applications play back higher quality video and experience increased throughput, higher bitrate, and shorter start up and buffering times.
