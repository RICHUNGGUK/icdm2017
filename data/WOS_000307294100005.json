The decision making process under uncertain environments is a common one in real logistics problems. The purpose of this study is to apply a fuzzy approach which will provide an optimal solution to the distribution of frozen food with uncertainty in its time values. A soft computing approach is used where fuzzy constraints are included in the modeling and the solution of the problem.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy optimization for distribution of frozen food with imprecise times", "paper_id": "WOS:000307294100005"}
