Goal of Esteem is to go beyond the existing state-of-the-art solutions for P2P knowledge sharing and to provide an integrated platform for both data and service discovery. A distinguishing feature of Esteem is the use of semantic communities to explicitly give shape to the collective knowledge and expertise of peer groups with similar interests. Key techniques of Esteem will be presented in the paper and concern: shuffling-based communication, ontology and service matchmaking, context management, and quality-aware data integration. An application example of data and service discovery in the health-care domain will be presented, by also discussing results of system and user evaluation.", "paper_title": "The ESTEEM platform: enabling P2P semantic collaboration through emerging collective knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000287591900002"}
