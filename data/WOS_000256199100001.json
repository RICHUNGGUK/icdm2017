Rossner, J.P. Seifert, The complexity of approximate optima for greatest common divisor computations, in: Proceedings of the 2nd International Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium, ANTS-II, 1996, pp. 307-322]: Given n numbers a(1),..., a(n) epsilon Z, find an l(infinity)-minimum GCD multiplier for a(1),..., a(n), i.e., a vector x epsilon Z(n) with minimum max 1 <= i <= n |x(i)| satisfying Sigma(n)(i=1) x(i)a(i) = gcd(a1,...,a(n)). We show that assuming P not equal NP, it is NP-hard to approximate the Minimum GCD Multiplier in l(infinity) norm (GCDMc(infinity)) within a factor n(c/log log n) for some constant c > 0 where n is the dimension of the given vector. This improves on the best previous result. The best result so far gave 2((logn)1-epsilon) factor hardness by Rossner and Seifert [C. Rossner, J.P. Seifert, The complexity of approximate optima for greatest common divisor computations, in: Proceedings of the 2nd international Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium, ANTS-II, 1996, pp. 307-322], where epsilon > 0 is an arbitrarily small constant.
