Pedestrian traffic flows during waiting, getting on or off, and traveling can be simulated. The typical scenario in Beijing Subway Line 13 is modeled to analyze the passenger behavior in subway system. By comparing simulation results with statistical ones, the correctness and practicality of the DPCA model are verified. At last, the additional results made by DPCA model can make contribution to passenger comfort analysis and pedestrian facility planning and guidance.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Parameters Cellular Automaton Model for Passengers in Subway", "paper_id": "WOS:000368923700006"}
