A number of measures have been proposed for validating overlapping clusterings, but it remains unclear which one is the most convenient. Most existing external measures aim to validate partitional clusterings, even when most real-life problem involve overlapping clustering scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new external measure specifically designed for validating overlapping clusterings, which fulfills the main set of desirable conditions presented in the literature. We also show that our proposal correctly handles situations where previous measures display undesirable performances.", "paper_title": "Addressing the validation of overlapping clustering algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000347782000004"}
