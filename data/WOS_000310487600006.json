For the reliability of accessing these remote services, user must pass a verification procedure to obtain the authorization for legal resource acquisition and data exchange. Recently, several dynamic identity-based authentication protocols for multi-server environment have been proposed, but all of these protocols have been cryptanalyzed by other scholars. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic identity-based authentication protocol for multi-server environment using elliptic curve cryptography. The analysis shows that our protocol could overcome security weaknesses in the previously published protocols. Hence, our protocol is more suitable for practical applications.
