The purpose of the meeting was to develop an integrated vision of future Unmanned Aircraft Systems with input from stakeholders in the government agencies, academia and industry. This paper discusses the motivation for the symposium, its organization, the outcome of focused presentations and discussions, and participant survey data from questions and statements that were collected in real time during the meeting. Some samples of these data are presented in graphical form and discussed. The complete set of survey data are included in the Appendix.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Participant Feedback from the Symposium for Civilian Applications of Unmanned Aircraft Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000264484900007"}
