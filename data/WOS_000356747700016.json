And thus the ranges of coupling strength g are obtained under the ring coupling and the global one for identical cells. It is observed that bigger synchronization threshold is needed for the ring coupling than the global one. In particular, we point out that the unidentical cells require stronger coupling to make the system reach nearly complete synchronization by means of numeric simulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
