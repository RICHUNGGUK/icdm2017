Firstly, we propose the principle of selecting the feature points and the portrait drawing method by B-spline curves using the self-reference parameter. Then, the wavelet transform is used to analyze the position, the direction and the intensity of the double-fold eyelid textures. Experimental results have shown that the facial texture analyzing method is effective for drawing portraits automatically. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
