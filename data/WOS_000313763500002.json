Manual construction of knowledge repositories, on the other hand, tends to produce high-quality data in very small amounts. We propose an architecture to combine the best of both worlds: A game with a purpose that induces humans to clean up data automatically extracted by text mining. First, a text miner trained on a set of known commonsense facts harvests many more candidate facts from corpora. Then, a simple slot-machine-with-a-purpose game presents these candidate facts to the players for verification by playing. As a result, a new dataset of high precision commonsense knowledge is created. This combined architecture is able to produce significantly better commonsense facts than the state-of-the-art text miner alone. Furthermore, we report that bootstrapping (i.e., training the text miner on the output of the game) improves the subsequent performance of the text miner.", "paper_title": "Bootstrapping a Game with a Purpose for Commonsense Collection", "paper_id": "WOS:000313763500002"}
