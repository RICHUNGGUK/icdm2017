We define the subnetworks of f as the restrictions of f to the hypercubes contained in {0, 1}(n), and we exhibit a class F of Boolean networks, called even or odd self-dual networks, satisfying the following property: if a network f has no subnetwork in F, then it has a unique fixed point. We then discuss this \"forbidden subnetworks theorem\". We show that it generalizes the following fixed point theorem of Shih and Dong: if, for every x in {0, 1}(n), there is no directed cycle in the directed graph whose the adjacency matrix is the discrete Jacobian matrix of f evaluated at point x, then f has a unique fixed point. We also show that F contains the class F' of networks whose the interaction graph is a directed cycle, but that the absence of subnetwork in F' does not imply the existence and the uniqueness of a fixed point.", "paper_title": "A fixed point theorem for Boolean networks expressed in terms of forbidden subnetworks", "paper_id": "WOS:000313505200001"}
