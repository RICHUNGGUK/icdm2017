The frequency response functions of the planar motion stage in the moving directions are obtained by numerical simulation, which are in good agreement with those obtained experimentally. The positioning accuracy of the planar motion stage is also evaluated numerically and experimentally. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
