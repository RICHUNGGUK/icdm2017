Unlike other explicit traffic control protocols that have to estimate network parameters (e.g., link latency, bottleneck bandwidth, packet loss rate, or the number of flows) in order to compute the allowed source sending rate, our fuzzy-logic-based controller can measure the router queue size directly; hence it avoids various potential performance problems arising from parameter estimations while reducing much consumption of computation and memory resources in routers. As a network parameter, the queue size can be accurately monitored and used to proactively decide if action should be taken to regulate the source sending rate, thus increasing the resilience of the network to traffic congestion. The communication QoS (Quality of Service) is assured by the good performances of our scheme such as max-min fairness, low queueing delay and good robustness to network dynamics. Simulation results and comparisons have verified the effectiveness and showed that our new traffic management scheme can achieve better performances than the existing protocols that rely on the estimation of network parameters.", "paper_title": "Using Fuzzy Logic Control to Provide Intelligent Traffic Management Service for High-Speed Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209724000004"}
