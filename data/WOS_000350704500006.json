The Randic matrix R = (r(ij)) of G is defined by r(ij) = 1/root d(i)d(j) if the vertices v(i) and v(j) are adjacent in G and r(ij) = 0 otherwise. The normalized signless Laplacian matrix Q is defined as Q = I + R, where I is the identity matrix. The Randic energy is the sum of absolute values of the eigenvalues of R. In this paper, we find a relation between the normalized signless Laplacian eigenvalues of G and the Rancho energy of its subdivision graph S(G). We also give a necessary and sufficient condition for a graph to have exactly k and distinct Randic eigenvalues.", "paper_title": "Randic Energy and Randic Eigenvalues", "paper_id": "WOS:000350704500006"}
