We create a reference image to represent the global feature of target image which could be further diffused into the cloned patch, and modify the diffusion process to ensure that the cloning result is seamless and natural. Specifically, we figure out an efficient solution based on Mean-Value Coordinates (MVC) to deal with the hybrid boundary, and construct a general model based on MVC to implement our image cloning, which is further applied to video cloning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our Environment-Sensitive cloning.", "paper_title": "Environment-Sensitive cloning in images", "paper_id": "WOS:000290767600032"}
