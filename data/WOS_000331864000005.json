Remanufacturing, a process of returning a used product to original performance specification from the customers' perspectives with at least 'as new' product warranty, is a strategy to reduce manufacturing's environmental impacts whilst boosting profitability. Remanufacturing is poorly understood because of its relative novelty in research terms, for example, in comparison to conventional manufacturing. If considered during the early stages of a product's design, active disassembly (AD) can be used to enable the rapid, non-destructive, self-disassembly of products at end-of-life. AD reduces component damage and so facilitates remanufacture. This article explains a potential way forward to fuse 'AD' and 'Design for Remanufacture' in addressing the goals of sustainable manufacturing. An initial investigation of an automotive 'electronic control unit' is tested with a unique form of AD employing an 'interstitial layer'. Future work is proposed.", "paper_title": "Use of active disassembly technology to improve remanufacturing productivity: automotive application", "paper_id": "WOS:000331864000005"}
