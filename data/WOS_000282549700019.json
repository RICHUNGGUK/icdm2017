Both the L-2-stability and error estimate of the DG method are discussed in detail. We show that the proposed method has an accuracy of O(h(k+1/2)) under the L-2-norm when polynomials of degree k in space are used. Furthermore, numerical experiments are provided to justify our theoretical analysis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
