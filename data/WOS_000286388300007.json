We consider both the first-order and second-order cases and present stability or boundedness conditions. Several interesting phenomena are analyzed and explained. Simulation results are presented to support the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Leaderless and Leader-Following Consensus With Communication and Input Delays Under a Directed Network Topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000286388300007"}
