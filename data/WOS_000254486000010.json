In a scientific collaboration community, different scientists perform different roles while they implement the project, and some scientists may be more active than others; these active scientists often undertake the role of leadership or key coordinator in the project. Obviously, we should assign the role of principle scientists onto those active actors in the communities. In this paper, we present the model and algorithms for locating active actors in the community based on the analyses of scientists' interaction topology, the actors with high connection degrees in the interaction topology can be considered as active ones. Finally, we make some case studies for our model and algorithms.", "paper_title": "Locating active actors in the scientific collaboration communities based on interaction topology analyses", "paper_id": "WOS:000254486000010"}
