It is based on the combination of the response surface (RS) approach (the surrogate model) with differential evolution algorithm for global search. Differential evolution (DE) is an evolutionary algorithm where N different vectors collecting the parameters of the system are chosen randomly or by adding weighted differences between vectors obtained from two populations. In the proposed algorithm (called DE-Q), the RS is introduced in the mutation operation. The new parameter vector is defined as the one minimizing the second-order polynomial function (RS), approximating the objective function. The performances in terms of speed rate are improved by introducing the second-order approximation; nevertheless, robustness of DE algorithm for global minimum search of objective function is preserved, because multiple search points are used simultaneously. Numerical examples are presented, concerning: search of the global minimum of analytical benchmark functions; parameter identification of a damaged beam; parameter identification of mechanical properties (masses and member stiffnesses) of a truss-girder steel bridge starting from frequencies and eigenvectors obtained from an experimental field test.", "paper_title": "Coupling Response Surface and Differential Evolution for Parameter Identification Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000352790800005"}
