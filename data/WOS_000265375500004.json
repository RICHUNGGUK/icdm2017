Thus, hardware support is crucial to enhance the performance of these operations. to this work, chip-level hardware support for similarity measure calculation is introduced and then extended to similarity matrix computation. Both software and hardware versions of various similarity computations are implemented with a hierarchical platform-based design approach to facilitate component reuse at different levels of abstraction. Software modules are executed on a reconfigurable, soft processor core on the same field-programmable, gate array (FPGA) as the hardware implementations for the purpose of performance comparison. Preliminary results using parallel hardware are also presented. In addition, performance gain from hardware as opposed to a general-purpose processor is examined. Experimental results show that the performance of similarity computation for a set of feature vectors could be significantly enhanced by using on-chip hardware.", "paper_title": "Hardware acceleration for similarity computations of feature vectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000265375500004"}
