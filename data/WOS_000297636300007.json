The article presents three novel algorithms that synthesize an application-specific NoC topology, map it onto the physical ReNoC architecture, and create deadlock-free, application-specific routing algorithms. We apply our algorithms to a mixture of real and synthetic applications and target three different physical architectures. Compared to a conventional NoC, ReNoC reduces power consumption by up to 58% on average.", "paper_title": "The ReNoC Reconfigurable Network-on-Chip: Architecture, Configuration Algorithms, and Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000297636300007"}
