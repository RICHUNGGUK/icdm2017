This study presents a novel method that accelerates transportation and minimizes the payload swing of the overhead cranes. Based on the inertia theorem, this method does not need a complex dynamic model for a crane system, but rather uses trolley position and swing angle data to design the proposed fuzzy projection controller. An enhanced fuzzy algorithm is also utilized to eliminate the deadzone problem. Last, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are compared with those of the conventional PD and nonlinear coupling methods. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
