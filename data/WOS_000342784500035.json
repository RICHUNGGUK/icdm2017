We define a training matrix which is represented in a two-way array and decompose the training models by PPCA to construct bases. In the two-way array representation, each training model is represented as a matrix and the columns of each training matrix are treated as training vectors. We formulate the adaptation equation in the maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework using the bases and the prior.", "paper_title": "Speaker Adaptation Based on PPCA of Acoustic Models in a Two-Way Array Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784500035"}
