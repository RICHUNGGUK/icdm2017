But many intermediate situations may occur on mobility dynamics or radio link instability. In such cases, where the network frequently splits into evolving connected groups, none of the conventional routing paradigms (DTN or MANET) are fully satisfactory. In this paper we propose HYMAD, a Hybrid DTN-MANET routing protocol which uses DTN between disjoint groups of nodes while using MANET routing within these groups. HYMAD is fully decentralized and only makes use of topological information exchanges between the nodes. The strength of HYMAD lies in its ability to adapt to the changing connectivity patterns of the network. We evaluate the scheme in simulation by replaying synthetic and real life mobility traces which exhibit a broad range of connectivity dynamics. The results show that HYMAD introduces limited overhead and outperforms the multi-copy Spray-and-Wait DTN routing protocol it extends, both in terms of delivery ratio and delay. This hybrid DTN-MANET approach offers a promising venue for the delivery of elastic data in mobile ad-hoc networks as it retains the resilience of a pure DTN protocol while significantly improving performance.
