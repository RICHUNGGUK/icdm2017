We obtain a new version of the theorem that asserts for the first time the full Weierstrass condition together with the Euler form of the adjoint equation, thereby extending a result of de Pinho and Vinter. The new theorem also features stratified hypotheses and conclusions. Two examples illustrate its use.", "paper_title": "The nonsmooth maximum principle", "paper_id": "WOS:000278066900012"}
