Discovering the mechanisms that govern the onset and progression of human metabolism-related diseases is not a straightforward process. Computational approaches, such as the flux balance analysis, have been successfully used to extract useful knowledge on the metabolic dysregulation processes from genome-scale network models. In this work, we propose a novel approach which integrates constraint-based techniques with model checking methods, with the aim to extract relevant qualitative information from a metabolic network model. As a case study, we applied our methodology to the simulation and analysis of the primary hyperoxaluria type I, an inherited disease in which the lack of a particular liver enzyme causes the kidney to accumulate excessive amounts of oxalate.", "paper_title": "Combining flux balance analysis and model checking for metabolic network validation and analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000360156500002"}
