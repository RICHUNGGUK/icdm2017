To satisfy the periodic constraint, the designable domain is divided into a certain number of identical unit cells. The optimal topology of the unit cell is determined by gradually removing and adding material based on a sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity numbers that consider the periodic constraint for the repetitive elements are developed. To demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the proposed approach, topology design problems of 2D and 3D periodic structures are investigated. The results indicate that the optimal topology depends, to a great extent, on the defined unit cells and on the relative strength of other non-designable part, such as the skins of sandwich structures.", "paper_title": "Optimal design of periodic structures using evolutionary topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000260380300004"}
