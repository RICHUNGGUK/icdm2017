Both services and their clients can protect themselves, by imposing security constraints on each other's behaviour. Then, service interaction results in a call-by-propbrty mechanism, that matches the client requests with service's. A static approach is also described, that determines how to compose services while guaranteeing that their execution is always secure, without resorting to any dynamic check.", "paper_title": "Security issues in service composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000239478000001"}
