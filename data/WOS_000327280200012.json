The number of such a minimum placement of PMUs is called the power domination number of G and is denoted by gamma(p)(G). Finding gamma(p)(G) of an arbitrary graph is known to be NP-complete. In this paper, we deal with the power domination problem on honeycomb meshes. For a t-dimensional honeycomb mesh HMt, we show that gamma(p)(HMt) = inverted right perpendicular 2t/3 inverted left perpendicular. In particular, we present an O(t)-time algorithm as the placement scheme.", "paper_title": "Power Domination in Honeycomb Meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000327280200012"}
