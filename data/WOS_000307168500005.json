Traditionally parallel task scheduling algorithms only focus on handling CPU resources but with use of a VM there are many more resources properties to monitor and manage. The objective of this paper is to address these challenges of a multi-dimensional scheduling algorithm for VMs within a SOA. To do this we deploy a testbed of SOA environment with VMs that are capable of being registered, indexed, allocated, accessed and controlled by our new parallel task scheduling algorithms.", "paper_title": "Resource management of distributed Virtual Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000307168500005"}
