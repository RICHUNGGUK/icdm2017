Their standard deviations are derived and they vary more obviously than the resistance variations measured in the conventional method. Hence the standard deviation of the refractive index can be used as the indicator to justify the durability of a flexible indium tin oxide film. The validity is demonstrated. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
