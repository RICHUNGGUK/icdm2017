This means that a single image system can be composed by mono and multiprocessor nodes running several Operating Systems and MPI implementations, as well as, heterogeneous clusters as nodes of the system. HyMPI supports blocking and non-blocking point-to-point communication and collective communication primitive in order to increase the range of High Performance Applications that can use it and to keep compatibility with MPI Standard.", "paper_title": "HyMPI - A MPI implementation for heterogeneous high performance systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300032"}
