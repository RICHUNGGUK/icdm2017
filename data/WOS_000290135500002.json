We applied the behavior-environment interface of social cognitive theory to explain several negative familial and organizational consequences of addiction to work-related pervasive technologies. Our empirical study of 241 organizational mobile email users revealed that their levels of addiction to mobile email increased their perceived work overload and technology-family conflict. Perceived work overload, in turn, reduced their organizational commitment. Furthermore, elevated levels of perceived work overload together with augmented technology-family conflict fostered work-family conflict. Implications for research and practice are suggested.
