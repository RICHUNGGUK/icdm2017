Their method, however, suffers from the expensive computation of siphons. We propose a new T-characteristic vector zeta to compute strict minimal siphons (SMS) for (SPR)-P-3 (systems of simple sequential processes with resources) in an algebraic fashion. For a special subclass of (SPR)-P-3, called (SPR)-P-4 (simple (SPR)-P-3), we discover that elementary siphons can be constructed from elementary circuits where all places are resources. Thus, the set of elementary siphons can be computed without the knowledge of all SMS. We also propose to construct characteristic T-vectors eta by building a graph to find dependent siphons without their computations.", "paper_title": "Computation of elementary siphons in Petri nets for deadlock control", "paper_id": "WOS:000238906600007"}
