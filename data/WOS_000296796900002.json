In a world that is highly submerged in data, data analytics and higher forms of data exploitation are fundamental to most decision making processes. However, enabling such technology requires several factors related to security, privacy, performance and costing to be addressed. In this paper, we discuss the various challenges in greater detail and propose our vision of a Privacy-aware Data Stream Cloud architecture that enables secure, privacy-preserving data analytics services.", "paper_title": "Towards a privacy-aware stream data management system for cloud applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000296796900002"}
