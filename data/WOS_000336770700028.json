Current HPC systems are built from commodity server processors, designed over years to achieve maximum performance, with energy efficiency being an after-thought. In this paper we advocate a different approach: building HPC systems from low-power embedded and mobile technology parts, over time designed for maximum energy efficiency, which now show promise for competitive performance. We introduce the architecture of Tibidabo, the first large-scale HPC cluster built from ARM multicore chips, and a detailed performance and energy efficiency evaluation. We present the lessons learned for the design and improvement in energy efficiency of future HPC systems based on such low-power cores. Based on our experience with the prototype, we perform simulations to show that a theoretical cluster of 16-core ARM Cortex-A15 chips would increase the energy efficiency of our cluster by 8.7x, reaching an energy efficiency of 1046 MFLOPS/W.
