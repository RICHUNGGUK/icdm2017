This makes it a promising candidate for many practical applications when the number of non-zero (significant) coefficients of a signal is not available. Our algorithm can provide a fast runtime while also offers comparably theoretical guarantees as the best optimization-based approach in both the noiseless and noisy regime. Numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the validity and high performance of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
