Antenna configuration includes number of antennas installed at the base station, the azimuth of each base station, the tilt, height, and transmitted power for each antenna for cellular mobile networks. Towards this end, a mathematical model is formulated using integer programming (IP).The objective of the model is to minimize the cost of the network. The model guarantees that each demand point is covered. A demand point represents a cluster of uniformly distributed multiple users. In addition, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at each demand point is set at a given threshold value. A none-line-of-site situation is considered while calculating the path loss using COST-231-Walfisch-Ikegami propagation model. To illustrate the capability of the formulated IP model, we use a discretized map of some area with demand points. The IP model is solved using a commercial software, LINGO 12. Possible future research directions are stated in the conclusion.", "paper_title": "Optimal base stations location and configuration for cellular mobile networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000347777300002"}
