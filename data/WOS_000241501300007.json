The combined use of visible and thermal IR imaging sensors offers a viable means for improving the performance of face recognition techniques based on a single imaging modality. Despite successes in indoor access control applications, imaging in the visible spectrum demonstrates difficulties in recognizing the faces in varying illumination conditions. Thermal IR sensors measure energy radiations from the object, which is less sensitive to illumination changes, and are even operable in darkness. However, thermal images do not provide high-resolution data. Data fusion of visible and thermal images can produce face images robust to illumination variations. However, thermal face images with eyeglasses may fail to provide useful information around the eyes since glass blocks a large portion of thermal energy. In this paper, eyeglass regions are detected using an ellipse fitting method, and replaced with eye template patterns to preserve the details useful for face recognition in the fused image. Software registration of images replaces a special-purpose imaging sensor assembly and produces co-registered image pairs at a reasonable cost for large-scale deployment. Face recognition techniques using visible, thermal IR, and data-fused visible-thermal images are compared using a commercial face recognition software (FaceIt (R)) and two visible-thermal face image databases (the NIST/Equinox and the UTK-IRIS databases). The proposed multiscale data-fusion technique improved the recognition accuracy under a wide range of illumination changes. Experimental results showed that the eyeglass replacement increased the number of correct first match subjects by 85% (NIST/Equinox) and 67%, (UTK-IRIS).", "paper_title": "Multiscale fusion of visible and thermal IR images for illumination-invariant face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241501300007"}
