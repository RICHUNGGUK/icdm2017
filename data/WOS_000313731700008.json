While a parametric family is commonly used in practice, one can also consider some nonparametric families to avoid distributional misspecification. In this article, we propose a solution using a mixture-based nonparametric family for the component distribution in a finite mixture model as opposed to some recent research that utilizes a kernel-based approach. In particular, we present a semiparametric maximum likelihood estimation procedure for the model parameters and tackle the bandwidth parameter selection problem via some popular means for model selection. Empirical comparisons through simulation studies and three real data sets suggest that estimators based on our mixture-based approach are more efficient than those based on the kernel-based approach, in terms of both parameter estimation and overall density estimation.", "paper_title": "Estimation of finite mixtures with symmetric components", "paper_id": "WOS:000313731700008"}
