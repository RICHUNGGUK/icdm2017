However, several natural matroid problems, such as 3-matroid intersection, are NP-hard. Here we investigate these problems from the parameterized complexity point of view: instead of the trivial n(0(k)) time brute force algorithm for finding a k-element solution, we try to give algorithms with uniformly polynomial (i.e., f(k) . n(0(1))) running time. The main result is that if the ground set of a represented linear matroid is partitioned into blocks of size f, then we can determine in randomized time f(k, l) . n(0(1)) whether there is an independent set that is the union of k blocks. As a consequence, algorithms with similar running time are obtained for other problems such as finding a k-element set in the intersection of l matroids, or finding k terminals in a network such that each of them can be connected simultaneously to the source by e disjoint paths.
