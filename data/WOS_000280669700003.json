Specific aspects of risk in supply chains involving China are also addressed. Design/methodology/approach - Literature review provides sources which are synthesized. Findings - A generic framework is identified, then categorizations of supply chain risks are compared. Cases and models applied to the study of supply chain risk are reviewed briefly. A review of Chinese risk in the supply chain context is provided. Originality/value - This review includes many current studies, and is a source of useful references for those examining supply chain risk.", "paper_title": "A review of enterprise risk management in supply chain", "paper_id": "WOS:000280669700003"}
