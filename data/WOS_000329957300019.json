Without explicit communication, such conflicts may lead to undesired topological changes since there is no global signal that facilitates coordinated and safe switching from one behavior to the other. Moreover, without coordination signals multiple swarm members might simultaneously assume leadership, and their conflicting leading directions are likely to prevent successful flocking. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first set of swarm flocking algorithms that maintain connectivity while electing direction for flocking, under conditions of no communication. The algorithms allow spontaneous direction requests and support direction changes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
