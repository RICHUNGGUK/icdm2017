It is based on the first stage of another approach that we described elsewhere. Instead of considering a static origin-destination matrix, we propose a novel way of computing the expected number of trips by making use of the results from a survey amongst the potential users of the rapid transit network. We also report some computational experiments on several randomly generated instances. In the second stage of the approach, a set of lines is generated for the rapid transit network.", "paper_title": "A Survey-based Approach for Selecting the Stations and Links for a Rapid Transit Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000336216400013"}
