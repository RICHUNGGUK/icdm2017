The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software with mutational diagnosis (MEGA-MD) is a suite of tools developed to forecast the deleteriousness of nsSNVs using multiple methods and to explore nsSNVs in the context of the variability permitted in the long-term evolution of the affected position. In its graphical interface for use on desktops, it enables interactive computational diagnosis and evolutionary exploration of nsSNVs. As a web service, MEGA-MD is suitable for diagnosing variants on an exome scale. The MEGA-MD suite intends to serve the needs for conducting low-and high-throughput analysis of nsSNVs in diverse applications.", "paper_title": "MEGA-MD: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis software with mutational diagnosis of amino acid variation", "paper_id": "WOS:000336095100021"}
