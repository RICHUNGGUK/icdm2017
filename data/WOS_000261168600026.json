It is remarkably robust to missing data, a feature particularly important for its use in quantitative proteomics. A new implementation in C and interfaced with R makes MMG extremely fast and easy to use and to extend. Availability: The original implementation (Matlab) is still available from http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/similar to guido/; the new implementation is available from http://wrightlab.group.shef.ac.uk/people_noirel.htm, from CRAN, and has been submitted to BioConductor, http://www.bioconductor.org/.
