In addition, public wireless LAN service areas, such as train stations, hotels, and airports, are increasing and tethering technology has enabled smartphones to act as access points (APs). Consequently, there can be multiple APs in the same area. In this situation, users must select one of many APs. Various studies have proposed and evaluated many AP selection methods; however, existing methods do not consider AP mobility. In this paper, we propose an AP selection method based on cooperation among APs and user movement. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed method dramatically improves throughput compared to an existing method.", "paper_title": "A Proposal of Access Point Selection Method Based on Cooperative Movement of Both Access Points and Users", "paper_id": "WOS:000368904200002"}
