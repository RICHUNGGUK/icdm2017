It was found that the free ion distribution diagram and voltage distribution diagram were similar, and ions migrated in the power line direction. The electrode modules were used for the mortar specimen with w/c ratio of 0.5. The effectively processed areas accounted for 14.1%, 39.0%, 49.4% and 51.4% of total area respectively on Day 28. Larger electrode area was more advantageous to ion migration. In addition, it was proved that the two-dimensional electric field could be divided into different equifield line active regions, and regarded as affected by one-dimensional electric field, and the ion migration results in various equifield line active regions were predicted by using the duration analysis method based on the theoretical model of ion migration obtained from one-dimensional test.", "paper_title": "Prediction of ions migration behavior in mortar under 2-D ALMT application to inhibit ASR", "paper_id": "WOS:000344577900004"}
