Considering real world organizations as an metaphor, this paper proposes architectural styles for MAS which adopt concepts from organizational theories. The styles are modeled in i*/Tropos, using the notions of actor, goal and actor dependency and are intended to capture needs/wants, delegations and obligations. The proposed architectural styles are evaluated with respect to a set of software quality attributes, such as predictability and adaptability. In addition, we report on a comparative study of organizational and conventional software architectures using a mobile robot control example from the Software Engineering literature. The research reported here was conducted within the scope of the Tropos project, whose objective is to develop a comprehensive agent-oriented software development methodology.", "paper_title": "Multi-agent architectures as organizational structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000236915400001"}
