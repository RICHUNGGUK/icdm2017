These are known as conflicting variables. We propose a new definition for measuring the conflict of a variable in a model and apply it to the set variables of models expressed in existential second-order logic extended with counting (there exists SOL+). Such a variable conflict can be automatically and incrementally evaluated. Furthermore, this measure is lower-bounded by an intuitive conflict measure, and upper-bounded by the penalty of the model. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by replacing a built-in global constraint by an there exists SOL+ version thereof, while still obtaining competitive results.", "paper_title": "Inferring variable conflicts for local search", "paper_id": "WOS:000241582400046"}
