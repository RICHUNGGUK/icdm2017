In this article, a novel multi-objective (MO) algorithm based on Taguchi's technique is illustrated and its performances assessed. Validation is performed through a comparison between the presented algorithm and a MO genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization, first on different sets of test functions and then on a practical antenna array synthesis problem. Results indicate a generally better behavior of the proposed algorithm in terms of convergence and spreading over the Pareto front with respect to the GA benchmark. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
