This is achieved by employing a nonlinear geometrical transform to add redundancy mainly to the area of interest followed by a partitioning of the transformed image into subimages which are coded and transmitted separately. Simulations show that this approach yields acceptable performance even when only one descriptor is received.", "paper_title": "Content-based multiple description image coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000236476300021"}
