The inherent complexity of such processors makes difficult to update processor teaching to include current commercial products, especially at lab sessions where simplistic simulators are usually used. However, instructors are forced to reduce this gap if they want to properly prepare students in this topic. Dealing with these complex concepts at labs does not only help reinforce theoretical concepts but also has a positive effect in the students'motivation. This article presents a methodology designed for the study of current microprocessor mechanisms in a gradual way without overwhelming students. The methodology is based on the use of a detailed simulation framework, used both in the academia and in the industry, which accurately models features from current processors. Due to the huge simulator complexity, it is introduced through several learning phases. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that students are able to develop skills in a detailed simulator in a reasonable time period and, at the same time they learn the details of complex architectural mechanisms of commercial microprocessors.
