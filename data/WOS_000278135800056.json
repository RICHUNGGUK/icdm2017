Highlights lack chroma information, and therefore special treatment for them is important for correct appearance modeling. We introduce techniques to establish efficient control of weathering and deweathering operations on images with high levels of specular highlights. Our solution adjusts the highlight information so that a more coherent result when transferring material properties is achieved. We also present a solution for transferring of material features between objects with very different reflectance properties, and explore normal mapping applications to improve the appearance modeling of materials with geometric variations.", "paper_title": "Highlights on weathering effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000278135800056"}
