Therefore, the high growth rate of the TSP market forces all the manufactures in the TSP supply chain to face a very competitive environment. The main purpose of this study is to provide a practical procedure for the manufacturers of the TSP terminal application products to rank their TSP suppliers. Via the critical-to-quality (CTQ) tree, CTQ is defined, and the index is utilized to measure the CTQ. Since measurement errors are often unavoidable in the inspection phase, fuzzy theory is integrated into the estimations. By the concept of fuzzy preference relation, a step-by-step procedure is provided for solving the TSP supplier selection problem. This study gives practicability for the real-life applications.", "paper_title": "On ranking multiple touch-screen panel suppliers through the CTQ: applied fuzzy techniques for inspection with unavoidable measurement errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000339387600023"}
