In the first half of the paper general relations are derived for the moments of the functionals using kernels from the Wiener-Ito chaos expansion. In the second half we obtain more explicit results for a system of U-statistics of some parametric models in stochastic geometry. In the logarithmic form functionals are connected to Gibbs models. There is an inequality between moments of Poisson and non-Poisson functionals in this case, and we have a version of the central limit theorem in the Poisson case.", "paper_title": "FUNCTIONALS OF SPATIAL POINT PROCESSES HAVING A DENSITY WITH RESPECT TO THE POISSON PROCESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000348961900004"}
