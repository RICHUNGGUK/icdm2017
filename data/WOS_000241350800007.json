Models are matched in their entirety, depending on overall topology and geometry information. A currently open challenge is how to perform partial matching. Partial matching is important for finding similarities across part models with different global shape properties and for the segmentation and matching of data acquired from 3D scanners. This paper presents a Scale-Space feature extraction technique based on recursive decomposition of polyhedral surfaces into surface patches. The experimental results presented in this paper suggest that this technique can potentially be used to perform matching based on local model structure. In our previous work, Scale-Space decomposition has been used successfully to extract features from mechanical artifacts. Scale-Space techniques can be parameterized to generate decompositions that correspond to manufacturing, assembly or surface features relevant to mechanical design. One application of these technique is to support matching and content-based retrieval of solid models. This paper shows how a Scale-Space technique can extract features that are invariant with respect to the global structure of the model as well as small perturbations that 3D laser scanning process introduce. In order to accomplish this, we introduce a new distance function defined on triangles instead of points. We believe this technique offers a new way to control the feature decomposition process, which results in the extraction of features that are more meaningful from an engineering viewpoint. The new technique is computationally practical for use in indexing large models. Examples are provided that demonstrate effective feature extraction on 3D laser scanned models. In addition, a simple sub-graph isomorphism algorithm was used to show that the feature adjacency graphs, obtained through feature extraction, are meaningful descriptors of 3D CAD objects.
