Consequently, improvement of this process has substantial potential to increase the rapidity of simulation projects, thus enabling more detailed analyses in design and development of production systems. This paper presents the development of a concept and an associated software demonstrator called the Generic Data Management Tool (GDM-Tool), which automates several critical and time-consuming data input activities. More specifically, raw data are extracted from multiple sources, with different data structures, and transformed to simulation input through data cleaning, calculations and distribution fitting, all done in one automated process. Finally, the simulation input is presented in the Core Manufacturing Simulation Data format, for further use in simulation applications. As a first step towards validation, the GDM-Tool was evaluated during a case study in the automotive industry. The results show that the time needed for input data management was reduced by 78%, as relative to a traditional manual approach.", "paper_title": "Automated input data management: evaluation of a concept for reduced time consumption in discrete event simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000310160200001"}
