This model relates the PV device's terminal current and voltage at a given irradiance and temperature. In order to obtain reasonable estimates of single-diode model parameters given noisy data, one ought to be able to characterize the estimability of the model parameters. Here, we look to an established method called data cloning to check for evidence of inestimability.", "paper_title": "On the estimability of the PV single-diode model parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000363467100007"}
