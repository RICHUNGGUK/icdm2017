As we know, in real-world applications the samples are usually corrupted by noise. However, representation based classification can take only noise in the test sample into account and is not able to deal with noise in the training sample, which causes side-effect on the classification result. In order to make the representation based classification more suitable for real-world applications such as face recognition, we propose a new representation based classification method in this paper. This method can effectively and simultaneously reduce noise in the test and training samples. Moreover, the proposed method can reduce noise in both the original and virtual training samples and then exploits them to determine the label of the test sample. The virtual training sample is generated from the original face image and shows possible variation of the face in scale, facial pose and expression. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs very well in face recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
