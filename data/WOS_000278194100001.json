There has been a lot of attention in similarity search in time sequence databases. However, most of the previous work on time sequences focused on one-dimensional sequences. Many applications such as multimedia databases or weather databases, however, need to handle multi-dimensional time sequences. In this paper, we extend our previous work on the similarity search by considering query types in multidimensional time sequence databases and more intensive experimental results that were not reported in the previous paper are illustrated. The proposed method can efficiently reduce the search space and guarantees no false dismissals.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT SIMILARITY SEARCH FOR MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TIME SEQUENCES", "paper_id": "WOS:000278194100001"}
