The MCBPP is a generalization of the classical bin-packing problem in which the machine (bin) capacity and task (item) sizes are given by multiple (resource) dimensions. The MRP is a challenging and novel optimization problem, aimed at maximizing the usage of available machines by reallocating tasks/processes among those machines in a cost-efficient manner, while fulfilling several capacity, conflict, and dependency-related constraints. The proposed MS-ILS-PP approach relies on simple neighborhoods as well as problem-tailored shaking procedures. We perform computational experiments on MRP benchmark instances containing between 100 and 50,000 processes. Near-optimum multi-resource allocation and scheduling solutions are obtained while meeting specified processing-time requirements (on the order of minutes). In particular, for 9/28 instances with more than 1000 processes, the gap between the solution value and a lower bound measure is smaller than 0.1%. Our optimization method is also applied to solve classical benchmark instances for the MCBPP, yielding the best known solutions and optimum ones in most cases. In addition, several upper bounds for non-solved problems were improved. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
