The BES would help in storing/releasing additional power in case of higher/lower wind speed to maintain constant grid power. The DC link capacitor is replaced with the BES system in a DFIG-based wind turbine to achieve the above-mentioned goal. The control scheme is modified and the co-ordinated tuning of the associated controllers to enhance the damping of the oscillatory modes is presented using bacterial foraging technique. The results from eigenvalue analysis and the time domain simulation studies are presented to elucidate the effectiveness of the BES systems in maintaining the grid stability under normal operation.", "paper_title": "Coordinated Tuning of DFIG-Based Wind Turbines and Batteries Using Bacteria Foraging Technique for Maintaining Constant Grid Power Output", "paper_id": "WOS:000300658400003"}
