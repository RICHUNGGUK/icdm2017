For unsharp quantum logic, let a lattice ordered quantum multiple valued (QMV) algebra be its truth value lattice. When lattice ordered QMV algebras satisfy a locally finite condition (that is, every non-zero element has a finite order) and its meet operation, A, is computable, we prove that Sigma(0)(1) boolean OR Pi(0)(1) subset of L-d(T) (epsilon, Sigma) (or L-W(T) (epsilon,Sigma)) subset of Pi(0)(2), where L-d(T) (epsilon, Sigma) (respectively L-W(T) (epsilon, Sigma)) denotes the class of languages accepted by these Turing machines in the depth-first method (respectively the width-first method). For sharp quantum logic, similar results are obtained for a general orthomodular truth value lattice. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
