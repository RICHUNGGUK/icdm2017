However, due to their dynamism and space-time heterogeneity, scalable parallel implementation of SAMR applications remains a challenge. This paper investigates hybrid runtime management strategies and presents an adaptive hierarchical multipartitioner (AHMP) framework. AHMP dynamically applies multiple partitioners to different regions of the domain, in a hierarchical manner, to match the local requirements of the regions. Key components of the AHMP framework include a segmentation-based clustering algorithm (SBC) that can efficiently identify regions in the domain with relatively homogeneous partitioning requirements, mechanisms for characterizing the partitioning requirements of these regions, and a runtime system for selecting, configuring, and applying the most appropriate partitioner to each region. Further, to address dynamic resource situations for long-running applications, AHMP provides a hybrid partitioning strategy (HPS) that involves application-level pipelining, trading space for time when resources are sufficiently large and underutilized, and an application-level out-of-core strategy (ALOC), trading time for space when resources are scarce in order to enhance the survivability of applications. The AHMP framework has been implemented and experimentally evaluated on up to 1,280 processors of the IBM SP4 cluster at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.", "paper_title": "Hybrid runtime management of space-time heterogeneity for parallel structured adaptive applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000248314700003"}
