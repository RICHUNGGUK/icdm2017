In a series of steps the user is guided by displays of relevant statistical distributions, which can be user designed. Statistical outliers can be excluded and the total sample of lineaments can be subdivided into azimuth sets and, if required, into spatial clusters. Special attention is given to the removal of spatial outliers in an interactive way. Several rule-based decisions are made to determine the nearest lineament in the spacing calculation. As a default procedure, the program defines a window whose size depends on the mode value of the length distribution of the lineaments in the study area. The software can accept a large amount of lineaments and can analyze the spatial properties of each azimuth set avoiding the repetitive calling of the original database. A simple rule was developed to derive the unidirectional lineament frequency. The spatial properties are presented as histograms for each azimuth set together with the mode, mean, standard deviation, and number of involved lineaments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
