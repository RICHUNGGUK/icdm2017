By using the edge-exchange method, we can change the network structure with degree sequence fixed. An optimal algorithm, namely Tabu Search, is applied, respectively, to enhance and weaken the synchronizability. The numerical results indicate that the synchronizability is most sensitive to the maximal betweenness. By tracking the optimization process, most previous works suggest that the synchonizability can be enhanced by reducing assortative coefficient and clustering coefficient; however, interestingly, our numerical simulations show that the depression of synchronizability also corresponds to the reduction process of those two coefficients.", "paper_title": "STRUCTURAL EFFECTS ON SYNCHRONIZABILITY OF SCALE-FREE NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000260270100005"}
