Position based broadcast oriented protocols, such as BEP, LBEP, DBEP and LDBIP work well in static and quasi static environment. While before they can be applied in general case where nodes move even during the broadcast process, the impact of mobility should be considered and mobility control mechanism is needed. In existing mobility management, each node periodically sends \"Hello\" message and based on received messages construct local view which may be updated at actual transmission time. In this paper, we proposed proactive and predictive mobility control mechanism: node will only send request to collect neighbors' info before transmission which conserves energy consumption of periodical \"Hello\" messages; once receiving location request command, nodes will send twice at certain interval; based on received locations, nodes will predict neighbors' position at future actual transmission time, use predicted local view to construct spanning tree and do efficient broadcast operation. We propose localized broadcast oriented protocols with mobility prediction for MANETs, and simulation result shows new protocols can achieve high coverage ratio.", "paper_title": "Localized broadcast oriented protocols with mobility prediction for mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238120800032"}
