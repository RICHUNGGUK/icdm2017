The modal method may be the most efficient method for eigensensitivity analysis, but suffers from modal truncation error. A method is presented by exactly expressing the modal truncation error as a sum of available modes and system matrices. The proposed method maintains original space without having to use the state-space form. It is shown that the proposed method yields good trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity in terms of the theoretical analysis and numerical studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
