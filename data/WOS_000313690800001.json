While this initially meant modelling only the control system of cognitive creatures, with the advent of \"embodied\" cognitive science this expanded to also modelling the interactions between the control system and the external environment. What did not seem to change with this embodiment revolution, however, was the attitude towards affect and emotion in cognitive science. This paper argues that cognitive systems research is now beginning to integrate these aspects of natural cognitive systems into cognitive science proper, not in virtue of traditional \"embodied cognitive science\", which focuses predominantly on the body's gross morphology, but rather in virtue of research into the interoceptive, organismic basis of natural cognitive systems.
