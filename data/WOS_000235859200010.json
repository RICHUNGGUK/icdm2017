The task concerns search in a tremendous weighting space. In this view we propose to incorporate a genetic algorithm (GA). It performs a wide yet efficient search for appropriate weightings (chromosomes). The difference from a traditional GA is that all the weightings throughout evolution Will be exploited to form the final ensemble, not just the best weighting. Our algorithm is tested on the UCI benchmark data sets and used to design a face detection system. Robust and consistently accurate classification is experienced. Comparative results with two other algorithms, i.e. AdaBoost and Bagging, are also given.
