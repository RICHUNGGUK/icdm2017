At the same time, in order to save the ports and the cost of optical cross-connect, the multicast waveband grooming approach was proposed to groom multiple light-trees to a few of waveband tunnels. However, the existing approaches all did not consider the joint performances of improving bandwidth utilization efficiency, reducing blocking probability and saving ports for multicast requests. Therefore, in this article, we propose a new multicast multi-granular grooming approach to perform the hierarchical sequential grooming to improve the joint performances based on a newly developed integrated auxiliary grooming graph (IAGG) that includes multiple wavelength integrated grooming graphs (WIGGs) and one waveband virtual topology layered graph (BVLG) to support both the multicast traffic grooming and multicast waveband grooming. In order to achieve the map of light-tree to the virtual topology layer in WIGG or BVLG, we present a light-segment map method, where a light-tree will be divided to several light-segments each of which will be independently mapped to the virtual topology layer. Since different definitions of blocking probability may lead to different objectives, we define two kinds of blocking probability, mean blocking probability of requests (MBPR) and mean blocking probability of users (MBPU). According to the two definitions of blocking probability, we propose two multicast multi-granular grooming heuristic algorithms, Heuristic Algorithm with minimizing MBPR and Heuristic Algorithm with minimizing MBPU based on IAGG. Simulation results show that the two proposed algorithms are both efficient and have better performances than traditional multicast grooming algorithm.", "paper_title": "Multicast multi-granular grooming based on integrated auxiliary grooming graph in optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000308330600003"}
