The performance measures are evaluated using the expanded mean value analysis, and the solution procedure is incorporated into a nonlinear optimization scheme to arrive at the sub-optimal buffer space vector. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through several numerical experiments. Discussions on convergence and computational complexity are also included. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
