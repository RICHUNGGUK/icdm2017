This article discusses, compares, contrasts and categorizes existing argumentation-based frameworks and applications as either philosophical or logic-based, and provides critical analysis that emphasizes the structure of arguments and the interactions between them. This review compares and contrasts the frameworks and applications of argumentation-based approaches on Web 2.0 and the Semantic Web, and subsequently highlights the importance and challenges of attaining monological argumentation on the Semantic Web.", "paper_title": "Philosophical and Logic-Based Argumentation-Driven Reasoning Approaches and their Realization on the WWW: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000361469800010"}
