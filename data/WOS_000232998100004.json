One means of solving this problem lies in its reduction to a bottleneck assignment problem with a matrix of a special structure. To solve it, three different approaches have been adopted. These approaches exploit specific minmax PRVP matrix properties. This paper presents a computational experiment with symmetric and asymmetric objective functions and offers conclusions about the most efficient way to find optimal solutions.
