They are derived from the parameterized asymmetric generalized Gaussian density (AGCD) model and GGD kernel based k-nearest neighbor (KNN) non-parametric estimation. The parameters of the score function in the algorithms are been chosen aclaptively by estimating the high order statistics of the observed signals and GGD kernel estimation based non-parametric method. Compared with convention I ICA algorithms, the two given methods can separate a wide range of source signals using 0 a only one unified density model. Simulations confirm the effectiveness and performance of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Unified parametric and non-parametric ICA algorithm for arbitrary sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000165"}
