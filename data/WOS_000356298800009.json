Identifying RFID tags in a given tag population is the most fundamental operation in RFID systems. While the Tree Walking (TW) protocol has become the industrial standard for identifying RFID tags, little is known about the mathematical nature of this protocol, and only some ad hoc heuristics exist for optimizing it. In this paper, first we analytically model the TW protocol, and then using that model, propose the Tree Hopping (TH) protocol that optimizes TW both theoretically and practically. The key novelty of TH is to formulate tag identification as an optimization problem and find the optimal solution that ensures the minimal average number of queries or identification time as per the requirement. With this solid theoretical underpinning, for different tag population sizes ranging from 100 to 100 K tags, TH significantly outperforms the best prior tag identification protocols on the metrics of the total number of queries per tag, the total identification time per tag, and the average number of responses per tag by an average of 40%, 59%, and 67%, respectively, when tag IDs are nonuniformly distributed in the ID space, and of 50%, 10%, and 30%, respectively, when tag IDs are uniformly distributed.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic Optimal Tree Hopping for RFID Identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000356298800009"}
