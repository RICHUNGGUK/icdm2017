After eye opening, chronic exposure to a constantly moving retinal image might influence the experience-dependent refinement of cell response characteristics. The results of previous modeling studies have suggested a contribution of fixational instability to the Hebbian maturation of the receptive fields of VI simple cells (Rucci, Edelman, & Wray, 2000; Rucci & Casile, 2004). This letter examines the origins of such a contribution. Using quasilinear models of lateral geniculate nucleus units and V1 simple cells, we derive analytical expressions for the second-order statistics of thalamocortical activity before and after eye opening. We show that in the presence of natural stimulation, fixational instability introduces a spatially uncorrelated signal in the retinal input, which strongly influences the structure of correlated activity in the model. This input signal produces a regime of thalamocortical activity similar to that present before eye opening and compatible with the Hebbian maturation of cortical receptive fields.", "paper_title": "Theoretical analysis of the influence of fixational instability on the development of thalamocortical connectivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000235485100004"}
