However, the presence of malicious relay nodes in the network may severely degrade the performance of the system. When a relay node behaves maliciously, there exists a possibility that such a node refuses to cooperate when it is selected for cooperation or deliberately drops the received packets. Trust establishment is a mechanism to detect misbehaving nodes in a network. In this paper, we propose a trust establishment method for cooperative wireless networks by using Bayesian framework. In contrast with the previous schemes proposed in wireless networks, this approach takes the channel state information and the relay selection decisions into account to derive a pure trust value for each relay node. The proposed method can be applied to any cooperative system with a general relay selection policy whose decisions in each cooperative transmission are independent of the previous ones. Moreover, it does not impose additional communication overhead on the system as it uses the available information in relay selection procedure.
