A linear matrix inequality based sufficient condition for asymptotic stability is proposed. This condition is an analogous counterpart for two-dimensional linear systems which is shown to be easily verifiable and suitable for design problems. The result is illustrated by a numerical example.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis for a class of discrete-time two-dimensional nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000278470200006"}
