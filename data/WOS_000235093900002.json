A fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme for trajectory integration is combined with a third order Jacobian matrix method with QR-factorization. After checking the algorithm on the standard Lorenz and Coupled quartic oscillator systems, the method is applied to a model 3-D steady flow for which an analytical expression is known. Both linear and quadratic approximated velocity fields succeed in predicting the Lyapunov exponents as well as describing the chaotic or regular regions inside the flow with satisfactory accuracy. A more realistic flow is then studied in order to delineate the possible limitations of the approach.
