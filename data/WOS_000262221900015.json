The most usual way to apply them also in color image sequences is to process each color channel separately. A different, more sophisticated approach is to process the color channels in a \"holistic\" manner using quaternions, as proposed by Ell and Sangwine. In this paper, we extend standard spatiotemporal Fourier-based approaches to handle color image sequences, using the hypercomplex Fourier transform. We show that translational motions are manifested as energy concentration along planes in the hypercomplex 3-D Fourier domain and we describe a methodology to estimate the motions, based on this property. Furthermore, we compare the three-channels-separately approach with our approach and we show that the computational effort can be reduced by a factor of 1/3, using the hypercomplex Fourier transform. Also, we propose a simple, accompanying method to extract the moving objects in the hypercomplex Fourier domain. Our experimental results on synthetic and natural images verify our arguments throughout the paper.", "paper_title": "Estimation of Motions in Color Image Sequences Using Hypercomplex Fourier Transforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000262221900015"}
