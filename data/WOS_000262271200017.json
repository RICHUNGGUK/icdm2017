The formation of this complex was endothermic with inclusion energy of 141.05 kcal/mol. C4H4 endohedral doping slightly perturbed the molecular orbitals of C-60. The calculated HOMO-LUMO gaps, the electron affinity (EA) and the ionizational potential (IP) indicated that C4H4@C-60 seemed to be more kinetically reactive than C-60. The IR active modes and harmonic vibrational frequencies of C4H4@C-60 were also discussed.
