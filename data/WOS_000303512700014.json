We point out a flaw in their analysis and show that their construction may not produce the desired diamond structure. We then give a more rigorous and detailed complexity analysis of the construction of a diamond structure. For this, we appeal to random graph theory (in particular, to the theory of random intersection graphs), which allows us to determine sharp necessary and sufficient conditions for the message complexity (i.e., the number of hash computations required to build the required structure). We also analyze the computational complexity for constructing a diamond structure, which has not been previously studied in the literature. Finally, we study the impact of our analysis on herding and other attacks that use the diamond structure as a subroutine. Precisely, our results shows the following: 1. The message complexity for the construction of a diamond structure is root k times more than the amount previously stated in literature. 2. The time complexity is n times themessage complexity, where n is the size of hash value. The time complexity is n times the message complexity, where n is the size of hash value.", "paper_title": "On the complexity of the herding attack and some related attacks on hash functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000303512700014"}
