However, it still remains a challenge to achieve high speech recognition performance, including accurate detection of erroneous utterances by non-native speakers. Conventionally, possible error patterns, based oil linguistic knowledge, are added to the lexicon and language model, or the ASR grammar network. However. this approach easily falls in the trade-off of coverage of errors and the increase of perplexity. To solve the problem, we propose a method based on a decision tree to learn effective prediction of errors made by non-native speakers. An experimental evaluation with a number of foreign students learning Japanese shows that the proposed method can effectively generate an ASR grammar network, given a target sentence, to achieve both better coverage of errors and smaller perplexity, resulting in significant improvement in ASR accuracy.", "paper_title": "Effective Prediction of Errors by Non-native Speakers Using Decision Tree for Speech Recognition-Based CALL System", "paper_id": "WOS:000273190800021"}
