Web pages are a very popular medium for broadcasting information and knowledge nowadays, and web pages are a good way to achieve the goal of secret message delivery because the different HTML coding codes will render the same screen in any of the popular browsers. The proposed method utilizes the HTML special space codes and sentence segmentation to conceal secret messages into a HTML file. The experimental results show that the stego HTML file generated by the proposed method is imperceptible. Also, the proposed method can conceal one more secret bit in every between-word location.", "paper_title": "Data Hiding for HTML Files Using Character Coding Table and Index Coding Table", "paper_id": "WOS:000331613500021"}
