Increasing evidence indicates that in many brain area inhibitory interneurons of similar properties make reciprocal connections. We found that a hybrid, as well as model network, consisting of two reciprocally inhibitory spiking neurons may express a peak of synchronization in a narrow range of low spiking frequencies in addition to classically described plateau of synchrony at a wide range of high frequencies. Occurrence of the low frequency peak of synchrony requires a moderate-to-strong inhibitory coupling and relatively fast synapses. This novel possibility of synchronization in a narrow range of network parameters may have an important implication in discrimination and encoding of signals of precise intensity, as well as in altering network ability to process information.", "paper_title": "Inhibitory network of spiking neurons may express a sharp peak of synchrony at low frequency band", "paper_id": "WOS:000272176000001"}
