In this paper, we consider more realistic WSN environments where the sensor nodes are moving around, which can disappear due to wear-out failures. By enhancing a variant of random waypoint model (Li et al., 2005), we propose Mobility Resilient Coverage Control (MRCC) to assure K-coverage in the presence of mobility. Our basic goals are (1) to elaborate the probability of breaking K-coverage with moving-in and moving-out probabilities and (2) to issue wake-up calls to sleeping sensors to meet user requirement of K-coverage even in the presence of mobility. Furthermore, to show the impact of wear-out failures on the coverage achieved, we adopt a lognormal distribution to depict the conditional probability of failures and observe the influence of reduced number of active nodes on coverage. Our experiments with Network Survivability - Double Link Failure show that MRCC achieves better coverage by 1.4% with 22% fewer active sensors than that of the existing Coverage Configuration Protocol (CCP). By taking reliability of nodes into account, the performance drop with respect to coverage is 3.7% (for coverage>1) while the reduction in the number of sensor nodes is 18.19% when compared with pure MRCC. Comparing CCP and MRCC with reliability, we observe a 3.4% reduction in coverage for the average probabilistic case and 5.78% for the individual probabilistic case, while achieving a 12.82% and 28.2% reduction in number of nodes, respectively.", "paper_title": "Assuring K-coverage in the presence of mobility and wear-out failures in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000279970700006"}
