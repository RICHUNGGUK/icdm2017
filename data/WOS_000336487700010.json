Whether the individual choose to change the evolutionary rule and migrate is determined by the relation between its payoff and aspiration level. The results show that the cooperation frequency can hold unchange with the increasing of temptation to defect. The individual chooses to adopt DEA efficient rule and to migrate that can induce the emergence of cooperation as the payoff is lower than its aspiration.", "paper_title": "Effects of aspiration-induced adaptation and migration on the evolution of cooperation", "paper_id": "WOS:000336487700010"}
