The use of remote sensing and geographical information systems enables rapid and effective mapping of the geomorphology of reefs that can be used as a basis for biodiversity and habitat assessments. However, pixel-based approaches have not been appropriate for detailed mapping of such complex systems. An object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach was used in this study to map intra-reef geomorphology of coral reefs across the Torres Strait region using Landsat ETM+ imagery. By combining image analysis techniques and a non-parametric neural network classifier and incorporating additional spatial information such as context, shape and texture, the accuracy of the segmentation and classification was improved considerably. A large-scale synoptic map of 10 geomorphological classes was produced for Torres Strait with an overall accuracy of 75%. The OBIA approach employed in this research has enabled the geomorphology of reef platforms to be mapped for the first time at such accuracy and descriptive resolution.", "paper_title": "Improving the synoptic mapping of coral reef geomorphology using object-based image analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000295467000006"}
