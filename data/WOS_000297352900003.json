The approach is a modification of the recently proposed missing data methods for exploratory data analysis (MEDA). MEDA is useful to identify the structure in the data and also to interpret the contribution of each latent variable. In this paper, MEDA is augmented with dummy variables to find the data variables related to a given deviation detected among observations, for instance, the difference between one cluster of observations and the bulk of the data. The MEDA extension, referred to as observation-based MEDA or oMEDA, can be performed in several ways, one of which is theoretically shown to be equivalent to a comparison of means between groups. The use of the proposed approach is demonstrated with a number of examples with simulated data and a real data set of archeological artifacts.
