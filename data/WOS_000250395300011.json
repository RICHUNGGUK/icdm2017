A new switched system model is proposed to represent the continuous-time dynamic and discrete-event dynamic of a walking biped as a whole, which is helpful to analyze the closed-loop stability of the biped locomotion. A type-2 fuzzy switching control system is proposed for the switched system model to guarantee the gait stability and to achieve a robust control performance with a simplified control scheme. Finally, we propose a new fuzzy c-mean variance algorithm for the type-2 fuzzy system modeling to capture the variance of each clustering means, which can translate random uncertainties of original data into rule uncertainties. Simulation results are reported to show the performance of the proposed control system model and algorithms.", "paper_title": "A type-2 fuzzy switching control system for biped robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000250395300011"}
