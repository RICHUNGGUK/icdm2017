In this work, we discuss how to incorporate cylindrically shaped focusing detectors in the mathematical modelling of photoacoustics and derive approximative reconstruction formulas. Moreover, we show how such focusing detectors combined with a focused illumination can yield a quantitative reconstruction of the material properties (the transport coefficient and the product of the Gruneisen parameter and the absorption coefficient) of a weakly scattering medium.", "paper_title": "Modelling the Effect of Focusing Detectors in Photoacoustic Sectional Imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000352213100001"}
