The mixed time delays consist of both discrete and distributed delays. The Markov chain in the underlying neural networks is finite piecewise homogeneous. By introducing a Lyapunov functional that accounts for the mixed time delays, a delay-dependent passivity condition is derived in terms of the linear matrix inequality approach. The case of Markov chain with partially unknown transition probabilities is also considered. All the results presented depend upon not only discrete delay but also distributed delay. A numerical example is included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Passivity Analysis for Discrete-Time Stochastic Markovian Jump Neural Networks with Mixed Time Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000295584100005"}
