It is however less widely known that Salomaa started his research work in the area of multiple-valued logic, in which he received his PhD degree 1960 from the University of Turku, Finland. In this way, research in multiple-valued logic provided foundations for later work of Professor Salomaa. The paper presents a short summary of the work of Arto Salomaa in multiple-valued logic.", "paper_title": "Contributions of Arto Salomaa to Multiple-Valued Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000344715900001"}
