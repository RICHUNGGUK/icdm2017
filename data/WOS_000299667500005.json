A series of coronal CT scan images of a 24 year old woman was used to construct the 3D model. The Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches were used, respectively, to find the trajectories of micro-particles and concentration of nano-particles. The total and regional deposition fractions of micro/nanoparticles were evaluated and the major hot spots for the deposition of inhaled particles were found. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
