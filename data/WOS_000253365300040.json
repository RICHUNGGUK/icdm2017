Such prior information is expressed in the form of exact linear restrictions. The knowledge of covariance matrix of measurement errors that is associated with explanatory variables is used to construct the consistent estimators. Some consistent estimators are suggested which satisfy the exact linear restrictions also. Their asymptotic properties are derived and analytically analyzed under a multivariate ultrastructural model with not necessarily normally distributed measurement errors. The finite sample properties of the estimators are studied through a Monte-Carlo simulation experiment. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
