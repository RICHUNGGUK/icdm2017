There are two important mechanisms to implement Cl: recommender and reputation systems. Recommender systems are used to provide filtered information from a large amount of elements. The recommendations are intended to provide interesting elements to users. Recommendation systems can be developed using different techniques and algorithms where the selection of these techniques depends on the area in which they will be applied. This work presents iPixel Recommender Engine, which is focused on the medical field. iPixel Recommendation Engine supports the process of differential diagnosis by recommending mammographic evaluations. Each mammogram is collectively tagged by the users' community with a semantic sense; this feature allows iPixel acquires collective knowledge. iPixel can associate more than one feature with each mammogram. This work also presents a qualitative evaluation, where the basic features that a recommendation system should have in the medical field were obtained. Finally, a comparison was carried out with other similar recommender systems in order to know the Pixel advantages. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
