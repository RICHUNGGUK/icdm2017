The R-CAT builds resilient multicast trees by considering the capacity of participating nodes and locating the high capacity nodes toward the upper parts of the trees. The resulting trees become shallow and more resilient since the number of affected nodes is minimized when nodes leave or fail. We have implemented R-CAT on top of Splitstream, a high bandwidth streaming system using Pastry, and evaluated our scheme in terms of packet loss rate and end-to-end delay. The performance results show that R-CAT is more resilient and provides lower end-to-end delay under various group dynamics.", "paper_title": "Improving resiliency using capacity-aware multicast tree in P2P-based streaming environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000241591300095"}
