This paper reviews the development of market segmentation techniques and identifies the computational issues of the applications of market segmentation. A multidimensional unified framework for market segmentation is proposed based on the relationship among segmentation variables, data measures, and the multi-objective optimization techniques implemented. We conduct an empirical comparison of two prominent methods: a concomitant finite mixture model and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The result shows that the proposed framework helps to understand different segmentation models and solutions and to guide the development of new market segmentation solution techniques.
