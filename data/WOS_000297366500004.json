The proposed method uses parity codes in four directions in a data part to assure the reliability of memories. The proposed method is very powerful in error detection while its error correction coverage is also acceptable considering its low computing latency. HVD code is useful for applications whose high error detection coverage is very important such as memory systems. Of course, this code can be used in combination with other protection codes which have high correction coverage and low detection coverage. The proposed method is evaluated using more than one billion multiple fault injection experiments. Multiple bit flips were randomly injected in different segments of a memory system and the fault detection and correction coverages are calculated. Results show that 100% of the injected faults can be detected. We proved that, this method can correct up to three bit upsets. Some hardware implementation issues are investigated to show tradeoffs between different implementation parameters of HVD method.", "paper_title": "HVD: horizontal-vertical-diagonal error detecting and correcting code to protect against with soft errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000297366500004"}
