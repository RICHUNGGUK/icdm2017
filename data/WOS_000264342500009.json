It characterizes the efficiency of detecting the presence of a target in a region of interest. Traditionally, stationary sensor networks are used to perform such sensing tasks. Consequently, nearly all research literature for the target detection problem has focused on stationary sensor networks. This paper addresses the problem of detecting the presence/absence of a target using a mobile sensor network. An analytic method is proposed to model the detection latency based on a collaborative sensing architecture. Detection latency for different node mobility models is presented. The accuracy of the analytic model is verified by simulations. This paper also compares the performance of mobile and stationary sensor networks. The comparison shows that if the target is present at the worst possible location in a given deployment, then detection latency of mobile sensor networks is considerably shorter as compared to that of stationary networks with the same number of nodes.", "paper_title": "Modeling Detection Latency with Collaborative Mobile Sensing Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000264342500009"}
