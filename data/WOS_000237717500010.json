We show that this is also possible in the calculus of Mobile Ambients (MA), without using communication or restriction. Following Palamidessi's methods, we deduce that there is no encoding satisfying certain conditions from MA into CCS. We also show that the calculus of Boxed Ambients is more expressive than its communication-free fragment. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
