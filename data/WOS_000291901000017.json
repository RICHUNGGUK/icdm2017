For standard collision processes, the Boltzmann equation itself fails to meet the second requirement for d = 2, 3 spatial dimensions, on account of its setting in 2d, while for d = 1 the first requirement is violated because the Boltzmann equation then lacks the convergence-to-equilibrium property that forms the substructure of simplified models. In this article we present a numerical investigation of a new one-dimensional prototype of the Boltzmann equation. The underlying molecular model is endowed with random collisions, which have been fabricated such that the corresponding Boltzmann equation exhibits convergence to Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium solutions. The new Boltzmann model is approximated by means of a discontinuous Galerkin (DC) finite-element method. To validate the one-dimensional Boltzmann model, we conduct numerical experiments and compare the results with Monte-Carlo simulations of equivalent molecular-dynamics models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
