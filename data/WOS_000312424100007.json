The individual design of the UPFC controller, using the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) technique over a wide range of operating conditions, is discussed. The effectiveness and validity of the proposed controller on damping low-frequency oscillations is tested through a time-domain simulation and eigenvalue analysis under loading conditions and a large disturbance. The simulation results, carried out using MATLAB/Simulink software, reveal that the tuned ICA-based UPFC controller has an excellent capability of damping power system low-frequency oscillations and greatly enhances the dynamic stability of the power systems.", "paper_title": "Optimal design of UPFC-based damping controller using imperialist competitive algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000312424100007"}
