Multiple Wiimotes are used to form a vision system to perform motion capture in 3D space. A hybrid algorithm for calibrating a multi-camera stereo vision system has been developed based on Zhang's and Svoboda's calibration algorithms. This hybrid algorithm has been evaluated and shown accuracy improvement over Svoboda's algorithm for motion capture with multiple cameras. The captured motion data are used to automatically generate an assembly simulation of objects represented by CAD models in real time. The Wiimote-based motion capture system is practically attractive because it is inexpensive, wireless, and easily portable. Application examples have been developed for a single vision system with two Wiimotes to track the assembly of a microsatellite prototype frame and for an integrated vision system with four Wiimotes to track the assembly of a bookshelf.", "paper_title": "Wii remote-based low-cost motion capture for automated assembly simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000318575200003"}
