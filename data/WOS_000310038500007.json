An efficient remeshing approach for modified solid models using existing prior existing meshes is proposed in this paper to resolve this issue. It is mainly achieved via three main steps: different face (between the input model and its modification) identification, local destruction zone generation, and local mesh regeneration. In this approach, by carefully selecting a destruction zone to be removed from the original mesh model, a final geometric adaptive mesh model of the modified model is generated, which is very important for downstream analysis accuracy control. Additionally, the complex boundary of the variation region that needs to be remeshed is set up by merging the boundaries of modified region and the destruction zone without using complex intersection operations, which ensure the approach's robustness. Experimental results on practical engineering parts are also shown to demonstrate the method's performance. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.
