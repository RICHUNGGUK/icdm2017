Recently, Gutman and Wagner proposed the concept of the matching energy (M E) and pointed out that the chemical applications of M E go back to the 1970s. Let G be a simple graph of order n and mu(1,)mu(2),...,mu(n) be the roots of its matching polynomial. The matching energy is defined as the sum Sigma(n)(i=1)vertical bar mu(i)vertical bar. In this-paper, we characterize the graphs with the extremal matching energy among all bicyclic graphs, and completely determine the graphs with the minimal and maximal matching energy in bicyclic graphs.", "paper_title": "Extremal Matching Energy of Bicyclic Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000328007000023"}
