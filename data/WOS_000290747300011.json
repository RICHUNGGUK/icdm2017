With LigBuilder 2.0, the synthesis accessibility of designed compounds can be analyzed, and a cavity detection procedure is implemented to detect the positions and shapes of the binding sites on the surface of a given protein structure and to quantitatively estimate drugability. Ligands are designed to best fit the detected cavities using a set of rules for evaluation. Drug-like and privileged fragments are used to construct the ligands with the aid of internal and external absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/T) and drug-like filters.", "paper_title": "LigBuilder 2: A Practical de Novo Drug Design Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000290747300011"}
