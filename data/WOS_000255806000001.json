Touch is a common medium used by the general population and the sensory impaired. Tactile substitution can be used by the blind or deaf in order to: (a) enhance access to computer graphical user interfaces and (b) enhance mobility in controlled environments. The skin nerves can be stimulated through six types of receptors by mechanical, electrical, or thermal stimuli. Modalities, such as vibration and pressure, can stimulate these receptors. Advances in tactile communication using implementations of the actuating devices have been developed via several new technologies. These technologies include static or vibrating pins, focused ultrasound, electrical stimulation, surface acoustic waves, and other. This paper is a review of the state-of-the-art in the physiological and technological principles, considerations and characteristics, as well as latest implementations of microactuator-based tactile graphic displays. We also review fabrication technologies, in order to demonstrate the potential and limitations in tactile applications. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
