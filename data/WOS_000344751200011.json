The upper bound of state delay is assumed to be available. A linear quadratic cost function is specified as the performance index of the closed-loop system. Attention is focused on the fuzzy state feedback controller design via parallel distributed compensation scheme, which not only guarantees the regular, impulse-free, and asymptotically stable of the closed-loop fuzzy singular delay system, but also provides an optimized upper bound of the guaranteed cost function for the possibility of feedback gain variation and all admissible uncertainties. All derived sufficient conditions are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design scheme.", "paper_title": "Nonfragile Control With Guaranteed Cost of T-S Fuzzy Singular Systems Based on Parallel Distributed Compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000344751200011"}
