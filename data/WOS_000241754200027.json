But the existing MIGPs, which are constructed mostly based on database middleware, are very difficult to guarantee local hospital data security and remote accessing legality. In this paper, a MIGP based on the WSRF-compliant HL7 (Health Level 7) grid middleware is proposed, which aims to combine the existing HL7 protocol and grid technology to realize medical data and image retrieval through the communications and interoperations with different hospital information systems. We also design the architecture and bring forward a metadata-based scheduling mechanism for our grid platforms. At last, experimental MIGPs are constructed to evaluate the performance of our method.", "paper_title": "MIGP: Medical Image Grid Platform based on HL7 grid middleware", "paper_id": "WOS:000241754200027"}
