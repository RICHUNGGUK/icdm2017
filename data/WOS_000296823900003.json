This definition also allows to deal with maps, intuitively considered as cellular automata, even if they did not match the usual definition, like the Margolus billiard-ball. One of the main results is an extension of Hedlund's theorem for these cellular automata.", "paper_title": "Cellular Automata on a G-Set", "paper_id": "WOS:000296823900003"}
