The input set may exhibit significant shape variability where the shapes do not admit proper spatial alignment and the corresponding parts in any pair of shapes may be geometrically dissimilar. Our algorithm can handle such challenging input sets since, first, we perform co-analysis in a descriptor space, where a combination of shape descriptors relates the parts independently of their pose, location, and cardinality. Secondly, we exploit a key enabling feature of the input set, namely, dissimilar parts may be \"linked\" through third-parties present in the set. The links are derived from the pairwise similarities between the parts' descriptors. To reveal such linkages, which may manifest themselves as anisotropic and non-linear structures in the descriptor space, we perform spectral clustering with the aid of diffusion maps. We show that with our approach, we are able to co-segment sets of shapes that possess significant variability, achieving results that are close to those of a supervised approach.", "paper_title": "Unsupervised Co-Segmentation of a Set of Shapes via Descriptor-Space Spectral Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000297681100004"}
