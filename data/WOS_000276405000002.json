The addition of more processing cores has emerged as the primary way to boost the computing power of microprocessors, but first the research community has to overcome certain hardware and software challenges along the way to on-chip scalable systems. The primary consequence is that applications will increasingly need to be parallelized to fully exploit processor throughput gains that are now becoming available. However, parallel code is more difficult to write than that of serial code. Writing applications in a way that permits different parts of a computing task be divided up and executed simultaneously across multiple cores is not new. Efforts today focus on translating the knowledge of building off-chip supercomputing based on multiprocessors to on-chip hypercomputing based on multicore processors. While the software may present the biggest challenge, there are also hardware changes that need to be made to overcome issues such as scalability and portability. The aim of this chapter is to explain the primary difficulties and issues of manycore programming. Firstly, the unsolved problem of the parallel computation model and its implications for issues such as portability and performance prediction is discussed. Secondly, the obstacles incurred by parallel hardware architectures on software development are covered. Thirdly, the main traps and pitfalls of multicore programming are addressed. Finally, the human factor in the success of the parallel revolution is presented.", "paper_title": "Pitfalls and Issues of Manycore Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000276405000002"}
