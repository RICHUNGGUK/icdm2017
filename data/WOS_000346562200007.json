Extant research has approached writer identification by using writing styles as a discriminative function between writers. In contrast, the authors model writing styles as a shared component of an individual's handwriting. They develop a theoretical framework for this conceptualisation and model it by using a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). In this text-independent, unsupervised model each writer's handwriting is modelled as a distribution over finite writing styles that are shared among writers. They test their model on a new online handwriting dataset IBM_UB_1 and also offer benchmark comparisons by using the IAM-OnDB database. Their experiments show comparable results to the current benchmarks and demonstrate the efficacy of explicitly modelling the shared writing styles.", "paper_title": "A hierarchical Bayesian approach to online writer identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000346562200007"}
