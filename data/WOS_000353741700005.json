It is important to make efficient use of all the available network capacity, using multiple physical paths whenever possible, but traditional forwarding mechanisms using a single path are not able to take advantages of available multiple physical paths. The state-of-the-art MPTCP (Multipath Transmission Control Protocol) solution uses multiple randomly selected paths, but cannot give total aggregated capacity. Moreover, it works as a TCP process, and so does not support other protocols like UDP. This paper presents an alternative solution using adaptive multipath routing in a Layer-2 network with static (capacity and latency) metrics, which adapts link and path failures. This solution provides in-network aggregated path capacity to individual flows, as well as scalability and multitenancy, by separating end-station services from the provider's network. The results of deploying a proof-of-concept prototype on a data center testbed, which show the aggregated path capacity per flow, demonstrate an improvement of 14% in the worst bisection bandwidth utilization, compared to the MPTCP with 5 subflows.
