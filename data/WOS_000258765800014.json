Dynamic frequency-Voltage Scaling (DVS) balances performance and energy consumption by varying PEs' frequency-voltage workpoints to save energy while meeting performance requirements. We consider multi-task CMP applications with unknown workloads, and dynamically set workpoints to minimize ET2. Heuristic policies for serial/parallel task-graphs are investigated. We compare these policies to a theoretical bound and show that they achieve good result,; with low complexity. In most cases the simplest policy, which usually assigns constant workpoints, is also the most cost-effective one.", "paper_title": "Low-complexity policies for energy-performance tradeoff in chip-multi-processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000258765800014"}
