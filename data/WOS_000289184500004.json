The capillary model is a circular mesh consisting of concentric rings with an increasing diameter. Each of the rings has uniformly distributed bifurcation nodes to represent capillary vessels. The model is customized using the data that has been measured from confocal microscopic images of a mouse retina. The capillary model developed can be connected to networks of larger vessels of the vasculature such as arterial and venous networks to form a complete model of the retinal network. A method to automate such interface connections between capillary and other vascular networks using connecting vessels (i.e., pre-capillary and post-capillary) is also presented in the paper. Such a detailed image-based capillary model together with the arterial and venular networks can be used for various circulation simulations to obtain accurate information on hemodynamic quantities such as the spatial distribution of pressure and flow in the vasculature for both physiological and pathological conditions. The method presented for the development of the capillary model can also be adopted for vasculatures of other organs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
