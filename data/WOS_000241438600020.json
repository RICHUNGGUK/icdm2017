The proposed solution represents a sufficient condition for a given system state to be safe and is based on an adaptation of the well-known Banker's approach for deadlock avoidance. The time complexity of the proposed solution is proved to be polynomial with the size of the Place/Transition net model.", "paper_title": "A polynomial deadlock avoidance method for a class of nonsequential resource allocation systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241438600020"}
