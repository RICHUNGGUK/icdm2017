Here, we present a publicly available web application that facilitates a high resolution mapping of measured molecular masses to peptides and proteins, irrespectively of the enzyme/digestion method used. Furthermore, multi-filtering may be applied in terms of measured mass tolerance, molecular mass and isoelectric point range as well as pattern matching to refine the results. This approach serves complementary to the existing solutions for protein identification and gives insights in novel peptides discovery and protein identification at the cases where the identification scores from the other approaches may be below significance threshold. Peptide Finder has been proven useful in proteomics procedures with experimental data from MALDI-TOF.", "paper_title": "Peptide Finder: mapping measured molecular masses to peptides and proteins", "paper_id": "WOS:000259581900026"}
