We characterize the performance of optically gain-clamped EDFAs, in terms of the signal quality of surviving channels with respect to input power variations, as a function of the feedback cavity loss. This is carried out for both a single EDFA as well as cascaded EDFAs in a realistic network scenario, where bursts are asynchronously added and dropped at each node. We show that the optimum feedback cavity loss is not only a function of input power fluctuation and feedback wavelength but also the number of hops through the network.
