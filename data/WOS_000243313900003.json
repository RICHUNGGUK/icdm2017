Many TPM algorithms appearing in the literature are based on tree automata. For efficiency, these automata should be deterministic, yet deterministic root-to-frontier tree automata (DRFTAS) are less powerful than nondeterministic ones, and no root-to-frontier TPM algorithm using a DRFTA has appeared so far. Hoffmann & O'Donnell presented a root-to-frontier TPM algorithm based on an Aho-Corasick automaton recognizing tree stringpaths. No relationship between this algorithm and algorithms using tree automata has however been described. We show that a specific DRFTA can be used for stringpath matching in a root-to-frontier TPM algorithm. This new algorithm provides a missing link between TPM algorithms using stringpath automata and those using tree automata. We also investigate the correspondence between the automata used by the two algorithms.", "paper_title": "Two related algorithms for root-to-frontier tree pattern matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000243313900003"}
