Furthermore, the authors showed that the BP threshold for code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems is improved up to the optimal one via spatial coupling. In this letter, a phenomenological model for elucidating the essence of these phenomenon, called threshold improvement, is proposed. The main result implies that threshold improvement occurs for spatially-coupled general graphical models.", "paper_title": "A Phenomenological Study on Threshold Improvement via Spatial Coupling", "paper_id": "WOS:000304572900015"}
