The first problem addresses a class of the two-Stage scheduling problems in which the first stage is job production and the second stage is job delivery. For the case that jobs are processed on a single machine and delivered by a single vehicle to one customer area, with the objective of minimizing the time when all jobs are completed and delivered to the customer area and the vehicle returns to the machine, an approximation algorithm with a worst-case ratio of 5/3 is known and no approximation can have a worst-case of 3/2 unless P = NP. We present an improved approximation algorithm with a worst-case ratio of 53/35, which only leaves a gap of 1/70. The second problem is a single machine scheduling problem subject to a period of maintenance. The objective is to minimize the total completion time. The best known approximation algorithm has a worst-case ratio of 20/17. We present a polynomial time approximation scheme. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
