The primary network consists of n randomly distributed primary nodes which can operate as if the secondary network is absent. However, the secondary network with a higher density m = n(beta), beta > 1 is required to adjust its protocol. By considering that both the primary and the secondary networks move according to random walk mobility model, we propose a multi-hop transmission scheme, and show that the secondary network can achieve the same throughput and delay tradeoff scaling law as in stand-alone network D-s(m) = Theta(m lambda(s)(m)). Furthermore, for primary network, it is shown that the tradeoff scaling law is given by D-p(n) = Theta(root n log n lambda(p)(n), when the primary node is chosen as relay node. If the relay node is a secondary node, the scaling law is D-p(n) = Theta(root n(beta) log n lambda(p)(n)). The novelties of this paper lie in: (i) detailed study of the delay scaling law for the primary network in the complex scenario where both the primary and the secondary networks are mobile; (ii) the impact of buffer delay on the two networks due to the presence of preservation region. We explicitly analyze the buffer delay and obtain an expression as D-SR(II)(m) = Theta(1/root n(beta-1) a(s)(m)). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
