A novel hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) was adapted to search for the optimal type of kernel function and kernel parameter values of SVR to increase the accuracy of SVR. The proposed model was tested at an electricity load forecasting competition announced on the EUNITE network. The results showed that the new HGA-SVR model Outperforms the previous models. Specifically, the new HGA-SVR model can successfully identify the optimal type of kernel function and all the optimal values of the parameters of SVR with the lowest prediction error values in electricity load forecasting.
