The maximum arc-chromatic number of digraphs over the k-digraphs and the (k boolean OR 1)-digraphs are denoted by Phi(k) and Phi(boolean OR)(k, 1), respectively. In this paper we first show that Phi(k) = theta(2k) = 2t when k =((2t-1)(t-1)) for t >= 2, where theta is the function defined by theta(n) = min{t : ([(t)(t/2)]) >= n}. Then we prove that Phi(boolean OR)(k, k) <= theta(2k) + 1 for k >= 1. The corollary of these results proves weaker versions of two conjectures of Bessy et al., i.e., Phi(k + 1) <= Phi(k) + 1 holds for almost all k, and Phi(k, k) <= Phi(k) + 1 holds when k = ((2t-1)(t-1)) for t >= 2.
