The results of this paper extend former results relative to the positive invariance of polyhedral sets with respect to linear systems defined in ordered semi-rings as well as former results relative to nonlinear dynamical systems defined in the real n-space. The nu-monotonicity of nonlinear maps is also been investigated. It is shown that, opposite to the case of linear maps, the nu-monotonicity of a nonlinear map is not a necessary condition for a set defined by nonlinear inequalities to be positively invariant.", "paper_title": "Invariance and monotonicity of nonlinear iterated systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239627400052"}
