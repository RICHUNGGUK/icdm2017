Let Gbe a graph modeling a sensor network. An -distance edge coloring of Gis a coloring of the edges of Gsuch that any two edges within distance of each other are assigned different colors. The parameter is chosen, so that the links corresponding to two edges that are assigned the same color do not interfere. We investigate the -distance edge coloring problem on several families of graphs that can be used as topologies in sensor deployment. We focus on determining the minimum number of colors needed and optimal coloring algorithms.
