This paper proposes a function call optimization method in behavioral synthesis from large sequential programs with a number of functions. We formulate the optimization problem using integer linear programming. Our experimental results show the reduction in the circuit area by up to 44.6%, compared with a traditional method.", "paper_title": "Function call optimization for efficient behavioral synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093700039"}
