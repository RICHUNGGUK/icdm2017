The main purpose of this study is to find Out the types of AMT to adopt to improve the manufacturing parameters that have significant impact on firm performance. In the research firstly, the current situation in AMT use in SMEs is examined. Secondly, the relationship between manufacturing parameters and firm performance is investigated. Finally, the relationship between the types of AMT and manufacturing parameters is investigated. The sampling pool includes 102 manufacturing SMEs that introduced AMTs. Our findings show that local area network, computer-aided design, and computer-aided manufacturing technologies are the most commonly used and automated storage. robotics. and wide area network technologies are the least commonly used AMTs in SMEs. In addition, the statistical association between manufacturing parameters and firm performance indicate that product design performance, fixture utilization, setup and production planning performance have positive impact, while capacity utilization and finished product inventory need have negative impact on firm performance.
