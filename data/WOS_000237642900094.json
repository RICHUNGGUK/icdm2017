The main advantage of this approach to source code augmentation is the missing requirement for an internal representation of the original program. We consider this work as the basis for further investigations into how far this technique can be extended in the context of more sophisticated transformations, for example, the automatic generation of adjoint codes. Our prototype tool AD_C_ANTLR currently F accepts a subset of the ANSI C standard. We discuss its theoretical basis, and we present a case study to underline the elegance of the parser-based approach to source augmentation.", "paper_title": "Tangent-linear models by augmented LL-parsers", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900094"}
