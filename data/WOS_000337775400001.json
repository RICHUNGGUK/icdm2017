The concepts of stochastic finite-time stability and stochastic finite-time boundedness are first given for neural networks. Then, applying the Lyapunov approach and the linear matrix inequality technique, sufficient criteria on stochastic finite-time boundedness are provided for the class of nominal or uncertain discrete-time neural networks with Markovian jump parameters and time-delays. It is shown that the derived conditions are characterized in terms of the solution to these linear matrix inequalities. Finally, numerical examples are included to illustrate the validity of the presented results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
