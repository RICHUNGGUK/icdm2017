A class of fullerene graphs with icosahedral symmetry is called icosahedral fullerenes, and they are determined by a vector (i, j), 0 <= i <= j and j > 0. For i = j or i = 0, the fullerenes are of full icosahedral symmetry. We show that the diameter of an (i, j)-icosahedral fullerene graph of full icosahedral symmetry is 4i + 6j - 1. We conclude the paper by stating a conjecture on the diameter of any fullerene graph.", "paper_title": "Diameter of Fullerene Graphs with Full Icosahedral Symmetry", "paper_id": "WOS:000325443000016"}
