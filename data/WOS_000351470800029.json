We show that the mutual orthogonality condition A(i) A(j)* + A(j) A(i)* = 0 for distinct basis matrices is not only sufficient but also necessary for fast decodability. We build on this to show that for full-rate (l = n(2)) transmission, the decoding complexity can be no better than vertical bar S vertical bar(n2 + 1), where vertical bar S vertical bar is the size of the effective real signal constellation. We also show that for full-rate transmission, g-group decodability, as defined by Jithamithra and Rajan, is impossible for any g >= 2. We then use the theory of Azumaya algebras to derive bounds on the maximum number of groups into which the basis matrices can be partitioned so that the matrices in different groups are mutually orthogonal-a key measure of fast decodability. We show that in general, this maximum number is of the order of only the 2-adic value of n. In the case where the matrices A(i) arise from a division algebra, which is most desirable for diversity, we show that the maximum number of groups is only 4. As a result, the decoding complexity for this case is no better than vertical bar S vertical bar(inverted right perpendicularl/2inverted left perpendicular) for any rate l.", "paper_title": "Bounds on Fast Decodability of Space-Time Block Codes, Skew-Hermitian Matrices, and Azumaya Algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000351470800029"}
