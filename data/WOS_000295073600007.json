A straightforward computer-aided polyp detection (CAD) scheme was developed that consisted of colon wall segmentation, a polyp-specific volumetric filter, and the counting and thresholding of cluster volume sizes. 65 patients had undergone the bowel cleaning scheme without fecal tagging and the optical colonoscopy (OC) and CT colonography (CTC) were performed. The polyp sizes determined by OC were used as reference measurements. The CTC dataset with 103 polyps were divided into training and test datasets. After tuning for the optimal parameter settings, the per-polyp sensitivities of the developed CAD scheme for clinically relevant polyps (>= 6 mm) were 100% at 8.5 false positives (FPs)/patient using the training dataset, and 93.3% at 7.7 FPs/patient using the test dataset. The developed CAD scheme was found to have a relatively high detection performance, easily optimized parameter settings, and an easily understood internal operation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
