The present findings indicate that OsH and PsH are not only concentration-dependent antioxidants, but also protect GtH with Trolox and TocH synergistically. Especially, the reason for the higher antioxidant capacity of OsH than PsH can be ascribed to the fact that OsH contains a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrogen atom. Furthermore, the number of trapped peroxyl radicals by Schiff base, n, can be calculated on the basis of chemical kinetic deduction. As a result, n of OsH and PsH increase in SDS micelle but decrease in CTAB, implicating that their antioxidant capacities are not only related to their structures but also to the charge property of micelles, dispersed GtH also affect their antioxidant behavior prominently. In addition, the synergistic antioxidant capacities of OsH and PsH used in conjuction with Trolox and TocH were investigated in the above micelles, and, it was found that PsH + Trolox in Triton X-100 and CTAB exhibited a mutual promoting effect, whereas OsH + Trolox in SDS plays a mutual demoting effect. Nevertheless, the n of Schiff bases or other antioxidants in the mixed usage are rather different from that used alone, implying that an interaction among these compounds exists in protecting GtH against AAPH-induced peroxidation.", "paper_title": "How many free radicals can be trapped by (hydroxylphenylimino)methylphenol in the free-radical-induced peroxidation of triolein in micelles?", "paper_id": "WOS:000246199000005"}
