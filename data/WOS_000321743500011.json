In this case study, we examine how different generations of information and communication technologies (ICTs), ranging from e-mail to micro-blogging, can help address these challenges. Twenty-one interviews with employees from a multinational company revealed that although people think social media can better address these challenges than older tools, the full potential of social media for supporting knowledge sharing has yet to be achieved. When examining the interconnections among different ICTs, we found that employees choice of a combination of ICTs, as affected by their functional backgrounds, could create technological divides among them and separate resources. This finding indicates that having more ICTs is not necessarily better. ICT integration, as well as support for easy navigation, is crucial for effective knowledge search and sharing. Adaptation to local culture is also needed to ensure worldwide participation in knowledge sharing.", "paper_title": "The use of different information and communication technologies to support knowledge sharing in organizations: From e-mail to micro-blogging", "paper_id": "WOS:000321743500011"}
