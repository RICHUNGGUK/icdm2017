We developed a novel design methodology for dependable wireless communication systems which exploits the mutual trade-offs of system performance, hardware reliability, and implementation complexity. Our cross-layer approach combines resilience techniques on hardware level with algorithmic techniques exploiting the available flexibility in the receiver. The overhead is minimized by recovering only from those hardware errors that have a strong impact on the system behavior. We apply our new methodology on a double-iterative MIMO-BICM receiver which belongs to the most complex systems in current communication standards.", "paper_title": "A Cross-Layer Reliability Design Methodology for Efficient, Dependable Wireless Receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000341390100020"}
