This SIP-based MIP6-MANET system is an integration and implementation of Mobile IPv6 and SIP-based mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). To support mobile multimedia services, this work is the first result to combine session initiation protocol (SIP) into the integrated MIP6-MANET system. Our actual system implementation was built on the Linux OS (2.4.22 Kernel), the Orinoco IEEE 802.1 lb wireless card, and MIPL (mobile IPv6 for Linux), where the router advertisement and solicitation and binding update packets were adaptively modified and redefined to achieve the real implementation of the SIP-based MIP6-MANET integrated system. Our SIP-based MIP6-MANET system utilizes the IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration (SAA) mechanism to automatically get a care-of-address (CoA) without CoA address management from the IPv4-based DHCP server. The SIP-based MIP6-MANET system supports the IP mobility mechanism which maintains a session connection when a mobile host roams from one MANET subnet to another. The key contributions of the SIP-based MIP6-MANET system are stated as follows: (1) This system provides an efficient handoff mechanism to reduce the handoff time when a mobile node (MN) roams between different MANETs; (2) Our system can efficiently reduce the triangle routing delay when an MN roams to a foreign MANET; (3) It obviously improves the throughput and arrival rate between an MN and a corresponding node; (4) The response time of our system is decreased when an MN roams to a foreign MANET. Performance analysis also illustrated the performance, which showed that the integrated system is more efficient in terms of handoff probability, triangle routing delay, throughput, and response time than traditional MIPv4-based wireless infrastructure systems.
