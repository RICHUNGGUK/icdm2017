Specifically, first a language obtained by extending (positive) DATALOG with intuitive and efficient constructs (namely, stratified negation, constraints, and exclusive disjunction) is introduced. Next, a further restricted language only using a restricted form of disjunction to define (nondeterministically) subsets (or partitions) of relations is investigated. This language, called NP Datalog, captures the power of DATALOG(-) in expressing search and optimization problems. A system prototype implementing NP Datalog is presented. The system translates NP Datalog queries into Optimization Programming Language (OPL) programs which are executed by the ILOG OPL Development Studio. Our proposal combines easy formulation of problems, expressed by means of a declarative logic language, with the efficiency of the ILOG System. Several experiments show the effectiveness of this approach.", "paper_title": "NP Datalog: A logic language for expressing NP search and optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000275990700001"}
