By using the Minkowski fractal iteration it is possible to obtain compact resonators. Furthermore, the second harmonic is highly attenuated, thus enhancing the rejection in the upper band. A fourth order filter using two dual-mode fractal resonators has been fabricated to illustrate these results. We use the suspended substrate technology to design these resonators, but the results can be extended to other technologies.
