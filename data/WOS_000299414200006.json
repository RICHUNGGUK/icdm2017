A simulation study suggests that our program performs significantly better than existing software on biologically relevant data. Finally, we demonstrate the application of such methods in the context of the evolution of the Aegilops/Triticum genera.", "paper_title": "Fast computation of minimum hybridization networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000299414200006"}
