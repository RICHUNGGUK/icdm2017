The spatial modulation transmits its information bits by transmit antenna selection in addition to symbol modulation, whereas the full-duplex (FD) technique suppresses self-interference leaking from the transmitter to the receiver in an adaptive fashion. A closed-form solution is derived for the instantaneous maximum mutual information possible with a 2x2 antenna configuration. The results show higher efficiencies in terms of outage and ergodic maximum mutual information in comparison with conventional FD. Simulations also compare this technique with multiple-input-multiple-output half duplex, where further potential is demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Spatial Modulated Full Duplex", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681700024"}
