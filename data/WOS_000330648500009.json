Traditionally, the task is completed by triangulation whose accuracy has its limitation in some applications. In this paper, we present a framework that incorporates surface characteristics such as Gaussian and mean curvatures into 3D point reconstruction to enhance the reconstruction accuracy. A Gaussian and mean curvature estimation scheme suitable to the proposed framework is also introduced in this paper. Based on this estimation scheme and the proposed framework, the 3D point recovery from image correspondences is formulated as an optimization problem with the surface curvatures modeled as soft constraints. To analyze the performance of proposed 3D reconstruction approach, we generated some synthetic data, including the points on the surfaces of a plane, a cylinder and a sphere, to test the approach. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework can indeed improve the accuracy of 3D point reconstruction. Some real-image data were also tested and the results also confirm this point.", "paper_title": "Improving three-dimensional point reconstruction from image correspondences using surface curvatures", "paper_id": "WOS:000330648500009"}
