Instead of recovering each individual frame independently, neighboring frames in both the view and temporal directions are used to calculate a prediction of a target frame, and the difference is used to drive a residual-based compressed-sensing reconstruction. The proposed approach demonstrates a significant gain in reconstruction quality relative to the straightforward compressed-sensing recovery of each frame independently of the others in the multiview set, as well as a significant performance advantage as compared to a pair of benchmark multiple-frame compressed-sensing reconstructions.", "paper_title": "Compressed-sensing recovery of multiview image and video sequences using signal prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000339889800006"}
