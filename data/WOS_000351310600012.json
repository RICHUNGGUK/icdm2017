Inter-AS collaboration may minimize the path stretch, while on the other hand brings in extra collaboration cost. At present, there is no systematic research on path stretch. This paper analyzes the cause of path stretch in scalable routing system, quantitatively studies the relationship between path stretches, scalable routing evolution and inter-AS collaboration, as well as the collaboration cost under different collaboration strategies. We conclude that path stretch is greatly affected by collaboration strategy and the tradeoff between the path stretch and collaboration cost is worth considering.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of path stretch in scalable routing system", "paper_id": "WOS:000351310600012"}
