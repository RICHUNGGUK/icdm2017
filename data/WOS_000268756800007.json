In this paper, an algorithm named DNA-like learning and decomposing algorithm (DNA-like LDA) is proposed, which is capable of effectively implementing non-LSBF. The novel algorithm first trains the DNA-like offset sequence and decomposes non-LSBF into logic XOR operations of a sequence of LSBF, and then determines the weight-threshold values of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) that perform both the decompositions of LSBF and the function mapping the hidden neurons to the output neuron. The algorithm is validated by two typical examples about the problem of approximating the circular region and the well-known-bit parity Boolean function (PBF).", "paper_title": "Universal Perceptron and DNA-Like Learning Algorithm for Binary Neural Networks: Non-LSBF Implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000268756800007"}
