Classic IRSs based on this paradigm [Smith, M., & Smith, M. (1997). The use of genetic programming to build Boolean queries for text retrieval through relevance feedback. Journal of Information Science, 23(6), 423-431] generate a single solution (Boolean query) in each run, that with the best fitness value, which is usually based on a weighted combination of the basic performance criteria, precision and recall. A desirable aspect of IRSs, especially of those based on the IQBE paradigm, is to be able to get more than one query for the same information needs, with high precision and recall values or with different trade-offs between both. In this contribution, a new IQBE process is proposed combining a previous basic algorithm to automatically derive Boolean queries for Boolean IRSs [Smith, M., & Smith, M. (1997). The use of genetic programming to build Boolean queries for text retrieval through relevance feedback. Journal of Information Science, 23(6), 423-431] and an advanced evolutionary multiobjective approach [Coello, C. A., Van Veldhuizen, D. A., & Lamant, G. B. (2002). Evolutionary algorithms for solving multiobjective problems. Kluwer Academic Publishers], which obtains several queries with a different precision-recall trade-off in a single run. The performance of the new proposal will be tested on the Cranfield and CACM collections and compared to the well-known Smith and Smith's algorithm, showing how it improves the learning of queries and thus it could better assist the user in the query formulation process.
