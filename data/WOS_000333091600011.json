Most existing works studying the network capacity issue are based on the unpractical model called deterministic network model. In this paper, a more reasonable model, probabilistic network model, is considered. For snapshot data collection, we propose a novel Cell-based Path Scheduling (CPS) algorithm that achieves capacity of Omega(1/5 omega lnn.W) in the sense of the worst case and order-optimal capacity in the sense of expectation, where n is the number of sensor nodes, omega is a constant, and W is the data transmitting rate. For continuous data collection, we propose a Zone-based Pipeline Scheduling (ZPS) algorithm. ZPS significantly speeds up the continuous data collection process by forming a data transmission pipeline, and achieves a capacity gain of N root n/root logn ln n or n/logn ln n times better than the optimal capacity of the snapshot data collection scenario in order in the sense of the worst case, where N is the number of snapshots in a continuous data collection task. The simulation results also validate that the proposed algorithms significantly improve network capacity compared with the existing works.", "paper_title": "Snapshot and Continuous Data Collection in Probabilistic Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000333091600011"}
