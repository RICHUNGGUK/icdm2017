In practice, tools or chambers differ and do not process lots identically. The ability to achieve consistent performance of wafer across the entire toolset is critical to developing and maintaining a high yield. In this paper, a statistical method is proposed to diagnose any reasonable difference between golden and inferior chambers that are classified in terms of end-of-line quality of wafer. Key features of the sensor-variable profiles are mined out to determine the causes of chamber mismatching in the manufacturing process. The method not only employs well-known statistical analysis techniques of discrimination and regression, but also presents a synopsis of analysis results in the chart of R-2 statistics versus p-value. This framework provides a systematic method of drawing inference from the available evidence without interrupting the normal process operation. The proposed concept is illustrated by an electroplating process in a local fabrication unit.", "paper_title": "Chamber Matching of Semiconductor Manufacturing Process Using Statistical Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000305584800011"}
