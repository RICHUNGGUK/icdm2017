Focusing on the analysis of leaves, we developed a working process to help recognize species, starting from a picture of a leaf in a complex natural background. A two-step active contour segmentation algorithm based on a polygonal leaf model processes the image to retrieve the contour of the leaf. Features we use afterwards are high-level geometrical descriptors that make a semantic interpretation possible, and prove to achieve better performance than more generic and statistical shape descriptors alone. We present the results, both in terms of segmentation and classification, considering a database of 50 European broad-leaved tree species, and an implementation of the system is available in the iPhone application Folia.(1) (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
