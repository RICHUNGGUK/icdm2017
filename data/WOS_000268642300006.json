As it is well known, in the lambda beta-calculus the omega-rule does not hold, even when the eta-rule (weak extensionality) is added to the calculus. A long-standing problem of H. Barendregt (1975) concerns the determination of the logical power of the omega-rule when added to the lambda beta-calculus. In this paper we solve the problem, by showing that the resulting theory is Pi(1)(1)-Complete.", "paper_title": "THE OMEGA RULE IS Pi(1)(1)-COMPLETE IN THE lambda beta-CALCULUS", "paper_id": "WOS:000268642300006"}
