An examination is made regarding the exploitation of audio and/or haptic interactions for the acquisition of a target of interest in an environment containing multiple and obscured distractors. A first study compares means for identifying and locating a specified target among others employing either audio, haptic, or both sensori-motor channels activated simultaneously. Following an analysis of the results and subject comments, an improved multimodal approach is proposed and evaluated in a second study, combining advantages offered by each sensory channel. Results confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed multimodal approach.", "paper_title": "Non-visual identification, localization, and selection of entities of interest in a 3D environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000342069200002"}
