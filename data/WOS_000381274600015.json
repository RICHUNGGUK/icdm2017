The recommendations, while well constructed, did not completely meet the needs of the Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) program at the Kelley School of Business, Indiana University. In this paper, we present a case study describing how IS faculty, considering local requirements and guiding principles, designed a unique and innovative integrated core curriculum for our MSIS program similar to those used in MBA programs. The design, described in detail, included innovations in faculty collaboration, integrated pedagogy across topic modules, and scheduling. Positive feedback from students and faculty confirmed the expected outcome of students' connecting the dots between concepts and enhanced learning around the soft skill dimensions, such as teamwork. Our contribution to the IS academic community is in the design and execution of such a curriculum block, one that focuses on providing a balance between the technical and managerial aspects of information systems while also integrating soft skill development into the curriculum.", "paper_title": "Design of an Integrated Information Systems Master's Core Curriculum: A Case Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000381274600015"}
