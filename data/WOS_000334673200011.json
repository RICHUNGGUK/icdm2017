In this paper, we consider the crucial problem of collecting all tags in a large-scale system through a handheld RFID reader. The reader has to move around due to the limited communication range of tags. We focus on the minimization of power consumption of the reader given the constraint on its movement distance. Two challenges must be addressed. First, the communication range of a tag is dependent on the reader. There is an intrinsic tradeoff between power saving and movement distance. Second, the number of sites at which the reader can collect tags can be numerous and the problem complexity is extremely high. We theoretically prove that the problem of minimizing the energy consumption of the reader is NP Complete (NPC). To solve the problem, we first analytically reveal that the time needed for reading a given number of tags is linearly proportional to the number of tags only. With this insight, we next propose an approach called ePath by constructing an energy-efficient candidate path and then incrementally pruning the path when the tag locations are given. We further relax the assumption on tag locations by extending ePath to exploit the tag distribution density knowledge only. Extensive simulations have been performed, and results show that our approach significantly reduces the power consumption of the reader comparing to an existing approach.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Identification in Large-Scale RFID Systems with Handheld Reader", "paper_id": "WOS:000334673200011"}
