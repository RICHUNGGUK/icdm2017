The article takes a fresh look at this \"soft\" truth, and presents a formal system L-R, that is shown to be sound and complete with respect to a semantics determined by this notion. L-R is based on the modal logic S5. Notable is the rough consequence relation defining L-R (a first version introduced in [9]), and rough consistency (also introduced in [9]), used to prove the completeness result. The former is defined in order to be able to derive roughly true propositions from roughly true premisses in an information system. The motivation for the latter stems from the observation that a proposition and its negation may well be roughly true together. A characterization of L-R-consequence shows that the paraconsistent discussive logic J of Jaskowski is equivalent to L-R. So, L-R, developed from a totally independent angle, viz. that of rough set theory, gives an alternative formulation to this well-studied logic. It is further observed that pre-rough logic [3] and 3-valued Lukasiewicz logic are embeddable into L-R.", "paper_title": "Logic for rough truth", "paper_id": "WOS:000239018100001"}
