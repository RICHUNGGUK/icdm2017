Ultra-low-power designs may even permit embedded systems to operate without batteries by scavenging energy from the environment. Moreover, managing power dissipation is now a key factor in integrated circuit packaging and cooling. As a result, embedded system price, size, weight, and reliability are all strongly dependent on power dissipation. Recent developments in nanoscale devices open new alternatives for low-power embedded system design. Among these, single-electron tunneling transistors (SETs) hold the promise of achieving the lowest power consumption. Unfortunately, most analysis of SETs has focused on single devices instead of architectures, making it difficult to determine whether they are appropriate for low-power embedded systems. Evaluating the use of SETs in large-scale digital systems requires novel architectural and circuit design. SET-based design imposes numerous challenges resulting from low driving strength, relatively large static power consumption, and the presence of reliability problems resulting from random background charge effects. We propose a fault-tolerant, hybrid SET/CMOS, reconfigurable architecture, named IceFlex, that can be tailored to specific requirements and allows tradeoffs among power consumption, performance requirements, operation temperature, fabrication cost, and reliability. Using IceFlex as a testbed, we characterize the benefits and limitations of SETs in embedded system designs. In particular, we focus on the use of SETs in room-temperature ultra-low-power embedded systems such as wireless sensor network nodes. We also consider high-performance applications such as multimedia consumer electronics. We see this work as a first step in determining the potential of ultra-low-power embedded system design using SETS.", "paper_title": "Characterization of Single-Electron Tunneling Transistors for Designing Low-Power Embedded Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000265457700006"}
