Based on the pre-defined instruction/operator sets, a flexible neural tree model can be created and evolved. This framework allows input variables selection, over-layer connections and different activation functions for the various nodes involved. The FNT structure is developed using the Extended Compact Genetic Programming and the free parameters embedded in the neural tree are optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm. Empirical results on two well-known cancer datasets shows competitive results with existing methods.", "paper_title": "Gene expression profiling using flexible neural trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900133"}
