They are one of the most successful state-of-the-art techniques in motion planning, as they offer a great degree of flexibility and reliability. However, their use in other fields in which search is a commonly used approach has not been thoroughly analyzed. In this work we propose the use of RRTs as a search algorithm for automated planning. We analyze the advantages and disadvantages that this approach has over previously used search algorithms and the challenges of adapting RRTs for implicit and discrete search spaces.", "paper_title": "Using random sampling trees for automated planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000361767900005"}
