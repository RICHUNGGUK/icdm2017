Our purification protocol can be used to purify photon pairs not only from an ideal entangled source but also from a parametric down-conversion source by the measurement on the interference of two coherent beams without giant cross-Kerr media. Our quantum nondemolition detection can also used to concentrate photon pairs in less entangled pure states efficiently. Our protocols are more flexibilities in distinguishing the phases of the coherent states during homodyne detection.", "paper_title": "POLARIZATION-ENTANGLEMENT PURIFICATION AND CONCENTRATION USING CROSS-KERR NONLINEARITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000295652300008"}
