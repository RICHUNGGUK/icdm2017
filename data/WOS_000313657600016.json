In this paper, a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control strategy is proposed in order to improve the responsiveness of ETC. In the fuzzy-PID scheme, the input variables are the error signal and its derivative, and the output variable is PID gains expressed in terms of fuzzy rules. In this manner, the fuzzy-PID controller has more flexibility and capability than conventional ones. A novel technique to tune the fuzzy rules of fuzzy-PID controller is proposed using a harmony search algorithm, which can search the optimal PID gains for the plant. Simulation and experiment results have shown the effective performance of the proposed controller.", "paper_title": "Harmony search algorithm-based fuzzy-PID controller for electronic throttle valve", "paper_id": "WOS:000313657600016"}
