Parallel Random Access Machine (PRAM) model is applied for the theoretical analysis of algorithm efficiency. The methods need a fine-grained parallelization, therefore the approach proposed is especially devoted to parallel computing systems with fast shared memory (e.g. GPGPU, General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units).
