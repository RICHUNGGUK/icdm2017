Despite all that, efficient monitoring to resources of different ownership in Grids remains a challenge. In this paper a novel resource-autonomy based grid monitoring architecture named PIMISA (Plug-In Monitoring and Information Service Architecture) is proposed to address this problem. GMA and SOA are subtly explored in the \"Two-Level-Logic\" philosophy of PIMISA: only measurement and control metadata of resources are globally published, while monitoring data communication between elements of different owner-ships are handled by means of service invocation. The monitoring within the scope of an ownership follows a close-loop structure: a dynamic configurable set of management logic is kept, and resource states are analyzed at real time so that corresponding control indications could be made by decision-making. Moreover, above procedure can be achieved by a \"Third-Party Mount\" mode to leverage caused load on resources proportion to their capabilities. A prototype is currently under development, and therefore, the implementation scheme of PIMISA is presented in mathematical format.", "paper_title": "A resource-autonomy based monitoring architecture for grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300047"}
