The computation domain of the algorithm is obtained and three affine scheduling functions are presented. The technique allows some of the algorithm variables to be pipelined while others are broadcast over system-wide buses. Nine possible processor array structures are obtained and analyzed in terms of speed, area, power, and I/O timing requirements. Time complexities are derived analytically and through extensive numerical simulations. The proposed designs exhibit optimum speed and area complexities. The processor arrays are compared with previously derived processor arrays for the string matching problem.", "paper_title": "Processor array architectures for deep packet classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000235451500005"}
