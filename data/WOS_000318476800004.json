Although significant efforts have been made to facilitate face tracking or illumination normalization in unconstrained videos, the approaches developed may not be effective in video surveillance applications. This is because: 1) a low-resolution face contains limited information, and 2) major changes in illumination on a small region of the face make the tracking ineffective. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes to perform tracking in an illumination-insensitive feature space, called the gradient logarithm field (GLF) feature space. The GLF feature mainly depends on the intrinsic characteristics of a face and is only marginally affected by the lighting source. In addition, the GLF feature is a global feature and does not depend on a specific face model, and thus is effective in tracking low-resolution faces. Experimental results show that the proposed GLF-based tracker works well under significant illumination changes and outperforms many state-of-the-art tracking algorithms.", "paper_title": "Low-Resolution Face Tracker Robust to Illumination Variations", "paper_id": "WOS:000318476800004"}
