The GCK has been successfully used for pattern matching. In this paper, we propose that the G4-GCK algorithm is more efficient than the previous algorithm in computing GCK. The G4-GCK algorithm requires four additions per pixel for three basis vectors independent of transform size and dimension. Based on the G4-GCK algorithm, we then propose the segmented GCK. By segmenting input data into L-s parts, the SegGCK requires only four additions per pixel for 3L(s) basis vectors. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly accelerate the full-search equivalent pattern matching process and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Segmented Gray-Code Kernels for Fast Pattern Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000318016600021"}
