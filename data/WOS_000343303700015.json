First, the stochastic bounded consensus tracking protocol based on sampled-data with the general sampling delay is presented by using the delay decomposition technique. Second, the augmented matrix method, the probability limit theory and some other techniques are employed to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing the mean square bounded consensus tracking. The theoretical results show that the convergence of the proposed protocol simultaneously depends on the constant feedback gains, the network topology, the sampled period and the sampling delay, and that the static consensus tracking error depends on not only the above-mentioned factors, but also the noise intensity and the upper bound of the velocity and the acceleration of the virtual leader. The obtained results cover no sampling delay and the small sampling delay as two special cases. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Stochastic bounded consensus tracking of second-order multi-agent systems with measurement noises based on sampled-data with general sampling delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000343303700015"}
