The system enhances precision of extracted keywords based on considering correlation of the category. 30 Living Modified Organisms related experimental documents were used in order for performance measurement of the system. The proposed system showed better precision than frequency-based system by 47% and thesaurus-based system by 18%.", "paper_title": "Automated keyword extraction using category correlation of data", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100024"}
