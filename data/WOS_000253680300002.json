In the face of a widely variable LC filter, however, integrating the frequency-compensation circuit is difficult without sacrificing stability performance, which is why integrated controller ICs only cater to relatively narrow LC ranges. While Sigma Delta control addresses this LC compliance issue in buck dc-dc converters with high equivalent series resistance (ESR) output capacitors, it is not clear how it applies to Sigma Delta boost converters. To that end, this paper discusses, analyzes, and experimentally evaluates a prototyped 0.6 mu m CMOS differential Sigma Delta boost converter. Experimental results verified the switching supply was stable across 1-30 mu H, 1-350 mu F, and 5-50 m Omega of inductance, capacitance, and ESR while keeping output voltage variations in response to 0.1-0.8 A load and 2.7-4.2 V line changes to less than +/- 1.5%, peak efficiency at 95%, and switching frequency variation to less than 27%.", "paper_title": "A compact 1-30 mu H, 1-350 mu F, 5-50 m Omega ESR compliant, 1.5% accurate 0.6 mu m CMOS differential Sigma Delta boost dc-dc converter", "paper_id": "WOS:000253680300002"}
