This work includes the Hats Simulator and the COLAB system. The Hats Simulator is a parameterized model of a virtual world in which hundreds of thousands of agents en-a-e in individual and collective activities. Playing against. the simulator, the goal of the analyst is to identify and stop harmful agents before they carry out terrorist attacks on simulated landmarks. The COLAB system enables multiple human analysts in different physical locations to conduct collaborative intelligence analysis. COLAB consists of two components: an instrumented analysis working environment built on a. blackboard system, and a web-based user interface that integrates the Trellis hypothesis authoring and management tool with a query language. COLAB is integrated with the Hats Simulator to provide a complete end-to-end analysis environment with challenging problem domain.", "paper_title": "The hats simulator and colab: An integrated information fusion challenge problem and collaborative analysis environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800010"}
