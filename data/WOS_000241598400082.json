It is demonstrated that it is reasonable to compress original noisy images with appropriate compression ratio and then to classify the decompressed images rather than original data. Two classifiers are considered: based on radial basis function neural network and support vector machine. The latter one produces slightly better classification results.", "paper_title": "Approaches to classification of multichannel images", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400082"}
