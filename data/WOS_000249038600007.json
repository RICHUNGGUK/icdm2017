Since the first FPGA was released by Xilinx in 1985, FPGAs have become denser and more powerful. The first FPGA that operates in the microwave range was designed in 2000. Various methods, such as a new basic cell structure and multimode routing, are used to make that design faster and less power consuming. Sequential logic functions are analyzed and tested in this paper with a DEMUX implementation using these high-speed FPGA circuits. A chip measurement has shown that the FPGA can operate at a 12-GHz system clock when configured to perform sequential logic. A DEMUX that operates at 12 Gb/s is used here to demonstrate the potential for high-performance and low-power FPGA features.", "paper_title": "A 12-Gb/s DEMUX implemented with SiGe high-speed FPGA circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000249038600007"}
