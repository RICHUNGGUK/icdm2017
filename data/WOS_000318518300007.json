However, cognitive radio networks may also impose some challenges due to various factors such as the ever increasing complexity of network architecture, the high cost of configuring and managing large-scale networks, the fluctuating nature of the available spectrum, diverse QoS requirements of various applications, and the intensifying difficulties of centralized control. A plethora of work has been carried out to address the challenges aforementioned by employing cognitive radio functionalities with self-organization features. In this article, variant aspects of self-organization paradigms in cognitive radio networks, including critical functionalities of MAC-and network-layer operations, are surveyed. The main contributions of this survey include introducing the fundamentals of existing cognitive radio and self-organization techniques as well as their current progress, surveying critical cognitive radio issues (including common control channel management, cooperative spectrum sensing, bio-inspired spectrum sharing, network scalability and adaptive routing) as well as their self-organization features, and identifying new directions and open problems in cognitive radio networks.", "paper_title": "SELF-ORGANIZATION PARADIGMS AND OPTIMIZATION APPROACHES FOR COGNITIVE RADIO TECHNOLOGIES: A SURVEY", "paper_id": "WOS:000318518300007"}
