A generalized Rendezvous Reservation Protocol (RRP) is proposed which permits multi-hop infrastructure nodes to adapt their power consumption in a dynamic fashion. When nodes have a long-term association, power consumption can be reduced by having them periodically rendezvous for the purpose of exchanging data packets. In order to support certain applications, the system invokes a connection set up process to establish the end-to-end path and selects node rendezvous rates along the intermediate nodes to meet the application's quality of service (QoS) needs. Thus, the design challenge is to dynamically determine rendezvous intervals based on incoming applications' QoS needs, while conserving battery power. In this paper, we present the basic RRP mechanism and an enhanced mechanism called Rendezvous Reservation Protocol with Battery Management (RRP-BM) that incorporates node battery level information. The performance of the system is studied using discrete-event simulation based experiments for different network topologies. The chief metrics considered are average power consumption and system lifetime (that is to be maximized). The QoS metrics specified are packet latency and end-to-end setup latency. It is shown that the use of the RRP-BM can increase the lifetime up to 48% as compared to basic RRP by efficiently reducing the energy consumption.", "paper_title": "A rendezvous reservation protocol for energy constrained wireless infrastructure networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000243142600005"}
