Deviations from the standard operating procedures as described in the designed process models, are not uncommon and may result in significant uncertainties. Acquiring insight in the dynamics of the actual logistics processes can effectively assist in mitigating the uncovered risks and creating strategic advantages, which are the result of uncertainties with respectively a negative and a positive impact on the organizational objectives. In this paper a comprehensive methodology for applying process mining in logistics is presented, covering the event log extraction and preprocessing as well as the execution of exploratory, performance and conformance analyses. The applicability of the presented methodology and roadmap is demonstrated with a case study at an important Chinese port that specializes in bulk cargo. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
