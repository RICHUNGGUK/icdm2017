Namely, for job j, pj = bjt, where bj 0 is its deterioration rate, t t0 0 is its starting time and t0 is a given constant. The criteria of optimality are minimising the makespan and maximising the minimum machine completion time. It has been proved that the first problem is NP-hard; we prove that the second problem is also NP-hard. For both problems heuristic algorithms are constructed and their performance is analysed.", "paper_title": "Parallel machine scheduling problems with proportionally deteriorating jobs", "paper_id": "WOS:000262632300006"}
