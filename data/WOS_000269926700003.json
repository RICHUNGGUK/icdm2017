Comparisons between them will be carried out in terms of the critical factors: stabilization parameters, convergence rates, consistence, and mesh effects. It is numerically drawn that the local Gauss integration method is a favorite method among these methods.", "paper_title": "Performance of several stabilized finite element methods for the Stokes equations based on the lowest equal-order pairs", "paper_id": "WOS:000269926700003"}
