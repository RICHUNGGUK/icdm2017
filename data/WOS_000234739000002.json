Due to the limit of energy storage capacity or DC link, it is necessary the minimize energy injection from DVR. In this paper the techniques of the supply voltage sag compensation in a distribution feeder are presented. In addition, a new concept of restoration technique is suggested to inject minimum energy for a given apparent power of DVR. Simulation results carried out by PSCAD/EMTDC1, verify the efficiency of the proposed method. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
