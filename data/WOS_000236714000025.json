Based on the classification of RM(3, 6)/RM(1, 6), we have completed this classification of cubic (n - 4)-resilient Boolean functions by deriving the corresponding algebraic normal form (ANF) and autocorrelation spectrum for each of the four types. At the same time, we have solved an open problem by proving that all plateaued cubic (n - 4)-resilient Boolean functions have dimension of the linear space equal either to a - 5 or n - 6.", "paper_title": "Classification of cubic (n-4)-resilient Boolean functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000236714000025"}
