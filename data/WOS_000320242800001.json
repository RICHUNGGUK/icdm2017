In this paper, we propose a traffic prediction-based fast rerouting algorithm for use between the cluster heads and a sink node in WMSNs (TPFR). The proposed algorithm uses the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model to predict a cluster head's network traffic. When the predicted value is greater than the predefined network traffic threshold, both adaptive retransmission trigger (ART) that contributes to switch to a better alternate path in time and trigger efficient retransmission behaviors are enabled. Performance comparison of TPFR with ant-based multi-QoS routing (AntSensNet) and power efficient multimedia routing (PEMuR) shows that they: (a) maximize the overall network lifespan by load balancing and not draining energy from some specific nodes, (b) provide high quality of service delivery for multimedia streams by switching to a better path towards a sink node in time, (c) reduce useless data retransmissions when node failures or link breaks occur, and (d) maintain lower routing overhead.", "paper_title": "Traffic Prediction-Based Fast Rerouting Algorithm for Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000320242800001"}
