Optimization and stochastic network theory have been successful in designing architectures for fair resource allocation to meet long-term throughput demands. However, to the best of our knowledge, strict packet delay deadlines were not considered in this framework previously. In this paper, we propose a model for incorporating the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of packets with deadlines in the optimization framework. The solution to the problem results in a joint congestion control and scheduling algorithm that fairly allocates resources to meet the fairness objectives of both elastic and inelastic flows and per-packet delay requirements of inelastic flows.", "paper_title": "Optimal Scheduling for Fair Resource Allocation in Ad Hoc Networks With Elastic and Inelastic Traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000294007700015"}
