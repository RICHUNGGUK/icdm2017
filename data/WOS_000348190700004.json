The method is based on the optimized weighted sum of the theoretical spectra of the corresponding tautomers. In this article we show how the choice of exchange-correlation functional (XCF) employed in the calculations becomes crucial for the success of the approach. After the systematic analysis of XCFs with different amounts of exact-exchange we found a better performance for B3LYP and PBE0. The direct test of the proposed method on omeprazole, a well-known 5(6)-benzimidazole based pharmacotherapeutic, demonstrate its broader applicability. The proposed approach is expected to find direct applications on the tautomeric analysis of other molecular systems exhibiting similar tautomeric equilibria. Using a weighted sum of the corresponding individual tautomer theoretical spectra, the tautomeric population of benzimidazole derivatives in solution and at room temperature is directly determined through the theoretical-experimental fitting of the UV-Vis spectra of the tautomeric mixture at equilibrium. The reliability of the proposed method is based on the existent spectral difference between the two species.", "paper_title": "Assessment of the tautomeric population of benzimidazole derivatives in solution: a simple and versatile theoretical-experimental approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000348190700004"}
