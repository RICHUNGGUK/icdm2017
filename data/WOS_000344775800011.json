First, the criterion without the time delays is derived. Then, the result is extended to time-varying condition. The criterion also ensures globally exponential stability if there is no input term. These conditions are the improvement and extension of the existing results in the literature. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algebraic criteria.", "paper_title": "Mean square input-to-state stability of a general class of stochastic recurrent neural networks with Markovian switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000344775800011"}
