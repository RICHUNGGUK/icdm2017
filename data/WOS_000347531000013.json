Computational models were created to represent four knees previously tested at 40 degrees, 60 degrees, and 80 degrees of flexion with the tibial tuberosity in a lateral, medial and anteromedial positions. The experimentally loaded muscles, major ligaments of the knee, and patellar tendon were represented. A repeated measures ANOVA with post-hoc testing was performed at each flexion angle to compare data between the three positions of the tibial tuberosity. Significant experimental trends for decreased patella flexion due to tuberosity anteriorization and a decrease in the lateral contact force due to tuberosity medialization were reproduced computationally. The dynamic multibody modeling technique will allow simulation of function for symptomatic knees to identify optimal surgical treatment methods based on parameters related to knee pathology and pre-operative kinematics.", "paper_title": "Dynamic simulation of tibial tuberosity realignment: model evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000347531000013"}
