In the current paper, Artificial Neural Networks are used for modelling ozone, and for simulating its behaviour in relation to other atmospheric parameters of interest, for the city of Thessaloniki, Greece. This behaviour is also investigated with the aid of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Results suggest the operational capabilities of such models, and the research potential in the application of computational intelligence methods for the environmental sector. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
