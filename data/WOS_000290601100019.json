On the other hand, hospitals require efficient management of medical treatment. In this paper, we combine these requirements and propose a smart card-based mobile medical treatment examination report transaction system to achieve a secure transaction model. We apply cryptography mechanisms to reduce cost, share medical treatment resources, mobilize services and simplify examination procedures. With this product, both supply merchants and retailers can find their niche. Moreover, users can share the mobile medical treatment examination resources saving much valuable time.", "paper_title": "A SMART CARD-BASED MOBILE SECURE TRANSACTION SYSTEM FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT EXAMINATION REPORTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601100019"}
