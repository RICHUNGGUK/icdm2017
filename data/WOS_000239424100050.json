The proof is formalized, and a realizing term extracted. This term can be applied to concrete continuous functions and arguments, and then normalized to a rational approximation of say a zero of a given function. It turns out that even in the logical term language \"normalization by evaluation\" is reasonably efficient.", "paper_title": "Inverting monotone continuous functions in constructive analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424100050"}
