The signals on which the analysis is based are heart-beat interval (HBI) and movement activity obtained from the bed sensor, the relevant features and parameters obtained through a time-variant autoregressive model (TVAM) used as feature extractor, and the classification obtained through a hidden Markov model (HMM). Parameters coming from the joint probability of the HBI features were used as input to a HMM, while movement features are used for wake period detection. A total of 18 recordings from healthy subjects, including also reference polysomnography, were used for the validation of the system. When compared to wake-nonrapid-eye-movement (NREM)-REM classification provided by experts, the described system achieved a total accuracy of 79 +/- 9% and a kappa index of 0.43 +/- 0.17 with only two HBI features and one movement parameter, and a total accuracy of 79 +/- 10% and a kappa index of 0.44 +/- 0.19 with three HBI features and one movement parameter. These results suggest that the combination of HBI and movement features could be a suitable alternative for sleep staging with the advantage of low cost and simplicity.", "paper_title": "Sleep Staging Based on Signals Acquired Through Bed Sensor", "paper_id": "WOS:000278538300029"}
