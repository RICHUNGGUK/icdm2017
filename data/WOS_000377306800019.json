In this work, we derive approximate expressions for outage probability and channel capacity when the signal of interest and interferers both experience kappa-mu shadowed fading with arbitrary parameters. The expressions are expressed in terms of well known hypergeometric function, which can be easily evaluated numerically. Finally, simulation results are provided which shows that our approximation is fairly tight.", "paper_title": "Approximate Outage Probability and Capacity for kappa-mu Shadowed Fading", "paper_id": "WOS:000377306800019"}
