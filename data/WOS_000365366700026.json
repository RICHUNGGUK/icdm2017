The proposed algorithms are based on restriction weights into the cost function of optimization-based control allocation. Hardware-in-the-loop investigation using a test rig with hardware components of friction brake system and dynamic tire pressure system showed that the proposed approach allows to achieve lower energy consumption and energy losses without significant impairment of motion stability and vehicle handling as compared to conventional control allocation.
