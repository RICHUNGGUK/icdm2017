Design/methodology/approach - A SABCA is parallelized through the chosen parallelization library MPI. Parallelization is performed in two stages. In the first stage, data to be clustered are divided among processors. After the sequential ant-based approach running on each processor clusters the data assigned to it, the resulting clusters are merged in the second stage. The merging is also performed through the same ant-based technique. The experimental analysis focuses on whether the implemented parallel ant-based clustering method leads to a better time performance than its fully sequential version or not. Since the aim of this paper is to speedup the time consuming, but otherwise successful, ant-based clustering method, no extra steps are taken to improve the clustering solution. Tests are executed using 2 and 4 processors on selected sample datasets. Results are analyzed through commonly used cluster validity indices and parallelization performance metrices. Findings - As a result of the experiments, it is seen that the proposed algorithm performs better based on time measurements and parallelization performance metrices; as expected, it does not improve the clustering quality based on the cluster validity indices. Furthermore, the communication cost is very small compared to other ant-based clustering parallelization techniques proposed so far. Research limitations/implications - The use of MPI for the parallelization step has been very effective. Also, the proposed parallelization technique is quite successful in increasing time performance; however, as a future study, improvements to clustering quality can be made in the final step where the partially clustered data are merged. Practical implications - The results in literature show that ant-based clustering techniques are successful; however, their high-time complexity prohibit their effective use in practical applications. Through this low-communication-cost parallelization technique, this limitation may be overcome. Originality/value - A new parallelization approach to ant-based clustering is proposed. The proposed approach does not decrease clustering performance while it increases time performance. Also, another major contribution of this paper is the fact that the communication costs required for parallelization is lower than the previously proposed parallel ant-based techniques.", "paper_title": "Parallelization of an ant-based clustering approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000279227800012"}
