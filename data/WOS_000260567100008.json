It seeks to focus both on the optimization of the power coupling in the discharge and on the discharge homogeneity. Design/methodology/approach - The CST microwave studio 3D commercial code was used, which solves Maxwell equations using the finite integration technique. The power coupling is investigated by studying the influence of a short-circuit position, whereas the discharge homogeneity is investigated by studying the influence of the discharge diameter. Findings - A short-circuit position was found for which the power coupling is perfectly optimised (reflected power around I per cent), and it is shown that the 12cm diameter cylindrical reactor is multi-mode at 2.45 GHz, with a dominant m = 3 hexapolar mode. Research limitations/implications - The electromagnetic modelling of this reactor is a first step; now the plasma has to be taken into account. Research is in progress to develop a 2D fluid model of the plasma. Practical implications - The electromagnetic simulation of a plasma reactor turns out to be very useful for the optimization in terms of energy coupling and spatial homogeneity prediction. Originality/value - The results and a similar approach can be used for the conception of new plasma reactors.", "paper_title": "3D electromagnetic simulation of a large diameter cylindrical surface wave excited plasma reactor", "paper_id": "WOS:000260567100008"}
