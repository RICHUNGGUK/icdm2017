However, this specification leaves key management as an open problem. Aiming to address the key establishment issue for BP, in this paper, we utilize a time-evolving topology model and two-channel cryptography to design efficient and noninteractive key exchange protocol. A time-evolving model is used to formally model the periodic and predetermined behavior patterns of space DTNs, and therefore, a node can schedule when and to whom it should send its public key. Meanwhile, the application of two-channel cryptography enables DTN nodes to exchange their public keys or revocation status information, with authentication assurance and in a noninteractive manner. The proposed scheme helps to establish a secure context to support for BSP, tolerating high delays, and unexpected loss of connectivity of space DTNs.", "paper_title": "Non-Interactive Key Establishment for Bundle Security Protocol of Space DTNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000332456600001"}
