The AOB reformulates the Kalman filter to accomplish model-reference adaptive control based on: (1) A desired closed loop system. (2) An extra equation to estimate an equivalent disturbance referred to the system input. An active state is introduced to compensate unmodeled terms, providing a feedforward compensation action. (3) Stochastic design of the Kalman matrices. Stability analysis with model errors is discussed. An example of robot force control with an external and unknown nonlinear disturbance is presented (SISO system). Another example of model-matching control for steer-by-wire (SBW) vehicles with underactuated structure is discussed (MIMO system).", "paper_title": "On Kalman active observers", "paper_id": "WOS:000243925600002"}
