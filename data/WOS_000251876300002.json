When BCRP is defined for wired networks, it can be solved in polynomial time. On the other hand, when it is defined for wireless ad hoc networks, it is NP-complete if the underlying MAC protocol is TDMA-based or CDMA-over-TDMA-based. In this paper, we show that BCRP is still NP-complete, even if CSMA-based or contention-based CDMA MAC protocols are used. Besides, we show that BCRP is polynomial-time solvable if the channel model is collision-free and the scheduling policy is FIFO. In wireless ad hoc networks, no MAC protocol was designed before, which would lead to a polynomial-time solution to BCRP. The results of this paper suggest a design principle for MAC protocols that can support QoS routing well.", "paper_title": "Bandwidth-constrained routing problem in wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000251876300002"}
