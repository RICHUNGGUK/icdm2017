Employing the properties of diffusion operator and the techniques of inequality, we investigate positive invariant set, global exponential stability, and then obtain the exponential dissipativity of the neural networks under consideration. Our results can extend and improve earlier ones. An example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of these results.", "paper_title": "Exponential dissipativity of non-autonomous neural networks with distributed delays and reaction-diffusion terms", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000014"}
