The cutoff frequency of the fourth-order LPF can be tuned within 240-550 MHz. The gain of the filter is tuned about 44 dB which can omit the variable gain amplifier (VGA) block. An IIP3 of 17.4 dBm is achieved for a power consumption of 5.2 mW from a 1.8 V power supply. Merging LPF and VGA into one block can efficiently reduce the power consumption and the chip area of the analog baseband channel while achieving a high linearity.", "paper_title": "A 5.2 mW 240-550 MHz continuous-time low-pass filter and VGA for a UWB receiver in 0.18 mu m CMOS process", "paper_id": "WOS:000257440000003"}
