Furthermore, we apply feedback control methodology to formulate the adaptive guard capacity adjustment as an adaptive real-time control problem. Performance evaluation reveals that the solution not only has excellent stability behavior, but also meets zero steady state error and settling time requirements. And simulation results also indicate that our adaptive guard capacity scheme can guarantee the predetermined soft handoff failure probability and new call blocking probability by comparing with conventional fixed guard capacity scheme.
