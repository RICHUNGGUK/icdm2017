The proposed architecture uses a single processing element (PE) and simplified memory addressing to reduce the hardware complexity. The addressing logic, which is presently applied to 352 x 288 CIF frames, can be easily extended to frames of higher resolutions. The proposed architecture uses optimum area while satisfying speed requirements for real-time video processing. Implemented in Verilog HDL and mapped to Virtex 6 (XC6VLX75T-3) FPGA, the architecture uses only 165 slice registers and 273 slice LUTs. The architecture can process 240 frames per second while operating at a maximum frequency of 320 MHz. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
