After underlining the importance of a layered approach and the use of standards, it starts with early efforts used for artificial intelligence researchers. Then recent approaches, aimed mainly at the semantic web, are described. Coding examples from the literature are presented in both sections. Finally, the semantic web ontology creation process, as we envision it, is introduced. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
