Unfortunately, the complexity and the heterogeneity of multi-modality have posed the following two major challenges for cross-media retrieval: 1) how to construct a unified and compact model for media objects with multi-modality, 2) how to improve the performance of retrieval for large scale cross-media database. In this paper, we propose a novel method which is dedicate to solving these issues to achieve effective and accurate cross-media retrieval. Firstly, a multi-modality semantic relationship graph (MSRG) is constructed using the semantic correlation amongst the media objects with multi-modality. Secondly, all the media objects in MSRG are mapped onto an isomorphic semantic space. Further, an efficient indexing MK-tree based on heterogeneous data distribution is proposed to manage the media objects within the semantic space and improve the performance of cross-media retrieval. Extensive experiments on real large scale cross-media datasets indicate that our proposal dramatically improves the accuracy and efficiency of cross-media retrieval, outperforming the existing methods significantly.", "paper_title": "A Novel Approach Towards Large Scale Cross-Media Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000311264700007"}
