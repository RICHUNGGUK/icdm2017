Although leakage power of FinFET logic gates is lower than their CMOS counterparts, it still contributes to a large part of total power consumption. In this article, we show how ultra-low-leakage FinFET chip multiprocessors (CMPs) can be designed using a hybrid logic style. This hybrid style exploits the ultra-low-leakage feature of asymmetric-workfunction shorted-gate (ASG) FinFETs and the high-performance feature of shorted-gate (SG) FinFETs. We explore the impact of the hybrid style at both the module and CMP levels. To do this, we have developed FinFET logic libraries targeted at SG and ASG logic gates, suitably characterized for various parameters of interest. We have also modified existing tools and created a framework to evaluate the hybrid designs of SRAMs, caches, and CMPs. Using the design with SG FinFETs as the baseline for comparison, our experimental results show that the hybrid style can reduce leakage power of execution units to as low as 10.6% of the baseline without hurting performance, that of SRAMs to between 21.5% and 4.8% of the baseline with 0%-8.3% delay overhead, and that of CMPs to 10.0% of the baseline with negligible performance degradation.", "paper_title": "Ultra-Low-Leakage Chip Multiprocessor Design with Hybrid FinFET Logic Styles", "paper_id": "WOS:000343424100003"}
