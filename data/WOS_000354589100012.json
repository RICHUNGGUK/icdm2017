With the advantages of low cost and fast access speed, non-volatile memories (NVMs) like NAND flash memory have become a critical component in building security-critical real-time embedded devices. Therefore, to improve the security protection of NVM-based embedded systems becomes a great challenge. In this paper, we are interested in online optimization of security-sensitive storage applications over modern NVM-based embedded systems, whose workloads are unpredictable but have explicit timing constraint and certain security constraint. Sensitive data must be stored before a specific deadline, otherwise it will lose its validity. To address these challenges, this paper presents a Feedback Vulnerability and Utilization Control (FVUC) mechanism. FVUC employs two proportional-integral controllers, the Utilization Controller and the Vulnerability Controller, to build a big feedback loop which dynamically monitors the system run-time status as well as decides how many flash pages would be encrypted by a cryptography service. Relied on the accurate model and design, FVUC can make a balance between the utilization and vulnerability, and achieve a better overall performance. Based on synthetic experiments, we obtain that FVUC can fully beat other three mechanisms on the overall performance with acceptable time overhead. Equipped with proportional-integral controller, FVUC can make the system more stable than the one with only proportional controller. The proposed mechanism can be utilized to resist on-line confidential attack and even achieve the off-line privacy protection when embedded devices are lost or stolen. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
