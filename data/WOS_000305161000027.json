As important concepts and theoretical foundations, the maximum controllability index of square matrices is defined and analyzed, and a generalized controllability canonical form is introduced for single-input systems. Based on these concepts, approaches for adjusting the leader-follower and follower-follower communication architectures are presented respectively.", "paper_title": "CONTROLLABILITY IMPROVEMENT FOR LINEAR TIME-INVARIANT DYNAMICAL MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000305161000027"}
