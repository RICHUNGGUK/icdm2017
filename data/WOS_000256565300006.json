We apply the ontology-based user and user interface modeling. The user model is represented as a tuple and user interface model is represented by a set of connected nodes, what enables suitable user interface design, an interface personalization and recommendation. The recommendation is performed using ant colony metaphor for selection the most optimal path in the user interface graph that specifies the user interface parameters for the specified user.", "paper_title": "Ant colony metaphor applied in user interface recommendation", "paper_id": "WOS:000256565300006"}
