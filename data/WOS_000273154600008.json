Our construction is natively quantum, based on the analogy of a product of two reflections and a quantum walk. Second, in some special cases we show how to amplify the acceptance probability for good witnesses to 1, making a step towards the proof that QMA with one-sided error (QMA(1)) is equal to QMA. Finally, we simplify the filter-state method to search for QMA witnesses by Poulin and Wocian [2].", "paper_title": "FAST AMPLIFICATION OF QMA", "paper_id": "WOS:000273154600008"}
