However, image patches do not strictly follow the similar structure in the low-resolution and high-resolution spaces, consequently leading to a bias to the image restoration. In this paper, considering that patches are a set of data with multiview characteristics and spatial organization, we advance a dual-geometric neighbor embedding (DGNE) approach for SISR. In DGNE, multiview features and local spatial neighbors of patches are explored to find a feature-spatial manifold embedding for images. We adopt a geometrically motivated assumption that for each patch there exists a small neighborhood in which only the patches that come from the same feature-spatial manifold, will lie approximately in a low-dimensional affine subspace formulated by sparse neighbors. In order to find the sparse neighbors, a tensor-simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is advanced to realize a joint sparse coding of feature-spatial image tensors. Some experiments are performed on realizing a 3X amplification of natural images, and the recovered results prove its efficiency and superiority to its counterparts.", "paper_title": "Dual-Geometric Neighbor Embedding for Image Super Resolution With Sparse Tensor", "paper_id": "WOS:000337141400003"}
