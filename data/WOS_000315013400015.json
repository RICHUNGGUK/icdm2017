The discovered frequent patterns are called constrained frequent U2 patterns (where \"U2\" represents \"univariate uncertain\"). In univariate uncertain data, each attribute in a transaction is associated with a quantitative interval and a probability density function. The CUP-Miner algorithm is implemented in two phases: In the first phase, a U2P-tree (Univariate Uncertain Pattern tree) is constructed by compressing the target database transactions into a compact tree structure. Then, in the second phase, the constrained frequent U2 pattern is enumerated by traversing the U2P-tree with different strategies that correspond to different types of constraints. The algorithm speeds up the mining process by exploiting five constraint properties: succinctness, anti-monotonicity, monotonicity, convertible anti-monotonicity, and convertible mono tonicity. Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP-Miner outperforms the modified CAP algorithm, the modified FIC algorithm, the modified U2P-Miner algorithm, and the modified Apriori algorithm.
