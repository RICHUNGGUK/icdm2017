His most notable contribution to computing is the invention of a mechanical computer containing approximately 1 million little steel balls rolling through many guide bars. Using this research, Vand collaborated with William Cochran and Francis Crick on the early analysis of the structure of helix molecules.", "paper_title": "Vladimir Vand (1911-1968): Pioneer of Computational Methods in Crystallography", "paper_id": "WOS:000297350100005"}
