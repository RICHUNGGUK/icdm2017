The proposed approach allows the simultaneous and consistent estimation of the PCA model plane, its dimension and the error covariance matrix. This paper also invokes recent work on monitoring non-Gaussian processes to extract unknown Gaussian as well as non-Gaussian source signals from recorded process data. By contrasting the unified framework with PCA-based process monitoring using a simulation example and recorded data from two industrial processes, the proposed approach produced more accurate and/or sensitive monitoring models.
