Studies demonstrating these benefits have been conducted primarily in the inpatient setting, with fewer in the ambulatory setting. The objective was to evaluate the effect of a basic, ambulatory CPOE system on medication errors and associated ADEs. Design This quasiexperimental, pretest-post-test study was conducted in a community-based, multispecialty health system not affiliated with an academic medical center. The intervention was a basic CPOE system with limited clinical decision support capabilities. Measurement Comparison of prescriptions written before (n=5016 handwritten) to after (n=5153 electronically prescribed) implementation of the CPOE system. The primary outcome was the occurrence of error(s); secondary outcomes were types and severity of errors. Results Frequency of errors declined from 18.2% to 8.2%-a reduction in adjusted odds of 70% (OR: 0.30, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.40). The largest reductions were seen in adjusted odds of errors of illegibility (97%), use of inappropriate abbreviations (94%) and missing information (85%). There was a 57% reduction in adjusted odds of errors that did not cause harm (potential ADEs) (OR 0.43: 95% Cl 0.38 to 0.49). The reduction in the number of errors that caused harm (preventable ADEs) was not statistically significant, perhaps due to few errors in this category. Conclusions A basic CPOE system in a community setting was associated with a significant reduction in medication errors of most types and severity levels.", "paper_title": "The impact of computerized provider order entry on medication errors in a multispecialty group practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000273173800014"}
