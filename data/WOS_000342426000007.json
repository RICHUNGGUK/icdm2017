Using this active element, a multifunction frequency filter is designed featuring the possibility of mutually independent control of quality factor Q and characteristic frequency by means of active elements. The structure of the filter is based on the idea of the Akerberg-Mossberg (AM) filter, i.e. the integrators in the structure are always realized only by two active elements. This fact results in better phase compensation for the filter. Compared to the AM opamp based filter, the newly proposed structure features high-impedance inputs, low-impedance output, and all basic frequency responses. The performance of the proposed structure has been verified by SPICE simulations using the TSMC level-7 SCN018 CMOS process parameters with supply voltage.", "paper_title": "Voltage-mode multifunction filter with mutually independent Q and control feature using VDDDAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000342426000007"}
