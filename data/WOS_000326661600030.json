This ensures that a broadcasting station cannot transplant illegal watermark into illegal advertisements, as well as advertisers cannot replace legal watermarks with illegal ones. Current watermark protocols are not suitable for broadcast monitoring, because they mostly adopt homomorphic public-key cipher to guarantee the security of media contents and watermarks. This results in high computation and bandwidth consumption. This paper proposes a video protocol suited to broadcast monitoring. The proposed protocol uses secure watermark embedding based on partial encryption to improve the level of security and to help with decreasing computation and bandwidth consumption. The authors have also analyzed its effectiveness and listed barriers to its implementation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
