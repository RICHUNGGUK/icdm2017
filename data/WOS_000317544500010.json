We describe a framework where a network of shared tuple spaces handles services provided by situated agents, enabling their composition and competition in a fully distributed, self-organised way. This is achieved by a set of coordination laws structured as chemical-resembling reactions, designed so as to enact feedback loops that regulate and balance the \"activity level\" of (atomic or composite) services.
