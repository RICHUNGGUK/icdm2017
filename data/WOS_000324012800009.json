This scheme is called Group Sequential Communication (GSC). The GSC improves the efficiency of the Hybrid Coordination Function Controlled Channel Access (HCCA) mechanism by reducing the protocol overheads of the 802.11e amendment. The GSC approach eliminates the polling scheme used in traditional scheduling algorithm, by means of a virtual token passing procedure among members of the real-time group to whom is granted a high-priority and sequential access to communication medium. In order to improve the reliability of the proposed scheme, it is also proposed an error recovery mechanism based on block acknowledgment. The GSC was implemented in network simulator software and the performance results were compared to HCCA scheme, showing the efficient of the proposed approach when dealing with traditional industrial communication scenarios.
