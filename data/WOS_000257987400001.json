The model is used to accurately measure the peak single cycle transition power consumption in combinational and sequential circuits, which is closely affected by the switching activity in the circuit. Our technique is scalable, and adapts easily to ever increasing sizes of the custom cells (building blocks) in today's industry, without compromising on accuracy and correctness.", "paper_title": "Satisfiability models for maximum transition power", "paper_id": "WOS:000257987400001"}
