Fourth-order accurate discretizations of the convective and viscous fluxes are obtained oil staggered meshes using explicit or compact finite-difference formulas. High-order accuracy in time is obtained by marching the solution with Runge-Kutta methods. The incompressibility constraint is enforced for each Runge-Kutta stage iteratively either by local pressure correction or by a Poisson-equation based global pressure correction method. Local pressure correction is carried out on cell by cell basis using a local, fourth-order accurate discrete analog of the continuity equation. The global pressure correction is based on the numerical Solution of a Poisson-type equation which is discretized to fourth-order accuracy, and solved using GMRES. In both cases, the updated pressure is used to recompute the velocities in order to satisfy the incompressibility constraint to fourth-order accuracy. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated in test problems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
