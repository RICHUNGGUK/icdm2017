At authentication side, while the localization data are used to detect the blocks containing substitute information, the reference data extracted from other regions and the spatial correlation are exploited to recover the principal content in tampered area by a pixel-by-pixel manner. In this scheme, the narrower the tampered area is, the higher quality of recovered content can be obtained.", "paper_title": "Self-embedding watermark with flexible restoration quality", "paper_id": "WOS:000291953700009"}
