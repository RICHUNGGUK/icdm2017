Under this approach the idea of the inner product is introduced to achieve reversibility. By establishing the inner product between the motion vector and the modulation vector and setting the embedding conditions, we embed 1 bit data into each motion vector and the proposed algorithm is reversible. Moreover, in order to avoid distortion drift, we only embed data into b4-frames with the coding feature of 3D MVC videos. Experimental results also confirm that the proposed scheme can provide expected acceptable video quality of stegovideos and successfully achieve reversibility.", "paper_title": "A reversible video steganography algorithm for MVC based on motion vector", "paper_id": "WOS:000354898800008"}
