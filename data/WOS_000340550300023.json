The method is presented in spatial as well as transform domains and its robustness against some well-known image processing attacks is evaluated. It is shown that the QR decomposition offers capacity and robustness comparable to or better than similar watermarking based on the DCT and SVD transformations. Also, an interesting property of QR decomposition, which for the first time has been introduced by our previous paper, is proved and put in practice in more details.", "paper_title": "Fast and robust watermarking in still images based on QR decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000340550300023"}
