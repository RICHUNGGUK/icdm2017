We used a parametric sensitivity analysis to extend a theoretical model based on reactive transport and computational cell biology. The numerical experimentation involved the drill hole, the haptotactic and chemotactic migrations, and the initial concentration of an anabolic growth factor. Output measure was the mineral fraction in tissue surrounding a polymethymethacrylate (PMMA) canine implant (stable loaded implant, non-critical gap). Increasing growth factor concentration increased structural matrix synthesis. A cell adhesion gradient resulted in heterogeneous bone distribution and a growth factor gradient resulted in homogeneous bone distribution in the gap. This could explain the radial variation of bone density from the implant surface to the drill hole, indicating less secure fixation. This study helps to understand the relative importance of various host and clinical factors influencing bone distribution and resulting implant fixation.", "paper_title": "Sensitivity analysis of periprosthetic healing to cell migration, growth factor and post-operative gap using a mechanobiological model", "paper_id": "WOS:000299433900001"}
