The MOE docking (MOE-dock) and the alpha sphere and excluded volume-based ligand-protein docking (ASE-dock) showed that both NAD(+)-h11 beta HSD2 and NAD(+)-m11 beta HSD2 models have a similar binding orientation to the template cofactor-protein model. Our present study also revealed that Asp91, Phe94, Tyr232 and Thr267 could be of importance in the interaction between NAD(+) and 11 beta HSD2. NADP(+) was incapable of entering into the cofactor-binding site of the 11 beta HSD2 models. The present study proposes the latest models for 11 beta HSD2 and its cofactor NAD(+), and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a m11 beta HSD2 model with NAD(+).", "paper_title": "Molecular docking and structural analysis of cofactor-protein interaction between NAD(+) and 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2", "paper_id": "WOS:000303539500021"}
