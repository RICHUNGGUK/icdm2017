Clearly, these policies increase the number of job migrations, the number of messages generated per re-scheduled job, and also the application makespan. The main purpose of the present study is to analyze the effect of applying self-adjusting resource sharing policies to previously proposed performance based scheduling strategies. For example, when a resource is near saturation or has an internal peak demand, it can decide not to accept new external jobs. On the other hand, when a job owner receives the previous action, it can decide not to submit temporally more jobs to that resource. In this way, the proposed self-adjusting resource sharing policies save time and communication bandwidth by reducing the number of jobs migrations, and thus, avoiding the generation of the corresponding messages per re-scheduled job. At the same time, the new resource sharing strategies improve application makespan and resource performance objective functions while maintaining infrastructure owners complete autonomy.
