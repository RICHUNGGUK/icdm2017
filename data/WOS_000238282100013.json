By viewing the interconnection as a kind of input to a subsystem, it specifies sufficient conditions of string stability for a class of directed circular interconnected nonlinear systems, which is based on the input-to-state stability analysis and singular perturbation theory. The proof is first conducted on a system with two subsystems, and then expanded to finite N subsystems. Furthermore, directed graph is used as an illustrative tool in this paper.", "paper_title": "Input-to-state stability analysis of a class of interconnected nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100013"}
