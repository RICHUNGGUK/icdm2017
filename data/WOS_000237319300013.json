Sequence-based computational techniques for predicting HLA-DQ binding peptides have encountered limited success, with few prediction techniques developed using three-dimensional models. Methods: We describe a structure-based prediction model for modeling peptide-DQ3.2 beta complexes. We have developed a rapid and accurate protocol for docking candidate peptides into the DQ3.2 beta receptor and a scoring function to discriminate binders from the background. The scoring function was rigorously trained, tested and validated using experimentally verified DQ3.2 beta binding and non-binding peptides obtained from biochemical and functional studies. Results: Our model predicts DQ3.2 beta binding peptides with high accuracy [area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve A(ROC) > 0.90], compared with experimental data. We investigated the binding patterns of DQ3.2 beta peptides and illustrate that several registers exist within a candidate binding peptide. Further analysis reveals that peptides with multiple registers occur predominantly for high-affinity binders.", "paper_title": "Prediction of HLA-DQ3.2 beta ligands: evidence of multiple registers in class II binding peptides", "paper_id": "WOS:000237319300013"}
