In particular, the domain of attraction is expanded from a previous estimate, such as a classical Lyapunov level set. With the use of fuzzy-polynomial models, the domain of attraction analysis can be carried out via sum of squares optimization and an iterative algorithm. The result is a function that bounds the domain of attraction, free from the usual restriction of being positive and decrescent in all the interior of its level sets.", "paper_title": "Closed-Form Estimates of the Domain of Attraction for Nonlinear Systems via Fuzzy-Polynomial Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000333119100007"}
