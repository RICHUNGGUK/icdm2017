Here, we discuss the use of a new system, Astrolabe, to automate self-configuration, monitoring, and to control adaptation. Astrolabe operates by creating a virtual system-wide hierarchical database, which evolves as the underlying information changes. Astrolabe is secure, robust under a wide range of failure and attack scenarios, and imposes low loads even under stress. To focus the discussion, we structure it around a hypothetical Web Services scenario. One of the major opportunities created by Astrolabe is to allow Web Services client systems to autonomically adapt when a data center becomes slow or unreachable.", "paper_title": "Navigating in the storm: Using Astrolabe to adaptively configure web services and their clients", "paper_id": "WOS:000237308400002"}
