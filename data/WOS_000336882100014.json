We show that the parameterized APT(Pi) problem - given a connected graph G on n vertices and m edges and an integer parameter k, does there exist a spanning subgraph H of G such that H is an element of Pi and H has at least [GRAPHICS] edges - is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) for all 0 < lambda < 1, for all strongly lambda-extendible graph properties Pi for which the APT(Pi) problem is FPT on graphs which are 0(k) vertices away from being a graph in which each block is a clique. Our results hold for properties of oriented graphs and graphs with edge labels, generalize the recent result of Crowston et al. (ICALP 2012) on MAX-CUT parameterized above the Edwards-Erdos bound, and yield FPT algorithms for several graph problems parameterized above lower bounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
