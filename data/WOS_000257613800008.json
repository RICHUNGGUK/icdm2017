In the first phase, an EC value matrix is used to develop a strategy and value-adding services for a business and then necessary customized requirements are identified. In the second phase, a goal-driven approach is used to specify the system requirements based on the strategy. This methodology enables business managers and system developers to develop high-level strategies that improve value activities and obtain competitive advantage, and thereby determine the specifications of the core e-services. To illustrate the methodology, we use a B2C application of an online bookstore. Finally, implications and conclusions are discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
