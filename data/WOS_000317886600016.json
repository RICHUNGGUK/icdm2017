This descriptor does not rely on layout analysis and can be computed efficiently. We show how this descriptor can achieve state-of-the-art results on two very different public datasets in classification and retrieval tasks. Moreover, we show how we can compress and binarize these descriptors to make them suitable for large-scale applications. We can achieve state-of-the-art results in classification using binary descriptors of as few as 16-64 bits. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
