An Eulerian description IS used to model the flow of the fluid (carrier) phase, and the governing equations are solved using a control-volume finite element method (CVFEM). The motion of the solid (particulate) phase IS Simulated using a Lagrangian approach. An efficient algorithm is proposed for locating the particles in the finite element mesh. In the demonstration problem, which involves a particle-laden axisymmetric jet, a modified k-epsilon turbulence model is used to characterize the velocity and length scales of the turbulent flow of the fluid phase. The effect of turbulence oil the particle trajectories is accounted for through a stochastic model. The effect of the particles on the fluid time-mean velocity and turbulence (two-way coupling) is also addressed. Comparisons between predictions and available experimental data for the demonstration problem are presented. Satisfactory agreement is obtained.
