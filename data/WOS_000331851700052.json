Some sufficient conditions for assuring the existence, uniqueness and exponential stability of the equilibrium point of the system are derived using the vector Lyapunov function method, homeomorphism mapping lemma and the matrix theory. The obtained results not only are convenient to check, but also generalize the previously published corresponding results. A numerical example is used to show the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
