Design/methodology/approach - Based on 305 valid responses collected from a survey questionnaire, structural equation modeling (SEM) technology was employed to examine the research model. Findings - The results show that both information quality and system quality significantly affect users' trust and flow experiences, which further determine their loyalty. The results indicate that flow experience is the strongest determinant of users' loyalty. Practical implications - Mobile SNS providers need to consider user experience when seeking users' loyalty. They should enhance information quality and system quality in order to improve user trust and flow experience. Originality/value - Although much research has been conducted to explore the effects of extrinsic motivations, such as perceived usefulness, on mobile commerce user behavior, the effect of intrinsic motivations, such as flow experience, is seldom tested. This research found the effect of flow experience on mobile SNS users' loyalty to be significant.", "paper_title": "The effect of flow experience on mobile SNS users' loyalty", "paper_id": "WOS:000280935600016"}
