In a traditional router, the centralized switching fabric is becoming the bottleneck for its limited number of ports and complicated scheduling algorithms. Direct networks, such as 3-D Torus topology, have been successfully applied to the design of scalable routers. They show good scalability and fault tolerance. Unfortunately, its scalability is limited in practice. In this paper, we introduce another type of direct network, called H-Torus. This network shows excellent topological properties. On its basis, the designs of line card and routing algorithms are introduced. Extensive simulations show that the routing algorithm is very important in such a system and results in low latency with high throughput.", "paper_title": "Research on next-generation scalable routers implemented with H-Torus topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000257809900017"}
