Both the one and two way couplings are examined in detail, with the help of delay logistics, Ikeda and Mackey-Glass system. Robustness of the process is exhibited when the same analysis is done in presence of Gaussian noise. Influence of the strength of such a noise is shown. Our procedure opens up a potentially new approach for the synchronization study of delay dynamical systems.", "paper_title": "Robust synchronization of delay differential systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000332032800007"}
