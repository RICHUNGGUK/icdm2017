This paper focuses on their application in tourism. A comprehensive and thorough search of the smart e-Tourism recommenders reported in the Artificial Intelligence journals and conferences since 2008 has been made. The paper provides a detailed and up-to-date survey of the field, considering the different kinds of interfaces, the diversity of recommendation algorithms, the functionalities offered by these systems and their use of Artificial Intelligence techniques. The survey also provides some guidelines for the construction of tourism recommenders and outlines the most promising areas of work in the field for the next years. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
