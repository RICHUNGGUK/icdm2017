We propose a new approach to video completion that can deal with complex scenes containing dynamic background and non-periodical moving objects. We build upon the idea that the spatio-temporal hole left by a removed object can be filled with data available on other regions of the video where the occluded objects were visible. Video completion is performed by solving a large combinatorial problem that searches for an optimal pattern of pixel offsets from occluded to unoccluded regions. Our contribution includes an energy functional that generalizes well over different scenes with stable parameters, and that has the desirable convergence properties for a graph-cut-based optimization. We provide an interface to guide the completion process that both reduces computation time and allows for efficient correction of small errors in the result. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively complete complex, high-resolution occlusions that are greater in difficulty than what existing methods have shown.", "paper_title": "How Not to Be Seen - Object Removal from Videos of Crowded Scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000304901400001"}
