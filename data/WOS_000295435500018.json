There is one simplistic approach for achieving recipient anonymity. If a message is equally broadcasted to all network entities (e.g., routers and hosts), an adversary cannot infer any traffic patterns for the intended recipient. While this technique is unconditionally secure, no one believes that this is a practical solution except in some special network environments since it requires extremely expensive traffic overhead. In this paper we realize this idea with an efficient multicast protocol by introducing the concept of a public routing proxy. A public routing proxy enables a sender to deliver a message to the intended recipient anonymously since the public routing proxy multicasts the message to a set of k network entities including the intended recipient. Thus, in the proposed protocol, the recipient's k-anonymity can be unconditionally guaranteed. We also demonstrate the practicality of the proposed protocol through intensive simulation based on well-known network topologies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
