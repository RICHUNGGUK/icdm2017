Previous studies have shown that non-parametric contrast/brightness correction methods using the cumulative density function (CDF) and its improvements, which are based on gray-level transformation associated with the pixel histogram, perform well in uniform contrast/brightness difference conditions. However, for radiographs with nonuniform contrast/brightness, the CDF produces unsatisfactory results. In this paper, we propose a new approach in contrast correction based on the generalized fuzzy operator with least square method. The result shows that 50% of the contrast/brightness errors can be corrected using this approach when the contrast/brightness difference between a radiographic pair is 10 U. A comparison of our approach with that of CDF is presented, and this modified GFO method produces better contrast normalization results than the CDF approach.", "paper_title": "A robust generalized fuzzy operator approach to film contrast correction in digital subtraction radiography", "paper_id": "WOS:000239986800013"}
