It has been shown that the phase transition of k-connectivity becomes sharper as the total number of nodes n increases. In this paper, we investigate how fast such phase transition happens and derive a generic analytical formula for the phase transition width of k-connectivity for large enough n and for any fixed positive integer k in d-dimensional space by resorting to a Poisson approximation for the node placement. This result also applies to mobile networks where nodes always move randomly and independently. Our simulations show that to achieve a good accuracy, n should be larger than 200 when k = 1 and d = 1 and n should be larger than 600 when k <= 3 and d = 2, 3. The results in this paper are important for understanding the phase transition phenomenon; and it also provides valuable insight into the design of wireless multihop networks and the understanding of its characteristics.", "paper_title": "On the Phase Transition Width of K-Connectivity in Wireless Multihop Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000266033300006"}
