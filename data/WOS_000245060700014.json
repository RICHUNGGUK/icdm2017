But the critical issues of stability and convergence have always been neglected in most of the level set implementations. This often leads to either complete breakdown or premature/delayed termination of the curve evolution process, resulting in unsatisfactory results. We present a generic convergence criterion and also a means of determining the optimal time-step involved in the numerical solution of the level set equation. The significant improvement in the performance of level set algorithms, as a result of the proposed changes, is demonstrated using object tracking and shape-contour extraction results.
