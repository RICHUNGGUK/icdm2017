An essential component in ShadowStream is distributed lifecycle control mechanism, which assigns each client a virtual arrival/lifetime to create a particular scenario to evaluate the performance of streaming system. The original design focuses on utilizing stable streaming viewers in physical world to guarantee the accuracy of ShadowStream, which, on the other hand, significantly limits the scale of the experiment. The authors' research develops a novel distributed client lifecycle control to get rid of restrictions caused by the limited number of stable viewers in live-testing streaming networks. The core idea of their research is to match the desired experimental scenario with real viewers' behavior in physical world. The result demonstrates that with the authors' methodology, the scale of experiments can be doubled.", "paper_title": "Improve Distributed Client Lifecycle Control in ShadowStream", "paper_id": "WOS:000353297300005"}
