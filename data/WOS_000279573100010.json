This robot has a wagon truck to transfer luggage, important specimens, and other materials. This study proposes an obstacle collision avoidance technique for the wagon truck pulling robot which uses an omni-directional wheel system as a safe movement technology. Moreover, this paper proposes a method to reach the goal along a global path computed by path planning without colliding with static and dynamic obstacles. The method is based on virtual potential fields. Several modules with different prediction times are processed in parallel to change the robot response according to its relative velocity and position with respect to the obstacles. The virtual force calculated from each potential field is used to generate the velocity command. Some experiments were carried out to verify the performance of the proposed method. From the experimental results in a hospital it was confirmed that the robot can move along its global path, and reach the goal without colliding with static and moving obstacles.
