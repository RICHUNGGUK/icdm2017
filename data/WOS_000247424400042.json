We used rotational devices to study the tribology of such tissues, which appear to exhibit mixed and hydrodynamic lubrication. To explore mechanism, we modeled the interaction of fluid and soft material in 3D using a simple cylindrical geometry with an uneven solid-fluid interface in rotation. Deformation of the solid, frictional force, and fluid thickness are presented as a function of applied rotational velocity, applied normal load and material properties. The results suggest that the deformation caused by hydrodynamic pressure leads to load-supporting behavior. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
