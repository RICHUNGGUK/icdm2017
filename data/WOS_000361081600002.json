We introduce here the task of recognizing the location depicted in an old photo given modern annotated images collected from the Internet. We present an extensive analysis on different features, looking for the most discriminative and most robust to the image variability induced by large time lags. Moreover, we show that the described task benefits from domain adaptation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
