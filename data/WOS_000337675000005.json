Software that calculates highway distances visible to a driver has been developed. This software is supported by a geographic information system (GIS) and can use a trajectory defined by points obtained with a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver instead of relying on project information. The software includes specific tools for studying shortcomings in three-dimensional (3D) alignment; mainly, this pertains to divings. In this article, the software and its application to a case study are presented. The results are compared with those obtained using an existing validated procedure.
