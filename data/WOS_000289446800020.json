We first propose a numerical method to accurately detect the critical Reynolds number where this kind of bifurcation appears. From this singular value, we introduce a numerical tool to compute all the steady bifurcated branches. All these algorithms are based on the Asymptotic Numerical Method [1,2]. The critical values are determined by using a bifurcation indicator [3-5] and the bifurcated branches are computed by using an augmented system which was first introduced in solid mechanics [4,6]. Several numerical examples from 2D Navier-Stokes show the reliability and the efficiency of the proposed methods. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
