Currently, the MEP coordination process involves a series of meetings where representatives from each MEP trade overlay drawings of their respective systems to detect and eliminate numerous types of interferences. Tailored computer tools used to design and fabricate MEP systems almost always generate these drawings, but no knowledge-based computer technology exists to assist in the multidiscipline MEP coordination effort. The purpose of this research was to develop a technology that integrates a number of knowledge bases-design criteria, construction, and operations and maintenance-into a knowledge-based system that is able to provide valuable insight to engineers and construction personnel, to assist them in resolving coordination problems for multiple MEP systems. This research provides a foundation for future researchers to build from and for industry to create a revised work process, using information technology, to assist in multidiscipline coordination efforts.", "paper_title": "Prototype tool for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing coordination", "paper_id": "WOS:000234190700004"}
