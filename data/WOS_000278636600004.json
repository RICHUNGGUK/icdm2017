We prove that every ideal monad M has an iterative reflection, that is, an embedding into an iterative monad with the expected universal property. We also introduce the concept of iterativity for algebras for the monad M, following in the footsteps of Evelyn Nelson and Jerzy Tiuryn, and prove that M is iterative if and only if all free algebras for M are iterative algebras.", "paper_title": "Iterative reflections of monads", "paper_id": "WOS:000278636600004"}
