Test results of logic-chain bridging faults, unlike existing scan chain fault models, depend on the previous scan inputs as well as primary inputs. A bridging pair extraction algorithm is proposed to quickly extract bridging pairs from the layout. The paper proposed two sets of structural reduction techniques so that runtime is very short. Experimental results on ISCAS benchmark circuits show that, on the average, logic-chain bridging faults can be diagnosed within an accuracy of four bridging pairs. The techniques are still applicable when there are only 10 failing patterns due to limited ATE failure memory. This paper demonstrates the feasibility to diagnose logic-chain bridging faults by software.", "paper_title": "Structural Reduction Techniques for Logic-Chain Bridging Fault Diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000304448100002"}
