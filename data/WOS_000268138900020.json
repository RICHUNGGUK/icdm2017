A compilation of 40 diverse data sets is described. It is proposed that these can be used as a common benchmark sample for comparisons of QSAR methodologies, primarily in terms of predictive ability. Use of this benchmark set will be useful for both assessment of new methods and for optimization of existing methods.", "paper_title": "Comparison Data Sets for Benchmarking QSAR Methodologies in Lead Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000268138900020"}
