It seems that cyclic division algebras play the most crucial role in designing a space-time code with nonvanishing determinants. In this paper, we explicitly construct space-time codes for arbitrary numbers of transmit antennas that achieve nonvanishing determinants and the optimal diversity-multiplexing gains tradeoff over 7 [i]. Unlike previous methods usually arising a field compositum for two or more fields, our scheme, which only requires one simple extension, constitutes a much more efficient and feasible advancement whether in theory or practice.", "paper_title": "Generally Explicit Space-Time Codes With Nonvanishing Determinants for Arbitrary Numbers of Transmit Antennas", "paper_id": "WOS:000263375500008"}
