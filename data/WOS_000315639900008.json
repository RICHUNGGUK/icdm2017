When considering path delay faults, certain specified input values in a test cube are needed only for determining the lengths of the paths associated with detected faults. Path delay faults, and therefore, small delay defects, would still be detected if such values are unspecified. The goal of this paper is to explore the possibility of increasing the number of unspecified input values in a test set for path delay faults by unspecifying such values in order to make the test set more amenable to test data compression. Experimental results indicate that significant numbers of such values exist. The proposed procedure unspecifies them gradually to obtain a series of test sets with increasing numbers of unspecified values and decreasing path lengths. Experimental results also indicate that filling the unspecified values randomly (as with some test data compression methods) recovers some or all of the path lengths associated with detected path delay faults. The procedure uses a matching of the sets of detected faults for the comparison of path lengths.", "paper_title": "Computing Two-Pattern Test Cubes for Transition Path Delay Faults", "paper_id": "WOS:000315639900008"}
