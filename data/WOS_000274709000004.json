Two methods for determining the occupancy distribution and the blocking and loss probability in communication systems with state-dependent arrival processes and state-dependent admission processes are presented. The first proposed method, the recursive BPP-KR method, is based on a modification of the generalized Kaufman-Roberts formula. In the second method, the hybrid BPP-Hyb method, a convolution algorithm is used in the computational process. Particular attention is given to the multiservice traffic streams offered to the systems, which can be generated both by infinite number of traffic sources and by a finite number of sources.
