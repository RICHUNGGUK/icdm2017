Our algorithm produces succinct embeddings, where vertex positions are represented using O(log n) bits and distance comparisons may be performed efficiently using these representations. These properties are useful, for example, for routing in sensor networks, where storage and bandwidth are limited.", "paper_title": "Succinct Greedy Geometric Routing Using Hyperbolic Geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000295273500005"}
