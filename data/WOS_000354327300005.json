Two methods called Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy weighted average (IFWA) and Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric mean (IFWGM) are developed to solve the multiple attribute decision making problems under Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy environment, in which the performance ratings of alternatives and relative importance of attributes are expressed with Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The IFWA and IFWGM methods, respectively, are treated as an auxiliary pair of fractional programming models and two linear programming (LP) solution procedures are proposed simultaneously by using Charnes and Cooper transformation. Furthermore, two algorithms which are based on the IFWA and IFWGM models, respectively, are developed to solve Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy decision making problems where attribute values and weights of attributes are all in Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. The order relationship between IFWA and IFWGM are investigated. Finally, a numerical example is illustrated to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "IFWA and IFWGM Methods for MADM under Atanassov's Intuitionistic Fuzzy Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000354327300005"}
