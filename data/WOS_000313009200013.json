This problem can be handled by arranging the inputs in hierarchical ways. This paper presents a multi-objective genetic algorithm that learns serial hierarchical fuzzy systems with the aim of coping with the curse of dimensionality. By means of an experimental study, we have observed that our algorithm obtains good results in interpretability and accuracy with problems in which the number of variables is relatively high.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective genetic learning of serial hierarchical fuzzy systems for large-scale problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000313009200013"}
