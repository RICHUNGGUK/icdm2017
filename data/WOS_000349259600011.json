Both methods are based on a set of simple operators to keep the computational complexity as low as possible, thus allowing large instances of the scheduling problem to be efficiently addressed. The experimental analysis demonstrates that both versions of the parallel CPU/GPU stochastic local search are able to compute accurate suboptimal schedules in significantly shorter execution times than state-of-the-art schedulers, while also outperforming a recently published GPU parallel evolutionary scheduler in terms of both efficiency and solution quality.", "paper_title": "A parallel local search in CPU/GPU for scheduling independent tasks on large heterogeneous computing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000349259600011"}
