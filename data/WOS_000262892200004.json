The standard practice of answering a consecutively rewritten query along the propagation path often results in significant loss of information. On the opposite, the use of mediated schemas requires human interaction and global agreement, both during creation and maintenance. In this paper we present GrouPeer, an adaptive, automated approach to both issues in the context of unstructured P2P database overlays. By allowing peers to individually choose which rewritten version of a query to answer and evaluate the received answers, information-rich sources left hidden otherwise are discovered. Gradually, the overlay is restructured as semantically similar peers are clustered together. Experimental results show that our technique produces very accurate answers and builds clusters that are very close to the optimal ones by contacting a very small number of nodes in the overlay.
