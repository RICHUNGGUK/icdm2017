During the course of ten years of research, we have defined the UniCore instruction set architecture, and designed the UniCore CPU and the PKUnity SoC family. This cross-disciplinary practice has also fostered many innovations in microprocessor architecture, optimizing compilers, low power design, functional verification, physical design, and so on. In the mean time, we have put technology transfer on the list of our top priorities. This effort has led to several marketable products, such as ultra mobile personal computers, secure micro-workstations and 3C-converged consumer electronic,,. The development, of the next generation products, the 64-bit multi-core CPU and SoC, is also underway. They will find their applications in secure and adaptable computers for mobile and desktop, as well as personal digital multimedia devices. Being consistent with the philosophy and the long-term plan, and by leveraging the cutting-edge process technology, we will continue to make more innovations in CPUs and SoCs, and strengthen our commitment to technology transfer.", "paper_title": "Research Progress of UniCore CPUs and PKUnity SoCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000275623200003"}
