In this paper, a new method to realize the adaptive impulsive synchronization of two general fractional order chaotic systems with uncertain and unknown parameters is investigated. A new function is to be applied to the stability theory of fractional order directly. Then the impulsive synchronization of two fractional order chaotic systems with unknown parameters is discussed. The criteria for synchronization of the systems are established. Finally, some numerical examples are delivered to illustrate the effectiveness of our results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
