To this aim, the level of satisfaction using an e-learning platform as a complementary instrument of training and education is measured in a multinational company operating in the energy sector. Our case study focuses on two purely on-line courses involving 5395 employees, who responded to a questionnaire at the end of their learning activities on the basis of a Technology Acceptance Model. The major finding is that the usage of e-learning technology plays a full mediating role in the relationship between e-learning system service and measured employees satisfaction (organisational effectiveness in implementing knowledge improvement). This result has practical direct implications for companies with a distributed layout unable to implement conventional classroom learning. Furthermore, our investigation results ensure that well conducted e-learning programmes can effectively be adopted by a large amount of companies: more the users satisfied with e-learning service, the better in enhancing organisational learning.", "paper_title": "User satisfaction affecting the acceptance of an e-learning platform as a mean for the development of the human capital", "paper_id": "WOS:000317725400003"}
