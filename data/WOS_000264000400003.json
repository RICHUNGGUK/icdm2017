If G is edge-L-colorable for every edge assignment L with vertical bar L(e)vertical bar >= k for e is an element of E(G), then G is said to be edge-k-choosable. In this paper, we prove that if G is a planar graph without non-induced 5-cycles, then G is edge-k-choosable, where k = max{7. Delta(G) + 1}. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
