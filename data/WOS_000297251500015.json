The coupling delay and nodes delay are considered in the networks. Based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory, sufficient conditions for the existence of the optimal guaranteed cost control laws are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Under these sufficient conditions, the networks are globally asymptotically synchronous, and the optimal upper bound is also guaranteed. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Guaranteed cost control of synchronisation for uncertain complex delayed networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000297251500015"}
