The probability is calculated that an individual is able to withdraw from the crowd under one's own steam. The problem is simulated within the generalized force model (D. Helbing, et al., Nature 407 (2000) 487), and all model parameters are taken from this paper. The results indicate, that in a crowd of 150 persons, this probability is not greater than ten percent. We also evaluate the number of helpers necessary to get the above probability of fifty percent. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
