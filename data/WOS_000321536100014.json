In our proposed extension, called pi Z, a channel is associated with a stateful abstract type in the Z specification language. We develop both reduction as well as labeled transition semantics for pi Z. We show that the important properties of the pi-calculus are preserved in pi Z: (1) tau-transitions match reductions; and (2) bisimilarity induced by the labeled transitions is closed under parallel composition, name restriction, and a restricted recursion. The paper illustrates the use of stateful channels by modeling the 'hidden node problem' in a wireless network. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
