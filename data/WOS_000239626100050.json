We describe the architecture of the human tracking agent, and present an image recognition algorithm to track location and motion of the human. The human tracking agent decides the human's location, which changes in real-time, through the reletive distance of home furniture (or appliance) and human. Unlike the human's location, because a person's appearance (height, weight) is different for each person, a human's motion should be recognized to be different from each other person. We converted the image (that is acquired from the network camera) into a standard image (that is defined in the human tracking agent) for recognition of multiuser's motion. We used a LSVM(linear support vector machine) to recognize the feature patterns for human motion. In our experiment, results of motion recognition showed excellent performance accuracy of over 80%.", "paper_title": "Multi-user human tracking agent for the smart home", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100050"}
