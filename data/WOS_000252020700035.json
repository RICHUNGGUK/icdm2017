These matrices are may be useful in digital signal processing, CDMA, and coded modulation. Based on Circular Permutation Matrix (CPM) cocyclic quasi-Jacket block low-density matrix is introduced in this letter which is useful in coding theory. Additionally, we show that the fast algorithm of quasi-Jacket block matrix.", "paper_title": "A class of cocyclic quasi Jacket block matrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020700035"}
