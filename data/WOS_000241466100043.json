The algorithms combine a PSO algorithm with either the Nelder-Mead-Simplex or Powell's Direction-Set local search methods. Local search is applied each time the PSO part meets some convergence criterion. Our experimental results for test functions with up to 100 dimensions indicate that the usage of the iterative improvement algorithms can strongly improve PSO performance but also that the preferable choice of which local search algorithm to apply depends on the test function. The results also suggest that another main contribution of the local search is to make PSO algorithms more robust with respect to their parameter settings.", "paper_title": "Hybrid particle swarm optimization: An examination of the influence of iterative improvement algorithms on performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000241466100043"}
