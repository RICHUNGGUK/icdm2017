In this study, we propose a parallel data mining system for analyzing big graph data generated on a Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) computing model named BSP-based Parallel Graph Mining (BPGM). This system has four sets of parallel graph mining algorithms programmed in the BSP parallel model and a well-designed workflow engine optimized for cloud computing to invoke these algorithms. Experimental results show that the graph mining algorithm components in BPGM are efficient and have better performance than big cloud-based parallel data miner and BC-BSP.", "paper_title": "BPGM: A Big Graph Mining Tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000364485400004"}
