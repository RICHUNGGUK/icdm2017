Code generation for queue machines has some problems but the solutions have not been studied thoroughly. A new parallel queue computation model, 2-offset P-Code queue computation model, is presented together with a new code generation algorithm. The code generation algorithm takes leveled DAGs as input and produces 2-offset P-Code assembly. We also developed a queue compiler to evaluate the new algorithm and compiled a set of C language benchmark programs for the 2-offset P-Code. The queue compiler generates between 8.55% less instructions and 10.55% more instructions than an actual MIPS32 compiler for the compiled programs. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
