It can be used to compare powers, calculate the \"false discovery rate\", to study the effects of reduced step procedures, and to calculate P[U <= k], where U is the number of rejected true hypotheses. It can be used to determine the maximum number of steps that can be made and still guarantee (with a given probability) that the number of false rejections will not exceed some specified number. The test statistics are assumed to have a multivariate-t distribution.
