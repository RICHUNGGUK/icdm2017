The key step Of Surface lofting is to obtain a set of compatible B-spline curves interpolating each row. Given a set of points and their parameterization, a necessary and sufficient condition is proposed to determine the existence of interpolating B-spline curves defined on a given knot vector. Based on this condition, we first properly construct a common knot vector that guarantees the existence of interpolating B-spline curves to each row of points. Then we calculate a set of interpolating B-spline curves defined on the common knot vector by energy minimization. Using this method, fewer control points are employed while maintaining a visually pleasing shape of the lofted surface. Several experimental results demonstrate the usability and quality of the proposed method. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
