The Social Media Acceptance Model focussing on six key constructs: Self, Performance, Social Influence, Facility, Effort and Functionality was used as a guide to build Edooware, an educational tool that supports myriad of social media functionalities. Both pre and post-evaluation questionnaires were used to gauge students' perceptions on their learning experiences. A sample of 68 students from two different courses evaluated Edooware. Analysis revealed significant improvements for Self, Social Influence and Functionality after using Edooware. It can be inferred that the students were particularly attracted to some of the features provided in Edooware that are not available in the current learning platform. Educational institutions should look into the possibility of incorporating social media enabled tools to improve students' learning experiences. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
