A general dynamical system, satisfying a Lyaponov-type descent condition, is derived and specialized to a goal function combining stiffness and mass. For a cyclic time-dependent load it is indicated how, in the limit of short cycles compared to the overall time scale, this can be handled by multiple load cases. Numerical examples, both for a convex and a non-convex case, illustrates the theory.", "paper_title": "Dynamical systems, SIMP, bone remodeling and time dependent loads", "paper_id": "WOS:000303052700003"}
