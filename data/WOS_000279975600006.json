In this paper we introduce quantitative extensions and study nested word series which assign to nested words elements of a semi-ring. We show that regular nested word series coincide with series definable in weighted logics as introduced by Droste and Gastin. For this we establish a connection between nested words and the free bisemigroup. Applying our result, we obtain characterizations of algebraic formal power series in terms of weighted logics. This generalizes results of Lautemann, Schwentick and Therien on context-free languages.", "paper_title": "WEIGHTED LOGICS FOR NESTED WORDS AND ALGEBRAIC FORMAL POWER SERIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000279975600006"}
