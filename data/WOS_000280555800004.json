A visual sensor with double-layer filter system was researched for the different levels of the welding current. An image processing in C+ + language was developed to extract the seam trajectory and the offset of the torch to the seam in the welding images of aluminum alloys plates with grooves. The rectifying rule of the robot used in this paper was found based on the experimental data, and the seam tracking controller was also analyzed and constructed. The experimental results on straight line seam and curve seam demonstrated the efficiency of the proposal seam tracking system.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Seam Tracking Technology of Welding Robot with Visual Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000280555800004"}
