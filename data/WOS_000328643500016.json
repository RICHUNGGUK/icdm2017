Dynamic bandwidth assignment (DBA) avoids transmission collision in the upstream direction and improves the efficiency of the PON upstream bandwidth by dynamically adjusting the bandwidth among the optical network units (ONUs) in response to the ONU burst traffic requirement. Instead of using GATE and REPORT control messages in Ethernet PON DBA, the buffer REPORT/GRANT message is embedded into a GPON encapsulation mode (GEM)/GPON transmission convergence (GTC) frame, and all ONUs are essentially polled simultaneously within a GEM/GTC frame in GPON DBA. This paper proposes a bipartition DBA (BI-DBA) mechanism in GPON that divides the transmission cycle time into two groups and adjusts the bandwidth dynamically. Two cases are considered: in the first case, there is a first group for high priorities T-CONT 1 and T-CONT 2 and a second group for low priorities T-CONT 3 and T-CONT 4, called class based scheduling (CBDBA). In the second case, the first and the second group are created according to the number of ONUs, called group based scheduling (GBDBA). Moreover, the T-CONT 2 traffic has a prediction mechanism and recycles the remaining unused bandwidth for the low-priority T-CONTs. The GBDBA has better system performances in terms of the average bandwidth utilization, packet latency, and drop probability; on the other hand, the CBDBA has better packet delay performance when the proportion of T-CONT 1 traffic is higher and has better fairness performance.", "paper_title": "Comprehensive Performance Assessment of Bipartition Upstream Bandwidth Assignment Schemes in GPON", "paper_id": "WOS:000328643500016"}
