Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 402 users in Malaysia, and structural equation modelling analysis was employed to test the research model. Findings - The results showed that different demographic, motivation and security perceptions variables have different relationships with the types of m-commerce usage activities. Practical implications - The results from this study will be useful for m-commerce companies in formulating appropriate marketing strategies, as well as developing appropriate applications that will attract more consumers. Originality/value - Although past literatures have focused on technological aspects of m-commerce, few studies have examined the applications and strategies of m-commerce. Furthermore, most studies on m-commerce adoptions have focused on the relationships between technology adoption factors and behavioural intentions of users. There are few studies which have investigated the actual m-commerce usage activities of users.", "paper_title": "Analysis of the determinants of consumers' m-commerce usage activities", "paper_id": "WOS:000322935200007"}
