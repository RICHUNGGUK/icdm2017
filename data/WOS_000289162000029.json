Due to the high ambiguity of gene names, this task is particularly challenging. Manual annotation for this task is cost expensive, time consuming and labor intensive. Therefore, providing assistive tools to facilitate the task is of high value. Results: We developed GeneTUKit, a document-level gene normalization software for full-text articles. This software employs both local context surrounding gene mentions and global context from the whole full-text document. It can normalize genes of different species simultaneously. When participating in BioCreAtIvE III, the system obtained good results among 37 runs: the system was ranked first, fourth and seventh in terms of TAP-20, TAP-10 and TAP-5, respectively on the 507 full-text test articles.", "paper_title": "GeneTUKit: a software for document-level gene normalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000289162000029"}
