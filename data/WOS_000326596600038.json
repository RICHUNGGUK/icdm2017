The governing Gross-Pitaevskii equation (or Schrodinger equation) can be reformulated as a Schrodinger-Poisson (SP) type system [13]. The two-level continuation scheme is developed for tracing the first solution curves of the SP system, which in turn provide an appropriate initial guess for the Newton method to compute ground state solutions for 3D dipolar EEC. Extensive numerical experiments on 3D dipolar EEC and dipolar EEC in optical lattices are reported. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
