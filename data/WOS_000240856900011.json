In this paper, we consider the problem of packing n soft rectangles r(1), r(2),..., r(n) into R. We prove that, if a(R) >= Sigma(1 <= i <= n) a(r(i)) + 0.10103a(max) and a(max) <= 3(min{h(R), w(R)})(2) hold for a(max) = max(1 <= i <= n) a(r(i)), then these n soft rectangles can be packed inside R so that the apect ratio of each rectangle r(i) is at most 3.", "paper_title": "Packing soft rectangles", "paper_id": "WOS:000240856900011"}
