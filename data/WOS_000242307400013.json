In particular, we explore the meaning negotiations among communicating agents. The self-organizing map is used as a model of an agent's conceptual memory. The concepts are not explicitly given but they are learned by the agent in an unsupervised manner. Concepts are viewed as areas formed in a self-organizing map based on unsupervised learning. The language acquisition process is modeled in a population of simulated agents by using a series of language games, specifically observational games. The results of the simulation experiments verify that the agents learn to communicate successfully and a shared lexicon emerges.", "paper_title": "Simulating meaning negotiation using observational language games", "paper_id": "WOS:000242307400013"}
