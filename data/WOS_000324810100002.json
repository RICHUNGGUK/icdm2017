The influence of axial forces has generally been considered as compression onto symmetrically reinforced cross-sections, thus strain at the reference fiber never has been an issue. However, when dealing with integral structures, which are usually statically indeterminate in different degrees, these concepts are not sufficient. Their horizontal elements are often completely restrained, which, under imposed deformations, leads to moderate compressive or tensile axial forces. The authors propose to analyze conventional beam cross-sections with moment-curvature diagrams considering asymmetrically reinforced cross-sections under combined influence of bending and moderate axial force. In addition a new diagram is introduced that expands the common moment-curvature relation onto the strain variation at the reference fiber. A parametric study presented in this article reveals the significant influence of selected cross-section parameters.", "paper_title": "Expanding the classic moment-curvature relation by a new perspective onto its axial strain", "paper_id": "WOS:000324810100002"}
