Traditionally, in the Byzantine fault model, faults are statically attributed to a set of up to t processes. This, however, implies that in this model a process at which a value fault occurs is forever \"stigmatized\" as being Byzantine, an assumption that might not be acceptable for long-lived systems, where processes need to be reintegrated after a fault. We thus consider a model where Byzantine processes can recover in a predefined recovery state, and show that consensus can be solved in such a model. Our model admits executions where over time every process is faulty as long as there are always enough correct processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
