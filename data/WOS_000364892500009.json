To improve efficiency compared to conventional global checkpointing, we exploit the inherent data compression of the multigrid hierarchy, and relax the synchronicity requirement through a local failure local recovery approach. We experimentally identify the root cause of convergence degradation in the presence of data loss using smoothness considerations. Our resulting schemes form a family of techniques that can be tailored to the expected error probability of (future) large-scale machines. A performance model gives further insight into the benefits and applicability of our techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
