When multiple non-functional criteria are considered, users are required to express their preferences over different quality attributes as numeric weights in existing methods. However, this imprecise method may not reflect the natural ordering of services and thus could miss some user-desired services. In this paper, we propose a composition framework to construct multiple skyline composite services for each individual request. We also discuss how a service registry can effectively deal with multiple requests simultaneously by materializing the intermediate composite services. We evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods through extensive experiments.", "paper_title": "PROCESSING MULTIPLE REQUESTS TO CONSTRUCT SKYLINE COMPOSITE SERVICES", "paper_id": "WOS:000333067200003"}
