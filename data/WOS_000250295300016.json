This class imbalance problem would impede the performance of some standard classifiers since a modal-class pattern may cover many relatively weak interest patterns. This study presents a new learning algorithm based on conflict-sensitive contexture, which remedies the class imbalance problem by basing decisions on the inconsistency of the local entropy estimator. The study also adopts a new neuro-fuzzy network algorithm with multiple decision rules to a real-world banking case for mining very significant patterns. The proposed algorithm can attain accuracy for minority classes at classification from roughly 10% up to 71%. This work also elucidates these patterns of interests and suggests many business applications for them. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
