The seat includes a force platform assembly suitable for measuring the magnitude, position and direction of the force applied to each thigh while sitting or rising from the chair. The natural frequency of the chair fixed to the floor was found to be 14.0 +/- 2 Hz with an estimated damping of xi = 0.20. Static tests showed that the maximal errors were 2% of the full-scale output (726 N vertically, 164 N horizontally) for both vertical and horizontal forces. The root mean square error of the center of pressure location was estimated as 5 mm. Preliminary data on the net joint moment at the hips of one healthy subject computed with and without consideration for the forces under the thighs revealed significant amplitude differences. In conclusion, the results indicate that the characteristics of the instrumented chair are acceptable and the chair can be used to assess the biomechanics of sitting and sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit tasks in various subject populations.", "paper_title": "A chair with a platform setup to measure the forces under each thigh when sitting, rising from a chair and sitting down", "paper_id": "WOS:000253215600010"}
