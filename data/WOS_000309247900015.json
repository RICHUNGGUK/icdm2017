However, its computational complexity is very high. In this paper, we propose three tools to enhance the WBCT coding scheme, in particular, on reducing its computational complexity. First, we propose short-length 2-D filters for directional transform. Second, the directional transform is applied to only a few selected subbands and the selection is done by a mean-shift-based decision procedure. Third, we fine-tune the context tables used by the arithmetic coder in WBCT coding to improve coding efficiency and to reduce computation. Simulations show that, at comparable coded image quality, the proposed scheme saves over 92% computing time of the original WBCT scheme. Comparing to the conventional 2-D wavelet coding schemes, it produces clearly better subjective image quality. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
