The PTIDES model is an actors-like model that claims to deliver precise control over end-to-end latencies in a complex real-time system. The present work jointly investigates both claims by (1) implementing several PTIDES-based schedulers as Flexotask scheduler plugins, and (2) using the resulting system to implement a new reactive control program for a simulation of the JAviator. We present results from the realistic JAviator control application and also from synthetic benchmarks designed to shed light on the differences between the several PTIDES schedulers we implemented.", "paper_title": "PTIDES on Flexible Task Graph: Real-Time Embedded System Building from Theory to Practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000268471100005"}
