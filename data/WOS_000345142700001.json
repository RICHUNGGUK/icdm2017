The cells considered in this study reside in the periosteum. Furthermore, they are believed to be activated by certain substances to initiate bone growth. This study focuses on the role that stress driven diffusion plays in the transport of these substances from the medullary cavity to the periosteum. Calculations of stress driven diffusion are performed under steady state conditions using a finite element method with the concentration of nutrients in the cambium layer of the periosteum obtained for different choices of load frequencies. The results are compared with experimental findings, suggesting that increased bone growth occurs in the neighbourhood of relatively high nutrient concentration.", "paper_title": "A two-dimensional model for stress driven diffusion in bone tissue", "paper_id": "WOS:000345142700001"}
