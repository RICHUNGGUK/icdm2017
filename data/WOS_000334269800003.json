In this paper, we extend this result to general online convex optimization. In particular, this resolves an open problem that has been posed in a number of recent papers. We first analyze the limitations of the FTRL algorithm as proposed by Hazan and Kale (in Machine Learning 80(2-3), 165-188, 2010) when applied to online convex optimization, and extend the definition of variation to a gradual variation which is shown to be a lower bound of the total variation. We then present two novel algorithms that bound the regret by the gradual variation of cost functions. Unlike previous approaches that maintain a single sequence of solutions, the proposed algorithms maintain two sequences of solutions that make it possible to achieve a variation-based regret bound for online convex optimization. To establish the main results, we discuss a lower bound for FTRL that maintains only one sequence of solutions, and a necessary condition on smoothness of the cost functions for obtaining a gradual variation bound. We extend the main results three-fold: (i) we present a general method to obtain a gradual variation bound measured by general norm; (ii) we extend algorithms to a class of online non-smooth optimization with gradual variation bound; and (iii) we develop a deterministic algorithm for online bandit optimization in multipoint bandit setting.", "paper_title": "Regret bounded by gradual variation for online convex optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000334269800003"}
