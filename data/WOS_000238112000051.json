The dissipativity of the system and stability of equilibrium point are studied by mens of Lyapunov theory. Stable fixed point, periodic and quasi-periodic orbits, and chaotic motion are observed in system via numerical calculation. With the change of the slope and threshold of activation function, as well as time delay and synaptic weight, the system passes from stable to periodic and then to chaotic regimes. Interestingly, the system returns to periodic or stable regimes by further changing these parameter values. Furthermore, some numerical evidences, such as phase portraits, bifurcation diagrams, power spectrum density, are given to confirm chaos.", "paper_title": "Numerical analysis of a chaotic delay recurrent neural network with four neurons", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000051"}
