In this paper, we address the problem from a view which integrates conventional tracking and detection and present a temporal probabilistic combination of discriminative observers of different life spans. Each observer is learned from different ranges of samples, with different subsets of features, to achieve varying levels of discriminative power at varying costs. An efficient fusion and temporal inference is then done by a cascade particle filter which consists of multiple stages of importance sampling. Experiments show significantly improved accuracy of the proposed approach in comparison with existing tracking methods, under the condition of LFR data and abrupt motion of both target and camera.", "paper_title": "Tracking in low frame rate video: A cascade particle filter with discriminative observers of different life spans", "paper_id": "WOS:000258344900005"}
