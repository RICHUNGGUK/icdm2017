The necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence are derived. A detailed analysis reveals that the convergence order is higher than that of the previous finite-difference scheme. The coupled double distribution function (DDF) model is used to describe discontinuity flows and verify the improvement. Numerical simulations of compressible flows with shock wave show that the improved finite-difference lattice Boltzmann scheme is accurate and has less dissipation. The numerical results are found to be in good agreement with the analytical results and better than those of the previous scheme.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL LESS DISSIPATION FINITE-DIFFERENCE LATTICE BOLTZMANN SCHEME FOR COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS", "paper_id": "WOS:000310802600003"}
