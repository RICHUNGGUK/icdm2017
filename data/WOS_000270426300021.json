It is an emerging solution for multimedia content authentication and retrieval. This paper proposes a multipurpose image hashing scheme based on DCT-VQ for both copyright protection and content authentication. The original image is first block-DCT transformed. In each DCT block, two groups of DCT coefficients are then respectively vector quantized to generate two indices, one for copyright protection and the other for content authentication. The obtained two index sequences are transformed into two binary strings using different mapping functions. Finally, the authentication mark and permuted copyright logo are respectively XOR-ed with the two binary strings to generate final authentication and protection fingerprints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "A DCT-VQ BASED MULTIPURPOSE IMAGE HASHING SCHEME FOR COPYRIGHT PROTECTION AND CONTENT AUTHENTICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000270426300021"}
