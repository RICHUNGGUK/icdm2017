Such stereotypes are important in order to study the impact of different design variables on user performance. In this paper, a neural network-based method is proposed to quantify the causal connection among design variables and to compute their relative influences on the two performance measures of user response time and response accuracy. Based on the experimental data presented here, the best operating condition with which to optimize each of the measures is suggested. Some useful observations about the relationship between design variables and measures are also presented and discussed. In ergonomics, there have been a lack of useful quantitative methods for investigating the mappings between different displays and controls under a variety of operating conditions. The major contribution of this study is to provide some insight into the usefulness of quantitative methods in evaluating display-control compatibility.", "paper_title": "A Study of the Impact of Different Direction-of-Motion Stereotypes on Response Time and Response Accuracy Using Neural Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000307893300005"}
