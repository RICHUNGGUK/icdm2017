An application based on the sensor network also has various requirements to provide services to users. Therefore it is important to develop the common USN middleware for flexible integration between the sensor networks and applications. Especially, this paper focuses on intelligent service management which is one of the main functions of USN middleware. Several applications in the sensor network environment support not only monitoring services, but also sensor-based context-awareness and intelligent services. In many applications, however, approaches to support intelligent services depend on the application because the standard method has been undefined yet. Therefore this paper proposes a common method for processing intelligent services in USN middleware independent of an application. The proposed method is implemented and evaluated as a component of USN middleware.", "paper_title": "Intelligent service processing in common USN middleware", "paper_id": "WOS:000286054000003"}
