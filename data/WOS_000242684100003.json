It is derived using Parzen windowing to estimate an information theoretic distance measure between probability density functions. We propose to optimize the Information Cut using a gradient descent-based approach. Our algorithm has several advantages compared to many other graph-based methods in terms of determining an appropriate affinity measure, computational complexity, memory requirements and coping with different data scales. We show that our method may produce clustering and image segmentation results comparable or better than the state-of-the art graph-based methods. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.
