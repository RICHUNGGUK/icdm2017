Moreover, we prove that this holds also for the cut polytope and the stable set polytope. These results were discovered through a new connection that we make between one-way quantum communication protocols and semidefinite programming reformulations of LPs.", "paper_title": "Exponential Lower Bounds for Polytopes in Combinatorial Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000354799200008"}
