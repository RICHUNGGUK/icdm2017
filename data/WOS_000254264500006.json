This ATPG performs power reduction during dynamic test compaction so the test length overhead is very small. This low-power test generator implements several novel techniques, such as parity backtrace, confined propagation, dynamic controllability and post-fill test regeneration. The experimental data on ISCAS benchmark circuits show that the peak capture power and the peak shift power are reduced by 31% and 26%, respectively.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous capture and shift power reduction test pattern generator for scan testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000254264500006"}
