It consists of over 650 sequences of dynamic textures, mostly in everyday surroundings. Additionally, we propose a scheme for the manual annotation of the sequences based on a detailed analysis of the physical processes underlying the dynamic textures. Using this scheme we describe the texture sequences in terms of both visual structure and semantic content. The videos and annotations are made publicly available for scientific research.
