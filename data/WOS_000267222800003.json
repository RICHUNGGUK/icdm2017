The balance between feasibility and optimality is a key issue. This is addressed by using a knapsack model to ensure that the solutions produced by the construction heuristic are easy to repair. Several construction heuristics and neighbourhoods are compared empirically. The best combination is further enhanced by a diversification strategy and a dynamic evaluation criterion. Tests show that it outperforms previously published approaches and finds optimal solutions quickly and consistently.", "paper_title": "A grasp-knapsack hybrid for a nurse-scheduling problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000267222800003"}
