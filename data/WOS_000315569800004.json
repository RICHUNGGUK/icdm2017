In this paper, a method of modified K-means-based support vector machine (SVM) classification is proposed to use a hybrid sample selection that leverages the informativeness and representativeness of training samples to classify real multi/hyperspectral images. The hybrid sample selection (close-to-cluster-border sampling and near-cluster-center sampling) is constructed on the reduced convex hulls (RCHs) of clustering structure and can reduce the risk of overtraining caused by active sample selection of active learning methods. Numerical results obtained on the classification of three challenging remote sensing images (Landsat-7 ETM+, AVIRIS Indian pines, and KSC) by comparing the proposed technique with random sampling (RS) and margin sampling (MS) demonstrate the good efficiency and high accuracy of our approach.", "paper_title": "Clustering-Based Extraction of Near Border Data Samples for Remote Sensing Image Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000315569800004"}
