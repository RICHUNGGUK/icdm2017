An extra regular item indicating the prior knowledge of the problem to be solved is added in the cost functional to obtain better generalization performance, and a simple and efficient method named cost functional minimized extreme and incremental learning (CFM-EIL) algorithm is proposed. In CFM-EIL based SLRRN (CFM-EIL-SLRRN), the ridgelet hidden neurons together with their parameters are tuned incrementally and analytically; thus it can significantly reduce the computational complexity of gradient based or other iterative algorithms. Some simulation experiments about time-series forecasting are taken, and several commonly used regression ways are considered under the same condition to give a comparison result. The results show the superiority of the proposed CFM-EIL-SLRRN to its counterparts in forecasting. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
