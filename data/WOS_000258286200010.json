Linear zero-forcing V-BLAST (ZF V-BLAST) algorithm and maximum ratio combining (MRC) scheme was applied to the receivers. The average bit error rate (BER) expression was derived on condition that the number of receive antennas was larger than that of transmit antennas and it was verified by simulations. Numerical results show that the number of transmit and receive antennas, as well as the number of subcarriers, all exert significant effects on the BER performance. The space diversity and frequency diversity show different abilities to improve the BER performance. The MIMO MC-CDMA system based on linear ZF V-BLAST algorithm is capable of achieving better BER performance than that of the conventional MC-CDMA system by reducing the number of transmit antennas or increasing the number of receive antennas.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of uplink MIMO MC-CDMA systems based on linear zero-forcing V-BLAST algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000258286200010"}
