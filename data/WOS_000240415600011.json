The new data model formalized as ISO 14649 is under development by ISO TC184 SC1 and SC4 for the replacement of the old standard so-called G&M codes, formalized as ISO 6983 which has been used since the 1950s. As the new data model is being established, development and implementation of STEP-compliant CAD/CAM/CNC system based on the new data model is drawing worldwide attention. Several systems have been reported in such international conventions as the ISO Expert Committee Meeting. Up to the present time, all the STEP-CNC systems are intended for milling operation. In this paper, the authors first present STEP-compliant CNC system for turning system including the data model, followed by a generic architecture and functionality. Implementation results obtained from a prototype system called TurnSTEP have been provided. Based on the results, the authors are convinced of the validity of the STEP-NC data model together with the effectiveness of the STEP-CNC system for turning. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
