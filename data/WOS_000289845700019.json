As the distance-measurement ranges are often less than the communication ranges for many ranging systems, most communication-dense wireless networks are localization-sparse. Consequently, existing algorithms fail to provide accurate localization supports. In order to address this issue, by introducing the concept of component, we group nodes into components so that nodes are able to better share ranging and anchor knowledge. Operating on the granularity of components, our design, CALL, relaxes two essential restrictions in localization: the node ordering and the anchor distribution. Compared to previous designs, CALL is proven to be able to locate the same number of nodes using the least information. We evaluate the effectiveness of CALL through extensive simulations. The results show that CALL locates 90% nodes in a network with average degree 7.5 and 5% anchors, which outperforms the state-of-the-art design Sweeps by about 40%.", "paper_title": "Component-Based Localization in Sparse Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000289845700019"}
