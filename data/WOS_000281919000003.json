One of the most popular queries, continuous k nearest neighbor, has been widely addressed. However, none of them focuses on continuous LookAhead k nearest neighbor. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new approach, called Continuous LookAhead k Nearest Neighbor (CLKNN) which is different from the traditional continuous k nearest neighbor because CLKNN user concerns with only the objects of interest in the forward space of query point according to a predefined moving direction. Objects of interest, which are behind the moving query point, are not of interest anymore. Look Ahead KNN which will be proposed first is used for static query point, whereas the Look Ahead CKNN is used for moving query point. Our experiments verify the applicability of the proposed approach to solve queries which involve Look Ahead k nearest neighbors continuously.", "paper_title": "LookAhead continuous KNN mobile query processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000281919000003"}
