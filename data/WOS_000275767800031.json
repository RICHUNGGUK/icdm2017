An external disturbance is supposed to act on the dynamics. The stochastic stability and stochastic stabilization problems of this class of systems are tackled. The H(infinity) state feedback controller is designed to stabilize the system and at the same time assure the rejection of the external disturbance with a desired level. Sufficient conditions that consider only the known bounds on the transition jump rates are developed either for stability or stabilization. A design procedure for the controller which guarantees that the dynamics of the system will be stochastically stable is proposed. It is shown that the addressed problems can be solved if the corresponding developed convex optimization problems are feasible. A numerical example is employed to show the usefulness of the proposed results", "paper_title": "STABILIZATION OF STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS WITH PARTIALLY KNOWN TRANSITION JUMPS RATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000275767800031"}
