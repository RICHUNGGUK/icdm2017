It has been widely used in protecting copyright and transmitting sensitive data over an insecure channel. Conventional data hiding schemes only focus on how to reduce the distortion when sensitive data is embedded into the cover image. However, the transmitted images may be compressed or occur transmitting errors. If such errors occur, the receiver cannot extract the correct information from the stego-image. In this paper, we proposed a novel hiding data scheme with distortion tolerance. The proposed scheme not only can prevent the quality of the processed image from being seriously degraded, but also can simultaneously achieve distortion tolerance. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme indeed can obtain a good image quality and is superior to the other schemes in terms of its distortion tolerance. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
