By calculating the score, a weighted sum of average vehicle speed, average inter-vehicle distance, road type, and road gain, for each candidate road, the DNA can generate a road score table and choose the road with the highest score among the candidate roads toward the destination. In addition, a dynamic rebroadcasting block (DRB) is designed in the DNA to carry out Road-Request (R-REQ) rebroadcasting function. The DRB mechanism can prevent from network congestion incurred by R-REQ rebroadcasting. The performance of our proposed DNA is evaluated through simulations. Simulation results have shown that the DNA performs much better than other navigational schemes in reaching a destination with shorter travel distance and less travel time.", "paper_title": "A Dynamic Navigation Approach with Rebroadcasting Flood Avoidance in VANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000297605900014"}
