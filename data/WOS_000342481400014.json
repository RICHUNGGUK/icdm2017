This problem is inspired by two well-studied parameterized vertex deletion problems, VERTEX COVER and FEEDBACK VERTEX SET, Which Can also be expressed as TREEWIDTH-t VERTEX DELETION problems: t = 0 for VERTEX COVER and t = 1 for FEEDBACK VERTEX SET. While single-exponential FPT algorithms, i.e. running in 2(O(k)).n(O(1)) co time, are known for these two latter problems, it was open whether the K-4-MINOR COVER problem could be solved in single-exponential EFT time. This paper answers this question in the affirmative. Observe that it is known to be unlikely that TREEWIDTH-t VERTEX DELETION can be solved in time 2(O(k)).n(O(1)).
