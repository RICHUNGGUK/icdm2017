It makes use of virtual point lights (VPL) to compute bounced illumination and a point-based scene representation to query indirect visibility, similar to Imperfect Shadow Maps (ISM). To ensure a high fidelity of indirect light and shadows, our solution is made view-adaptive by means of two orthogonal improvements: First, the VPL distribution is chosen to provide more detail, that is, more dense VPL sampling, where these contribute most to the current view. Second, the scene representation for indirect visibility is adapted to ensure geometric detail where it affects indirect shadows in the current view.", "paper_title": "Making Imperfect Shadow Maps View-Adaptive: High-Quality Global Illumination in Large Dynamic Scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000297317200009"}
