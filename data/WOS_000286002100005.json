The inherently hybrid character of locative media use necessitates that the designers of such applications take into account the way communication and social interaction is influenced by contextual elements. In this paper, an investigation into the communicational and social practices of users who participate in a location-based game is presented, with an emphasis on group formation and dynamics, interpersonal communication, and experienced sense of immersion. This investigation employs a methodological approach that is reliant on both qualitative and quantitative data analysis. A series of this user experience study's results are presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Theoretical and methodological implications of designing and implementing multiuser location-based games", "paper_id": "WOS:000286002100005"}
