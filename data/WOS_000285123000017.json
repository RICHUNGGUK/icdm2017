The security of an identity-based system relies on a trusted private key generator (PKG) that generates private keys for users. Unfortunately, the assumption of a trusted PKG (or a curious-but-honest PKG) is considered to be too strong in some situations. Therefore, achieving security without such an assumption has been considered in many cryptographic protocols. As a PKG knows the private keys of its users, man-in-the-middle attacks (MIMAs) from a malicious PKG is considered as the strongest attack against a key agreement protocol. Although securing a key agreement process against such attacks is desirable, all existent identity-based key agreement protocols are not secure under such attacks. In this paper, we, for the first time, propose an identity-based authenticated key agreement protocol resisting MIMAs from malicious PKGs that form a tree, which is a commonly used PKG structure for distributing the power of PKGs. Users are registered at a PKG in the tree and each holds a private key generated with all master keys of associated PKGs. This structure is much more efficient, in comparison with other existing schemes such as threshold-based schemes where a user has to register with all PKGs. We present our idea in two protocols. The first protocol is not secure against MIMAs from some kinds of malicious PKGs but holds all other desirable security properties. The second protocol is fully secure against MIMAs. We provide a complete security proof to our protocols. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
