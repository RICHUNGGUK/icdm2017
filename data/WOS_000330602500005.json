First, the supercloseness of the gradients between the piecewise linear finite element solution u(h) and the linear interpolation u(I) is derived by using a weak estimate and an estimate of the discrete derivative Green's function. We then analyze a superconvergence patch recovery scheme for the gradient of the finite element solution, showing that the recovered gradient of u(h) is superconvergent to the gradient of the true solution u.", "paper_title": "Pointwise Superconvergence Patch Recovery for the Gradient of the Linear Tetrahedral Element", "paper_id": "WOS:000330602500005"}
