This method can express the spatial correlation of textons. During the course of feature extracting, we have quantized the original images into 256 colors and computed color gradient from the RGB vector space, and then calculated the statistical information of textons to describe image features. Image retrieval experimental results have shown that our proposed method has the discrimination power of color, texture and shape features, the performances are better than that of GLCM and CCG.
