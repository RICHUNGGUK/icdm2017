Multiphysics measurement techniques have been developed to analyze the correlations between each physical parameter. For multiphysics measurement, some researchers have combined two measurement techniques, including the application of functional particles which are sensitive to pressure or temperature to the conventional PIV technique for simultaneous measurement. The present review introduces some recent results of phosphorescence-based multiphysics visualization. The basics of phosphorescence are described, and the techniques of PIV, PSP, LIF, and TP are also discussed because these techniques were used for multiphysics measurement. Finally, the remarkable results of multiphysics measurement are summarized in detail, especially for simultaneous measurement techniques.", "paper_title": "Phosphorescence-based multiphysics visualization: a review", "paper_id": "WOS:000344082700001"}
