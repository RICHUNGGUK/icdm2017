Inspired from this phenomenon, we propose an evolutionary algorithm called Unit Bit Importance Evolutionary Algorithm (UBIEA). Compared with Darwinian-type genetic algorithms, UBIEA completely abandons commonly used genetic operators such as mutation and crossover. Its main idea is that: detecting bit importance, speeding up the convergence of important bits and maintaining the diversity of unimportant bits. Although our theoretic analyses are based on the assumption that all bits are independent and have different salience, UBIEA perhaps is usable in a larger framework which can be verified by numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "Unit bit importance evolutionary algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000240363800002"}
