DEA is a popular technique for efficiency evaluation. There might be a couple of efficient DMUs. Classical DEA models cannot fully rank efficient DMUs. In this paper, a novel technique for fully ranking all DMUs based on changing reference set using a single virtual inefficient DMU is proposed. To this end, the first concept of virtual DMU is defined as average of all inefficient DMUs. Virtual DMU is a proxy of all inefficient DMUs. This new method proposes a new ranking method that takes into account impact of efficient DMUs on virtual DMU and impact of efficient DMUs on influences of other efficient DMUs. A case study is given to show applicability of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A new data envelopment analysis method for ranking decision making units: an application in industrial parks", "paper_id": "WOS:000363201500003"}
