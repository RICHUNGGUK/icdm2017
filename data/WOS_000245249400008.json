The main goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of NGT in a web-based environment compared to its traditional counterpart. Comparisons were made along several performance and process-related dimensions. First, the decision process and experimental methodology are introduced. Second, the interface design used during the online sessions is described. Next, the response variables were explored following two difference approaches. The first approach compared the response variables from the traditional and the online setting. The second approach assessed the differences in perceived values before and after the session was conducted. Results revealed that the traditional NGT outperformed the online version in the variables related to the process. However, traditional groups did not significantly differ from online groups with respect to the variables related to the outcomes. Finally, we suggest conditions for enhanced productivity in idea-generating and problem-solving groups by providing some sustaining evidence. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
