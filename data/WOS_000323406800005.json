In particular, we address the key issue of the relationship that should hold between the operators in a family in order to understand that they properly define a consistent FAO. We focus on the idea of strict stability of a family of aggregation operators in order to propose an operative notion of consistency between operators of such a family. In this way, robustness of the aggregation process can be guaranteed. Some strict stability definitions for FAOs are proposed, leading to a classification of the main aggregation operators in terms of the properties they satisfy. Furthermore, we apply this approach to analyze the stability of some families of aggregation operators based on weights. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
