This restriction is one of big questions in cooperative networks since it decreases overall bandwidth-efficiency. In this paper, we propose a scheme which alleviates it through novel use of dual carrier modulation (DCM) and an adequately designed distributed space-time block code (DSTBC). The proposed scheme achieves comparable error performance to the conventional one while providing 20% higher transmission rate. The performance is always guaranteed by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based adaptive cooperation algorithm.
