The two bosons are initially simply placed at two positions on the ring which is an unentangled state. After some time evolution, we project the segments to a pure state through coarse grained measurements which ascertain whether there is a particle present in a given segment without revealing any information about its position within the segment. Subject to finding a particle in each segment, we quantify the entanglement established between the segments through the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem. We also investigate whether this entanglement increases with the number of particles and compare the entanglement in dynamical and ground states.", "paper_title": "Pure state entanglement between separated regions using impenetrable bosons", "paper_id": "WOS:000258398400027"}
