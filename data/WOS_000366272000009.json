We focus on its semantical theory from the viewpoint of Pavelka's graded semantics of propositional fuzzy logic, investigate the L-tautologies based on different Kripke frames. We also define the notion of L-semantical consequence operation, its some basic properties are obtained. Finally, this paper considers the fuzzy decision implications in propositional fuzzy modal logic with evaluated syntax based on MV-algebras, and presents a kind of semantical characteristics of fuzzy decision implications. Moreover, we introduce the notions of possible and necessary fuzzy decision implication, and their semantical characteristics are presented as well.", "paper_title": "Semantics of Propositional Fuzzy Modal Logic with Evaluated Syntax and its Application to Fuzzy Decision Implications", "paper_id": "WOS:000366272000009"}
