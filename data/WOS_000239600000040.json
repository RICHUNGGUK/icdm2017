In this paper we confront this problem by means of a Genetic Algorithm that is hybridized with a local search method. The Genetic Algorithm searches over the space of active schedules, whereas the local search does it over the space of semi-active ones. We report results from an experimental study over a set of selected problem instances showing that this combination of search spaces is better than restricting both algorithms to search over the same space. Furthermore we compare with the well-known Genetic Algorithms proposed by D. Mattfeld and the Branch and Bound procedure proposed by P. Brucker and obtain competitive results.", "paper_title": "Scheduling with memetic algorithms over the spaces of semi-active and active schedules", "paper_id": "WOS:000239600000040"}
