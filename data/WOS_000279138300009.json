This article revisits a 2004 survey of corporate firewall configurations that quantified the extent of this issue. In addition to being much larger, the current study includes configurations from two major vendors. It also introduces a new firewall complexity measure that applies to both types of firewalls. The study's findings validate the 2004 study's main observations: firewalls are (still) poorly configured, and a rule set's complexity is (still) positively correlated with the number of detected configuration errors. However, unlike the 2004 study, the current study doesn't suggest that later software versions have fewer errors.", "paper_title": "Trends in Firewall Configuration Errors Measuring the Holes in Swiss Cheese", "paper_id": "WOS:000279138300009"}
