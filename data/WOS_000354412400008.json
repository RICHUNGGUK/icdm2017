Mining association rules focus on obtaining relations between data. When mining association rules in big data, conventional methods encounter severe problems incurred by the tremendous cost of computing and inefficiency to achieve the goal. This study proposes an evolutionary algorithm to address these problems, namely Niche-Aided Gene Expression Programming (NGEP). The NGEP algorithm (1) divides individuals to several niches to evolve separately and fuses selected niches according to the similarities of the best individuals to ensure the dispersibility of chromosomes, and (2) adjusts the fitness function to adapt to the needs of the underlying applications. A number of experiments have been performed to compare NGEP with the FP-Growth and Apriori algorithms to evaluate the NGEP's performance in mining association rules with a dataset of measurement for environment pressure (Iris dataset) and an Artificial Simulation Database (ASD). Experimental results indicate that NGEP can efficiently achieve more association rules (36 vs. 33 vs. 25 in Iris dataset experiments and 57 vs. 44 vs. 44 in ASD experiments) with a higher accuracy rate (74.8 vs. 53.2 vs. 50.6% in Iris dataset experiments and 95.8 vs. 77.4 vs. 80.3% in ASD experiments) and the time of computing is also much less than the other two methods.", "paper_title": "Mining association rules in big data with NGEP", "paper_id": "WOS:000354412400008"}
