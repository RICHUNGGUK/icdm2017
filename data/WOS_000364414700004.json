There are some parallel tools to improve the efficiency for encoder and decoder. However, owing to the dependence of the current prediction block and surrounding block, parallel processing at CU level and Sub-CU level are hard to achieve. In this paper, focusing on the spatial motion vector prediction (SMVP) and temporal motion vector prediction (TMVP), parallel improvement for spatio-temporal prediction algorithms are presented, which can remove the dependency between prediction coding units and neighboring coding units. Using this proposal, it is convenient to process motion estimation in parallel, which is suitable for different parallel platforms such as multi-core platform, compute unified device architecture (CUDA) and so on. The simulation experiment results demonstrate that based on HM12.0 test model for different test sequences, the proposed algorithm can improve the advanced motion vector prediction with only 0.01% BD-rate increase that result is better than previous work, and the BDPSNR is almost the same as the HEVC reference software.", "paper_title": "Spatio-Temporal Prediction Based Algorithm for Parallel Improvement of HEVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000364414700004"}
