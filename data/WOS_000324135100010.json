For a given poset P=(X,a parts per thousand(0)) and a cost function c(x,y) defined on XxX, we want to find a linear extension of P such that maximum cost is as small as possible. For the general case, it is NP-complete. In this paper we consider the linear extension problem with the assumption that c(x,y)=0 whenever x and y are incomparable. First, we prove the discussed problem is polynomially solvable for a special poset. And then, we present a polynomial algorithm to obtain an approximate solution.", "paper_title": "Minimizing the maximum bump cost in linear extensions of a poset", "paper_id": "WOS:000324135100010"}
