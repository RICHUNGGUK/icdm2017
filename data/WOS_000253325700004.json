A detailed assessment of the turbulence closures by comparison with both mean-flow and turbulent experimental quantities is presented. The Reynolds-stress model which is wall-topology free and which uses an optimized redistribution closure, is in good agreement with experimental data both for wall-pressure and mean-velocity profiles. Detailed analysis of three components of the Reynolds-stress tensor (comparison with measurements and transport-equation budgets) provides a critical evaluation of full Reynolds-stress models for the separated supersonic compression ramp. The discrepancy observed in the shock-wave foot region, between computations and measurements for the Reynolds-stresses profiles, could be explained by considering the experimental shock-wave oscillation and directions for future modelling work are indicated.
