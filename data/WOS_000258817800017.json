The two fingerprints to be matched are first aligned using their minutiae, then the images are decomposed in several overlapping sub-windows, each sub-window is convolved with a bank of Gabor filters and, finally, the invariant local binary patterns histograms are extracted from the convolved images. Extensive experiments conducted over the four FVC2002 fingerprint databases show the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid approach with respect to the well-known Tico's minutiae matcher and other image-based approaches. Moreover, it BioHashing approach have been designed using the proposed fixed-length feature vector and very interesting performance has been obtained by combining it with the Tico's minutiae matcher.
