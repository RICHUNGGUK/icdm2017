The equations are solved by two high order schemes. The first one using the fifth-order WENO scheme combined with spectral projection to solenoidal field, the second one being based on the second-order AUSM MUSCL scheme with artificial compressibility in dual time. The schemes are used to model a flow around an obstacle moving through the stratified fluid. The setup of the computational case corresponds to the experiment of Chaschechkin and Mitkin [23]. Mutual comparison of results obtained by both schemes as well as of the experimental data is presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
