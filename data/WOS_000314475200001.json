When these schemes are applied in two or three dimensions, the errors become functions of both wavenumber and the direction of the wave. For the Euler equations, the direction of flow and flow velocity are also important. Spectral analysis was used to predict the error in magnitude and direction of the group velocity of vorticityentropy and acoustic waves in the solution of the linearised Euler equations in a two-dimensional Cartesian space. The anisotropy in these errors, for three schemes, were studied as a function of the wavenumber, wave direction, mean flow direction and mean flow Mach number. Numerical experiments were run to provide confirmation of the developed theory.
