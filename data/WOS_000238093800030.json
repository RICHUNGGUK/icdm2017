This paper will show that with a few simple off-the-shelf items a microfluidic DNA computer can be build. It also shows hybridisation and annealing working in such a system. Furthermore, there are some tentative results of a small computing problem. Finally, in the conclusion, it gives some suggestion of ways of automation.", "paper_title": "A poor man's microfluidic DNA computer", "paper_id": "WOS:000238093800030"}
