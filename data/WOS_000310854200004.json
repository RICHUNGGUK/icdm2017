We believe that it may provide a useful example of formal reasoning about logic programs. The correctness property concerns the declarative semantics. The proof, however, refers to the operational semantics (LD-resolution) of the source programs. Its conciseness is due to applying a suitable proof method.", "paper_title": "A simple correctness proof for magic transformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000310854200004"}
