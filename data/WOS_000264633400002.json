Traditionally, curvelet watermarks are embedded into all sample frequency bands. However, the study of individual band behavior and the use of single band for watermarking have not been reported. The selective band will provide an addition security feature against any physical tampering. This paper aims to give an intensive study on the robustness of watermarking using selective curvelet coefficients from a single band and to find out the best band for embedding watermark. Wrapping of specially selected Fourier samples is employed to implement Fast Discrete Curvelet Transforms (FDCT) to transform the digital image to the curvelet domain.", "paper_title": "A ROBUST WATERMARKING SCHEME USING SELECTIVE CURVELET COEFFICIENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000264633400002"}
