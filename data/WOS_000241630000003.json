It allows software developers to implement various useful program transformation without serious efforts. Although the range of program transformation enabled by reflection is quite restricted, it covers a large number of interesting applications. In particular, several non-functional concerns found in web-application software, such as distribution and persistence, can be implemented with program transformation by reflection. Furthermore, a recently emerging technology known as aspect-oriented programming (AOP) provides better and easier programming interface than program transformation does. One of the roots of AOP is reflection and thus this technology can be regarded as an advanced version of reflection. In this tutorial, we will discuss basic concepts of reflection, such as compile-time reflection and runtime reflection, and its implementation techniques. The tutorial will also cover connection between reflection and aspect-oriented programming.", "paper_title": "Program transformation with reflection and aspect-oriented programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000241630000003"}
