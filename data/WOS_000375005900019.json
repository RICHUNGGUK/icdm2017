Thirty-four Australian adolescents (26 girls, 8 boys) aged 13 to 17 years participated in the study. Five semi-structured focus groups (3 mixed groups, 2 all-girl groups) were conducted to explore how adolescents perceive their own and others' SNS behaviours, the motivation underlying these behaviours, and the expected outcomes related to particular behaviours. Teenagers reported that they spend a good deal of time planning their SNS posts, felt that the information they posted was a true reflection of them as a person, and thus interpreted feedback (\"likes\") as measuring their self-worth. In contrast, some teenagers were perceived as \"chasing the like\" for status and popularity while not caring about how accurately their posts represented them as a person. A potential gender bias in these findings is discussed.", "paper_title": "Chasing The 'Like': Adolescent Use Of Social Networking Sites In Australia", "paper_id": "WOS:000375005900019"}
