In this novel solution, we automate this process by proposing a framework that determines important depth cues for the input scene and the rendering methods to provide these cues. While determining the importance of the cues, we consider the user's tasks and the scene's spatial layout. The importance of each depth cue is calculated using a fuzzy logic-based decision system. Then, suitable rendering methods that provide the important cues are selected by performing a cost-profit analysis on the rendering costs of the methods and their contribution to depth perception. Possible cue conflicts are considered and handled in the system. We also provide formal experimental studies designed for several visualization tasks. A statistical analysis of the experiments verifies the success of our framework.", "paper_title": "A Framework for Applying the Principles of Depth Perception to Information Visualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000329136700002"}
