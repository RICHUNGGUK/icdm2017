By using a fixed point theorem in a cone, the existence of at p-Leastone, two or three positive solutions under some sufficient conditions is obtained. The interesting points are that the boundary condition is a new kind of Sturm-Liouville type and the nonlinearity may change sign. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
