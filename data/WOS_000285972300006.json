Both temporal and spatial information are combined to generate a saliency map, and features are available based on the change of saliency. Considering the context of shot changes, a statistical detector is constructed to determine all types of shot transitions by the minimization of the detection-error probability simultaneously under the same framework. The evaluation performed on videos of various content types demonstrates that the proposed approach outperforms a more recent method and two publicly available systems, namely VideoAnnex and VCM.", "paper_title": "VIDEO-SHOT TRANSITION DETECTION: A SPATIO-TEMPORAL SALIENCY APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000285972300006"}
