With this design, a common relay is exploited to help the communications between multiple secondary source-destination pairs, which allows for a more efficient use of the radio resources, and moreover, generates less interference to primary licensees in the network. Considering the spectrum-sharing constraints on the relay and secondary sources, the achievable data rate of the proposed cross-layer design is derived and evaluated. Numerical results on average capacity and uniform capacity in the network under study substantiate the efficiency of our proposed design.", "paper_title": "Cross-Layer Combining of Information-Guided Transmission with Network Coding Relaying for Multiuser Cognitive Radio Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696500008"}
