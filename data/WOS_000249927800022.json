The availability and resilience of the Internet under failures can have significant global effects. However, in the current Internet routing architecture, achieving the high level of reliability demanded by many mission-critical activities can be costly. In this paper, we first propose a novel solution framework called reliability as an interdomain service (REIN) that can be incrementally deployed in the Internet and may improve the redundancy of IP networks at low cost. We then present robust algorithms to efficiently utilize network redundancy to improve reliability. We use real IP network topologies and traffic traces to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and algorithms.", "paper_title": "Reliability as an interdornain service", "paper_id": "WOS:000249927800022"}
