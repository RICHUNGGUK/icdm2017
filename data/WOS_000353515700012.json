This problem has been extended to three or more variables; for this generalization, all fast algorithms proposed so far rely on the lattice approach. In this paper, we reduce this multivariate interpolation problem to a problem of simultaneous polynomial approximations, which we solve using fast structured linear algebra. This improves the best known complexity bounds for the interpolation step of the list-decoding of Reed-Solomon codes, Parvaresh-Vardy codes, and folded Reed-Solomon codes. In particular, for Reed-Solomon list-decoding with re-encoding, our approach has complexity O similar to (l(omega-1)m(2)(n - k)), where l, m, n, and k are the list size, the multiplicity, the number of sample points, and the dimension of the code, and. is the exponent of linear algebra; this accelerates the previously fastest known algorithm by a factor of l/m.", "paper_title": "Faster Algorithms for Multivariate Interpolation With Multiplicities and Simultaneous Polynomial Approximations", "paper_id": "WOS:000353515700012"}
