In this case, quality of service (QoS) adaptability is particularly important since some important features of the integrated network call for QoS adaptability, such as mobility, bursty applications and so on. Traditional QoS schemes include integrated service (IntServ) and differentiated service (DiffSev) as well as their variants. However, they are not able to balance well between scalability and QoS granularity. For example, IntServ faces the scalability problem, while DiffServ can only provide coarse granular QoS. In addition, they are also unable to efficiently support QoS adaptability. Therefore, a per-packet differentiated queueing service (DQS) was proposed. DQS was originally proposed to balance between scalability and QoS granularity in wired networks and then extended to wireless networks. This paper mainly discusses how to use DQS to support QoS adaptability in wired-wireless integrated networks. To this end, we propose a scheme to determine dynamic delay bounds, which is the key step to implement DQS to support QoS adaptability. Simulation studies along with some discussions are further conducted to investigate the QoS adaptability of the proposed scheme, especially in terms of its support of QoS adaptability to mobility and to bursty real-time applications.", "paper_title": "Provisioning of QoS Adaptability in Wired-Wireless Integrated Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000316038800009"}
