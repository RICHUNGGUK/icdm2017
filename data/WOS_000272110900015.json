A sample of pairs (functional predictor and response) is observed. When predicting the response for a new functional predictor value, a semi-metric is used to compute the distances between the new and the previously observed functional predictors. Then each pair in the original sample is weighted according to a decreasing function of these distances. A Weighted (Linear) Distance-Based Regression is fitted, where the weights are as above and the distances are given by a possibly different semi-metric. This approach can be extended to nonparametric predictions from other kinds of explanatory variables (e.g., data of mixed type) in a natural way. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
