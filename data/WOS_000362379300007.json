We combine the pair density approximation, which is highly accurate but feasible only for the isotropic interactions between atoms, with the Takahashi-Imada approximation for general interactions. We present finite temperature simulations results for energy and structure of molecules-helium clusters (XHe20)-He-4 (X=HCCH and LiH) which show a marked improvement over the Trotter approximation which has a 2nd-order time step bias. We show that the 4th-order corrections of the Takahashi-Imada approximation can also be applied perturbatively to a 2nd-order simulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
