In the present work, the oligomerization mechanisms of Al(OH)(3) were investigated systematically with the Gaussian 03 package at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level in combination with CPCM single-point energy calculations. The results of our theoretical model showed that: (1) the Al atoms are tetracoordinate and pentacoordinate; (2) in alkaline solution, Al(OH)(3) tends to condense into more soluble polyhydroxy compounds; (3) the neutral dimerization of Al(OH)(3) and the transfer of the hydrogen on the bridging hydroxyl are energetically favorable, but the most stable geometry is a four-membered Al-O ring structure linked by two bridging hydroxyls; (4) Al(OH)(3) is inclined to form tetracoordinate oligomers, which develop into three-dimensional structures connected by four-membered Al-O rings.", "paper_title": "Mechanistic investigations of Al(OH)(3) oligomerization mechanisms", "paper_id": "WOS:000316677600009"}
