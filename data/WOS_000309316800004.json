It is noted that all marine surface vessels are required to adhere to COLREGs at all times in order to minimise or eliminate the risk of collisions. The approach presented is essentially a reactive path planning algorithm which provides feedback to the autopilot of an unmanned vessel or the human captain of a manned ship for steering the craft safely. The proposed strategy consists of waypoint guidance by line-of-sight coupled with a manual biasing scheme. This is applied to the dynamic model of an unmanned surface vehicle. A simple PID autopilot is incorporated to ensure that the vessel adheres to the generated seaway. It is shown through simulations that the resulting scheme is able to generate viable trajectories in the presence of both stationary and dynamic obstacles. Rules 8 and 14 of the COLREGs, which apply to the amount of manoeuvre and to a head-on scenario respectively are simulated. A comparison is also made with an offline or deliberative grid-based path planning algorithm which has been modified to generate COLREGs-compliant routes. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
