They generalize previous ones respectively given by Rizomiliotis (IEEE Trans Inf Theory 56:4014-4024, 2010) and Zeng et al. (IEEE Trans Inf Theory 57:6310-6320, 2011) and some new functions with desired properties are obtained. The functions constructed in this paper can be balanced and have optimal algebraic degree. Further, a new lower bound on the nonlinearity of the proposed functions is established, and as a special case, it gives a new lower bound on the nonlinearity of the Carlet-Feng functions, which is slightly better than the best previously known ones. For , the numerical results reveal that among the constructed functions in this paper, there always exist some functions with nonlinearity higher than or equal to that of the Carlet-Feng functions. These functions are also checked to have good behavior against fast algebraic attacks at least for small numbers of input variables.", "paper_title": "Two constructions of balanced Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity, high nonlinearity and good behavior against fast algebraic attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356360000009"}
