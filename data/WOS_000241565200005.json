Such integration is designed in a Bayesian framework, and a Belief Propagation technique is exploited to perform coherent form/motion labeling of regions of the observed scene. Experiments on both synthetic and real data are presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Bayesian propagation for perceiving moving objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000241565200005"}
