In previous work, the quality of monitoring (QoM) is evaluated based on the stochastic events capture without taking the energy of motion into consideration. Since sensor nodes are normally constrained by limited energy capability, it is desirable to guide the mobile sensor in an energy-efficient motion to capture events information. In this paper, by analyzing the different kinds of surveillance that may result in different required QoM. We obtain the expected Information captured Per unit of Energy consumption (IPE), which is a function with multiple parameters including the event type, the event dynamics, and the velocity of the mobile sensor. Our analysis is based on a realistic energy model of motion, and can achieve suboptimal motion plans by adopting existing typical approximation algorithm, and thus enable the sensor velocity to be optimized for capturing stochastic events information. We propose approximation algorithms to enable the tradeoff between the computation and efficiency. which make motion plans more practical in some realistic scenarios. The efficiency and effectiveness of proposed algorithm are validated by the extensive simulations.
