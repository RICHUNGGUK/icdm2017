This paper proposes two such strategies, based upon hierarchical routing and signaling crankback, to handle single and multi-link failure events in multi-domain IP/MPLS networks (also extendible to optical DWDM networks). Specifically, the hierarchical routing strategy relies upon abstracted domain information to compute inter-domain loose routes, whereas the crankback scheme applies signaling re-tries to restore paths in a domain-by-domain manner. The performance of these proposed solutions is then analyzed and compared via simulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
