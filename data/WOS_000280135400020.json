The key component is a novel volumetric Laplacian deformation tool inspired by the state-of-the-art differential surface deformation techniques. Working on the volumetric domain and incorporating inhomogeneous material from CT data make the new approach suitable for soft tissue simulation. In particular, the system employs a special sketch contour driving deformation interface, which can provide realistic 3D rhinoplasty simulation with intuitive and straightforward 2D manipulation. When satisfied with the appearance, the change of soft tissue before and after simulation is utilized to generate the individual prosthesis model automatically. Clinical validation using post-operative CT data demonstrated that the system can provide prediction results of high quality. And the surgeons who used the system confirmed that this planning system is attractive and has potential for daily clinical practice.
