The deglitching technique is realized by lowering the voltage swing of the control signal as well as by using a method of glitch counteraction (GC). A new switch-driver structure is designed to enable the effectiveness of the GC and provide sufficient driving capability under a low supply voltage. Moreover, the control signal's rise/fall asymmetry which increases the glitch error can be suppressed by using the proposed switch-driver structure. The 12-bit DAC is implemented in 180nm CMOS technology. The measurement results show that the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) at low signal frequency is 78.8 dB, and it is higher than 70 dB up to 60MHz signal frequency at 400 MS/s. The measured INL and DNL are both less than +/- 0.6 LSB.", "paper_title": "A 12-BIT 400-MS/s CURRENT-STEERING DAC WITH DEGLITCHING TECHNIQUE", "paper_id": "WOS:000331282500004"}
