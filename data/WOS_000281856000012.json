This theoretical approach was the ground for a study conducted by a European Commission project envisioning the single integrated information space, where MIS is focal working towards a seamless intra/internet-based structured space for dynamic and value-adding collaboration purposes. Characterised by the semiotics perspective, this paper evaluates at technological level the ATHENA framework for systems interoperability, complemented by non-Technological Interoperability Metrics (nT-IM). Then, based on such results it analyses the vision of stakeholders and concludes with considerations on MSI in the advent of the single electronic market, discussing the correlation of the technical framework and non-technical interoperability measurement indicators with semiotic levels and theories for MIS, identifying the principal challenges for MSI when characterised by the semiotic levels according to the stakeholders recognised issues, as a wider framework for managing integrated complex information systems.", "paper_title": "Semiotics-based manufacturing systems integration in the advent of a single electronic market", "paper_id": "WOS:000281856000012"}
