First, we propose the pyramid partwise bag of words (PPBoW) representation which implicitly encodes both local visual characteristics and human body structure. Furthermore, we formulate the task of single/multi-view human action recognition into a part-induced multi-task learning problem penalized by graph structure and sparsity to discover the latent correlation among multiple views and body parts and consequently boost the performances. The experiment shows that this method can significantly improve performance over the standard BoW+SVM method. Moreover, the proposed method can achieve competing performance simply with low dimensional PPBoW representation against the state-of-the-art methods for human action recognition on KTH and MV-TJU, a new multi-view action dataset with RGB, depth and skeleton data prepared by our group.
