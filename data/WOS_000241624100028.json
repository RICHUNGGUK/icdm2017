Mobile devices with multiple network interfaces are very common and to make these multi-mode devices communicate with any WPAN device at anytime, anywhere, a framework for heterogeneous wireless networks is essential. Therefore, we propose an integration framework that handle heterogeneous WPAN protocols simultaneously in a unified ways. In this paper, we explain the requirements and detailed design of our framework, and then present the emulation test results.", "paper_title": "Design and emulation of integration framework for heterogeneous wireless PAN networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624100028"}
