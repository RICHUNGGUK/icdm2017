Design: Using participants from two different sites, we conducted a repeated measures simulator-based experiment to assess ICU nurses' ability to detect abnormal patient variables using a novel IGID versus a conventional tabular information display. Patient scenarios and display presentations were fully counterbalanced. Measurements: We measured percent correct detection of abnormal patient variables, nurses' perceived workload (NASA-TLX), and display usability ratings. Results: 32 ICU nurses (87% female, median age of 29 years, and median ICU experience of 2.5 years) using the IGID detected more abnormal variables compared to the tabular display [F(1, 119) = 13.0, p < 0.05]. There was a significant main effect of site [F(1, 119) = 14.2], with development site participants doing better. There were no significant differences in nurses' perceived workload. The IGID display was rated as more usable than the conventional display [F(1, 60) = 31.7]. Conclusion: Overall, nurses reported more important physiological information with the novel IGID than tabular display. Moreover, the finding of site differences may reflect local influences in work practice and involvement in iterative display design methodology. Information displays developed using user-centered design should accommodate the full diversity of the intended user population across use sites. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
