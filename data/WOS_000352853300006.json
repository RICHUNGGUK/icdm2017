A New low-voltage low-power consumption comparator for Successive Approximation Register Analogue to Digital Converter has been designed to prolong the lifetime in WSNs in this paper. The input is amplified by a differential amplifier with positive feedback structure in the pre-amplifier. The positive feedback latch can reduce the power consumption. Using a constant bias circuit to provide two different bias voltages, an eliminated effect of different process variations on the amplifier is observed. Lifetime of individual sensor node as well as lifetime of sensor networks which using traditional circuits are compared with new architecture and their probability density functions (pdf) has been figured out.", "paper_title": "Energy efficient comparator for successive approximation register ADCs with application to wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352853300006"}
