To be able to solve the problem for real-world cases, the artificial immune algorithm (AIA) technique is used to generate an optimal or near-optimal control strategy for reactive power compensation and bus voltage regulation. Two real-world cases are tested to demonstrate the effectiveness and high efficiency of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Optimization of reactive power compensation and voltage regulation using artificial immune algorithm for radial transmission networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000254666000008"}
