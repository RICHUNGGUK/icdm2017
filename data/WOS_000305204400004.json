This paper proposes an automated trace signal selection algorithm, which uses the pruning-based strategy to reduce the exploration space. First, the restoration range is covered for each candidate signals. Second, the constraints are generated based on the conjunctive normal form (CNF) to avoid the conflict. Finally the candidates are selected through pruning-based enumeration. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can bring higher restoration ratios and is more effective compared to existing methods.", "paper_title": "Pruning-Based Trace Signal Selection Algorithm for Data Acquisition in Post-Silicon Validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000305204400004"}
