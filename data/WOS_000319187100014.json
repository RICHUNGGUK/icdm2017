The rectangle intersection problem is a subset of the plane sweep problem, a topic of computational geometry and a component in design rule checking, parasitic resistance-capacitance extraction, and mask processing flows. A variant of a plane sweep algorithm that is embarrassingly parallel and therefore easily scalable on multicore machines and clusters, while exceeding the best-known parallel plane sweep algorithms on real-world tests, is presented in this letter.", "paper_title": "A Variant of Parallel Plane Sweep Algorithm for Multicore Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000319187100014"}
