In the source coding setting, a decoder wishes to reconstruct the source subject to a distortion constraint, while an encoder is required to estimate the decoder's reconstruction reliably. Side information is action-dependent in the sense that its quality and/or availability at the encoder or decoder can be influenced by a cost-constrained action sequence. In the channel coding dual, the decoder wishes to decode both the message and the channel input sequence reliably, and the channel state information available at the encoder or decoder is assumed to depend on the action sequence. We consider discrete memoryless systems and characterize single letter expressions for the rate-distortion-cost function and channel capacity for the respective source and channel coding problems.", "paper_title": "Coding With Action-Dependent Side Information and Additional Reconstruction Requirements", "paper_id": "WOS:000363256500039"}
