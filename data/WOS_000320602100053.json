This algorithm is fast and requires a small amount of memory per processing element, which makes it even suitable for SIMD implementation. The proposed parallel algorithm completes in O(K + S-2 - T-2) steps for a clustering problem of N data patterns with M features per pattern and K clusters where S and T are the minimum numbers such that NM <= S! and KM <= T!, on the S-dimensional star graph.
