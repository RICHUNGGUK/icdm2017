In this article, we target embedded CMPs, and propose a novel Hybrid Scratch Pad Memory (HSPM) architecture which consists of SRAM and NVM to take advantage of the ultra-low leakage power, high density of NVM, and fast access of SRAM. A novel data allocation algorithm as well as an algorithm to determine the NVM/SRAM ratio for the novel HSPM architecture are proposed. The experimental results show that the data allocation algorithm can reduce the memory access time by 33.51% and the dynamic energy consumption by 16.81% on average for the HSPM architecture when compared with a greedy algorithm. The NVM/SRAM size determination algorithm can further reduce the memory access time by 14.7% and energy consumption by 20.1% on average.", "paper_title": "Management and Optimization for Nonvolatile Memory-Based Hybrid Scratchpad Memory on Multicore Embedded Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000346219200006"}
