Using this new function, called H-isoefficiency, it is now possible to analyze the scalability of heterogeneous clusters. In order to show how this new metric can be used, a theoretical a priori analysis of the scalability of a Gauss Elimination algorithm is presented, together with a model evaluation which demonstrates the correlation between the theoretical analysis and the experimental results.", "paper_title": "Evaluating scalability in heterogeneous systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000296635800011"}
