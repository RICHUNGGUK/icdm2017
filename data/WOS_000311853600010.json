In this paper, motivated by a psychological theory of word meaning, we propose a graph-based approach to constructing a cross-language association dictionary (CLAD) from Wikipedia, which can be used in a variety of cross-language accessing and processing applications. In order to evaluate the quality of the mined CLAD, and to demonstrate how the mined CLAD can be used in practice, we explore two different applications of the mined CLAD to cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). First, we use the mined CLAD to conduct cross-language query expansion; and, second, we use it to filter out translation candidates with low translation probabilities. Experimental results on a variety of standard CLIR test collections show that the CLIR retrieval performance can be substantially improved with the above two applications of CLAD, which indicates that the mined CLAD is of sound quality.", "paper_title": "Mining a multilingual association dictionary from Wikipedia for cross-language information retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000311853600010"}
