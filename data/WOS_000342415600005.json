In this paper, we consider the Ising channel with feedback and find the capacity of the channel together with a capacityachieving coding scheme. To calculate the channel capacity, an equivalent dynamic programming (DP) problem is formulated and solved. Using the DP solution, we establish that the feedback capacity is the expression C = (2H(b)(a)/3 + a) approximate to 0.575522, where a is a particular root of a fourth-degree polynomial and H-b(x) denotes the binary entropy function. Simultaneously, a = arg max0 <= x <= 1(2H(b)(x)/3 + x). Finally, an error- free, capacity-achieving coding scheme is provided together with the outlining of a strong connection between the DP results and the coding scheme.", "paper_title": "Capacity and Coding for the Ising Channel With Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000342415600005"}
