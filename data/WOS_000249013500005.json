An institutional analysis of our historical and empirical data from six NHS organisations identifies growing fragmentation in the organisational field of healthcare, as past and present institutional logics both fuel and inhibit changes in the governance systems and working practices of healthcare practitioners. This is further complicated by new institutional logics that place the citizen at centre stage of the NPfIT, in a move to promote patient choice and public value.", "paper_title": "Conflicting institutional logics: a national programme for IT in the organisational field of healthcare", "paper_id": "WOS:000249013500005"}
