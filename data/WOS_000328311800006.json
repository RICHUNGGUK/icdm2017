In the HSAM, three time slots are assembled into a super-slot, each slot in the super slot is allocated to a particular AC according to its priority. The main idea of HSAM is to stagger the transmission slots of different ACs to reduce collisions, while maintaining the service differentiation. Extensive results from simulations have demonstrated good performance of HSAM comparing with EDCA protocol in terms of throughput, packet loss and MAC delay. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
