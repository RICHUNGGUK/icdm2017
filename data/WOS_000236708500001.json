However, less progress has been achieved in constructing reasoning frameworks from existing systems that support organizations in architecture analysis and design decisions. These reasoning frameworks are necessary, for example, to assemble existing components and deploy them in new system configurations. We propose a model-centric approach where this kind of reasoning is driven by the analysis of quality attribute scenarios. The scenarios and the related quality attribute models guide the SAR effort by focusing on the elicitation of model relevant artifacts. The approach further drives the model construction towards the analytical support of What If scenarios that explore responses stimulated by new requirements, such as new deployments of existing components. The paper provides two real-world case studies. The first case study introduces the model-centric reconstruction approach in the context of a large satellite tracking system. The second case study provides the construction of a time performance model for an existing embedded system in the automotive industry. The model allows us to perform cost-efficient predictions of component assemblies in new customer configurations.
