The lack of a target attribute (target column/class label) makes the division process into a set of groups very difficult to define and construct. The end user needs to exert considerable effort to interpret the results of diverse algorithms because there is no pre-defined reliable \"benchmark\". To overcome this drawback the current paper proposes a methodology based on bounded-rationality theory. It implements an S-shaped function as a saliency measure to represent the end user's logic to determine the features that characterize each potential group. The methodology is demonstrated on three well-known datasets from the UCI machine-learning repository. The grouping uses cluster analysis algorithms, since clustering techniques do not need a target attribute. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
