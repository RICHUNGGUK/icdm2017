The solutions to these equations can help people design the structures of fuzzy systems in such a way that the number of rules is largely reduced. This paper studies the distributive functional equation I(x, S-1 (y, z)) = S-2 (I(x, y), I(x, z)), where S-1 and S-2 are two continuous t-conorms given as ordinal sums, and I : [0, 1](2) -> [0, 1] is a binary function which is increasing with respect to the second place. If there is no summand of S-2 in the interval [I(1, 0), I(1, 1)], we get its continuous solutions directly. If there are summands of S-2 in the interval [I(1, 0), I(1, 1)], by defining a new concept called feasible correspondence and using this concept, we describe the solvability of the distributive equation above and characterize its general continuous solutions. When I is restricted to fuzzy implications, it is showed that there is no continuous solution to this equation. We characterize its fuzzy implication solutions, which are continuous on (0, 1] x [0, 1].", "paper_title": "Distributive Equations of Fuzzy Implications Based on Continuous Triangular Conorms Given as Ordinal Sums", "paper_id": "WOS:000319930000012"}
