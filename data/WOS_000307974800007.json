While current approaches for defining design rules are largely unsystematic and empirical in nature, this paper offers a novel framework for early and systematic evaluation of design rules and layout styles in terms of major layout characteristics of area, manufacturability, and variability. The framework essentially creates a virtual standard-cell library and performs the evaluation based on the virtual layouts. Due to the focus on the exploration of rules at an early stage of technology development, we use first-order models of variability and manufacturability (instead of relying on accurate simulation) and layout topology/congestion-based area estimates (instead of explicit and slow layout generation). Such a framework can be used to co-evaluate and cooptimize design rules, patterning technologies, layout methodologies, and library architectures.", "paper_title": "DRE: A Framework for Early Co-Evaluation of Design Rules, Technology Choices, and Layout Methodologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000307974800007"}
