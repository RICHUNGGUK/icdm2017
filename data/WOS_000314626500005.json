The Pilarcos open service ecosystem architecture provides an environment where inter-enterprise collaborations can be collectively managed, utilizing correctness and acceptability criteria set in ecosystem-wide dynamic processes. The correctness requirements are defined in terms of business network models, policies and service definitions that are dynamically utilized as complex conformance reference points. Failures to conform to these reference points trigger pre-committed recovery behavior. The ODP reference model provides sufficient and efficient facilities for the design of this kind of complex, adaptive system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
