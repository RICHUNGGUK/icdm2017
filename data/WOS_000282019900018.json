This work is motivated by applications in freeform architecture and leads to a discussion of fields of conjugate directions in surfaces, their singularities and indices, their optimization and their interactive modeling. The actual meshing is performed by means of a level set method which is capable of handling combinatorial singularities, and which can deal with planarity, smoothness, and spacing issues.", "paper_title": "Designing Quad-dominant Meshes with Planar Faces", "paper_id": "WOS:000282019900018"}
