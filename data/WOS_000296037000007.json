The most prominent example of a base sequence (U-k)(k) is the sequence of Fibonacci numbers. We prove that the representations of minimal weight Sigma(k)vertical bar epsilon(k)vertical bar are recognised by a finite automaton and obtain an asymptotic formula for the average number of representations of minimal weight. Furthermore, we relate the maximal number of representations of a given integer to the joint spectral radius of a certain set of matrices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
