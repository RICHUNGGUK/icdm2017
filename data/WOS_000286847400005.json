The usability of voiceprint authentication using digits (random strings and telephone numbers) and sentences (branded and unbranded) are compared in a controlled experiment with 204 telephone banking customers. Results indicate high levels of usability and customer acceptance for voiceprint authentication in telephone banking. Customers find voiceprint authentication based on digits more usable than that based on sentences, and a majority of participants would prefer to use digits. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
