The scheduling of a simple manufacturing system with the help of common assignment rules has been simulated. rst. The results are studied and analysed with the help of time-delay plots. Some conclusions are drawn and, based on them, a new method of scheduling is proposed. The method is tested against conventional rules and the results are evaluated and discussed, specifically by addressing practical and generalization issues.", "paper_title": "Dispatching policy for manufacturing jobs and time-delay plots", "paper_id": "WOS:000246903100002"}
