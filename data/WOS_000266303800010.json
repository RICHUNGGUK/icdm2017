We present a comparative study of four well-known, general-purpose, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to learn Boolean queries in IRSs. These evolutionary algorithms are the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II), the first version of the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA), the second version of SPEA (SPEA2), and the Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA).", "paper_title": "A Study of the Use of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms to Learn Boolean Queries: A Comparative Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000266303800010"}
