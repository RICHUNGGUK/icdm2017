The qualitative descriptions of a given set are defined as L-fuzzy sets. In the case where the well-ordered set is finite, a distance between L-fuzzy sets is introduced based on the properties of the lattice L. The concept of the information contained in a qualitative label is introduced, leading to a formal definition of the entropy of an L-fuzzy set as a Lebesgue integral. In the discrete case, this integral becomes a weighted average of the information of the labels, corresponding to the Shannon entropy in information theory.
