Another important issue specific to some data sets, like Fitness, is their uniform distribution due to tile analysis that was performed on them. In this paper, we propose a novel data mining tool named OSDM (Optimized Shape Distribution Method) to give a comprehensive view of correlations of attributes in cases of uneven frequency distribution among different values of symptoms. We apply OSDM to explore the relationship of the Fitness data and symptoms in medical test dataset for which popular data mining methods fail to give an appropriate output to help doctors decisions. In our experiment, OSDM found several useful relationships.", "paper_title": "OSDM: Optimized shape distribution method", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200115"}
