This research presents a new RGB color image encryption using keystream generator based on Choquet fuzzy integral (CFI). The properties of the dynamical keystream generator with mathematical analysis are presented in this work. In the proposed method, the CFI is first used to generate pseudo-random keystreams. Then, each of the color pixels is decomposed into three gray-level components. The output of the CFI is used to randomly shift the bits of three gray-level components. Finally, three components of RGB color pixels and the generated keystream are coupled to encrypt the permuted components. Performance aspects of the proposed algorithm such as the entropy analysis, differential analysis, statistical analysis, cipher random analysis, and cipher sensitivity analysis are introduced to evaluate the security of the new scheme. The experimental results reveal the fact that the proposed algorithm is suitable for practical use in protecting the security of digital image information distributed via the Internet.
