However, it is quite difficult for a batch-oriented processing system to progressively provide cumulatively accurate results in the context of a distributed environment. MapReduce Online extends the MapReduce framework to support online aggregation, but it is hindered by its processing speed in keeping up with ongoing real-time data events. We deploy the online aggregation algorithm over S4, a scalable stream processing system that is inspired by the combined functionalities of MapReduce and Actor model. Our system applies an asynchronous message communication mechanism from actor model to support online aggregation. It can process large scale data stream with high concurrency in a short response time. In this system, we adopt a distributed weighted random sampling algorithm to solve biased distribution between different streams. Furthermore, a multi-level query processing topology is developed to reduce overlapped processing for multiple queries. Our system can provide continuous window aggregation with a confidence interval and error bound. We have implemented our system and conducted plentiful experiments over the TPC-H benchmark. A large number of experiments are carried out to demonstrate that by using our system, high-quality query results can be generated within a short response time and that the approach outperforms MapReduce Online on data streams.
