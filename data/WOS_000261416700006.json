In particular, if a circuit with area-time bounds (A. T) is emulated by a universal circuit with bounds (A(u), T-u), we say that the universal circuit has blowup A(u)/A and slowdown T-u/T. A central question in VLSI theory is to investigate the inherent costs and tradeoffs of universal circuit designs. Prior to this work, universal designs were known for area-A circuits with O(1) blowup and O(log A) slowdown. Universal designs for the family of area-A circuits containing O(root A(1+epsilon) log A) vertices, with O(A(epsilon)) blowup and O(log log A) slowdown had also been developed. However, the existence of universal circuits with O(1) slowdown and relatively small blowup was an open question. In this paper, we settle this question by designing an area-universal circuit U-A(epsilon) with O (1/epsilon) slowdown and O (A(epsilon)) blowup, for any value of the parameter epsilon, with 4 log log A/log A <= epsilon <= 1. By varying epsilon, we obtain universal circuits which operate at different points in the spectrum of the slowdown-blowup tradeoff. In particular, when epsilon is chosen to be a constant, our universal circuit yields O(1) slowdown. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
