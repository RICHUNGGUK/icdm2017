Thereby, six integration problems occur on the software level, which are sketched in this paper. Two of them are discussed in more detail: a special architecture editor was realized helping to transform abstract architecture situations to complex and concrete ones, reflecting the final software solution. The second one and the focus of this paper is wrapper construction, in order to get access to single tools as parts of the environment. A method is presented for wrapper construction (for interfaces and services) on different layers. Tools support this construction, which can be applied by non-specialists. As many tools are integrated, mechanical wrapper construction is of big importance for the quality of the environment, as well as for the efficiency of the process to get it. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
