The existing distributed output regulation results with exactly known leader systems is not applicable. To solve the leader-following with unknown parameters in the leader dynamics, a distributed control law based on an adaptive internal model is proposed and the convergence can be proved.", "paper_title": "DISTRIBUTED OUTPUT REGULATION FOR LINEAR MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS WITH UNKNOWN LEADERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000325506900002"}
