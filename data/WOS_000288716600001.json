Using BGP, ASes can apply semantically rich routing policies to choose interdomain routes in a distributed fashion. This expressiveness in routing-policy choice supports domains' autonomy in network operations and in business decisions, but it comes at a price: The interaction of locally defined routing policies can lead to unexpected global anomalies, including route oscillations or overall protocol divergence (see, e.g., Varadhan et al. in Comput Networks 32(1):1-16, 2000). Networking researchers have addressed this problem by devising constraints on policies that guarantee BGP convergence without unduly limiting expressiveness and autonomy (see, e.g., Gao and Rexford in IEEE/ACM Trans Network 9(6):681-692, 2001; Griffin et al. in Proceedings of 9th ACM Conference on Applications, Technologies, Architectures, and Protocols for Computer Communication (SIGCOMM'03), pp. 61-72. ACM Press, New York, 2003). In addition to taking this engineering or \"protocol- design\" approach, researchers have approached interdomain routing from an economic or \"mechanism-design\" point of view. It is known that lowest-cost-path (LCP) routing can be implemented in an incentive-compatible, BGP-compatible manner (Feigenbaum et al. in Distribut. Comput 18(1):61-72, 2005; Shneidman and Parkes in Proceedings of 23rd ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC'04), pp. 88-97. ACM Press, New York, 2004) but that several other natural classes of policies cannot (Feigenbaum et al. in Theor Comput Sci 378(2):175-189, 2007; Feigenbaum et al. in Distribut Comput 18(4):293-305, 2006). In this paper, we present the first example of a class of interdomain-routing policies that is more general than LCP routing and for which BGP itself is both incentive-compatible and guaranteed to converge. We also present several steps toward a general theory of incentive-compatible, BGP-compatible interdomain routing.", "paper_title": "Incentive-compatible interdomain routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000288716600001"}
