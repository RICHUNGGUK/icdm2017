Thus information hiding for images is one of the main research issues to maintain the data security and integrity. This paper proposed a data hiding method on the indices of VQ compression. For an index table of VQ compression, neighboring indices have similar index values in a great chance. Exploiting neighboring correlation among VQ indices, the proposed data hiding can enhance the embedding capacity and bit rate of encoding. In addition, our method can use the output bit stream to reconstruct the cover image. Experimental results show the proposed scheme performs better in average comparing with Lee et al.' smethod [9] in 2013.", "paper_title": "Data hiding of high compression ratio in VQ indices with neighboring correlations", "paper_id": "WOS:000350572900008"}
