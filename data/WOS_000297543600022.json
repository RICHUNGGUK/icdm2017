When available permutation tests are essentially of an exact nonparametric nature in a conditional context, where conditioning is on the pooled observed data set which is often a set of sufficient statistics in the null hypothesis. Whereas, the reference null distribution of most parametric tests is only known asymptotically. Thus, for most sample sizes of practical interest, the possible lack of efficiency of permutation solutions may be compensated by the lack of approximation of parametric counterparts. There are many complex multivariate problems, quite common in empirical sciences, which are difficult to solve outside the conditional framework and in particular outside the method of nonparametric combination (NPC) of dependent permutation tests. In this paper we review such a method and its main properties along with some new results in experimental and observational situations (robust testing, multi-sided alternatives and testing for survival functions).", "paper_title": "A review and some new results on permutation testing for multivariate problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000297543600022"}
