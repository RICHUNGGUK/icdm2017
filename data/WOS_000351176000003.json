In this paper, a method based on recurrent neural network (RNN) for landslide prediction is presented. Genetic algorithm is used to optimize the initial weights and biases of the network. The results show that the prediction accuracy of RNN model is much higher than the feedforward neural network model for Baishuihehe landslide. Therefore, the RNN model is an effective and feasible method to further improve accuracy for landslide displacement prediction.", "paper_title": "Landslide Deformation Prediction Based on Recurrent Neural Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000351176000003"}
