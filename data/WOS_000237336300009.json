A linear ten-parameter model was developed for the prediction of lambda(max) with R(2)=0.9512 and SEE=22.95 by MLRA. The MRE for the calculation of lambda(max) was 3.90%. The stability of the proposed model was validated using Leav-Five-Out cross-validation and randomization experiments. All descriptors involved in the model were derived solely from the chemical structures of the NLO chromophores. A satisfactory MRE of 5.23% for a test set of 12 chromophores makes the model very useful for the prediction of the unknown chromophores.", "paper_title": "A linear QSPR model for prediction of maximum absorption wavelength of second-order NLO chromophores", "paper_id": "WOS:000237336300009"}
