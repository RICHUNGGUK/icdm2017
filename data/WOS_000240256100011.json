For many Csp models, e.g., the traces model, equivalent semantics have been given in operational style. A CSP semantics in axiomatic style, however, has been considered problematic in the literature. In this paper we present a sound and complete axiomatic semantics for CSP with unbounded nondeterminism over an alphabet of arbitrary size. This result is connected in various ways with our tool CSP-Prover: (1) the CSP dialect under discussion is the input language of CSP-Prover; (2) all theorems presented have been verified with CSP-Prover; (3) CSP-Prover implements the given axiom system.", "paper_title": "A complete axiomatic semantics for the CSP stable-failures model", "paper_id": "WOS:000240256100011"}
