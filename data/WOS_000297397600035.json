Such models not only help to improve quality of products but also lead to lower maintenance cost. In this paper, an integrated model is presented which considers complete failure and planned maintenance simultaneously. This model leads to six different scenarios. A new procedure for calculating average cost per time unit is also presented. Finally, a numerical example is used to evaluate sensitivity of the model parameters and compare performance of the developed model to a planned maintenance model. Results indicate satisfactory performance for the developed model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
