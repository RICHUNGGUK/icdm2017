It is widely used in imaging world, for example, image interpolation is often used in 3-D medical image to compensate for information insufficiency during image reconstruction by simulating additional images between two-dimensional images. Reversible data hiding has become significant branch in information hiding field. Reversibility allows the original media to be completely restored without any degradation after the embedded messages have been extracted. This study proposes a high-capacity image hiding scheme by exploiting an interpolating method called Interpolation by Neighboring Pixels (INP) on Maximum Difference Values to improve the performance of data hiding scheme proposed by Jung and Yoo. The proposed scheme offers the benefits of high embedding capacity with low computational complexity and good image quality. The experimental results showed that the proposed scheme has good performance for payload up to 2.28 bpp. Moreover, the INP yields higher PSNRs than other interpolating methods such as NMI, NNI and BI.
