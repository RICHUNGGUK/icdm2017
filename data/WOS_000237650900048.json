The modeling process is carried out in two steps. The first step consists of selecting automatically two sets of corresponding feature points between standard and individual vessels. In the second step, 3D model of individual vessels is performed by warping with corresponding feature points. The 3D model of vessels provides patients with better and cleaner visualization without extensive training to understand vessels geometry. It saves reviewing time for physicians since 3D model may be performed by a trained technician, and may also help visualize dynamics of the vessels.", "paper_title": "Automatic generation technique of three-dimensional model corresponding to individual vessels", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900048"}
