Several studies have shown that these data complexities may affect the performance or behavior of artificial neural networks. Strategies proposed to face with both challenges have been separately applied. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid method for handling both class imbalance and class overlap simultaneously in multi-class learning problems. Experimental results on five remote sensing data show that the combined approach is a promising method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
