In this article, we regard communication synthesis targeting a refined regular distributed register architecture, named RDR-GRS, as a problem of simultaneous data transfer routing and scheduling for global interconnect resource minimization. We also present an innovative algorithm with regard of both spatial and temporal perspectives. It Features both a concentration-oriented path router gathering wire-sharable data transfers and a channel-based time scheduler resolving contentions for wires in a channel, which are in spatial and temporal domain, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly outperform existing related works.", "paper_title": "Communication Synthesis for Interconnect Minimization in Multicycle Communication Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000273190700024"}
