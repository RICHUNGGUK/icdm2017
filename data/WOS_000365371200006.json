We propose new adaptive controllers, with which we can synchronize two complex dynamical networks within finite time. Sufficient conditions for the finite-time adaptive outer synchronization are derived based on the finite-time stability theory. Finally, numerical examples are examined to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "FINITE-TIME ADAPTIVE OUTER SYNCHRONIZATION BETWEEN TWO COMPLEX DYNAMICAL NETWORKS WITH NONIDENTICAL TOPOLOGICAL STRUCTURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000365371200006"}
