However, the RSS feeds/readers architecture suffers from (i) the high bandwidth consumption issue, and (ii) limited filtering semantics. In this paper, we proposed a stateful full text dissemination scheme over structured P2Ps to address both issues. Specifically, for the semantic side, end users are allowed to subscribe for favorite contents via input keywords; for the network bandwidth side, the cooperative content polling, filtering and disseminating via DHT-based P2P overlay networks save the network bandwidth consumption. Our contributions include the novel techniques to (i) reduce the unit-publishing cost by pruning irreverent documents during the forwarding path towards destinations, and (ii) reduce the publication amount by selecting a very small number of meaningful terms. Based on real data sets, our experimental results show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the publishing cost with low maintenance overhead and a high document quality.", "paper_title": "A distributed full-text top-k document dissemination system in distributed hash tables", "paper_id": "WOS:000294558800004"}
