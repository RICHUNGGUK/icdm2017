The proposed method uses online estimates of the surface normal (tangent) direction to dynamically modify the control target and control space decomposition. It is proved that these estimates converge to the actual value even though the elasticity and friction parameters are unknown. The proposed control solution is demonstrated through simulation examples in three-dimensional robot motion tasks contacting both planar and curved surfaces. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
