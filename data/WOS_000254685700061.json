The algorithm is based on a segregated solution formalism in the class of pressure-correction methods. It shows good conservation properties and returns stable results, regardless of the difference in density between neighboring cells. A simplified Burke-Schumann flame model is used to describe the heat release due to mixing of fuel and oxidizer. The convergence rate of the method is discussed for a 1D channel flow, containing fuel and oxidizer.
