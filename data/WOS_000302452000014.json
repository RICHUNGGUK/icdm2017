Matching application signatures in traffic payload is widely considered to be the most reliable classifying method. However, deriving accurate and efficient signatures for various applications is not a trivial task, for which current practice is mostly manual thus error-prone and of low efficiency. In this paper, we tackle the problem of automatic signature generation. In particular, we focus on generating regular expression signatures with a certain subset of standard syntax rules, which are of sufficient expressive power and compatible with most practical systems. We propose a novel approach that takes as input a labeled training data set and produces a set of signatures for matching the application classes presented in the data. The approach involves four procedures: pre-processing to extract application session payload, tokenization to find common substrings and incorporate position constraints, multiple sequence alignment to find common subsequences, and signature construction to transform the results into regular expressions. A real life full payload traffic trace is used to evaluate the proposed system, and signatures for a range of applications are automatically derived. The results indicate that the signatures are of high quality, and exhibit low false negatives and false positives. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
