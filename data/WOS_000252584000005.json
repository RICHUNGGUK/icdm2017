However, a truly new set of data being often unavailable for checking predictability and robustness of the developed model, a typical external validation in QSAR studies is commonly performed by splitting the available data into training and test sets. In the present work we have attempted to explore the impact of training set size on the quality of prediction using different topological descriptors and three different statistical techniques. Three different data sets of moderate size have been used for the present study: cytoprotection data of anti-HIV thiocarbamates (n=62), HIV reverse transcriptase inhibition data of 1-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]-6-(phenylthio)thymine (HEPT) derivatives (n=107) and bioconcentration factor data of diverse functional compounds (n=122). In each case, the data set was divided into different combinations of training and test sets maintaining different size ratios in several iterations. In cases of the first two data sets, significant impact of reduction of training set size was found on the predictive ability of the models while the first data set showing higher dependence on the size than the second one. However, in case of modeling of bioconcentration factor, no significant impact of training set size on the quality of prediction could be found. Hence, no general rule can be formulated regarding the impact of training set size on the quality of prediction. Optimum size of the training set should be set based on a particular data set and types of descriptors and statistical analysis being used. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
