The challenge is to automatically identify the best mapping of computations to the target heterogeneous platform and to adjust the problem, algorithmic and platform parameters. In the proposed meta-algorithm, four hardware configuration scenarios have been considered: 1CPU-1GPU, nCPU-OGPU, nCPU-1GPU, nCPU-nGPU. Over a serial B&B, accelerations up to x222 have been achieved for large problem instances of the Flow-Shop scheduling problem. The reported results show that: (1) the GPU-accelerated algorithm performs better than its multi-core CPU-based version; (2) combining multi-core and GPU allows improvement up to 36% over a single CPU-GPU execution; (3) the more GPU devices are used, the better the speedups are whatever is the considered problem instance.
