Neither the variances nor the sample sizes for the two classes need be the same. The generality of heteroskedasticity (unequal variances) is a fundamental feature of the work presented in this paper, which distinguishes it from past work. The expected resubstitution and leave-one-out errors are represented by probabilities involving bivariate Gaussian distributions. Their second moments and cross-moments with the actual error are represented by 3- and 4-variate Gaussian distributions. From these, the bias, deviation variance, and RMS for resubstitution and leave-one-out as estimators of the actual error can be computed. The RMS expressions are applied to the determination of sample size and illustrated in biomarker classification. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
