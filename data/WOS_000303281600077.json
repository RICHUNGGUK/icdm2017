While there is a great deal of literature about use of artificial intelligence and multiple linear regression for the problem, there has been always controversy about which one performs better. Noting that this controversy is due to difficulty finding proper predictor variables in real estate appraisal, we propose a modified version of ridge regression, i.e., ridge regression coupled with genetic algorithm (GA-Ridge). In order to examine the performance of the proposed method, experimental study is done for Korean real estate market, which verifies that GA-Ridge is effective in forecasting real estate appraisal. This study addresses two critical issues regarding the use of ridge regression, i.e., when to use it and how to improve it. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
