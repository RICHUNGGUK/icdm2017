We propose a methodology to transform behavior rules to a state machine, so that a device that is being monitored for its behavior can easily be checked against the transformed state machine for deviation from its behavior specification. Using vital sign monitor medical devices as an example, we demonstrate that our intrusion detection technique can effectively trade false positives off for a high detection probability to cope with more sophisticated and hidden attackers to support ultra safe and secure MCPS applications. Moreover, through a comparative analysis, we demonstrate that our behavior-rule specification-based IDS technique outperforms two existing anomaly-based techniques for detecting abnormal patient behaviors in pervasive healthcare applications.", "paper_title": "Behavior Rule Specification-Based Intrusion Detection for Safety Critical Medical Cyber Physical Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000352054200002"}
