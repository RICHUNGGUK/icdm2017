Data integration is a practical approach to these applications. Dealing with inconsistencies is one of the important problems in data integration. In this paper we motivate the problem of data inconsistency solution for data integration in pervasive environments. We define data quality criteria and expense quality criteria for data sources to solve data inconsistency. In our solution, firstly, data sources needing high expense to obtain data from them are discarded by using expense quality criteria and utility function. Since it is difficult to obtain the actual quality of data sources in pervasive computing environment, we introduce fuzzy multi-attribute group decision making approach to selecting the appropriate data sources. The experimental results show that our solution has ideal effectiveness.", "paper_title": "A Solution of Data Inconsistencies in Data Integration - Designed for Pervasive Computing Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000277548500010"}
