We show that as particular cases of our generalization of Choquet integral there are the Sugeno integral, the Sipos integral and the Cumulative Prospect Theory functional. We also show that many concepts such as Mobius transform, importance index, interaction index, k-order capacities and OWA operators, introduced in the research about Choquet integral, can be generalized in the considered context.
