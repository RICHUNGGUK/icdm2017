Topology control is an effective way to solve the problem of topology building. To investigate the joint effect of topology control and channel assignment, we propose a joint processing scheme composed of a k-Neighbor topology control algorithm and a greedy channel assignment (GCA) algorithm in this paper. Based on this joint processing scheme, the relationships between the energy consumption, the total required channel number and the network connectivity are discussed. We also discuss the impact of some parameters on the performance of networks in terms of the path loss factor, node density, maximum node degree, etc. Our main contributions in this paper is that we find that topology control has a good effect on improving the performance of channel assignment, and the proposed joint processing scheme can reduce the required channel number effectively, compared with its theoretical upper bound. In particular, if the node degree in a network is not more than k, various simulations indicate that the required channel number is not more than 2k + 1.
