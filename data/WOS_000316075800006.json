In this work, we investigate how the combination of DDNA and SOEKS with feature selection learning algorithm RELIEF-F can improve the quality of predictions. The proposed approach is general and extensible in terms of both designing enhanced learning algorithms and application to other domains.", "paper_title": "PREDICTION BASED ON INTEGRATION OF DECISIONAL DNA AND A FEATURE SELECTION ALGORITHM RELIEF-F", "paper_id": "WOS:000316075800006"}
