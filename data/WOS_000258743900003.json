This becomes a burden on the server CPUs and exhibits itself as high CPU utilization. In this paper, first, we confirm this phenomenon, then, we utilize performance analyzer tools from major processor vendors to characterize the major sources of CPU usage. In addition, the experiments run on real hardware reveal server bottlenecks within the context of new architectural features such as hyper-threading, hypertransport and multi-core processors.
