When one analyzes data using such a model, one is looking for one way to cluster data that is jointly defined by all the attributes. In other words, one performs unidimensional clustering. This is not always appropriate. For complex data with many attributes, it is more reasonable to consider multidimensional clustering, i.e., to partition data along multiple dimensions. In this paper, we present a method for performing multidimensional clustering on categorical data and show its superiority over unidimensional clustering. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
