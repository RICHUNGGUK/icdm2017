For our main construction, we prove that multiplicatively disjoint arithmetic circuits of size n (O(1)) and treewidth k can be simulated by bounded fan-in arithmetic formulas of depth O(k (2)logn). From this we derive an analogous statement for syntactically multilinear arithmetic circuits, which strengthens the central theorem of M. Mahajan and B.V.R. Rao (Proc. 33rd International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science, vol. 5162, pp. 455-466, 2008). We show our main construction has the following three applications: Bounded width arithmetic circuits of size n (O(1)) can be balanced to depth O(logn), provided chains of iterated multiplication in the circuit are of length O(1). Boolean bounded fan-in circuits of size n (O(1)) and treewidth k can be simulated by bounded fan-in formulas of depth O(k (2)logn). This strengthens in the non-uniform setting the known inclusion that SC(0)aS dagger NC1. We demonstrate treewidth restricted cases of Directed-Reachability and Circuit Value Problem that can be solved in LogDCFL. We also give a construction showing, for both arithmetic and Boolean circuits, that any circuit of size n (O(1)) and treewidth O(log (i) n) can be simulated by a circuit of width O(log (i+1) n) and size n (c) , where c=O(1), if i=0, and c=O(loglogn) otherwise.", "paper_title": "Balancing Bounded Treewidth Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000330992200010"}
