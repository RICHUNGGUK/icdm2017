Our method integrates the web and a local user database with semantic links including geographical ones. We first construct a graph structure, consisting of database entries, their related web pages and relationships between them. Then a link analysis is performed to compute a LocalRank value for each node. The result called LocalRank is a rank value for a web page to assess its relevance degree to database entries and its popularity on a local web space. In our demo, we will show our experimental results for a local restaurant database. The local web pages related to the database entries are highly ranked based on our method.", "paper_title": "LocalRank: A prototype for ranking web pages with database considering geographical locality", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000137"}
