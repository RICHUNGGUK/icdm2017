This paper proposes an Intelligent system Modeling and Simulation Language (IMSL) which integrates artificial intelligence theory and M&S technology to describe intelligent model structures, behaviors, facts, knowledge, and rules. Meanwhile, an M&S platform is implemented to provide a basic support for M&S of intelligent systems, featured as its convenience, efficiency and problem solving ability. Our research work has been focused on M&S methods and language specification of intelligence systems, intelligent simulation resource libraries and integrated development environment. As an application instance, M&S of a C3I (Command, Control, Communication and Information) system is conducted to evaluate the performance of IMSL and the IMSL platform. And the simulation result proves that IMSL can work effectively in solving practical problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
