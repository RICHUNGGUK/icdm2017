Therefore, reverse logistics network problem (rLNP) will be powerful and get a great potential for winning consumers in a more competitive context in the future. We formulate a mathematical model of remanufacturing system as three-stage logistics network model for minimizing the total of costs to reverse logistics shipping cost and fixed opening cost of the disassembly centers and processing centers. And we consider a multi-stage, multi-product and some attach condition for disassembly centers and processing centers, respectively. For solving this problem, we propose it genetic algorithm (GA) with priority-based encoding method consisting of 1st and 2nd stages combined a new crossover operator called as weight mapping crossover (WMX). A heuristic approach is applied in the 3rd stage to transportation of parts from processing center to manufacturer. Numerical experiments with various scales of rLNP models show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach by comparing the recent researches. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
