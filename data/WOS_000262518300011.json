It is often claimed a major advantage of the LR method that dropout can be assessed probabilistically. Results: In this article, a new RMNE measure is proposed that likewise accounts for allelic dropout in an observed forensic DNA pro. le. We discuss the necessary calculations, underline their simplicity and provide a tool for performing the calculations.", "paper_title": "Impact of allelic dropout on evidential value of forensic DNA profiles using RMNE", "paper_id": "WOS:000262518300011"}
