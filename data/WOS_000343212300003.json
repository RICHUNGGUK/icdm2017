In terms of a set of coupled linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), a necessary and sufficient condition is firstly proposed, which ensures the systems to be regular, impulse-free and stochastically stable. Moreover, the corresponding necessary and sufficient condition on the existence of a mode-dependent state-feedback controller, which guarantees the closed-loop systems stochastically admissible by employing the LMI technique, is derived; the stabilizing state-feedback gain can also be expressed via solutions of the LMIs. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Stabilisation of descriptor Markovian jump systems with partially unknown transition probabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000343212300003"}
