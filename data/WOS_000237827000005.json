For alternative solutions to traditional ad hoc routings, many geographic routing algorithms have been proposed. Most of the existing routings impose a certain restriction, planarity, on the graph structure of network for delivering messages to destination definitely. PHF achieves the guaranteed packet delivery over Unit Disk Graph, which is more widely employed graph model for the study of ad hoc networks. Accordingly, to eliminate the restriction of the routing algorithms enhances the probability to deliver messages successfully in networks with high nodes' mobility rate. In the simulation of PHF, we have evaluated the performance comparisons between PHF and its related work, Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), which are the prominent geographic and conventional topology-based routing protocols, respectively. The results show that PHF provides higher packet delivery success rate indicating better communication stability and equal or less overhead than these work.", "paper_title": "The enhancement on communication stability in MANETs with unit disk graph model", "paper_id": "WOS:000237827000005"}
