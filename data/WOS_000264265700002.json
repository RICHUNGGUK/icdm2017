A trained fully connected RNN can be converted to a graph by defining edges between pairs od nodes having significant weights. We measured structural properties of the derived graphs, such as characteristic path lengths, clustering coefficients and degree distributions. The results imply that a trained RNN has significantly larger clustering coefficient than a random network with a comparable connectivity. Besides, the degree distributions show existence of nodes with a large degree or hubs, typical for scale-free networks. We also show analytically and experimentally that this type of degree distribution has increased entropy.", "paper_title": "Structural Properties of Recurrent Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000264265700002"}
