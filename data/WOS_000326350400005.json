Owing to local topography and subsurface geology, a drainage system achieves a particular drainage pattern based on the form and texture of its network of stream channels and tributaries. Although research has been done on the description of drainage patterns in geography and hydrology, automatic drainage pattern recognition in river networks is not well developed. This article introduces a new method for automatic classification of drainage systems in different patterns. The method applies to river networks, and the terrain model is not required in the process. A series of geometric indicators describing each pattern are introduced. Network classification is based on fuzzy set theory. For each pattern, the level of membership of the network is given by the different indicator values. The method was implemented, and the experimental results are presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Automatic drainage pattern recognition in river networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000326350400005"}
