This is important in verifying the trust and authenticity of data and the device that created it. Current forensic identification techniques for digital cameras, printers, and RF devices are presented. It is also shown how these techniques can fit into a general forensic characterization framework, which can be generalized for use with other devices. (c) 2006 DFRWS. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
