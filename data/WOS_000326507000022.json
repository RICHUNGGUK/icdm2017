The scheme is based on a colorless frequency division multiplexing (FDM)-PON with centralized wavelength control. Multiplexing and demultiplexing in the optical network unit (ONU) is performed in the electronic domain and relies either on FDM with Nyquist sinc-pulse shaping or on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). This way the ONU can perform processing at low speed in the baseband. Further, the ONU is colorless by means of a remote seed for upstream transmission and a remote local oscillator for heterodyne reception, all of which helps in keeping maintenance and costs for an ONU potentially low and will simplify wavelength allocation in a future software defined network architecture. To extend the reach, semiconductor optical amplifiers are used for optical amplification in the downstream and upstream.", "paper_title": "Colorless FDMA-PON With Flexible Bandwidth Allocation and Colorless, Low-Speed ONUs", "paper_id": "WOS:000326507000022"}
