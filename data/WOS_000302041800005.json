The aforementioned bijection is proved to be independent of the t-norm and it provides a representation theorem for a large class of fuzzy pseudometric spaces. Further, the relations between the uniformities and topologies both generated by the fuzzy pseudometric and by the corresponding family of ordinary pseudometrics are also investigated.
