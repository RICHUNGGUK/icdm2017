In this paper we present some of the results of our research activity at the boundary between computer science and philosophy of science started in 1997 under Marco Somalvico's impulse and guidance. In particular, we discuss two roles that multiagent systems can play in scientific discovery. From the one hand, they can support scientific practice; from the other hand, they can represent scientific results. The theoretical framework presented in this paper is exemplified in concrete by illustrating specific implemented systems, both taken from the literature and developed by ourselves.", "paper_title": "The multiagent technology and paradigm within scientific discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000250893600004"}
