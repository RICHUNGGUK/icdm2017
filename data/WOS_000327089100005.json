The proposed technique is based on hybrid frequency shift keying (FSK) with an enhanced modified prime code as a signature sequence for coding techniques. Coherent FSK modulation along with incoherent demodulation using Arrayed-Waveguide Grating has been examined in the transceiver structure. In the proposed technique, a reference signal is constructed by using one of the addressed spreading sequences, and MAI cancelation is performed by subtracting the reference signal from the received signal of the desired user. The performance of the proposed FSK-OCDMA system is compared with the performance of the existing pulse position modulation (PPM)-OCDMA system. The simulation results reveal that the bit-error rate performance of the proposed technique is superior to the performance of the pulse position modulation (PPM) technique. Also, the results indicate that the proposed technique is very power efficient, and when the bit rate is constant, the network capacity can be expanded to accommodate a large number of simultaneous active users with low error rate. Moreover, the proposed technique simplifies the hardware of the receiver design.", "paper_title": "Multiple access interference cancelation technique in optical CDMA systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000327089100005"}
