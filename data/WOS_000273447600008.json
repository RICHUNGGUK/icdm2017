For such applications, improving data availability is a significant issue and various studies have been conducted with this aim. However, each of these conventional works assumed a particular mobility model and did not fully investigate the influence of the mobility on the proposed approach. In this paper, we aim to quantify the influences of mobility on data availability from various perspectives. We assume neither specific applications nor specific protocols but we propose and quantify several metrics that affect data availability. We also report results of some experiments that measure the proposed metrics assuming several typical mobility models.", "paper_title": "Quantifying Impact of Mobility on Data Availability in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000273447600008"}
