The accurate positioning of workpiece on a fixture is influenced by rigid body displacements and rotations of the workpiece due to several errors (e.g. geometric radial and position errors in locators and manufacturing tolerances of the workpiece). In this paper, an efficient approach is introduced for analysis and compensation errors in the workpiece-fixture-cutting tool system. A new mathematical formulation of workpiece-fixture modelling is proposed to establish the relationship between the locating errors and their sources. Based on the proposed method, the locating errors of the workpiece can be accurately estimated by relating them to the specific geometric errors or tolerances of the workpiece and the related locators. Then, to eliminate the effects of the locating errors and the cutting tool wear on the machined features, the location and orientation of the cutting tool in the cutter location data are corrected. The proposed method is proper for error analysis and compensation based on worst case analysis approach. The application of the presented method is illustrated through presenting an example and the computational results are compared to the results of simulation of the case study in a computer aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) system.", "paper_title": "Manufacturing error compensation based on cutting tool location correction in machining processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000341924400001"}
