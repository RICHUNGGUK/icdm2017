However, automatic shot change detection often suffers from high false detection rates due to camera or object movements. To solve this problem, we propose an approach based on local keypoint matching of video frames. This approach aims to detect both abrupt and gradual transitions between shots without modeling different kinds of transitions. Our experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is effective for most kinds of shot changes.", "paper_title": "Shot Change Detection via Local Keypoint Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000260862600013"}
