The challenge in the problems is to estimate the operational performance of a deployment plan under stochastic environments. More specifically, the stochastic and dynamic nature of request arrivals, fulfillment processes, and complex traffic conditions as well as the time-dependent spatial patterns of some parameters complicate the decisions in the problems. This paper proposes a simulation optimization method that enables evaluating the operational performance of deployment plans through a detailed simulation model. For guiding the search process in the simulation optimization method, the genetic algorithm is employed in this study. On the basis of the deployment decisions, a mathematical model on ambulance relocation is also proposed for adapting to the dynamic changing environments along the time. To illustrate the proposed method's usage in practice, a demo example about its application in Shanghai is given. Some numerical experiments are also performed to validate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
