Using common mode double-pseudo-resistance technique in the proposed circuit leads to low power dissipation without degrading the phase noise. Additionally, band-switching capacitor array is employed in order to increase the tuning range. The schematic circuit of the proposed VCO is simulated in 0.18 mu m 1P6M CMOS process and simulation results show high efficiency of the proposed circuit. The overall tuning frequency range is from 1.7 GHz to 3.18 GHz (59%) with tuning voltage variation range from 0V to 1.5 V. The proposed VCO circuit has phase noise of -102.6 and -124.3 dBc/Hz at 100 KHz and 1MHz offset frequency from the carrier, respectively, while consumes 1.98mW power at 1.5V supply voltage.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL WIDEBAND CMOS VCO USING SWITCH CAPACITORS ARRAY FOR RF APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000308948300011"}
