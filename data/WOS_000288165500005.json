Compensating for the comparator delay by digitally adjusting the comparator threshold improves the ADC resolution from 2.5-bit to 7.05-bit. The ADC is manufactured in a 90 nm CMOS technology, with a core area of 0.85 mm x 0.35 mm, a 1.2 V supply for the core and 1.8 V for the input switches. It has an effective number of bits (ENOB) of 7.05-bit, and a power dissipation of 8.5 mW at 60 MS/s.", "paper_title": "Comparator-based switched-capacitor pipelined analog-to-digital converter with comparator preset, and comparator delay compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000288165500005"}
