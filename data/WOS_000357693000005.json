Rather, researchers assume a linear relation based on the argument that science is allied with the development of technology. To probe this issue further, this study uses a ranking of over 5600 scientists based on number of appearances in Google Books over a period of 200 years (1800-2000). The results point to several peak periods, particularly for scientists born in the 1850-1859, 1897-1906, or 1900-1909 periods, suggesting overall cycles of around 8 years and a positive trend in distinction that lasts around 100 years. Nevertheless, a non-parametric test to determine whether randomness can be rejected indicates that non-randomness is less apparent, although once we analyse the greatest minds overall, rejection is more likely.", "paper_title": "Do great minds appear in batches?", "paper_id": "WOS:000357693000005"}
