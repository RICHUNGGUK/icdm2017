After gain error and offset extraction from prototype measurement, the improved circuit achieves spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of 82.9 dB and signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SINAD) of 64.1 dB for a 30.5 MHz input, maintained within 6 dB performance deterioration up to 170 MHz input. Differential nonlinearity (DNL) is 0.66 LSB and integral nonlinearity (INL) is 2.5 LSB. Low-jitter clock amplifier and buffers with balanced loads are used to reduce the jitter and skew between different stages. An on-chip voltage reference generator is schemed with low impedance to reduce noise and spurs of reference signals. The ADC is fabricated in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process with core area of 3.86 mm(2), and consumes 518 mW at 1.8 V supply.", "paper_title": "An 80-MS/s 14-bit pipelined ADC featuring 83 dB SFDR", "paper_id": "WOS:000277095700014"}
