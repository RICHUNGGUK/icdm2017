In recent years, there have been a rising number of brownfield redevelopment practices in Chinese cities. However, some redevelopment practices have been unsuccessful in spite of cautious planning whereas others have been successful in the absence of any planning. It is largely due to China's rapid urbanization on one hand, and inadequate information on the locations and conditions of brownfield on the other. To address the gaps, an integrative methodology is devised based on two frameworks, one for identifying potential instead of actual brownfields, and one for establishing priorities for redevelopment. The first framework identifies potential brownfields through four steps: (1) define input sites; (2) verify environmental liability; (3) confirm tax delinquency; and (4) cross-check with industrial classification code. The second framework prioritize the identified potential brownfield sites with a set of criteria which are selected and weighed based on key interviews and the study of local reference cases. The utility of this methodology is exemplified with the case study of Futian in Shenzhen. Local data including land use data, tax and environmental records of 2005 and the development plan for 2006-2010 are utilized. We conclude that this methodology properly responds to the increasing need of urban planners in making pro-active plans for brownfield redevelopment in Chinese cities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
