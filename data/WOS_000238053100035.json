Several methods have been proposed to deal with it, However, it is still an open problem. In this paper we follow an approach consisting of a number of steps in order to increase TIS prediction accuracy. First, all the sequences are scanned and the candidate TISs are detected. These sites are grouped according to the length of the sequence upstream and downstream them and a number of features is generated for each one. The features are evaluated among the instances of every group and a number of the top ranked ones are selected for, building a classifier. A new instance is assigned to a group and is classified by the corresponding classifier. We experiment with various feature sets and, assification algorithms, compare with alternative methods and draw important conclusions.", "paper_title": "Prediction of translation initiation sites using classifier selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000238053100035"}
