We discuss how this method can be applied to a general class of walks in the quarter plane Z(+)(2) with a step set that is a subset of {(-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1)} in the interior of Z(+)(2). We derive an explicit expression for the generating function which turns out to be non-holonomic, and which can be used to obtain exact and asymptotic expressions for the counting numbers.", "paper_title": "The Compensation Approach for Walks With Small Steps in the Quarter Plane", "paper_id": "WOS:000314296400001"}
