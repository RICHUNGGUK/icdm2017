This paper describes an effective approach to display a Web page in various resolution terminals with a realistic layout. According to this approach, multiple-level navigation views are automatically generated based on the layout information extracted from the original Web pages. The navigation views can help the users using low resolution terminals to see the brief contents of the large Web pages with high resolution. A case study is introduced in this paper to display how to apply this approach, and show that it is an effective solution for low-resolution terminals to display Web pages that is designed for high-resolution terminals.", "paper_title": "An effective Web page layout adaptation for various resolutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000073"}
