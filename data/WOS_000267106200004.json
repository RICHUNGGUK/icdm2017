First, ambiguous zones are detected using feature points of the skeleton and the contour information around them. Then, a graph is built to represent each character, and the continuity of sub-strokes is analyzed using Bayesian classification. Several constraint conditions are proposed to search stroke paths in the graph and two criteria are also utilized to deal with multi-traced sub-strokes. Finally, strokes are reconstructed by B-spline interpolation. Experimental results show that the proposed method can detect the ambiguous zones accurately, and is feasible and effective for stroke extraction.", "paper_title": "Stroke extraction based on ambiguous zone detection: a preprocessing step to recover dynamic information from handwritten Chinese characters", "paper_id": "WOS:000267106200004"}
