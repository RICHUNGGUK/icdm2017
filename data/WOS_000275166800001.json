We also note the impact of new information technology capabilities for this increase in terms of improvements in analysis techniques, new ways to generate and maintain connections within and between social units, and new social connection-focused IT capabilities. We also review main streams of network-based analyses in information system research. We conclude by making some propositions for future research in information systems and networks, and summarize the main contributions made in this special issue.", "paper_title": "Social Networks and Information Systems: Ongoing and Future Research Streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000275166800001"}
