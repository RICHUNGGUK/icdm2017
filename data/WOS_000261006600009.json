Many IT-supported methods have been introduced, but so far none has been able to deliver satisfactory and reliable information. This paper presents a combined method, consisting of three components: an automated activity tracking subsystem based on image recognition, an automated material tracking subsystem, and a mobile computing supported communication environment. All subsystems are based on the same 4D model of a building. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
