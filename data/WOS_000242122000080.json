Set of experience knowledge structure can assist in accomplishing this purpose. However, to make set of experience knowledge structure useful, it must be classifiable and comparable. The purpose of this paper is to show similarity metrics for set of experience knowledge structure, and within, similarity metrics for its components: variables, functions, constraints, and rules. A comparable and classifiable set of experience would make explicit knowledge of formal decision events useful elements in multiple systems and technologies.", "paper_title": "Similarity metrics for set of experience knowledge structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000080"}
