First, the nonlinear boiler-turbine is re-expressed as a linear system with norm bounded uncertainties via a nonlinear transformation function. Then, based on this linear model a sufficient condition for the existence of a guaranteed cost nonlinear state feedback tracking control is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The advantage of the proposed tracking control design is that only a simple nonlinear controller is constructed and it does not involve feedback linearisation technique and complicated adaptive or fuzzy schemes. An industrial boiler-turbine system is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design as compared with a linearised approach.", "paper_title": "Guaranteed cost nonlinear tracking control of a boiler-turbine unit: an LMI approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000278648300012"}
