A parallel development in the past two decades has been the emergence of the field of computational intelligence (CI) consisting primarily of the three fields of neural networks, evolutionary computing and fuzzy logic. It is observed that NIC and CI intersect. The authors advocate and foresee more cross-fertilisation of the two emerging fields.", "paper_title": "Nature Inspired Computing: An Overview and Some Future Directions", "paper_id": "WOS:000366329200007"}
