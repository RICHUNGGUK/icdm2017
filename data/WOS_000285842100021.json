All communication terminals could be equipped with multiple antennas. The relays operate in a full-duplex mode. By incorporating time-domain linear transformation into amplify-and-forward (AF) based relaying, we propose an AF-based space-time relay scheme and show that the DMT upper bound of the channel can be achieved by properly designing space-time (ST) codes at the source.", "paper_title": "Achieving Optimal Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff for Full-Duplex MIMO Multihop Relay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000285842100021"}
