The rules are tailored to weight functions with algebraic endpoint singularities related to the geometrical singularities of the domain. Each rule has two different expressions involving Legendre functions and hypergeometric functions, respectively. Numerical examples amply demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the proposed algorithms. Application to the solution of a singular integral equation is exemplified. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
