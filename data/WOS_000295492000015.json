In recent years many projects have faced this problem and provided solutions based on specific standards and technologies in order to satisfy the needs of a particular scenario. Most of such solutions cannot be easily adapted to new scenarios, thus more global solutions are needed. In this work, we have focused on the semantic interoperability of electronic healthcare records standards based on the dual model architecture and we have developed a solution that has been applied to ISO 13606 and openEHR. The technological infrastructure combines reference models, archetypes and ontologies, with the support of Model-driven Engineering techniques. For this purpose, the interoperability infrastructure developed in previous work by our group has been reused and extended to cover the requirements of data transformation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
