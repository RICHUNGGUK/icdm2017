By choosing each circulant permutation matrix sequentially, the proposed method ensures that the current circulant permutation matrix forms no cycles of length smaller than g with the existent circulant permutation matrices. The construction complexity of the proposed algorithm is much lower than that of the random construction. Simulation results show that the proposed QC-LDPC codes can outperform both the random regular LDPC codes with short to moderate block lengths, and the proposed construction method LDPC codes based on the finite geometries in terms of bit-error-rate (BER).", "paper_title": "Low complexity construction for quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes by Progressive-Block Growth", "paper_id": "WOS:000287703200014"}
