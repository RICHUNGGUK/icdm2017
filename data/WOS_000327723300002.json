In this paper, to achieve low probability of interception (LPI) and high throughput in the cooperative single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) system, a new physical layer transmission scheme is proposed, where a new encryption algorithm is applied and adaptive modulation is further considered based on channel state information (CSI). By doing so, neither relay node nor eavesdropper can intercept the information signals transmitted from user terminal (UT). Simulation results show above new physical layer transmission scheme brings in high transmission safety and secrecy rate. Furthermore, by applying adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) technique according to CSI, transmission throughput can be increased significantly. Additionally, low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) characteristic can still be remained due to the uniform distribution of random coefficients used for encryption algorithm.", "paper_title": "A New Physical Layer Transmission Scheme for LPI and High Throughput in the Cooperative SC-FDMA System", "paper_id": "WOS:000327723300002"}
