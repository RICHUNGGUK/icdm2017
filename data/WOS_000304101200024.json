The proposed architecture is based on the split capacitive-array DAC with a simple switching logic as compared to the conventional non-binary SAR ADC architecture. A 10-bit 50-MS/s SAR ADC is designed based on the proposed architecture in a 0.18 1 mu m CMOS technology. Simulation results show that at a supply voltage of 1.2 V, the SAR ADC achieves a peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio of 59.5 dB, and a power consumption of 1.3 mW, resulting in a figure of merit of 33 fJ/conversion-step.", "paper_title": "A 10-bit 50-MS/s redundant SAR ADC with split capacitive-array DAC", "paper_id": "WOS:000304101200024"}
