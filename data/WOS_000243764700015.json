A well-known access scheme based on carrier sense is adopted in this paper for all optical networks. An approximate analysis, base on the M/G/1 queuing model, has been developed to evaluate the performance of the network. The analytical results show an excellent agreement with simulation results over a broad range of parameters. The results show that major part of the packet transfer delay is coming from the propagation delay from a source to a destination. It is also observed that the throughput characteristic of the network depends upon the aggregated transmission capacity of the network. Both throughput and transfer delay improve with the number of wavelengths used in the ring, that proportional to the current escalation of WDM technology.", "paper_title": "Modeling IP packets over WDM ring network with one tunable transmitter and multiple fixed receivers (TT-FRs)", "paper_id": "WOS:000243764700015"}
