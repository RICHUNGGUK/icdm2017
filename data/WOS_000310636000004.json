Construction of term-based, partitioned, parallel inverted indexes is a communication intensive task and suitable for memory-based modeling. In this paper, we provide an efficient parallel framework for in-memory construction of term-based partitioned, inverted indexes. We show that, by utilizing an efficient bucketing scheme, we can eliminate the need for the generation of a global vocabulary. We propose and investigate assignment schemes that can reduce the communication overheads while minimizing the storage and final query processing imbalance. We also present a study on how communication among processors should be carried out with limited communication memory in order to reduce the total inversion time. We present several different communication-memory organizations and discuss their advantages and shortcomings. The conducted experiments indicate promising results.", "paper_title": "A Parallel Framework for In-Memory Construction of Term-Partitioned Inverted Indexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000310636000004"}
