These schemes are developed directly for the equations in second-order form, as opposed to transforming the equations to a first-order hyperbolic system. The schemes are based on the solution to a local Riemann-type problem that uses d'Alembert's exact solution. We construct conservative finite difference approximations, although finite volume approximations are also possible. High-order accuracy is obtained using a space-time procedure which requires only two discrete time levels. The advantages of our approach include efficiency in both memory and speed together with accuracy and robustness. The stability and accuracy of the approximations in one and two space dimensions are studied through normal-mode analysis. The form of the dissipation and dispersion introduced by the schemes is elucidated from the modified equations. Upwind schemes are implemented and verified in one dimension for approximations up to sixth-order accuracy, and in two dimensions for approximations up to fourth-order accuracy. Numerical computations demonstrate the attractive properties of the approach for solutions with varying degrees of smoothness. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
