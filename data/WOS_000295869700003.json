There are obvious drawbacks in packet forwarding of the conventional IP and MPLS networking architecture. In this paper, we propose an innovative concept: Vector Label Switching (VLS) architecture that supports high performance and low cost for the core Internet. Similar to MPLS, a label based on source routing information is attached to packets for fast interconnection purpose rather than an option as source-routing in conventional IP framework. The proposed architecture requires neither table lookup nor header replacing in the router/switch, and labeled packets will be quickly forwarded through Label Stripping algorithm. The packet processing unit can be made simple because the operation for packet forwarding is simple in VLS. As a result, the price and energy consumption of a switch/router can be evidently cut down. The significant performance improvement of the proposed architecture is proven through mathematical analysis and simulation in this paper.", "paper_title": "Vector Label Switching (VLS): A High-Performance Switching Architecture for Future Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000295869700003"}
