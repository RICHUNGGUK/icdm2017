It is shown that in both of the geometries considered three-dimensional BiGlobal instability leads to deviation of the flow from the two-dimensional solution; the analysis results are used to define low- and high-Reynolds number solutions by reference to the flow physics. Critical conditions for linear global instability and neutral loops are presented in both geometries. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
