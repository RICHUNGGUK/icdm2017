The measure is based on the generalized survival exponential entropy (GSEE) and mutual information (GSEE-MI). Since GSEE is estimated from the cumulative distribution function instead of the density function, it is observed that the interpolation artifact is reduced. The method has been tested on four real MR-CT data sets. The experimental results show that the GSEE-MI-based method is more robust than the conventional MI-based method. The accuracy is comparable for both methods.", "paper_title": "Multi-modal image registration using the generalized survival exponential entropy", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700118"}
