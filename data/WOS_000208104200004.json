In this paper we present a new characterization of VFs based on mechanics, and provide a set practical guidelines for the designers of such fixtures from a software architecture point of view. We propose an event-driven approach that facilitates the integration of these guiding constraints in a scene graphed-based environment. In this context some novel implementation of VFs are presented, where users may interact with a single or an assembled set of fixtures. We present two types of force attributes for VF and present their implications in a trajectory-following problem.", "paper_title": "On study of design and implementation of virtual fixtures", "paper_id": "WOS:000208104200004"}
