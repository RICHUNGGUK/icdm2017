Using our new side-channel technique we show that advanced encryption standard (AES) with reduced 10 masked rounds is broken, which is faster than the exhaustive key search attack. This implies that one has to mask the entire rounds of the 12-round 192-bit key AES to prevent our attacks. Our result is the first one to analyse AES with reduced 10 masked rounds, while the previous best known side-channel attack is on AES with reduced eight masked rounds.", "paper_title": "Side-Channel Attack Using Meet-in-the-Middle Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000280704000005"}
