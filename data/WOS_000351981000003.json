This paper presents a parallel computing strategy for the MPM on the graphics processing unit (GPU) to boost the method's computational efficiency. The interaction between a structural element and soil is investigated to validate the applicability of the parallelisation strategy. Two techniques are developed to parallelise the interpolation from soil particles to nodes to avoid a data race; the technique that is based on workload parallelisation across threads over the nodes has a higher computational efficiency. Benchmark problems of surface footing penetration and a submarine landslide are analysed to quantify the speedup of GPU parallel computing over sequential simulations on the central processing unit. The maximum speedup with the GPU used is 30 for single-precision calculations and decreases to 20 for double-precision calculations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
