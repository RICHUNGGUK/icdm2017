Explicit operand forwarding lets software opportunistically orchestrate the routing of operands through the forwarding network to avoid writing ephemeral values to registers. Both mechanisms let software capture short-term reuse and locality close to the function units, improving energy efficiency by allowing a significant fraction of operands to be delivered from inexpensive registers that are integrated with the function units. An evaluation shows that capturing operand bandwidth close to the function units allows operand registers to reduce the energy consumed in the register files and forwarding network of an embedded processor by 61%, and allows explicit forwarding to reduce the energy consumed by 26%.", "paper_title": "Operand Registers and Explicit Operand Forwarding", "paper_id": "WOS:000207924800008"}
