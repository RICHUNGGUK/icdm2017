It is based on the phased-array concept. Beamforming is digitally realized. The system concept and architecture are described in full detail. A proof of concept prototype, including a 1 x 2 planar array, an analog front end, and an field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based embedded system, is built andmeasured. The system is controlled by a GUI running on a mainstream laptop. The architecture is tailored to the use of low cost, off the shelf, and readily available components.", "paper_title": "Off-the-Shelf Low-Cost Target Tracking Architecture for Wireless Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000351075000003"}
