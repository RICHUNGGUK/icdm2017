Memristive network exhibits state-dependent switching behaviors due to the physical properties of memristor. It is demonstrated that the synchronization performance is largely dependent on the coupling pattern and strength among memristive neural networks. Moreover, the information exchange graph of the underlying network topology need not be undirected or strongly connected. Finally, numerical simulations are given to verify the usefulness and effectiveness of our results.", "paper_title": "Exponential synchronization of coupled memristive neural networks with time delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000334251000016"}
