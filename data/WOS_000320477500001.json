The proposed method modifies the durations of vowel and pause segments by different modification factors. Vowel segments are modified by factors based on their identities, and pause segments by uniform factors based on the desired speaking rate. Consonant and transition (consonant-to-vowel) segments are not modified in the proposed TSM. These modification factors are derived from the analysis of slow and fast speech collected from professional radio artists. In the proposed TSM method, vowel onset points (VOPs) are used to mark the consonant, transition and vowel regions, and instants of significant excitation (ISE) are used to perform TSM as required. The VOPs indicate the instants at which the onsets of vowels take place. The ISE, also known as epochs, indicate the instants of glottal closure during voiced speech, and some random excitations such as burst onset during non-voiced speech. In this work, VOPs are determined using multiple sources of evidence from excitation source, spectral peaks, modulation spectrum and uniformity in epoch intervals. The ISEs are determined using a zero-frequency filter method. The performance of the proposed non-uniform TSM scheme is compared with uniform and existing non-uniform TSM schemes using epoch and time domain pitch synchronous overlap and add (TD-PSOLA) methods.
