Based on a digital signal processor complementary metal-oxide semiconductor chip, the digital control hardware and software systems are analyzed and designed. In this paper, the calculation and regulation of the motor rotational speed, correction and regulation methods of the radial displacements, calculation and compensation algorithms of the unilateral magnetic pulls, induction compensation algorithm of the effective suspension control current, current regulation, and space-vector pulse width modulation algorithms, are presented in detail. The experimental results verify the feasibility and practicability of the designed decoupling digital control system of the 3-phase bearingless induction motor.", "paper_title": "Digital control system design and analyses of a 3-phase bearingless induction motor", "paper_id": "WOS:000343076200007"}
