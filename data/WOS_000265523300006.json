The interaction cutoff contribution to the ruggedness of protein-protein energy landscape is studied in terms of relative energy fluctuations for 1/r(n) potentials based on a simplistic model of a protein complex. This artificial ruggedness exists for short cutoffs and gradually disappears with the cutoff increase. Results: The critical values of the cutoff were calculated for each of 11 popular power-type potentials with n = 0 divided by 9,12 and for two thresholds of 5% and 10%. The artificial ruggedness decreases to tolerable thresholds for cutoffs larger than the critical ones. The results showed that for both thresholds the critical cutoff is a non-monotonic function of the potential power n. The functions reach the maximum at n = 3 divided by 4 and then decrease with the increase of the potential power. The difference between two cutoffs for 5% and 10% artificial ruggedness becomes negligible for potentials decreasing faster than 1/r(12). The analytical results obtained for the simple model of protein complexes agree with the analysis of artificial ruggedness in a dataset of 62 protein-protein complexes, with different parameterizations of soft Lennard-Jones potential and two types of protein representations: all-atom and coarse-grained. The results suggest that cutoffs larger than the critical ones can be recommended for protein-protein potentials.", "paper_title": "The ruggedness of protein-protein energy landscape and the cutoff for 1/r(n) potentials", "paper_id": "WOS:000265523300006"}
