In this paper we prove this to be true for all cases (n, q) with q = 2 and we conjecture this to be true for all remaining cases (n, q). We show that the exact polynomial degree of chi((G) over bar) is (q-1)((n2)-1+delta) for delta:=delta(n,q)=0 or 1, and that the possibility delta= 1 is ruled out if the above conjecture is true. The result deg (chi((G) over bar))=(n2)-1 for the binary cases (n,2) can be used to construct quantum codes by intersecting G with subspaces of dimension at least (n 2).", "paper_title": "The polynomial degree of the Grassmannian G(1,n,q) of lines in finite projective space PG(n,q)", "paper_id": "WOS:000239889200006"}
