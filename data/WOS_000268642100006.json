This paper investigates whether they can be used as effectively as their non-probabilistic counterparts. It presents drastically improved algorithms to decide whether some (discrete- or continuous-time) Markov chain strongly or weakly simulates another, or whether a probabilistic automaton strongly simulates another. The key innovation is the use of parametric maximum flow techniques to amortize computations. We also present a novel algorithm for deciding strong probabilistic simulation preorders on probabilistic automata, which has polynomial complexity via a reduction to an LP problem. When extending the algorithms for probabilistic automata to their continuous-time counterpart, we retain the same complexity for both strong and strong probabilistic simulations.", "paper_title": "FLOW FASTER: EFFICIENT DECISION ALGORITHMS FOR PROBABILISTIC SIMULATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000268642100006"}
