We argue that faithful stereo reproduction of night scenes on photopic stereo displays requires manipulation of not only color but also binocular disparity. To this end, we performed a psychophysics experiment to devise a model of disparity at scotopic luminance levels. Using this model, we can match binocular disparity of a scotopic stereo content displayed on a photopic monitor to the disparity that would be perceived if the scene was actually scotopic. The model allows for real-time computation of common stereo content as found in interactive applications such as simulators or computer games.", "paper_title": "Stereo Day-for-Night: Retargeting Disparity for Scotopic Vision", "paper_id": "WOS:000345311700006"}
