It uses the application session information of the session description protocol to generate the quality of service parameters in IEEE 802.16 systems. This feature allows the system to efficiently allocate the radio resource because it can exactly estimate the properties of VoIP services such as packet-size and packet-generation-interval. In other words, the cross-layer framework is expected to achieve a novel resource request scheme for a VoIP service that dynamically assigns the radio resource. This paper has analyzed the maximum number of supportable VoIP users for the resource request schemes in terms of the packet-generation-interval in the silent-period, the duration of the silent-period, and the major VoIP speech codec. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme can efficiently support the VoIP services for the various communication environments. Particularly, it can improve the maximum number of supportable VoIP users by 14 similar to 93% compared to an extended real-time polling service.", "paper_title": "Application-Aware Design to Enhance System Efficiency for VoIP Services in BWA Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000286386900015"}
