In this paper, a two-dimensional model of the breast organisms is numerically carried by the finite di r erence time domain (FDTD) method. The dispersion characteristics of the breast media are taken into account by single pole Debye model to approach the actual properties of the breast organism. In this method, a tumor is assumed in the model with two cases. The standard Capon beamforming (SCB) and doubly constrained robust Capon beamforming (DCRCB) algorithm performed to reconstruct the image is described in detail. The tumor can be detected and localized using the proposed algorithm and the result demonstrates a good stability of DCRCB algorithm.", "paper_title": "IMPROVED BEAMFORMING ALGORITHM FOR IMAGING RECONSTRUCTION FOR EARLY BREAST CANCER DETECTION BY UWB", "paper_id": "WOS:000209245200009"}
