Employing traffic grooming or waveband switching (WS) only may results in several traffic-diversity problems in wavelength routed networks (WRNs) or WaveBand Switching (WBS) networks. In order to solve the traffic-diversity problems in IP over WDM networks, an identified multi-granularity optical cross-connect (MG-OXC) with supporting traffic partition is devised in this paper. In this node structure, one traffic partition module is used to check the type of demand. Followed by our proposed traffic partition based grooming policy (TPGP), if the currently-arriving IP-level user is small-granularity demand, it will be processed by traffic grooming, otherwise processed by waveband switching. Then, we propose a new multi-granularity grooming algorithm based on integrated grooming auxiliary graph (MG-IGAG). The IGAG includes a wavelength integrated auxiliary graph (WIAG) and a waveband integrated auxiliary graph (BIAG) to groom small-granularity and coarse-granularity demands, respectively. Simulation results show that compared to previous WS algorithms and multi-granularity grooming algorithms followed by integrated grooming policy (IGP). MG-IGAG not only performs traffic grooming and waveband switching together, but also solves the traffic-diversity problems effectively, especially for port savings. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
