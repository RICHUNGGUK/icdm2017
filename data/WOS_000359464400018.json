In order to realize efficient power transfer, it is necessary to communicate data such as a frequency, required power, or error tolerance. In the proposed system, because of the use of the same antennas for power transmission and data transmission, the frequency response of a channel for the data transmission changes owing to load fluctuation and the distance between antennas. This paper investigates data transmission performance in the wireless power transfer system with frequency response estimation at the transmitter side. The numerical results obtained through computer simulation show that the proposed scheme can estimate the frequency response of the channel and the difference between the expected bit error rate (BER) and the BER with the estimation error is less than 0.5 dB at the BER of 10(-3).", "paper_title": "Data Transmission Using Transmitter Side Channel Estimation in Wireless Power Transfer System", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464400018"}
