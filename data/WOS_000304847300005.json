These systems have recently received an increasing attention because, unlike stereo cameras, can capture two views of the same scene without the need of hardware multi-camera synchronization and calibration. In this paper we explore the original scenario in which a robot manipulator, equipped with a pinhole camera on its end-effector, observes an unknown 3-D scene both directly and reflected through multiple mirrors. We present new multiple-view properties for this scenario and, based on these theoretical results, we present new image-based camera localization and new 3-D scene reconstruction algorithms. Extensive simulation and real-data experiments illustrate the theory and show the effectiveness of the proposed designs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
