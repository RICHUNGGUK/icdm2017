We proved that the set of all concepts in this system is a lattice with the greatest element and the least element. This framework includes formal concept lattices from formal contexts, L fuzzy concept lattices from L fuzzy formal contexts and three kinds of variable threshold concept lattices, i.e. the extension and the intension of a concept are a crisp set and a crisp set, a crisp set and a fuzzy set, a fuzzy set and a crisp set, respectively. Finally, some iterative algorithms for constructing concepts are proposed and they are proved to be optimal concepts under some conditions in this system.", "paper_title": "A mathematical model for concept granular computing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000279575100011"}
