Such isomorphisms are valuable for use in quantum information. Simple algebraic analysis, however, already rules out the last case so that one and two qubits are the only instances of such isomorphism of the algebras and of a local homomorphism of the corresponding symmetry groups. Amore mathematical topological analysis of the group spaces is also provided demonstrating their topological inequivalence.", "paper_title": "1-, 2-, AND 6-QUBITS, AND THE RAMANUJAN-NAGELL THEOREM", "paper_id": "WOS:000328903100003"}
