The proposed adaptive fuzzy logic control based on physical properties of wheeled inverted pendulums makes use of a fuzzy logic engine and a systematic online adaptation mechanism to approximate the unknown dynamics. Based on Lyapunov synthesis, the fuzzy control ensures that the system outputs track the given bounded reference signals to within a small neighborhood of zero, and guarantees semi-global uniform boundedness of all closed-loop signals. The effectiveness of the proposed control is verified through extensive simulations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
