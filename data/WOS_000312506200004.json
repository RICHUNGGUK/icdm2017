The method is based on supervised learning of local alignment patterns, which are captured by statistical image features at distinctive landmark points. A two-stage classifier cascade, employing an optimal multi-feature model, classifies local alignments into three quality categories: correct, poor or wrong alignment. We establish a reference registration error set as basis for training and testing of the method. It consists of image registrations obtained from different non-rigid registration algorithms and manually established point correspondences of automatically determined landmarks. We employ a set of different classifiers and evaluate the performance of the proposed image features based on the classification performance of corresponding single-feature classifiers. Feature selection is conducted to find an optimal subset of image features and the resulting multi-feature model is validated against the set of single-feature classifiers. We consider the setup generic, however, its application is demonstrated on 51 CT follow-up scan pairs of the lung. On this data, the proposed method performs with an overall classification accuracy of 90%. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
