In particular, artificial neural networks are coupled with a full-wave time domain simulator in order to model and optimize microwave structures. Furthermore, neural networks are used to predict the late time response from the early time response of a structure to accelerate the convergence of time domain simulations, particularly in the case of high-Q structures such as filters and resonators. The combination of neural networks with a time domain TLM solver is demonstrated by means of a design example of an iris-coupled band pass filter. The results demonstrate the dramatic gain in speed and numerical efficiency enabled by this approach to optimizing and modeling microwave devices.
