They are known to be global convergent, however, usually deliver nondeterministic results. In this work we propose the deterministic global solution to a multi-objective problem of supervised learning with the methodology of nonlinear programming. As the result, the proposed multi-objective algorithm performs a global search of Pareto-optimal hypotheses in the space of RBF networks, determining their weights and basis functions. In combination with the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, the algorithm demonstrates a high generalization efficiency on several synthetic and real-world benchmark problems.
