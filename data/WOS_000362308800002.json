The present study proposes a framework that involves integrating the features of news structure, news content, and reader usage (social media recommendation) to explain the number of comments. The results of logistic regression suggest that the proposed framework is a powerful tool for explaining the number of comments (R-2 = 47.1%). The relative and mediating role of recommendation in social media from readers is also explored. The theoretical and managerial implications of these results are provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
