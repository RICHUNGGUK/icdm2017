Deformable models supported include co-rotational linear FEM elasticity, SaintVenant Kirchhoff FEM model, massspring system and invertible FEM models: neo-Hookean, SaintVenant Kirchhoff and MooneyRivlin. We provide several timestepping schemes, including implicit Newmark and backward Euler integrators, and explicit central differences. The implementation of material models is separated from integration, which makes it possible to employ our code not only for simulation, but also for deformable object control and shape modelling. We extensively compare the different material models and timestepping schemes. We provide practical experience and insight gained while using our code in several computer animation and simulation research projects.", "paper_title": "Vega: Non-Linear FEM Deformable Object Simulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000315301700005"}
