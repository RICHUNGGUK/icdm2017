Computational tools that combine reliable, automated and semi-automated approaches to produce secondary structure-based alignments with an appropriate visualization of the results are rare. We have developed SBAL, a tool to generate and edit secondary structure-based sequence alignments. It is easy to install and provides a user-friendly interface. Sequence alignments are displayed, with secondary structure assignments mapped to their corresponding regions in the sequence by using a simple colour scheme. The algorithm implemented for automated and semi-automated secondary structure-based alignment calculations shows a comparable performance to existing software.", "paper_title": "SBAL: a practical tool to generate and edit structure-based amino acid sequence alignments", "paper_id": "WOS:000302298900018"}
