The nonlinear model structure is based on empirical relationships between the measured PM10 and other primary pollutants and meteorological variables. An Extended Kalman filter algorithm is used to estimate 1-day ahead prediction of the extended state, containing model parameters and daily mean PM10. A key characteristic of such a system is that its behaviour can be adapted to the short-term changes of air pollution and consequently the model can handle the time-evolving nature of the phenomena and does not need frequent adjustments. The method is applied to data from a monitoring site in Bordeaux (south France). Experimental results show that the model accurately predicts daily mean PM10. The application of the Extended Kalman filter explains about 70% of the variance with an absolute mean error less than 4.5 mu g/m(3). The approximate index of agreement value for the period covered is 0.90. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
