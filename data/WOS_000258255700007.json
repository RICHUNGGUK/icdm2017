The eMinerals project has tackled this problem by developing the 'my-condor-submit' (MCS) tool, which provides a simple scriptable interface to Globus, a flexible interaction with the storage resource broker, metascheduling with load balancing within a grid environment, and automatic metadata harvesting. This paper provides an overview of MCS together with a use case. We also describe the use of MCS within parameter-sweep studies.
