An efficient algorithm is presented to decompose the multiplication into a number of independent units to facilitate parallel processing. Besides, a novel so-called \"pre-computed addition\" technique is introduced to further reduce the latency. The proposed design involves significantly less area-delay and power-delay complexities compared with the best of the existing designs. It has the same or shorter critical-path and involves nearly one-fourth of the latency of the other in case of the National Institute of Standards and Technology recommended irreducible pentanomials.", "paper_title": "Low Latency Systolic Montgomery Multiplier for Finite Field GF(2(m)) Based on Pentanomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000314022300018"}
