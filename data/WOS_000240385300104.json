In this paper, we use a wearable tri-axial accelerometer to capture the movement data of human body, and propose a novel fall detection method based on one-class support vector machine (SVM). The one-class SVM model is trained by the positive samples from the falls of younger volunteers and a dummy, and the outliers from the non-fall daily activities of younger and the elderly volunteers. The preliminary results show that this method can detect the falls effectively, and reduce the probability of being damaged in the experiments for the elderly people.", "paper_title": "Fall detection by wearable sensor and one-class SVM algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300104"}
