In the language of the CPC community, the cyberinfrastructure for data flow is evolving from an isolated and simple open-loop system to a closed-loop system of complex inter-dependencies with all other infrastructures. This pathway will undoubtedly lead to one of the grand challenges of modem systems engineering, namely a system with a rich set of dynamics that presents a formidable challenge amenable only to those most skilled in the art and science of process control. The dramatic ramp up in societal investments in radio frequency identification (RFID), the emergence of a community investigating dynamic data-drive application systems (DDDAS) and mitigation of security risks engendered by cyberhubs linking critical infrastructures can all be reconsidered in this framework as part of a greater pattern.
