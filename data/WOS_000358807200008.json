However, the storage of personal medical and health information is usually outsourced to some third parties which may result in the exposure of patients' privacy to unauthorized individuals or organizations. In order to address this security loophole, we suggest a promising solution. We propose a new approach for fine-grained access control and secure sharing of signcrypted (sign-then-encrypt) data. We call our new primitive Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Signcryption (CP-ABSC) which satisfies the requirements of cloud computing scenarios for PHR. CP-ABSC combines the merits of digital signature and encryption to provide confidentiality, authenticity, unforgeability, anonymity and collusion resistance. The correctness, security and efficiency of this scheme are also proven. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
