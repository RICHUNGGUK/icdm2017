We proposed a class of impulsive switched systems with time delays and parameter uncertainties. Based on the result of Theorem 3.1 in [X.Z. Liu, G. Ballinger, Uniform asymptotic stability of impulsive delay differential equations, Computer and Mathematics with Applications 41 (2001) 903-915], sufficient stability conditions of the impulsive delay switched systems are obtained. The validity of the results is shown by an example and its simulation.. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
