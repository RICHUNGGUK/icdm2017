Starting from customer's task and process requirements, the cutting trajectories are planned under generalised mathematical model able to reconfigure in accordance with various intersecting types' joint, and all tasks are scheduled by nesting algorithm to maximise the utilisation rate of rough material. This RMES for pipe cutting has been effectively implemented in more than 100 companies.", "paper_title": "Reconfigurable manufacturing execution system for pipe cutting", "paper_id": "WOS:000297244300002"}
