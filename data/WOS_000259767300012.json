In the protocol, all values which are inputted to a comparator network and all intermediate outputs are kept secret assuming the presence of an honest majority. We also introduce an application of the protocol for a secure (M + 1)-st price auction.", "paper_title": "Secure multiparty computation for comparator networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000259767300012"}
