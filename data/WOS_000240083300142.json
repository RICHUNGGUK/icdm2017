We first apply Lagrangean relaxation to decompose the problem into a number of subproblems, each corresponding to one skill type, and then develop a coordination scheme based on a Genetic algorithm, which updates the Lagrangean multipliers to maximize the dual objective function. We report computational results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Maximizing dual function by genetic algorithm - A new approach for optimal manpower planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300142"}
