Both schemes employ DWT followed by DCT. Pseudo-random watermark values are added to mid-frequency DWT-DCT coefficients in the additive scheme. In the image dependent scheme, the watermarking coefficients are modulated with original mid-frequency DWT-DCT coefficients to increase the efficiency of the watermark embedding. Schemes are compared to each other and comparison results including Stirmark 3.1 benchmark tests are presented.", "paper_title": "Additive vs. image dependent DWT-DCT based watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800014"}
