This paper proposes a novel hybrid model which combines time-scale feature extractions with SVM models for stock index forecasting. The time series of explanatory variables are decomposed by the wavelet basis, and the extracted time-scale features then serve as inputs of a SVM model which performs the nonparametric forecasting. Compared with pure SVM models or traditional GARCH models, the performance of the new method is the best. The root- mean-squared forecasting errors are significantly reduced. The results of this study can help investors for controlling and reducing their risks in international investments.", "paper_title": "Combining time-scale feature extractions with SVMs for stock index forecasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000044"}
