The joint transceiver beamformer design is introduced to minimize the transmit power at secondary base station (SBS) while simultaneously controlling the interference to primary users (PUs) and satisfying the secondary users (SUs) signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) based on the convex optimization method. Due to the limited cooperation between SBS and PUs, the channel state information (CSI) usually cannot be obtained perfectly at the SBS in cognitive system. In this study, both perfect and imperfect CSI scenarios are considered in the beamformer design, and the proposed method is robust to CSI error. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Transceiver Optimization for the Multi-Antenna Downlink in MIMO Cognitive System", "paper_id": "WOS:000370180200015"}
