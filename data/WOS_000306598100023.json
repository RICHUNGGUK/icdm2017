On the basis of the recent studies on the just noticeable depth difference (JNDD), which represents a threshold at which a human can perceive the depth difference between objects, we modify the depth image such that neighboring objects in the depth image can have a depth value difference of at least the JNDD. This modification is modeled via an energy minimization framework using three energy terms defined as depth data preservation, depth order preservation, and depth difference expansion. The depth data term enforces minimal changes in the depth image with an additional weighting function that controls the direction of depth changes. The depth order term restricts the inversion of the local and global depth orders among objects, and the JNDD term leads to an increase in the depth differences between segments. Throughout subjective quality evaluation on a stereoscopic image display, it is demonstrated that the human depth sensation is effectively improved by the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Depth Sensation Enhancement Using the Just Noticeable Depth Difference", "paper_id": "WOS:000306598100023"}
