The grown trees are used for highlighting regional differences in the women's labor participation, by using data from the Swiss Population Census. Hence, the focus is on their descriptive rather than predictive power. Trees grown by language regions exhibit fundamental cultural differences supporting the hypothesis of cultural models in female participation. The explanatory power of the induced trees is measured with deviance based fit measures.", "paper_title": "Experiences from a socio-economic application of induction trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000241631200033"}
