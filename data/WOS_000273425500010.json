Algebraic relations between the matrix representation of the dual conic and the circular point enveloped are extensively analyzed, to attain a generalized framework for the problem. The dual conic has the decomposition with consistent geometric interpretation from which the circular point envelope can be solved. From the geometric viewpoint, based on the characteristics of the common elements of dual conics (their bitangents), a stratified approach is presented to establish the solution. Experiments on both synthetic and real images are conducted to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the presented approach.", "paper_title": "GEOMETRIC AND ALGEBRAIC APPROACHES OF PLANAR STRUCTURE RECOVERY BASED ON PROPERTIES OF DUAL CONIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000273425500010"}
