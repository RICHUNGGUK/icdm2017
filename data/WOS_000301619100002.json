This is so despite the diversity of research methods available, the emergence of an interpretivist tradition, and some isolated examples of methodological pluralism. While there have been significant contributions in guiding qualitative research methods teaching, little research has been undertaken that considers the training actually provided, and the possible impacts this may have on the quality and quantity of qualitative research articles in our journals. This explorative study aims to provide some insight into what training is provided, the issues confronted, and possible impediments to publishing qualitative research. Data were collected from interviews with a panel of international colleagues who have a range of experience in teaching and applying qualitative methods. Grounded Theory is used to identify emergent and interconnected themes. Experiential and social learning lenses are used to reflect on the results, providing some initial understanding of the complexities of teaching and undertaking qualitative research. Theoretical as well as practical contributions are made regarding the means by which qualitative research may be introduced, developed and extended within the IS academy, and further theorisation of social and experiential learning.
