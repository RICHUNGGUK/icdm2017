Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey based research method is used and a Mann-Whitney U-test as well as a T-test is applied on this data. Findings - There is no difference between internal auditors in the manufacturing industry and those in the service industry with respect to environmental awareness and cognizance of environmental auditing. Yet there is a significant difference with respect to knowledge of environmental protection. Research limitations/implications - This study is limited to that of internal auditors' perspectives. Practical implications - Internal auditors are the \"watch dogs\" for firms to implement environmental management so that strengthening their enviromnental knowledge is required. Originality/value - This study reveals internal auditors' perception toward environmental management in both high- and low-pollution industries that go beyond green auditing issues.", "paper_title": "Assessment of sustainable development and knowledge of environmental management - Internal auditors' perspectives", "paper_id": "WOS:000239331700017"}
