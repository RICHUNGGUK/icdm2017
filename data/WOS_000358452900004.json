The extremal graphs are unique for n is not an element of {3k - 1, 3k, 4k - 2, 4k - 1}. The value of ex(n, C2k+1) can be read out from the works of Bondy [3], Woodall [14], and Bollobas [1], but here we give a new streamlined proof. The complete determination of the extremal graphs is also new. We obtain that the bound for n(0)(C2k+1) is 4k in the classical theorem of Simonovits, from which the unique extremal graph is the bipartite Turan graph.", "paper_title": "Extremal Numbers for Odd Cycles", "paper_id": "WOS:000358452900004"}
