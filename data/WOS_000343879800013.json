This phenomenon is no different in the transportation sector in which a service-oriented Group Decision Support System (GDSS) provides an important role in transportation enterprise to effectively manage and rapidly respond to the varying needs of the customer. In this paper, we explore the integration problem of service-oriented system and intelligence technology through the use of a GDSS. Initially, we analyze a service-oriented architecture and then, propose the design architecture of a service-oriented GDSS. Next, we put forward a general framework that integrates the intelligent techniques as a component into the architecture of service oriented GDSS. In addition, we illustrate how Artificial Intelligence techniques can resolve the conflicts of distributed group decisions. The paper is concluded by providing a number of applications in the railway management system that demonstrates the benefits of the utilization of a service oriented intelligent GDSS.", "paper_title": "Service-oriented intelligent group decision support system: Application in transportation management", "paper_id": "WOS:000343879800013"}
