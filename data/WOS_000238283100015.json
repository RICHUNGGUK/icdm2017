MMP has proved to be a very powerful coding method for images, as for other types of signals. Experimental tests showed that MIMP is able to achieve better results than the traditional transform-based image coding methods, particularly for images that do not have a low-pass nature. These promising results motivated the use of MMP for residual error encoding in hybrid video coding algorithms. This paper presents the first results of these experiments, performed using a H.264/AVC based video encoder, but using MMP to encode the motion compensated residual data, for the P and B slices. Experimental results show that, even in this not fully optimised version, this method is able to achieve an approximately equivalent performance to the H.264/AVC. This demonstrates that MMP is an alternative to the transform-quantisation paradigm for hybrid video coding that is worth investigating.", "paper_title": "H.264/AVC based video coding using multiscale recurrent patterns: First results", "paper_id": "WOS:000238283100015"}
