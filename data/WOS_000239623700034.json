In this work, we present results of a comparative study of colour contrast and characteristics of colour change between successive video frames for normal vision and two most common types of colour blindness: the protanopia and deuteranopia. The results were obtained by colour mining from three videos of different kind including their original and simulated colour blind versions. Detailed data regarding the reduction of colour contrast, decreasing of the number of distinguishable colours, and reduction of inter-frame colour change rate in dichromats are provided.", "paper_title": "Mining dichromatic colours from video", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623700034"}
