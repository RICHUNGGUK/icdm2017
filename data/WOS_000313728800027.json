This method is useful for the construction of binary sequences with low correlation and large family size. There may be more cases where starting with Z(4) could help researchers design new low correlation sequences for code-division multiple access application.", "paper_title": "On the Construction of Binary Sequence Families With Low Correlation and Large Sizes", "paper_id": "WOS:000313728800027"}
