The primary goal is to design a mobile system for learning of the Japanese language with a clear separation of content and presentation, and to leverage the learners' interest in the Japanese language. Both the technical and the language learning perspectives are discussed. A reusable, lightweight model of learning objects with compact content and a reduced metadata set is presented. These objects are stored in a simple learning object repository that can deliver them to any client over the Internet. A mobile application is designed to use the learning object repository as its content provider, while defining its own method of presentation suitable for smaller screens of mobile devices. For the purpose of evaluation, an experiment was conducted within the e-learning system at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade. Research findings have indicated that the developed mobile application has a positive effect on the students' interest in the subject matter.", "paper_title": "Designing a mobile language learning system based on lightweight learning objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000349356400012"}
