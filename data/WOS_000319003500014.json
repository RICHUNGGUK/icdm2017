For an input image, we first adopt a sparsity prior-based illumination decomposition method to remove its original illumination and have an intrinsic image. Meanwhile, we iteratively extract the salient edge inside by employing a message-passing strategy. Then, we simplify this image with a proposed salient edge-guided image abstraction optimization algorithm in the luminance field. Finally, we put forward a salient edge-guided image relighting optimization method to simulate the effect of dynamic lighting along different directions. Experiment results show that our system can artistically adjust the illumination of the abstracted image and makes it more vivid.
