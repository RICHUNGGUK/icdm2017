A survey was administered to 347 pediatric nurses (response rate = 57.3%) from two academic freestanding pediatric hospitals in the United States. Two separate equations were constructed; one tested whether technology beliefs affected perceived individual quality of care, and the other tested whether technology beliefs affected perceived quality of care provided by the nursing unit. Nurse confidence in their ability to use computer technology and their beliefs that the technologies fit task requirements were significant predictors of nurse beliefs that they and their unit were able to provide quality care to their patients.", "paper_title": "Do Beliefs About Hospital Technologies Predict Nurses' Perceptions of Quality of Care?
