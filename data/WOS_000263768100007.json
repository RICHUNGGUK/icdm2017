The optimality of derived system configurations is guaranteed, while the computation efficiency of the optimizer allows for solving problem instances that were traditionally considered beyond reach for exact solvers (optimality gap). Furthermore, this paper illustrates the development- and run-time software infrastructures that assist the user in developing applications and implementing optimizer solutions. The proposed approach guarantees a high level of power, performance, and constraint satisfaction predictability as from validation on the target platform, thus bridging the abstraction gap.", "paper_title": "Reducing the Abstraction and Optimality Gaps in the Allocation and Scheduling for Variable Voltage/Frequency MPSoC Platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000263768100007"}
