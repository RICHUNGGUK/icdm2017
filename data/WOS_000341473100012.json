However, this study argues that according to the task nature, different negotiation tasks shall \"best fit\" different media channels. A 2 x 3 laboratory experiment was conducted to test this argument. Findings suggested that higher process satisfaction, lower cognitive effort and higher negotiation efficiency would be created when text-based systems were used to execute more analyzable tasks. In contrast, less analyzable tasks best fit face-to-face or audio/video-based systems. Managerial implications are discussed accordingly. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
