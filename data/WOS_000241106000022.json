The dynamic surface control technique is introduced to overcome the problem of explosion of terms associated with backstepping design method. Fuzzy logic system is used as a universal approximator to approximate unstructured uncertain functions and the bounds of the reconstruction error is estimated online. The algorithm has the adaptive mechanism with minimum learning parameterizations. Furthermore, all the signals in the closed-loop systems are guaranteed to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded and the output of the system is proved to converge to a small neighborhood of the desired trajectory. The control performance can be guaranteed by an appropriate choice of the design parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.", "paper_title": "Adaptive dynamic surface fuzzy control for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000022"}
