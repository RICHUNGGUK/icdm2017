In this paper, we propose a new method to realize CMOS digital circuits that are implemented with dual-V-t technology. We first present a new signal-path-level circuit model which effectively deals with the fact that there can be two threshold voltages assigned to a single gate. In order to assign proper threshold voltage to all the signal-paths in the circuit, our new algorithms introduce the concept of subcircuit extraction and include the hierarchy algorithms which are effective and fast. Experimental results show that our algorithms produce a significant reduction for the ISCAS85 benchmark circuits.", "paper_title": "Signal-path-level dual-V-t assignment for leakage power", "paper_id": "WOS:000240112800004"}
