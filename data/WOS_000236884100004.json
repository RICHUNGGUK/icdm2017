More and more web applications have been wrapped as web services, which triggers the change of research focus from finding and integrating them to maximizing reuse. Usually a service requestor retrieves (web) service advertisements out of a UDDI registry based on keywords, like in search engines, which inevitably brings the difficulty of discovering the most appropriate service from a massive number of existing services. This paper briefly introduces a new mechanism to discover and match services in a more fine-grained manner by taking advantage of UDDI and OWL-S. UDDI is used to discover approximate services syntactically by adding new elements and an API. OWL-S is used to match the exact service semantically using ontologies and inference. Finally this paper draws out a framework for discovering and invoking services dynamically.", "paper_title": "Web service discovery and dynamic invocation based on UDDI/OWL-S", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884100004"}
