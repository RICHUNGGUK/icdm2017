However, the estimation of reliable mean squared prediction error (MSPE) of the estimated best linear unbiased predictors (EBLUP) is a complicated process. In this paper we study the use of resampling methods for MSPE estimation of the EBLUP. A cross-sectional and time-series stationary small area model is used to provide estimates in small areas. Under this model, a parametric bootstrap procedure and a weighted jackknife method are introduced. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted in order to compare the performance of different resampling-based measures of uncertainty of the EBLUP with the analytical approximation. Our empirical results show that the proposed resampling-based approaches performed better than the analytical approximation in several situations, although in some cases they tend to underestimate the true MSPE of the EBLUP in a higher number of small areas.", "paper_title": "Assessing different uncertainty measures of EBLUP: a resampling-based approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000278439300001"}
