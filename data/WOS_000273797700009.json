Due to its high versatility, efficiency and low simulation time, this model is suitable not only for the analysis and design of control systems, but also for the development of an expert real time supervision system that would allow detecting and preventing any failure during the treatment.", "paper_title": "Adaptive neurofuzzy ANFIS modeling of laser surface treatments", "paper_id": "WOS:000273797700009"}
