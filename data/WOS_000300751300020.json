This paper proposes a bi-objective credibility-based fuzzy mathematical programming model for designing the strategic configuration of a green logistics network under uncertain conditions. The model aims to minimize the environmental impacts and the total costs of network establishment simultaneously for the sake of providing a sensible balance between them. A popular but credible environmental impact assessment index, i.e., CO2 equivalent index is used to model the environmental impact across the concerned logistics network. Since transportation mode and production technology play important roles on the concerned objectives, the proposed model integrates their respective decisions with those of strategic network design ones. In addition, to solve the proposed bi-objective fuzzy optimization model, an interactive fuzzy solution approach based upon credibility measure is developed. An industrial case study is also provided to show the applicability of the proposed model as well as the usefulness of its solution method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
