The use of carrier beams makes it possible to obtain an equivalent nonlinear spring constant, which increases the capacitor's tuning range and prevents the top plate from collapsing at a tuning range of 50%. A lumped element model and a continuous model of the proposed variable capacitor are developed. The continuous model is simulated using commercial software. A detailed analysis for the steady state of the capacitor is presented. The tuning range is measured and found to be 410% at 1 GHz with a maximum de bias voltage of 9.2 V. The achievable tuning range exceeds that of the traditional parallel-plate MEMS variable capacitors. The self-resonance frequency is measured and found to exceed 11 GHz. The proposed MEMS variable capacitor is built using the PolyMUMPs process.", "paper_title": "A high-tuning-range MEMS variable capacitor using carrier beams", "paper_id": "WOS:000237755700008"}
