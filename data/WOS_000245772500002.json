In this paper, we propose a periodic surface model for computer aided nano design such that geometry of atoms and molecules can be constructed parametrically. At the molecular scale, periodicity of the model allows thousands of particles to be built efficiently. At the meso scale, inherent porosity of the model represents natural morphology of polymer and macromolecule. Surface and volume operations are defined to support crystal and molecular model creation with loci and foci periodic surfaces. The ultimate goal is to enable computer assisted material and system design at atomic, molecular, and meso scales. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
