These adverse effects are initiated by, among others, electrophilic chemicals and those transformed into electrophiles; i.e. non-reactive chemicals activated into reactive electrophilic species by either a biotransformation (pro-electrophiles) or abiotic mechanism (pre-electrophiles). The presence of pro- and pre-electrophiles is important when developing quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). In this study, the reactivity of potential pre-electrophile polyphenolics was investigated using an in chemico assay based on glutathione (GSH) depletion; in addition, the toxicity to Tetrahymena pyriformis was determined. For pre-electrophiles, no direct relationship between toxic potency and reactivity to GSH was obtained. The structural determinants for the pre-electrophile domain were characterized qualitatively by assessing structure-activity relationships (SARs). From this analysis, structural alerts for the pre-Michael acceptor domain (i.e. non-reactive chemicals activated into Michael acceptors) were extracted from the in chemico GSH data. A series of 10 structural alerts corresponding to 1,2- and 1,4-hydroxy and amino-substituted aromatics was developed. The relevance of the alerts was assessed by investigating the aquatic toxicity of these compounds. The structural alerts should help to identify and group pre-Michael acceptors and thus potent reactive toxicants.", "paper_title": "Reactivity and aquatic toxicity of aromatic compounds transformable to quinone-type Michael acceptors", "paper_id": "WOS:000288270300004"}
