However, the most popular P2P system - unstructured P2P system, suffers greatly from the mismatching between the logical overlay and physical topology. This mismatching problem causes a large volume of redundant traffic, which makes peer-to-peer system far from scalable and degrades their search efficiency dramatically. In this paper we address the mismatching problem in an unstructured P2P architecture by developing a distributed overlay optimizing algorithm - HAND (Hops Adaptive Neighbor Discovery). Through comprehensive simulations, we show that HAND significantly outperforms previous approaches, especially in large-scale P2P systems.", "paper_title": "HAND: An overlay optimization algorithm in peer-to-peer systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241591300030"}
