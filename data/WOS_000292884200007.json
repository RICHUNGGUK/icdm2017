However, the models produced by these methods are not unique, with the result depending on the intuition or expertise of the designer, specifically with regards to region D of the structure, where the load path distribution is non-linear. Topology optimization can offer new opportunities to eliminate the limitations of traditional methods. The aim of this work was to study the effect of using different mechanical properties for the steel reinforcement and for the concrete on the emerging topology of strut-and-tie models. The Isolines Topology Design (ITD) method was used for this research. Three examples are presented to show the effect of different mechanical properties used for the tensile (steel) and compressive (concrete) regions of the structure, the: (1) Single short corbel; (2) Deep beam with opening; and (3) Double-sided beam-to-column joint.", "paper_title": "Generation of strut-and-tie models by topology design using different material properties in tension and compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000292884200007"}
