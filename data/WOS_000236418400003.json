It enjoys the flexibility of switching between a line search method that computes steps by factoring the primal-dual equations and a trust region method that uses a conjugate gradient iteration. Steps computed by direct factorization are always tried first, but if they are deemed ineffective, a trust region iteration that guarantees progress toward stationarity is invoked. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the algorithm is implemented in the Knitro [6,28] software package and is extensively tested on a wide selection of test problems.", "paper_title": "An interior algorithm for nonlinear optimization that combines line search and trust region steps", "paper_id": "WOS:000236418400003"}
