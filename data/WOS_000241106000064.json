Using the non-linear mapping to decrease the dimensions of data, taking full advantage of wavelet analysis' superiority in local analysis, the approach is able to detect anomalies accurately. The experiments show that the approach is accurate and practical.", "paper_title": "An approach based on wavelet analysis and non-linear mapping to detect anomalies in dataset", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000064"}
