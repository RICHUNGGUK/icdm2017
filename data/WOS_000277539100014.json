Design/methodology/approach - The traditional calculus-based methods are employed in reference with the qualitative analysis and reasoning of spinning yoyo flows. Findings - This paper presents an opportunity for us to see how theoretical and experimental results obtained in the conventional electromagnetic theory can be potentially generalized to the study of the general systemic yoyo model. Originality/value - This paper looks at the well-established laws of electromagnetic theory from the angle of systems studies with an eye on the possibility of first generalizing these laws to the situations of general systems, and second, the potential to employ these generalized laws to social science and humanity areas.", "paper_title": "The displacement currents of yoyos and Maxwell relationships", "paper_id": "WOS:000277539100014"}
