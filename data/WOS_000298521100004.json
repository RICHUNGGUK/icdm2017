Based on running an incremental analysis, a new relationship is presented for fictitious mass of the kinetic DR algorithm. This formulation is also combined with a transformational form of the Gerschgorin circles theory, proposed here. For numerical verification, some structures from the finite element models are analyzed statically and dynamically and results are compared with the well-known viscous and kinetic DR algorithms. These examples clearly show that the proposed fictitious mass considerably increases the convergence rate of the kinetic DR iterations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
