The review takes the form of an annotated bibliography. A short summary of each of the 186 published works published up to and including 2013 is combined with a classification of the different contributions. While the main focus is design and optimization of processes for liquefaction of natural gas, a selection of publications considering optimization of other parts of the LNG value chain and optimization of other sub-ambient refrigeration processes is also included.
