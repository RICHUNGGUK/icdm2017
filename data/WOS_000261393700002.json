These methods, however, have mainly used general purpose (unmatched) wavelet bases such as Daubechies and Quadratic Spline. In this paper,five new matched wavelet bases, with minimum approximation error and maximum coding gain criteria, are designed and applied to ECG signal analysis. To study the effect of using different wavelet bases for this application, two different wavelet-based R peak detection algorithms are implemented: (1) a conventional wavelet-based method; and (2) a modified wavelet-based R peak detection algorithm. Both algorithms are evaluated using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. Experimental results show lower computational complexity (up to 76%) of the proposed R peak detection method compared to the conventional method. They also show considerable decrease in the number of failed detections (up to 55%) for both the conventional and the proposed algorithms when using matched wavelets instead of Quadratic Spline wavelet which, according to the literature, has generated the best detection results among all conventional wavelet bases studied previously for ECG signal analysis.", "paper_title": "DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF MATCHED WAVELETS WITH MAXIMUM CODING GAIN AND MINIMUM APPROXIMATION ERROR CRITERIA FOR R PEAK DETECTION IN ECG", "paper_id": "WOS:000261393700002"}
