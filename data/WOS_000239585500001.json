The concept of a Smart Home refers to the enrichment of a living environment with technology in order to offer improved habitual support to its inhabitants and therefore an improved quality of life for them. In this article we purport how advances from the device and technological side have not necessarily been matched with a similar level of development in processing of the information recorded within the living environment from an algorithmic or 'intelligent' perspective. We surmise how traditional areas in Artificial Intelligence can bridge this gap and improve the experience for the user within a Smart Home.", "paper_title": "Smart homes can be smarter", "paper_id": "WOS:000239585500001"}
