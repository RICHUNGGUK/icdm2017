[15], Mikusinski and Taylor [25] and Trutschnig and Fernandez-Sanchez [33]. Some of these methods use iterative procedures to construct copulas with fractal supports. The main part of this paper is given in Section 3, where we introduce the sample d-copula of order m with m >= 2, the central idea is to use the above methodologies to construct a new copula based on a sample. The greatest advantage of the sample d-copula is the fact that it is already an approximating d-copula and that it is easily obtained. We will see that these new copulas provide a nice way to study multivariate data with an approximating copula which is simpler than the empirical multivariate copula, and that the empirical copula is the restriction to a grid of a sample d-copula of order n. These sample d-copulas can be used to make statistical inference about the distribution of the data, as shown in Section 3.", "paper_title": "SAMPLE D-COPULA OF ORDER M", "paper_id": "WOS:000328665200001"}
