Various algorithms and design optimization problems, related to microwave devices, antennas and electronic circuits, are presented in numerous publications. However, a new application area for SM optimization is currently expanding, i.e. the design of electromechanical actuators. The purpose of this paper is to present an over-view of the recent developments. Design/methodology/approach - New algorithm variants and their application to design problems in electromechanics and related fields are briefly summarized. Findings - The paper finds that SM optimization offers a significant speed-up of the optimization procedures for the design of electromechanical actuators. Its true potential in the area of magnetic systems and actuator design is still rather unexplored. Originality/value - This overview is complementary to the previous published reviews and shows that the application of SM optimization has also extended to the design of electromechanical devices.", "paper_title": "Space-mapping optimization in electromechanics: an overview of algorithms and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000270210500011"}
