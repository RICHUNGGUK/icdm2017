This paper addresses the implementation of financial cross functional links through the integration of production scheduling and planning with financial management in a modelling framework aimed at chemical process industries. Altogether models must play a more active role, recommending besides schedules and plans, the optimal budgetary decisions for each new scenario. The platform built combines a deterministic cash flow management model with a MILP formulation of process operation. The advantages of this approach are highlighted through case studies.
