These color markers can be used for environmental labeling, for example, as a wayfinding aid for persons with visual impairment. Using a cascade of elemental detectors, robust detection is achieved at an extremely low computational cost. We also introduce a strategy to select surfaces for the marker that ensure very low specular reflection, thus facilitating color-based recognition.", "paper_title": "Robust real-time detection of multi-color markers on a cell phone", "paper_id": "WOS:000319066900007"}
