The aerodynamic efficiency aims to providing a short distance take-off, long endurance and better maneuverability. In addition, the stealth property is one of the essential requirements to complete diverse missions and ensure the survivability of UAVs. This paper explores the application of a robust Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) for aerofoil sections and wing plan form shape design and optimisation for the improvement of aerodynamic performance and the reduction of Radar Cross Section. The method is based on a canonical evolution strategy and incorporates the concepts of hierarchical topology, parallel computing and asynchronous evaluation. Results obtained from the optimisation show that utilising the designing transonic wing aerofoil sections and plan form in combination with evolutionary techniques improve the aerodynamic efficiency. It is shown that this optimisation procedure produced a set of shock-free aerofoils and achieved supercritical aero-diamond wings. Results also indicate that the method is efficient and produces optimal and Pareto non-dominated solutions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
