Since most existing web search algorithms are originally developed for English web documents, one would question the efficiency and performance of these techniques as they are applied to documents of other languages. In this work, we have chosen Chinese web search and documents for our study. Potential issues and problems in applying well-known English language based algorithms to Chinese web documents are identified and discussed. Through our qualitative and exploratory quantitative analysis, it can be concluded that these algorithms and techniques cannot be directly used to develop an efficient Chinese search engine.", "paper_title": "The adaptability of English based web search algorithms to Chinese search engines", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000036"}
