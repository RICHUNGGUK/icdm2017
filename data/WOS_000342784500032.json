AFD can effectively extract the signal's primary trend, which specifically suits the Dow Theory based technique analysis. The proposed approach integrates two different kinds of forecasting approaches, including the Dow theory the RBF neural network. Effectiveness of the proposed approach is assessed through comparison with the direct RBF neural network approach. The result is proved to be promising.", "paper_title": "Stock Index Trend Analysis Based on Signal Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784500032"}
