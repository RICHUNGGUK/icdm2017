The configuration space of these systems (including the transitions) is a special kind of directed graph, called a pseudo-lattice digraph, which is closely related to the stoichiometric matrix. Taking advantage of the monoidal structure of this space, we introduce the algebraic notion of precycle. A precycle leads to the identification of cycles by means of the concept of defect, which is a set of geometric constraints on configuration space. Two efficient algorithms for evaluating precycles and defects are given: one is an algorithm due to Contejean and Devie, the other is a novel branch-and-bound tree search procedure. Cycles partition configuration space into equivalence classes, called the communicating classes. The structure of the communicating classes in the free regime where all rules are enabled - is analyzed: testing for communication can be done efficiently. We show how to apply these ideas to a biological regulatory system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
