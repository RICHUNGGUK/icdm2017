Various decision aids, more and more implemented as web services, aim at reducing this overload. Often they implement compensatory strategies that enable desirable and undesirable values of a product attribute to compensate each other. However, increasing the number of options beyond a handful can lead to poor choices, decreasing satisfaction (i.e., paradox of choice). In such a situation, that involves uncertainty, people relies more on heuristics than rationality to arrive at decisions and purchases. Heuristics, or noncompensatory strategies, do not consider a buyer's preference for multiple attributes, such as the satisficing heuristic that compares each attribute value with a predetermined cut-off level, rejecting alternatives that do not meet it. This paper presents a study combining an E-Commerce literature survey, an E-Commerce websites' analysis, and a survey of online buyers opinions. It is pointing to a gap that exists between sellers' services and buyers' expectations. Empirical evidence suggests that it can be bridged turning to noncompensatory strategies implemented as web services.", "paper_title": "E-COMMERCE WEBSITES SERVICES VERSUS BUYERS EXPECTATIONS: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF THE ONLINE MARKETPLACE", "paper_id": "WOS:000326678500002"}
