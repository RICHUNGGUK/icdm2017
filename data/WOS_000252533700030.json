The AMNDCS is an extension of the multistate network without satisfying the flow conservation law. A very straightforward and simply programmed exact algorithm is developed for this problem using the universal generating function method (UGFM) and a generalized multiplication operator. The correctness and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm will be analyzed and proven. An illustrative example is presented to demonstrate bow this problem is solved using the proposed UGFM. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
