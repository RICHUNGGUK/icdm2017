We explain how it enables us to determine the current probability of an event using a collection of conditional probabilities of the event determined from past experiences and the current probabilities of the conditioning events. We note the importance of the joint probabilities of the event of interest and the conditioning events in obtaining the required conditional probabilities. We investigate the use of copula's to help obtain these required joint probabilities. We then apply our results to a problem of financial decision making in which the success of the stock issue of a new company depends on the quality of management of company. Here, past history tells information about the success of a typical company based on its quality of management and our own observations provides information about the quality of the current companies management.
