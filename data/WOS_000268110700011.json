The shape is discretized as a regular grid. User places handles on the grid and manipulates the shape by moving the handles to the desired positions. To meet the constraints of the users manipulation, the grid is then deformed in an as-rigid-as-possible way. However, this straight forward approach tends to produce unnatural deformations when the grid resolution is not high enough to capture the topological structure of the shape. In the proposed method, the regular grid is trimmed and only the cells that are inside the fatty regions of the shape tire preserved, namely \"interior grid.\" When user manipulates the shape, the interior grid and the shape boundary curve tire deformed With minimum distortions. To make the deformations of the interior grid and the boundary curve consistent, a junction energy is introduced. In this Way, the unnatural deformation effects could be effectively removed and the physically plausible results can be obtained. Meanwhile, the proposed approach provides user an intuitive and simple way to adjust the shape global and local stiffnesses. The deformation is formulated as an energy minimization problem. The energy function is ion-quadratic and could be efficiently solved using an iterative solver with the fast summation technique that exploits the interior grid and boundary curve regularities. In addition, the method could be easily extended to manipulate curves and stick figures. Experimental results demonstrate the capability and flexibility of the new method.
