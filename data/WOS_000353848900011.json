Because the statistical properties of the prediction errors along the embedding direction are significantly altered due to the shifting operation, the existing PHS-based methods are vulnerable to some steganalyzers. The proposed method exploits a set of key-selected referential pixels to construct a 3D Delaunay mesh to obtain the prediction errors. The presence of the altered statistical properties along the embedding direction is unrevealed because the same set of prediction errors cannot be reconstructed. A selective embedment mechanism is used to control the embedding regions in the cover image for evading the detection of the steganalyzers based on low-amplitude stego signal. The experimental results, reveal that the proposed method not only provides better payload and image quality than the existing PHS-based methods, but is also robust to the detection of modern steganalyzers such as histogram analysis and SPAM.
