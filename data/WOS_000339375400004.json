Towards this goal, we develop a novel control framework to improve the flexibility and responsiveness of material handling systems. Flexibility is achieved by using multi-commodity flow network optimization to find the most optimized job sequence in terms of minimum transfer steps. Responsiveness is achieved by the use of a matrix-based discrete event (DE) supervisory controller to dispatch equipment control commands in real-time based on real-time sensor information, according to the optimized sequence. By modeling the MHS network as multi-commodity flow network to define job routes, and using the matrix-based DE controller to implement the job routes in real-time, the users achieve a seamlessly integrated solution to control the execution of transfer jobs that covers the supervisory planning stage through the real-time actual dispatching decisions. The proposed control framework is evaluated on an industrial case study of airfreight terminal material handling and simulation results show its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Multi-commodity flow dynamic resource assignment and matrix-based job dispatching for multi-relay transfer in complex material handling systems (MHS)", "paper_id": "WOS:000339375400004"}
