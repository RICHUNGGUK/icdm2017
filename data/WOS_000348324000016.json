In this contribution some h-type indices are developed, and applications in the field of technological innovation are provided. The obtained results suggest that these h-type indices can be used to describe two-dimensions of a firm's vitality with respect to technological innovation and technological breadth of patents. Hence, patent-related h-indices can serve as simple alternative indicators to describe a firm's performance in technological innovation. They can, moreover, be used to compare firms active in the same industry.", "paper_title": "A simple approach to describe a company's innovative activities and their technological breadth", "paper_id": "WOS:000348324000016"}
