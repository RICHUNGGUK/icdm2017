The algorithm is based on formulating probabilistic stochastic process models for target states, data associations, and birth and death processes. The tracking of these stochastic processes is implemented using sequential Monte Carlo sampling or particle filtering, and the efficiency of the Monte Carlo sampling is improved by using Rao-Blackwellization.
