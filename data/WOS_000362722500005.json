It is energy efficient and is based on a game-theoretic heuristic load-balancing approach. It runs on a hierarchical graph arranged as a tree with parents and children. Sensor nodes are considered heterogeneous in terms of their generated traffic, residual energy and data transmission rate and the bandwidth they provide to their children for communication. The proposed method generates a data routing tree in which child nodes are joined to parent nodes in an energy-efficient way. The principles of the Stackelberg game, in which parents as leaders and children as followers, are used to support the distributive nature of sensor networks. In this context, parents behave cooperatively and help other parents to adjust their loads, while children act selfishly. Simulation results indicate the proposed method can produce on average more load-balanced trees, resulting in over 30% longer network lifetime compared with the cumulative algorithm proposed in the literature.
