Existing schemes have neglected the fact that neighbors which are not closer to the destination than the current node can still reduce energy consumption by taking part in the selected path. Moreover, recent works have confirmed that the generally used Unit Disk Graph to model Wireless Sensor Networks does not represent accurately the behavior of real links. We propose a new scheme called Locally Optimal Source Routing (LOSR) that is able to use neighbors which do not provide advance toward the destination to reduce the overall energy consumption while still avoiding routing loops. Using an Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) mechanism hop by hop we overcome the problems caused by errors in radio transmissions and we introduce a novel routing metric, which accounts for those errors in the energy consumption. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing solutions over a variety of scenarios and network densities.", "paper_title": "Locally Optimal Source Routing for energy-efficient geographic routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000263983000009"}
