The proposed approach consists of three main steps: first, the focus information of each source image obtained by morphological filtering is used to get the rough segmentation result which is one of the inputs of image matting. Then, image matting technique is applied to obtain the accurate focused region of each source image. Finally, the focused regions are combined together to construct the fused image. Through image matting, the proposed fusion algorithm combines the focus information and the correlations between nearby pixels together, and therefore tends to obtain more accurate fusion result. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over traditional multi-focus image fusion methods, especially for those images in dynamic scenes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
