By providing a set of cage geometries as examples, CageIK optimizes deformations of the cage according to handle movements and reconstructs the model using a subspace deformation method based on Green Coordinates. CageIK therefore not only poses the model naturally but also preserves details even when leaving the example space. Furthermore, by blending deformations based on bounded biharmonic weights, CageIK can edit the pose of the model locally. Because example cages can be generated from existing models, we can reuse animation assets that were already created by artists or simulations, which avoids repeating the time-consuming process of creating examples. We show that CageIK can edit a wide variety of models, including multicomponent meshes, polygon soups, and quadrilateral meshes.
