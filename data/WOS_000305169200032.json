The maximum passband group delay of the filter is minimized subject to a positivity constraint on the pass band group delay response of the filter as well as a specification on the maximum absolute difference between the desired magnitude square response and the designed magnitude square response over both the passband and the stopband. This filter design problem is a quadratic NP hard functional inequality constrained optimization problem. To tackle this problem, first, the one norm functional inequality constraint of the optimization problem is approximated by a smooth function so that the quadratic NP hard functional inequality constrained optimization problem is converted to a nonconvex functional inequality constrained optimization problem. Then, a modified filled function method is applied for finding the global minimum of the nonconvex optimization problem. By using a local minimum of the corresponding unconstrained optimization problem as the initial condition of our proposed global optimization algorithm, computer numerical simulation results show that our proposed approach could efficiently and effectively design a minimax passband group delay nonlinear phase peak constrained FIR filter without imposing a desired phase response.", "paper_title": "MINIMAX PASSBAND GROUP DELAY NONLINEAR PHASE PEAK CONSTRAINED FIR FILTER DESIGN WITHOUT IMPOSING DESIRED PHASE RESPONSE", "paper_id": "WOS:000305169200032"}
