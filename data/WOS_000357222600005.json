Our results are the following: Isomorphism testing of rank 1 decision trees is complete for logspace. For any constant r >= 2, isomorphism testing for rank r decision trees is polynomial-time equivalent to Graph Isomorphism. As a consequence of our reduction, we obtain our main result for decision trees: A 2(root n(log s)0(1)) ern time algorithm for isomorphism testing of decision trees of size s over n variables. The isomorphism problem for decision lists admits a Schaefer-type trichotomy: depending on the class of base functions, the isomorphism problem is either in L, or polynomial-time equivalent to Graph Isomorphism, or coNP-hard.
