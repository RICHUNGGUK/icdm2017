The proposed scheme can provide a fast and efficient mobility service to MNs and also the strength of network scalability and stability to an access network by proposing the dynamic virtual hierarchical network architecture. In addition, the pre-authentication procedure for an MN, based on the information of neighbor mobile access gateway (MAG) list in the enhanced-policy server (E-PS), is proposed to support seamless handover by reducing MN's handover latency. Through performance evaluations of numerical analyses and simulations, we have confirmed and verified the superiority of the proposed scheme compared to the conventional proxy mobile ipv6 (PMIPv6).", "paper_title": "An Enhanced Network-based Mobility Management Protocol for Fast Mobility Support", "paper_id": "WOS:000300514600007"}
