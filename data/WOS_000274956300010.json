The solution is obtained using Newton's algorithm to find a zero of a vector field on a product manifold. As a preliminary the algorithm is formulated for the well-known case with no missing elements where also a rederivation of the correction equation in a block Jacobi-Davidson method is included. Numerical examples show that the Newton algorithm grows more efficient than an alternating least squares procedure as the amount of missing values increases.", "paper_title": "Grassmann algorithms for low rank approximation of matrices with missing values", "paper_id": "WOS:000274956300010"}
