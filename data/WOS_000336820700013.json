The present research furthers our understanding of SNS use by studying the relationship between loneliness, varied dimensions of Facebook use, and college adjustment among first-year students. We looked at three facets of college adjustment: social adjustment, academic motivation, and perceived academic performance. Compulsive use of Facebook had a stronger association with academic motivation than habitual use of Facebook, but neither were directly correlated with academic performance. Too much time spent on Facebook was weakly but directly associated with poorer perceived academic performance. Loneliness was a stronger indicator of college adjustment than any dimension of Facebook usage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
