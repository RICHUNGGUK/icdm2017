We formulate the constellation design as a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming. We propose a simple and efficient optimization method, which offers good solutions for small to medium sized constellations.", "paper_title": "Designing Good Multi-Dimensional Constellations", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696100020"}
