We argue for the potential of this approach, motivating it with recent trends and developments in the areas of information visualization, urban computing, and urban screens, and we layout a transdisciplinary research approach and methodology. Through three studies approaching our research goal from design, empirical, and reflective perspectives, we show how visualization interfaces, situated in public spaces can improve perception, and lead to sustained behavior change; can increase social awareness and discourse; and can influence meaningful participation and a range of social interactions related to locally relevant topics. We conclude by discussing implications for the design, use and evaluation of citizen-driven public visualization as a tool increase public awareness, participation and discourse.
