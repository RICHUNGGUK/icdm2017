An algorithm is first given to compute the Madalines' sensitivity, and its efficiency is verified by computer simulations. Then, based on the algorithm, the sensitivity analysis is conducted, which shows that the dimension of input has little effect on the sensitivity as long as the dimension is sufficient large, and the increases in the number of Adalines in a layer and the number of layers will lead the sensitivity to increase under an upper bound. The analysis results will be useful for designing robust Madalines.", "paper_title": "Sensitivity analysis of Madalines to weight perturbation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100086"}
