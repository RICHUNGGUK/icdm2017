We propose a new technique called Similar Trend Monitoring (STM) for this task: The current slopes of all univariate streams are estimated and compared pairwise at each time point. The STM statistic is the standardized slope difference, so that decisions about coherence can be made by means of the six-sigma-rule, for instance. The STM meets the high demands that come along with the online monitoring of multivariate data streams: it is fast to compute, robust against outliers, applicable when observations are missing, and does not require stationarity of the processes. We investigate the distribution and the performance of the STM and demonstrate its capabilities considering blood pressure time series from intensive care patient monitoring as an example.", "paper_title": "Robust online-surveillance of trend-coherence in multivariate data streams: the similar trend monitoring (STM) procedure", "paper_id": "WOS:000358784100004"}
