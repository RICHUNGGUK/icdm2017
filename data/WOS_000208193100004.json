In this paper, we propose an algorithm to estimate the two-dimensional (2D) shapes and positions of buildings, simultaneously using GPS logs and wireless communication logs of mobile nodes. The algorithm is easy to implement since it only needs general wireless devices such as smartphones. The results from the experiments conducted assuming rescue operation scenarios have shown that the proposed method could quickly generate a map with 85% accuracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
