This module, called dune-subgrid, allows to mark elements of another Dune hierarchical grid. The set of marked elements can then be accessed as a Dune grid in its own right. dune-subgrid is free software and is available for download ( External Dune Modules: www.dune-project.org/downloadext.html). We describe the functionality and use of dune-subgrid, comment on its implementation, and give two example applications. First, we show how dune-subgrid can be used for micro-FE simulations of trabecular bone. Then we present an algorithm that allows to use exact residuals for the adaptive solution of the spatial problems of time-discretized evolution equations.", "paper_title": "The dune-subgrid module and some applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000271501300001"}
