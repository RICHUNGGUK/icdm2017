A cost-constrained random-coding ensemble with multiple auxiliary costs is introduced, and is shown to achieve error exponents and second-order coding rates matching those of constant-composition random coding, while being directly applicable to channels with infinite or continuous alphabets. The number of auxiliary costs required to match the error exponents and second-order rates of constant-composition coding is studied, and is shown to be at most two. For independent identically distributed random coding, asymptotic estimates of two well-known non-asymptotic bounds are given using saddlepoint approximations. Each expression is shown to characterize the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding random-coding bound at both fixed and varying rates, thus unifying the regimes characterized by error exponents, second-order rates, and moderate deviations. For fixed rates, novel exact asymptotics expressions are obtained to within a multiplicative 1 + o(1) term. Using numerical examples, it is shown that the saddlepoint approximations are highly accurate even at short block lengths.", "paper_title": "Mismatched Decoding: Error Exponents, Second-Order Rates and Saddlepoint Approximations", "paper_id": "WOS:000335151900012"}
