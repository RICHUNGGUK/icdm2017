At the embedding stage, the host audio signal is divided into two subsignals, which are considered to be signals obtained from two virtual audio channels. The watermarks are implanted into the two subsignals simultaneously. Then the subsignals embedded with watermarks are combined to form the watermarked signal. At the decoding stage, the watermarked signal is split up into two watermarked subsignals. The similarity of the cepstra corresponding to the watermarked subsignals is exploited to extract the embedded watermarks. Moreover, if a properly designed colored pseudonoise sequence is used, the large peaks of its auto-correlation function can be utilized to further enhance the performance of watermark extraction. Compared with the existing time-spread echo-based schemes, the proposed method is more robust to attacks and has higher imperceptibility. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by simulation results.", "paper_title": "A Dual-Channel Time-Spread Echo Method for Audio Watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000301506500004"}
