The curved mesh adaptation procedure uses curved entity mesh modification operations that explicitly consider the influence of the curved mesh entities on element shape. Applications of the curved mesh adaptation procedure have been developed to support the parallel automated adaptive accelerator simulations at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.", "paper_title": "Parallel mesh adaptation for high-order finite element methods with curved element geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000333013500009"}
