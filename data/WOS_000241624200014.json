In such a setting, the course of service discovery could yield many alternative yet heterogeneous services which, by all means, may be of different type and moreover distinguished by their quality characteristics. To come through such situations and ease the task of service selection, service search engines need to be powered by an efficient matchmaking mechanism, which will abstract requesters from service heterogeneity and provide them with the means for choosing the service that best fits their requirements, among a wide set of services with similar functionally. In this paper, we present an efficient service matchmaking algorithm, which facilitates the task of heterogeneous service selection, whilst combining and. exploiting the syntactic, semantic, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) properties contained in service advertisements.", "paper_title": "Quantified matchmaking of heterogeneous services", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624200014"}
