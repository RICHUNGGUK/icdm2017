Their flexibility to adapt to different environments has helped in their steady growth. Overlay multicast trees that are built using location information account for node mobility and have a low latency. However, the performance gains of such trees are offset by the overhead involved in distributing and maintaining precise location information. As the degree of (location) accuracy increases, the performance improves but the overhead required to store and broadcast this information also increases. In this paper, we present SOLONet, a design to build a sub-optimal location aided overlay multicast tree, where location updates of each member node are event based. Unlike several other approaches, SOLONet doesn't require every packet to carry location information or each node maintain location information of every other node or carrying out expensive location broadcast for each node. Our simulation results indicate that SOLONet is scalable and its sub-optimal tree performs very similar to an overlay tree built by using precise location information. SOLONet strikes a good balance between the advantages of using location information (for building efficient overlay multicast trees) versus the cost of maintaining and distributing location information of every member nodes.", "paper_title": "SOLONet: Sub-optimal location-aided overlay network for MANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000257126500001"}
