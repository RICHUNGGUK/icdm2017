In each case, we consider the smallest target graph such that the corresponding homomorphism is NP-complete. These target graphs T-4, T-5, and T-6 have 4, 5, and 6 vertices, respectively. For i is an element of {4, 5, 6} and for every g, we prove that if there exists a (bipartite) planar oriented graph with girth at least g that does not map to T-i, then deciding homomorphism to T-i is NP-complete for (bipartite) planar oriented graphs with girth at least g.
