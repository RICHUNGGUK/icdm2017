Design/methodology/approach - General review and survey of selected research and development topics. Findings - Illustrates the multi- and trans-disciplinary nature of cybernetics and systems. Aims to further research and development activity. Practical implications - The choice of review provides an awareness of the current trends in these areas of endeavour but are necessarily selective. Originality/value - The reviews are selected from a global database and give a studied assessment of current research and development initiatives.", "paper_title": "Innovative information monitoring systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242322300012"}
