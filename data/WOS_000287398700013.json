A special common-mode level arrangement and gate-input self-biased amplifiers allows the modulator to meet the speed requirement at the low supply voltage. Realized in a 0.13-mu m triple-well CMOS process and using only standard V-T devices, the modulator achieves a peak SNDR of 61.9 dB, a dynamic range of 65.7 dB and an image rejection ratio of 46.3 dB with 3.4-mW consumption at the nominal supply of 0.5 V, and occupies a die area of 0.9 mm(2).", "paper_title": "A 0.5 V 65.7 dB 1 MHz continuous-time complex delta sigma modulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000287398700013"}
