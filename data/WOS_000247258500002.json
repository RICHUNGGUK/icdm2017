In particular, the optimisation problem for a real environment, including parallel machines and operation lag times, has been approached by means of an effective pheromone trail coding and tailored ant colony operators for improving solution quality. The method used to tune the system parameters is also described. The algorithm has been tested by using standard benchmarks and problems, properly designed for a typical FMS layout. The effectiveness of the proposed system has been verified in comparison with alternative approaches. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
