Grid provides uniform access to heterogeneous resources owned by multiple organizations. Any time a new resource can join the Grid or an existing resource can withdraw. The system loads and status of the resources also change frequently. Thus, a resource broker is an essential component in a Grid environment that can assist in the selection of a right resource provider for a job in all aspects. This paper discusses the design and implementation of resource brokering strategies within the multi-agent framework. These strategies help in finding out an optimal allocation of resources for executing multiple concurrent jobs in a Grid environment. Different stages in resource brokering and their implementation within the framework are discussed. The paper also presents results of evaluating the strategies and demonstrates their effectiveness.
