The hypercube memory division scheme lowers the energy per memory access by 59.2% and increases the total required area by 16.8%. The use of 3D integration reduces the logic power by 5.2%. We describe the tool flow required to realize the 3D implementation and perform a thermal analysis of it.", "paper_title": "Low-Power Hypercube Divided Memory FFT Engine Using 3D Integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000284931600005"}
