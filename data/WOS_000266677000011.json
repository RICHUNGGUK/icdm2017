Due to uncertainty of real systems, train timetables have to be made under an uncertain environment under most circumstances. This paper mainly investigates a passenger train timetable problem with fuzzy passenger demand on a single-line railway in which two objectives, i.e., fuzzy total passengers' time and total delay time, are considered. As a result, an expected value goal-programming model is constructed for the problem. A branch-and-bound algorithm based on the fuzzy simulation is designed in order to obtain an optimal solution. Finally, some numerical experiments are given to show applications of the model and the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Train Timetable Problem on a Single-Line Railway With Fuzzy Passenger Demand", "paper_id": "WOS:000266677000011"}
