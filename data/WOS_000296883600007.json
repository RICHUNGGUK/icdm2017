Several evaluations show that they improve the accuracy of related works. These measures have been applied to clustering to compute the similarity/distance between individuals described by textual attributes. Clustering results show that a proper interpretation of textual data at a semantic level improves the quality of the clusters and ease their interpretation.", "paper_title": "Ontology-based semantic clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000296883600007"}
