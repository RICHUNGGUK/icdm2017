This algorithm has remarkably higher accuracy than the standard collaborative filtering (CF) using Pearson correlation. Furthermore, we introduce a free parameter beta to regulate the contributions of objects to user correlation. The numerical simulation results indicate that decreasing the influence of popular objects can further improve the algorithmic accuracy and diversity.", "paper_title": "Improved collaborative filtering algorithm based on heat conduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971100017"}
