Then by combining the fuzzy theory with v-support vector machine, the fuzzy v-support vector classifier machine (Fv-SVCM) is proposed. A fault diagnosis method based on Fv-SVCM and its relevant parameter-choosing algorithm is put forward. The results of the application in car assembly diagnosis confirm the feasibility and the validity of the diagnosis method. Compared with the fuzzy neural network (FNN) model, Fv-SVCM method requires fewer samples and has better estimating precision. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
