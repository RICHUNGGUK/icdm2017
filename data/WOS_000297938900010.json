The objective of security-constrained UC (SC-UC) is to minimize the total generation cost, which is the sum of both transition cost and production cost of the scheduled combination units. The proposed CPSO method, which involves the chaotic map and the chaotic turbulence, can avoid premature convergence of PSO and escape local minima. Moreover, the proposed hybrid CPSO method has the ability of solving both the continuous and the discrete optimal programming problems. Two power systems are demonstrated for verifying the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in solving SC-UC problems with constraints of a nonlinear generator and operation security assessment taken into consideration. The simulation results show that the proposed CPSO-based SC-UC method is indeed capable of obtaining efficiently high-quality UC solutions and enhancing the system security of UC operation.", "paper_title": "UNIT COMMITMENT WITH SECURITY ASSESSMENT USING CHAOTIC PSO ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000297938900010"}
