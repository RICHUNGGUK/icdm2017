Geometrical characteristics of the Hencky nets giving the truss layout are expressed in terms of Lommel functions. Analytically derived truss volumes for the above problem are compared with those of trusses supported along circles of equivalent area. Some general implications of the results are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Analytical benchmarks for topological optimization IV: square-shaped line support", "paper_id": "WOS:000257332600003"}
