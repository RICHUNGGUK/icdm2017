The committee of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32, which had standardized the MDR, has started to improvise the MDR, and the improvised version is named extended MDR (XMDR). However, the XMDR does not fully support the ontology concept, and no method is available for mapping ontology registrations onto registries. To overcome the limitations of the outdated XMDR, this paper proposes an extended XMDR (XMDR+) framework. The XMDR+ framework provides a method for mapping of ontology registrations between the metadata registry and ontologies. To improve the functions of the XMDR, we have proposed herein a framework that is capable of defining a model that manages the relations not only among ontological concepts but also among instances, and guarantees the management and storage of their relationships for supporting valid relations of the ontologies.", "paper_title": "XMDR+: An Extended XMDR Model for Supporting Diverse Ontological Relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125900014"}
