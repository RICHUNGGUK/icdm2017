The proposed method evaluates gene expression patterns for discriminating heterogeneous cancers. Distance metrics and classification rules have also been analyzed to design a GASS with high classification accuracy. Moreover, the proposed method is compared to previously published methods. Various experimental results show that our method is effective for classifying the NCI60, the GCM and the SRBCTs datasets. Moreover, GASS outperforms other existing methods in both the leave-one-out cross validations and the independent test for novel data. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
