Large switching in the circuit during launch-to-capture cycles not only negatively impacts circuit performance causing overkill, but could also burn tester probes during wafer test due to the excessive current they must drive. It is necessary to develop a quick and effective method for evaluating each pattern, identifing high-power patterns considering functional and tester probes' current limits and making the final pattern set power-safe. Compared with previous low-power methods that deal with scan structure modification or pattern filling techniques, the new proposed method takes into account layout information and resistance in the power distribution network and can identify peak current among C4 power bumps. Post-processing steps replace power-unsafe patterns with low-power ones. The final pattern set provides considerable peak current reduction while fault coverage is maintained.", "paper_title": "Power-Safe Application of TDF Patterns to Flip-Chip Designs during Wafer Test", "paper_id": "WOS:000322449700010"}
