Computationally flexible EM-type algorithms are developed for parameter estimation of these models under a missing at random (MAR) mechanism. For ease of computation and theoretical developments, two auxiliary indicator matrices are incorporated into the estimating procedure for exactly extracting the location of observed and missing components of each observation. Computational aspects related to the specification of starting values, convergence assessment and model choice are also discussed. The practical usefulness of the proposed methodology is illustrated with real data examples and a simulation study with varying proportions of missing values. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
