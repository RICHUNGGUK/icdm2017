The PoPMuSiC algorithm is used to introduce, in silico, all the single-site mutations in four mesophilic and one psychrophilic chloride-dependent alpha-amylases and to evaluate the changes in thermodynamic stability. The analysis of the distribution of the sequence positions that could be stabilized upon mutation shows a clear difference between the three domains of psychrophilic and mesophilic alpha-amylases. Most of the mutations stabilizing the psychrophilic enzyme are found in domains B and C, contrary to the mesophilic proteins where they are preferentially situated in the catalytic domain A. Moreover, the calculations show that the environment of some residues responsible for the activity of the psychrophilic protein has evolved to reinforce favorable interactions with these residues. In the second part, these results are exploited to propose rationally designed mutations that are predicted to confer to the psychrophilic enzyme mesophilic-like thermodynamic properties. Interestingly, most of the mutations found in domain C strengthen the interactions with domain A, in agreement with suggestions made on the basis of structural analyses. Although this study focuses on single-site mutations, the thermodynamic effects of the recommended mutations should be additive if the mutated residues are not close in space.", "paper_title": "In silico analysis of the thermodynamic stability changes of psychrophilic and mesophilic alpha-amylases upon exhaustive single-site mutations", "paper_id": "WOS:000237658400061"}
