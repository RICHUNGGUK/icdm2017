Often, it is assumed that detected faults are immediately corrected when mathematical models are developed. This assumption may not be realistic in practice because the time to remove a detected fault depends on the complexity of the fault, the skill and experience of personnel, the size of debugging team, the technique(s) being used, and so on. During software testing, practical experiences show that mutually independent faults can be directly detected and removed, but mutually dependent faults can be removed iff the leading faults have been removed. That is, dependent faults may not be immediately removed, and the fault removal process lags behind the fault detection process. In this paper, we will first give a review of fault detection & correction processes in software reliability modeling. We will then illustrate the, fact that detected faults cannot be immediately corrected with several examples. We also discuss the software fault dependency in detail, and study how to incorporate both fault dependency and debugging time lag into software reliability modeling. The proposed models are fairly general models that cover a variety of known SRGM under different conditions. Numerical examples are presented, and the results show that the proposed framework to incorporate both fault dependency and debugging time lag for SRGM has a better prediction capability. In addition, an optimal software release policy for the proposed models, based on cost-reliability criterion, is proposed. The main purpose is to minimize the cost of software development when a desired reliability objective is given.", "paper_title": "Software reliability analysis by considering fault dependency and debugging time lag", "paper_id": "WOS:000240324800005"}
