By using multiple Lyapunov-functions technique and a dwell-time approach, several criteria on exponential stability for both linear and nonlinear systems are established. It is shown that by suitably controlling the switching between the stable and unstable modes, exponential stabilization of the switched system can be achieved. Some examples and numerical simulations are provided to illustrate our results. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
