Applying a novel semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation strategy to a class of continuous semi-supervised support vector machines ((SVMs)-V-3), a new convex relaxation framework for the (SVMs)-V-3 is proposed based on SDP. Compared with other SDP relaxations for (SVMs)-V-3, the proposed methods only require solving the primal problems and can implement L-1-norm regularization. Furthermore, the proposed technique is applied directly to recognize the purity of hybrid maize seeds using near-infrared spectral data, from which we find that the proposed method achieves equivalent performance to the exact solution algorithm for solving the (SVM)-V-3 in different spectral regions. Experiments on several benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed convex technique is competitive with other SDP relaxation methods for solving semi-supervised SVMs in generalization.
