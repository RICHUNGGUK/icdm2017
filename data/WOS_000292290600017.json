The iron crystal structure is treated as a truss system, while the forces between the atoms situated at the nodes are defined by modified Morse inter-atomic potentials. The evolution of lattice structure is interpreted as a sequence of equilibrium states corresponding to the history of applied load/deformation, where each equilibrium state is found using an iterative procedure based on IBA. The results presented demonstrate the success of applying the IBA technique for modeling the mechanisms of elastic, plastic and fracture behavior of single iron crystals.", "paper_title": "The application of inverse Broyden's algorithm for modeling of crack growth in iron crystals", "paper_id": "WOS:000292290600017"}
