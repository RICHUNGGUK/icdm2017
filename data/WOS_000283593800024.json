This stands in contrast to the case corresponding to a finite- dimensional approximation to the Mumford-Shah functional, where the operator involved is the identity and for which polynomial-time solutions are known. Consequently, we confirm the infeasibility of any natural extension of the Mumford-Shah functional to general inverse problems. A connection between truncated quadratic minimization and sparsity-constrained minimization is also discussed.", "paper_title": "On the Complexity of Mumford-Shah-Type Regularization, Viewed as a Relaxed Sparsity Constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000283593800024"}
