Given a constant size set R which represents distinct levels of fault-tolerant requirements of all cities, as well as the two-part (facility and connection) cost of the optimal solution, i.e. F* + C*, the cost of our solution is no more than |R| . F* + 2C* for the general case, and less than F* + 2C* for the special case where all cities have a uniform connectivity requirement. Extensive numerical experiments showed that the quality of our solutions is comparable (within 4% error) to the optimal solution in practice.", "paper_title": "A DISTRIBUTED APPROXIMATION ALGORITHM FOR FAULT-TOLERANT METRIC FACILITY LOCATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000293753200003"}
