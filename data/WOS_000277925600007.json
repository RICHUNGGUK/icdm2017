In particular, aggregate constraints defined as linear inequalities on aggregate-sum queries on input data are considered. The notion of repair as consistent set of updates at attribute-value level is exploited, and the characterization of several data-complexity issues related to repairing data and computing consistent query answers is provided. Moreover, a method for computing \"reasonable\" repairs of inconsistent numerical databases is provided, for a restricted but expressive class of aggregate constraints. Several experiments are presented which assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach in real-life application scenarios.", "paper_title": "Querying and Repairing Inconsistent Numerical Databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000277925600007"}
