The goal is to reduce dissipation, especially for smooth flows. This is accomplished by multiple piecewise linear reconstructions of conserved quantities within the cell. The reconstruction is based upon gradients that are calculated at the nodes, a procedure that avoids the least-square solution of a large equation set for polynomial coefficients. Conservation and monotonicity are guaranteed by adjusting the gradients within each cell corner. Results are presented for a wide variety of test problems involving smooth and shock-dominated flows, fluids and solids, 2D and 3D configurations, as well as Lagrange, Eulerian, and ALE methods.
