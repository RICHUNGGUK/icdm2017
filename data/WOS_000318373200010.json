SAPs are hardware implementations of a class of iterative, high-level language algorithms, for applications where the high-speed of processing has the principal meaning of a design. Embedding SAPs onto FPGAs is a complex process. The optimization phase in this process reduces the SAP significantly, thus less FPGA area is occupied by the embedded design, without any loss in the final performance. The present paper examines the effect of Projection Vectors (PVs) and Task Scheduling Vectors (TSVs) on the optimization process. Two optimization approaches are examined, namely technology mapping using FlowMap and Flowpack algorithms and optimization via logic synthesis using Xilinx Synthesis Tool. The multiplication of matrices, with entries being up to 32-bit integer vectors, has been taken as a sample space for the experiments conducted. The results, confirm that the selection of PV and TSV greatly affects the number of input/output signal connections of the FPGA, while the selection of an optimization approach affects the final number of logic resources occupied on the targeted device.", "paper_title": "EVALUATION STUDY OF SYSTOLIC ARRAY PROCESSORS OPTIMIZATION AND MAPPING ON k-LUT FPGA DEVICES", "paper_id": "WOS:000318373200010"}
