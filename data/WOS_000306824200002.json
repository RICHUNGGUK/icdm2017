In systems with both time-reversal and spatial inversion symmetry (centrosymmetric), one can use the parity analysis of Bloch functions at time-reversal invariant momenta to determine the Z(2) invariants. In systems without spatial inversion symmetry (noncentrosymmetric), however, a more complex and systematic method in terms of the Berry gauge potential and the Berry curvature is required to identify the band topology. We show in detail how both methods are implemented in FP-LAPW formalism and applied to several classes of materials including centrosymmetric compounds Bi2Se3 and Sb2Se3 and noncentrosymmetric compounds LuPtBi, AuTlS2 and CdSnAs2. Our work provides an accurate and effective implementation of first-principles calculations to speed up the search of new topological insulators. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
