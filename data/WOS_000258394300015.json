So far, the reported 3D face recognition techniques have used active 3D measurement methods to capture high-quality 3D facial information. However, active methods employ structured illumination (structure projection, phase shift, moire topography. etc.) or laser scanning, which is not desirable in many human recognition applications. Addressing this problem. we propose a face recognition system that uses (i) passive stereo vision to capture 3D facial information and (ii) 3D matching using an ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm with its improvement techniques. Experimental evaluation demonstrates efficient recognition performance of the proposed system compared with an active 3D face recognition system and a passive 3D face recognition system employing the original ICP algorithm.", "paper_title": "A passive 3D face recognition system and its performance evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000258394300015"}
