However, in a hierarchical design now for very large ASICs and SoCs, a floorplan can be completely useless for a situation where its outline is dissatisfied. In this paper, we study the fixed-outline floorplanning problem that is more applicable to the hierarchical design style. We develop an efficient algorithm based on robust evolutionary search and achieve substantially improved success rate. We also propose a new approach to handle soft modules to further adjust the generated floorplan to fit into the prescribed chip outline. The effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated on several large cases of MCNC and GSRC benchmarks. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
