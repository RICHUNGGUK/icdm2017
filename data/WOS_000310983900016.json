By observing the limitations of existing approaches, we found that there is an urgent need for a flexible, privacy-aware system that is able to meet the privacy preservation needs at both the role levels and the personal levels. We proposed a conceptual system that considered these two requirements: a graph-based, access control model to safeguard patient privacy. We present a case study of the healthcare field in this paper. While our model was tested in the field of healthcare, it is generic and can be adapted to use in other fields. The proof-of-concept demos were also provided with the aim of valuating the efficacy of our system. In the end, based on the hospital scenarios, we present the experimental results to demonstrate the performance of our system, and we also compared those results to existing privacy-aware systems. As a result, we ensured a high quality of medical care service by preserving patient privacy.", "paper_title": "A Privacy-aware Graph-based Access Control System for the Healthcare Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000310983900016"}
