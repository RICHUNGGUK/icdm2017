This article proposes a scenario for continuously improving the (X) over bar &S control charts during the use of the charts. It makes use of the information collected from the out-of-control cases in a manufacturing process to update the charting parameters (i.e. the sample size, sampling interval and control limits) step-by-step. Consequently, the resultant control charts (called the updatable charts) become more and more effective to detect the mean shift delta(mu) and standard deviation shift delta(sigma) for the particular process. The updatable charts are able to considerably reduce the average value of the loss function due to the occurrences of the out-of-control cases. Noteworthily, unlike the designs of the economic control charts, the designs of the updatable charts only require limited number of specifications that can be easily decided.", "paper_title": "The updatable (X)over-bar&S control charts", "paper_id": "WOS:000236500400006"}
