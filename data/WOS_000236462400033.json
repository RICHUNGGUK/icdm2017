Use of k-means cluster analysis for dimensional reduction and maximum sensitivity for RIFE resulted in 64-gene models with fewer invariant and correlated features when compared with PCA and mimimum error. In conclusion, k-means cluster analysis and sensitivity may be better suited for classifying diseases for which gene expression is more strongly influenced by pathway heterogeneity.", "paper_title": "Comparison of gene identification based on artificial neural network pre-processing with k-means cluster and principal component analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000236462400033"}
