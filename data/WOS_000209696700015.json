Based on the evaluation of various combining algorithms for the correlation functions of M element sequences of a CC, a per-carrier parallel interference cancellation scheme based on minimum mean square error combining (MMSEC) is proposed for CC-CDMA to achieve a frequency diversity gain and multi-user interference resistance. Both analytical and simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed scheme. It is shown that combining algorithms and correlation properties of element sequences have a significant impact on the performance of CC-CDMA systems in frequency selective fading channels.", "paper_title": "Multi-User Interference Cancellation in Complementary Coded CDMA with Diversity Gain", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696700015"}
