The model assumes a layerwise variable description for displacements, transverse stresses and in-plane strains, along with the electrostatic potential, transverse electric displacement and in-plane electric field components, taken as independent variables. This original choice for the layerwise mixed formulation is intended to ensure the a priori and complete fulfilment of the interlaminar C degrees continuity of both mechanical and electrical variables, which is due to compatibility and equilibrium conditions. Numerical applications are shown for assessment of the model predictive capabilities by comparison with available exact three-dimensional solutions, considering multilayered piezoelectric composite plates of various side-to-thickness ratios, under an applied load or surface potential.
