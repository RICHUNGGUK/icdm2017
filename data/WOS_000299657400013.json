We transform an RNA secondary structure into a linear structural sequence not only differentiating paired bases from free bases but also considering the hydrogen bonds between paired bases. We also propose two suitable distance pleasures based on both the linear structural sequences and RNA primary sequences using Lempel-Ziv complexity. The obtained pair distance matrix can be used to construct phylogenetic trees. The proposed approach does not require sequence alignment. The algorithm has successfully constructed phylogenies for nine 3'-terminal structures of viruses and three simulated second structures and phylogenies for 15 species of protozoa.", "paper_title": "Comparative Analysis of RNA Molecules", "paper_id": "WOS:000299657400013"}
