If we let u(n) = x(n)x(n-1) and v(n) = YnYn-1, then these systems can be viewed as special cases of the system of the form u(n+1) = f(v(n)), v(n+1) = g(u(n)). This system has applications in modeling population growth with age structure or the dynamics of plant-herbivore interaction. Let w(n) = v(2n), we have w(n+1) = f (g(w(n))) equivalent to h(w(n)). At a nonzero steady state w* of the last difference equation, we have vertical bar h '*)vertical bar = vertical bar f '(g(w*))g '(w*)vertical bar = 1, indicating that the system is degenerate at this steady state.", "paper_title": "Solutions and Properties of Some Degenerate Systems of Difference Equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000348558500011"}
