The development of machine vision devices at decreased costs, as well as their miniaturization and integration in industrial processes, have accelerated the use of 3D imaging systems in industry. In this paper we describe how to improve the performance of a 3D imaging system for inline dimensional quality inspection of long, flat-rolled metal products manufactured in rolling mills we designed and developed in previous works. Two dimensional characteristics of rolled products are measured by the system: width and flatness. The system is based on active triangulation using a single-line pattern projected onto the surface of the product under inspection for range image acquisition. Taking the system calibration into account the range images are transformed into a calibrated point cloud representing the 3D surface reconstruction of the product. Two approaches to improve the line detection and extraction method used in the original system are discussed, one intended for high-speed processing with lower accuracy, and the other providing high accuracy while incurring higher computational time expenses. A mechanism to remove, or at least reduce, the effects of product movements while manufacturing, such as bouncing and flapping, is also proposed to improve the performance of the system.
