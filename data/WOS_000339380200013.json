The GRRA scheme defines a green radio utility function, which is composed of the required transmission power, assigned modulation order, and the number of coordinated transmission nodes. By maximizing this utility function, the GRRA scheme can effectively save transmission power, enhance spectrum efficiency, and guarantee quality-of-service requirements. The simulation results show that when the traffic load intensity is greater than 0.7, the GRRA scheme can save transmission power by more than 33.9 and 40.1 %, as compared with the conventional adaptive radio resource allocation (ARRA) scheme (Tsai et al. in IEEE Trans Wireless Commun 7(5):1734-1743, 2008) with CoMP and the utility-based radio resource allocation (URRA) scheme (Katoozian et al. in IEEE Trans Wireless Commun 8(1):66-71, 2009) with CoMP, respectively. Besides, it enhances the system throughput by approximately 5.5 % and improves Jain's fairness index for best effort users by more than 155 % over these two ARRA and URRA schemes.", "paper_title": "A green radio resource allocation scheme for LTE-A downlink systems with CoMP transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000339380200013"}
