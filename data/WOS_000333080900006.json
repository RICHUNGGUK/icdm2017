There are various methods in the literature for carrying out this task. In this paper we describe a new implementation of a method based on interpolation at Leja points. We numerically compare this method with other codes from the literature. As we are interested in applications to exponential integrators we choose the test examples from spatial discretization of time dependent partial differential equations in two and three space dimensions. The test matrices thus have large eigenvalues and can be nonnormal.", "paper_title": "Comparison of software for computing the action of the matrix exponential", "paper_id": "WOS:000333080900006"}
