Amongst the most common is type abstraction, i.e. considering only well-typed runs of the protocol, therefore bounding message length. In this paper, we show how to get message boundedness \"for free\" under a reasonable (syntactic) assumption on protocols, in order to verify a variety of interesting security properties including secrecy and several authentication properties. This enables us to improve existing decidability results by restricting the search space for attacks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
