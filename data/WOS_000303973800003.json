The two dimensional model is a starting point for the three dimensional model of self-adaptive hp-FEM presented in the second part of this paper. A computational mesh is represented by a composite graph. The operations performed over the mesh are expressed by the graph grammar rules. The three dimensional model is based on the extension of the two dimensional model with rectangular finite elements. In the second part of this paper, we conclude the presentation with numerical examples concerning the generation of the optimal mesh for simulation of the Step-and-Flash Imprint Lithography (SFIL).", "paper_title": "A Graph Grammar Model of the hp Adaptive Three Dimensional Finite Element Method.
