Current cellular automata designs either focus on (i) ensuring desirable sequence properties such as maximum length period, balanced distribution of bits and uniform distribution of n-bit tuples, etc. or (ii) ensuring the generated sequences pass stringent randomness tests. In this work, important design patterns are first identified from the latter approach and then incorporated into cellular automata such that the desirable sequence properties are preserved like in the former approach. Preliminary experiment results show that the new cellular automata designed have potential in passing all DIEHARD tests.", "paper_title": "A transformation sequencing approach to pseudorandom number generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000251711800006"}
