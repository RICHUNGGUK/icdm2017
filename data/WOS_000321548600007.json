Enterprise digital rights management (E-DRM) is the application of DRM technology to prevent illegal users from accessing the confidential data of an enterprise. In 2010, Chang et al. proposed an efficient E-DRM scheme to solve the flaws of Chen's scheme. However, we still found some weaknesses in their scheme. In this article, we propose an improved secure and efficient E-DRM mechanism based on a one-way hash function and exclusive-or. Our mechanism overcomes the weaknesses in the scheme of Chang et al. and also reduces computation costs. In addition, we used BAN logic to show the correctness of our mechanism.
