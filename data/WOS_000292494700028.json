It is based on a discrete fracture representation. Three sets of applications are presented. In the first one, pressure drawdown well tests in closed oil reservoirs are simulated for complex model situations where the well intercepts a random fracture network with various fracture densities and conductivities. Then, the hydrodynamic response of a fractured aquifer is investigated by simulating on the field-scale single- or two-well pumping tests in the Poitiers Hydrological Experimental Site. Finally, a complete field-scale simulation of the production history in an oil reservoir with multiple wells is presented. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
