For each constrained model, the prior distribution of the model parameters is specified following the encompassing prior approach. Then, model selection is performed by using Bayes factors estimated through an importance sampling method. The approach is illustrated by three applications based on different datasets, which also include explanatory variables. In connection with one of these examples, a sensitivity analysis to the prior specification is also performed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
