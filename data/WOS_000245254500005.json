We consider the special case of these problems in which a parameter in (a positive integer) is given, indicating that each of the dimensions of the items to be packed is at most 1/m of the corresponding dimension of the recipient. We analyze the asymptotic performance of these algorithms and exhibit bounds that, to our knowledge, are the best known for this special case. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
