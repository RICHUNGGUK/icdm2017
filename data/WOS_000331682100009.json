In this paper, an alternative modelling method able to facilitate nonlinear recovery was developed for springback prediction. The nonlinear elastic recovery was processed using back-propagation networks in an artificial neural network (ANN). This approach is able to perform pattern recognition and create direct mapping of the elastically-driven change after plastic deformation. The FE program for the sheet metal springback experiment was carried out with the integration of ANN. The results obtained at the end of the FE analyses were found to have improved in comparison to the measured data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
