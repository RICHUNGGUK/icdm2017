The functionality of the package was enhanced. Now concomitant variable models as well as varying and constant parameters for the component specific generalized linear regression models can be fitted. The application of the package is demonstrated on several examples, the implementation described and examples given to illustrate how new drivers for the component specific models and the concomitant variable models can be de fined.", "paper_title": "FlexMix Version 2: Finite Mixtures with Concomitant Variables and Varying and Constant Parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000259947000001"}
