The approach uses parametric characterization of the traffic processes to derive two-moment approximations for performance measures at individual nodes. Based on these approximations, linkage equations are derived to establish the relationships between the various nodes in the network. These relationships result in a system of non-linear equations that is solved using an iterative procedure. Numerical studies comparing the performance of the approach with detailed simulations suggest that the approach yields fairly accurate estimates of performance measures without significant computational complexity.
