Yu and Gong recently found any binary sequence of period 4N with optimal autocorrelation value constructed from an almost difference set by Arasu et al. is an N x 4 interleaved sequence for which all four columns in its N x 4 array are shift equivalent up to the complement. We found that it is not necessary that four columns are shift equivalent. Instead, it could be a pair of related sequences together with their shifts as the column sequences. The first construction is to use a generalized GMW sequence of period N = 2(2k) -1 and its modified version, the second construction is to use a twin prime sequence of length N = p(p + 2) and its modified version, and the third construction, a pair of Legendre sequences of period N = p(p odd prime) with their respective first terms complementary (the 2-level autocorrelation property is not needed for the Legendre sequence). The comparison with the known constructions are given. For the new sequences with optimal autocorrelation value, their corresponding new almost difference sets are also derived.", "paper_title": "New Constructions of Binary Sequences With Optimal Autocorrelation Value/Magnitude", "paper_id": "WOS:000275561000028"}
