It was first proposed by Chaum in 1988. Till now, engineers have provided many improvements to enhance the security and functionality of the e-check system. The face value of a check and the identification of a payee, however, have to be determined previously in these improved versions. This results in the inflexibility of the system. In this paper, we aim to propose a novel e-check mechanism which allows a payer attaching the face value and the information of a payee to an e-check when dealing with a transaction. The security of this novel system is based on several cryptographic techniques including the secure one-way hash function, blind signature, and RSA cryptosystems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
