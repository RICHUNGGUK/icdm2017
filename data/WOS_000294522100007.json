A new verifiable threshold decryption scheme without trusted center was proposed in this paper. In order to publicly verify the identity of decryption member, the scheme forces the member to submit a commitment at the beginning of the process. Moreover, the scheme has several advantages such as cheat-proof and dynamic member revoking.", "paper_title": "A NEW VERIFIABLE THRESHOLD DECRYPTION SCHEME WITHOUT TRUSTED CENTER", "paper_id": "WOS:000294522100007"}
