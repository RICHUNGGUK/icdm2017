Design/methodology/approach - A survey research approach was employed to achieve overall aim and following three objectives of this research: to identify initial items that may help to explain the broadband adoption behaviour and determine them employing an exploratory survey approach; to confirm the representativeness of items to a particular construct domain employing content validity approach; and finally, to test the instrument in order to confirm the reliability of items and construct validity. Findings - The final outcome of the instrument development process that culminated from the confirmatory study was a parsimonious, 39-item instrument, consisting of ten scales, all with acceptable levels of content validity, reliability and construct validity. Practical implications - The developed instrument is relevant to both academic and practitioner communities who hold a particular interest in the study and management of broadband adoption from the household consumer perspective. Originality/value - The most conspicuous contribution of the paper is to provide a reliable instrument that is fundamental to measure the household consumer's perceptions of adopting broadband internet.", "paper_title": "Development of a survey instrument to examine consumer adoption of broadband", "paper_id": "WOS:000239331700006"}
