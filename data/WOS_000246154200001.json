The mathematical model takes into account stochastic disturbances acting on the load suspension point. The proposed approach allows solution of the problem of optimal control with minimization of oscillation and control power expenditure. The evolution of the system solution with time is investigated for various disturbance intensities. Computer calculation results are presented as a function of the suspension length and the intensity of stochastic disturbances.", "paper_title": "Stochastic control of helicopter suspended load position", "paper_id": "WOS:000246154200001"}
