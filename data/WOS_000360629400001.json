Confusion is reflected in nonlinearity of certain Boolean functions describing the cryptographic transformation. In this paper, we present two Boolean functions which have low Walsh spectra and high nonlinearity. In the proof of the nonlinearity, a new method for evaluating some exponential sums over finite fields is provided.", "paper_title": "Two Boolean Functions with Five-Valued Walsh Spectra and High Non linearity", "paper_id": "WOS:000360629400001"}
