The exterior calculus notation provides a guide to which finite element spaces should be used for which physical variables, and unifies a number of desirable properties. We present two formulations: a \"primal\" formulation in which the finite element spaces are defined on a single mesh, and a \"primal-dual\" formulation in which finite element spaces on a dual mesh are also used. Both formulations have velocity and layer depth as prognostic variables, but the exterior calculus framework leads to a conserved diagnostic potential vorticity. In both formulations we show how to construct discretisations that have mass-consistent (constant potential vorticity stays constant), stable and oscillation-free potential vorticity advection.
