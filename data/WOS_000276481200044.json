There are various coding schemes for transforming class labels into response scores. An equivalence notion of coding schemes is developed, and the regression approach is adopted for extracting a low-dimensional discriminant feature subspace. This feature subspace can be a linear subspace of the column span of original input data or kernel-mapped feature data. The classification training and prediction are carried out in this feature subspace using a linear classifier, which lead to a simple and computationally light but yet powerful toolkit for classification. Experimental results, including prediction ability and CPU time comparison with LIBSVM, show that the regression-based approach is a competent alternative for the multiclass problem.
