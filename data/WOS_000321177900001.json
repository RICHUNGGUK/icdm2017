In order to achieve realistic scenes, buildings, urban furniture and street road-ways should be modeled automatically also considering the slope of steep streets. A texturing process by hand which takes into account all the urban elements of a city is an impracticable task, especially if quality results are required. In this paper we propose an automatic method for building texturization in entire urban models using a small set of images. The different features of lower and upper parts of buildings are considered by implementing two different genetic algorithms. Our method can be used in cities with both horizontal and steep streets because the street slope is processed by the algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
