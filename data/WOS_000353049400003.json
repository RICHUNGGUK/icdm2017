However, the parsing algorithm they propose is not directly applicable to Feature-Based TAGs (FB-TAG). We provide a recognition algorithm for FB-TAG that supports both dependent and independent derivations. The resulting algorithm combines the benefits of independent derivations with those of Feature-Based grammars. In particular, we show that it accounts for a range of interactions between dependent vs. independent derivation on the one hand, and syntactic constraints, linear ordering, and scopal vs. nonscopal semantic dependencies on the other hand.", "paper_title": "Multiple Adjunction in Feature-Based Tree-Adjoining Grammar", "paper_id": "WOS:000353049400003"}
