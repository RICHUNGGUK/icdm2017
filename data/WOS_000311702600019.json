Our main contribution is a low complexity scheme that relies on erasure coding techniques for achieving prescribed levels of confidentiality and reliability. Using matrices that have no singular square submatrices, we subject the original data to a linear transformation. The resulting coded symbols are then stored in different networks. This scheme allows users with access to a threshold number of networks to reconstruct perfectly the original data, while ensuring that eavesdroppers with access to any number of networks smaller than this threshold are unable to decode any of the original symbols. This holds even if the attackers are able to guess some of the missing symbols. We further quantify the achievable level of security, and analyze the complexity of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Coding for Trusted Storage in Untrusted Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000311702600019"}
