This letter proposes an enhanced process to improve the throughput performance of LR-WPANs under the losses of beacon frames. The key idea of our proposed enhancement is to make devices that have not received a beacon frame, due to packet loss, to transmit their data in the contention period and even in the inactive period instead of holding pending frames during the whole superframe period. The proposed protocol is evaluated using mathematical analysis as well as simulations, and the throughput improvement of LR-WPANs is proved.", "paper_title": "Enhancing IEEE 802.15.4-Based Wireless Networks to Handle Loss of Beacon Frames", "paper_id": "WOS:000368904200034"}
