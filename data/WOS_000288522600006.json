An authenticated encryption scheme can be used to protect valuable information or secret, data for data confidentiality, authentication, non-repudiation and integrity. In this paper, the authors propose a new supervising authenticated encryption scheme for multilevel security which deals with the monitor and access control problems found in hierarchical organization, for protecting valuable authenticated encryption messages from being disclosed by malicious adversary. The proposed scheme provides two effective access control mechanisms, one is the partial access control and the other is the complete access control, which allows management superiors to monitor or access authenticated encryption messages received by inferiors within a hierarchical organization. Considering user privacy, the partial access control mechanism allows only a superior to access the \"intended\" authenticated encrypted information. In case of some special scenario (e.g., the monitored inferior is dead or dismissed), the complete access control mechanism allows the superior to access \"all\" authenticated encrypted messages received by the monitored inferior.", "paper_title": "A SUPERVISING AUTHENTICATED ENCRYPTION SCHEME FOR MULTILEVEL SECURITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000288522600006"}
