The discrete nature of the problem, along with complex timing models, stringent design constraints, and ever-increasing circuit sizes, make the problem very difficult to tackle. Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) is an effective technique to handle complex constrained optimization problems and therefore has been successfully applied to solve the gate sizing problem. This article proposes an improved Lagrangian relaxation formulation for discrete gate sizing that relaxes timing, maximum gate input slew, and maximum gate output capacitance constraints. Based on such formulation, we propose a hybrid technique composed of three steps. First, a topological greedy heuristic solves the LR formulation. Such a heuristic is applied assuming a slightly increased target clock period (backoff factor) to better explore the solution space. Second, a delay recovery heuristic reestablishes the original target clock with small power overhead. Third, a power recovery heuristic explores the remaining slacks to further reduce power. Experiments on the ISPD 2012 Contest benchmarks show that our hybrid technique provides less leakage power than the state-of-the-art work for every circuit from the ISPD 2012 Contest infrastructure, achieving up to 24% less leakage. In addition, our technique achieves a much better compromise between leakage reduction and runtime, obtaining, on average, 9% less leakage power while running 8.8 times faster.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid Technique for Discrete Gate Sizing Based on Lagrangian Relaxation", "paper_id": "WOS:000341232600009"}
