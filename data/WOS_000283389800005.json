Then, by integrating the hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) and the proposed LMI-based sufficient conditions, a new integrative approach is presented to find the output feedback controllers of the linear systems with both time-varying elemental and norm-bounded parameter uncertainties such that the control objective of minimizing a quadratic integral performance criterion subject to the stability robustness constraint is achieved A design example of the robust-optimal output feedback controller for the AFTI/F-16 aircraft control system with the time-varying elemental parameter uncertainties is given to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed new integrative approach 2010 Elsevier Inc All lights reserved", "paper_title": "Design of robust-optimal output feedback controllers for linear uncertain systems using LMI-based approach and genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000283389800005"}
