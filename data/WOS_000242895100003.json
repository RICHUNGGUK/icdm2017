In this article, the authors present their work on the design of an artificial intelligence (Al) framework for the bots in military operations on urbanized terrain (MOUT) simulations. Their framework is designed to be flexible, extensible, integrable, and independent of simulation platforms. For fast prototyping, the Al framework is implemented on the Unreal Tournament (UT) game engine. A case study has been conducted that shows that the framework is effective and efficient in generating realistic bot behaviors in various combat scenarios.", "paper_title": "Behavior representation and simulation for military operations on urbanized terrain", "paper_id": "WOS:000242895100003"}
