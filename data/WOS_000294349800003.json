A maximum likelihood training procedure was developed to estimate model parameters from training data. In this paper, we extend the above-mentioned work by using minimum classification error (MCE) training to improve recognition accuracy and using both split vector quantization and scalar quantization techniques to further compress model parameters. Experimental results on a handwritten character recognition task with a vocabulary of 2,965 Kanji characters demonstrate that MCE-trained and compressed PCGM-based classifiers can achieve much higher recognition accuracies than their counterparts based on traditional modified quadratic discriminant function (MQDF) when the footprint of the classifiers has to be made very small, e.g., less than 2 MB.", "paper_title": "Building compact recognizers of handwritten Chinese characters using precision constrained Gaussian model, minimum classification error training and parameter compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000294349800003"}
