Such visualizations are of great value in an educational environment, e.g., for the demonstration of flow physics and concepts to students and/or laypersons. Time-resolved visualizations offer further possibilities to demonstrate graphically the difference between what is seen with the naked eye and what is revealed in a visualization. .", "paper_title": "Schlieren imaging and the real world", "paper_id": "WOS:000321872600006"}
