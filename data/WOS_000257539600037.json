Two independent edge plasma codes are coupled to this purpose: B2 (with a detailed physics content but intrinsic geometrical limitations due to the 5-point computational scheme) for the inner region of the Scrape-Off Layer (the so-called near SOL) and ASPOEL (with simplified physics content but larger geometrical flexibility thanks to the Control Volume Finite Element CVFE scheme) for the outer region (the far SOL). The two codes share information across an interface magnetic surface, representing the outer boundary for B2 and the inner boundary for ASPOEL. An iterative procedure is developed, ensuring the continuity of profiles and fluxes at the interface. The radial profiles of density and temperature computed at the outboard mid-plane across the complete SOL, up to the first wall, are in good agreement with experimental data. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
