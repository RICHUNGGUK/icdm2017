The scheme is of strong order one half and A-stable in mean square. The combination with this and the projection method shows good performance in numerical experiments dealing with an alternative formulation of the chemical Langevin equation for a human ether a-go-go related gene ion channel model.", "paper_title": "A stochastic exponential Euler scheme for simulation of stiff biochemical reaction systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000346656400009"}
