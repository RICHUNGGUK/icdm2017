This method groups an application's operation modes into application scenarios and describes how to incorporate them in the overall design process. An automated scenario-based design trajectory reduces the energy consumption of a streaming application running on a single processor platform via dynamic voltage and frequency scaling.", "paper_title": "Application Scenarios in Streaming-Oriented Embedded-System Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000261394400009"}
