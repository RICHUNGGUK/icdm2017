Especially in early stages of technology development, user preferences and values are not adequately considered, which might even have a negative impact on acceptance issues. The aim of this study was the implementation of a quantified understanding of user needs in terms of values into the system design process of cell-phone processors. Moreover, we aimed for an extension of the engineering's trade-off analysis by using conjoint analysis in order to investigate trade-offs between specific device characteristics. Finally, our aim was the evaluation of empirically based user-oriented research methods. Results of the first study revealed that battery life, speech quality, signal quality and data-transmission rate are the most important device characteristics. Results from conjoint analysis indicated a clear trade-off between battery life and the three other characteristics. Moreover, this research demonstrated that technology acceptance research benefits considerably from an interdisciplinary and multi-method approach. Besides, implementing the users' preferences into early stages of the product development process offers several advantages concerning effectiveness as well as economic aspects of development.
