Evaluation results demonstrate that SOD is effective in treating oral diseases. It is found also that SOD and SOD-containing complex enzyme are proven treatments for certain types of oral diseases. The effects of some applications are compared and discussed.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy modeling of the medical treatment effects of superoxide dismutase", "paper_id": "WOS:000241201000008"}
