In contemporary restorative techniques, bonding to Dentine is created by the impregnation of the demineralised dentine by blends of resin monomers. In this paper, a numerical model of dentinal infiltration is proposed. The aim is to follow the resin front and to point out the optimal parameter set. The main tool is a level set technique to follow the evolving interface. It is coupled with the Navier-Stokes equation where capillary effect gives rise to the appearance of a new term in the variational approach than discretised by finite elements. Using an appropriate geometry representing demineralised dentine, the moving front is observed. First, a simulation of porosimetry test is achieved in order to validate the model. The two expected pore sizes are detected and the simulation also points out limitations of mercury intrusion porosimetry test in an educational way. Then a wetting fluid (representing the dental resin) is numerically infiltrated. In the dentinal porous network, capillarity is taken into account in our model by including a capillary term. A crucial conclusion is drawn from this study: resin application time by practitioners is sufficient if, in the infiltration process, the wetting phase is the resin.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional pore-scale modelling of dentinal infiltration", "paper_id": "WOS:000334156900006"}
