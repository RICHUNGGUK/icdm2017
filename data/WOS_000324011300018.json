It is difficult to identify the status of the filtration simply from sensor reading: in addition, some observation data cannot be obtained online but from the lab test. In this research, the ultrasonic detection of the local region of the membrane is proposed. The wavelet packet transform is used for feature extraction of the reflection signal. Principal component analysis with Gaussian smoothing is then used to classify the data and C4.5 is used to construct the diagnosis system for filtration processes. The proposed method applied to a degummed process of vegetable oil shows a good performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
