The algorithm uses soft data clusters to produce a soft classification containing inherently more information than a comparable hard classification at an increased computational cost. Previous work suggests that similar algorithms achieve good parallel scalability, motivating the parallel algorithm development work here. Experimental results of applying parallel CIGSCR to an image with approximately 10(8) pixels and six bands demonstrate superlinear speedup. A soft two class classification is generated in just over 4 min using 32 processors.
