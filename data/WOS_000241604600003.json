This filter is intended to be used in a zero-IF W-CDMA receiver between the LNA and the mixer. BAWs resonators turn out to be very attractive and competitive components thanks to their high Q-factor at high frequencies. Moreover, BAW technology, unlike Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) technology, is compatible with Silicon process technology and allows a considerable reduction of the circuit area. However, because of its stacked structure and the thin thickness of materials to deposit, such devices are sensitive to process. They also suffer from temperature dispersions. The presented filter offers a reduced sensitivity to process and temperature variations thanks to its tunability. It allows correcting thermal and process dispersions on the piezoelectric layer of the BAW devices. The tuning is achieved through additional passive components (Q-enhanced inductance and varicaps). Simulations exhibit a tuning range of 1.4% for a 2.4 mA current consumption at 2 GHz. Good in-band linearity and noise performances have also been simulated.", "paper_title": "A novel architecture of a tunable bandpass BAW-filter for a WCDMA transceiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000241604600003"}
