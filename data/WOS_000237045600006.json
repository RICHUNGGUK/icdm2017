Our rules operate on a representation of the states of affairs of a multi-agent system. We define the syntax and semantics of our rules and an interpreter; we achieve greater precision and expressiveness by allowing constraints to be part of our rules. We show how the rules and states come together in a distributed architecture in which a team of administrative agents employ a tuple space to guide the execution of a multi-agent system.", "paper_title": "A distributed architecture for norm-aware agent societies", "paper_id": "WOS:000237045600006"}
