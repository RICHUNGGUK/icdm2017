In this paper, we first show that their cross-correlation functions are closely related to Jacobi sums and cyclotomic numbers. We then derive the cross-correlation distribution of constant multiple sequences of an M-ary power residue sequence. In the case of constant multiple sequences of an M-ary Sidel'nikov sequence, we get the possible cross-correlation values whose occurrence numbers are expressed in terms of the cyclotomic numbers of order M and are possibly zero.", "paper_title": "On the Cross-Correlation Distributions of M-ary Multiplicative Character Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000265713000033"}
