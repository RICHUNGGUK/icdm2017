A complex dynamic model of the reactor-regenerator-fractionator system is developed and subsequently used in the controller. The novelty of the model consists in that besides the complex dynamics of the reactor-regenerator system, it also includes the dynamic model of the fractionator, as well as a five lumps kinetic model for the riser. Tight control is achieved using the QIHNMPC approach. The MHE-NMPC considers important features of a real-time control algorithm, resulting in a framework for practical NMPC implementation, such as: state and parameter estimation and efficient solution of the optimisation problem. In the NMPC approach, only measurements available in practice are considered, whereas the rest of the states are estimated together with uncertain model parameters, via MHE technique. Using an efficient numerical implementation based on the multiple shooting algorithm real-time feasibility of the approach is achieved. The incentives of the proposed approaches are assessed on the simulated industrial FCCU. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
