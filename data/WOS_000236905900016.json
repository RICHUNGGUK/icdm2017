As a proof format it has very remarkable properties that we plan to study in future works. In this paper we embed it with a rendering semantics that provides explanations in pseudo-natural language of its proof terms, in the spirit of the work of Yarm Coscoy [3] for the lambda-calculus. The rendering semantics unveils the richness of the calculus that allows to preserve several proof structures that are identified when encoded in the lambda-calculus.", "paper_title": "Explanation in natural language of lambda mu mu-terms", "paper_id": "WOS:000236905900016"}
