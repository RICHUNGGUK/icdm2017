This article presents the software D-Compress, which computes the gas and melt volatile composition of five element sets in magmatic systems (O-H, S-O-H, C-S-O-H, C-S-O-H-Fe, and C-O-H). It has been calibrated so as to simulate the volatiles coexisting with three common types of silicate melts (basalt, phonolite, and rhyolite). Operational temperatures depend on melt composition and range from 790 to 1400 degrees C. A specificity of D-Compress is the calculation of volatile composition as pressure varies along a (de)compression path between atmospheric and 3000 bars. This software was prepared so as to maximize versatility by proposing different sets of input parameters. In particular, whenever new solubility laws on specific melt compositions are available, the model parameters can be easily tuned to run the code on that composition. Parameter gaps were minimized by including sets of chemical species for which calibration data were available over a wide range of pressure, temperature, and melt composition. A brief description of the model rationale is followed by the presentation of the software capabilities. Examples of use are then presented with outputs comparisons between D-Compress and other currently available thermodynamical models. The compiled software and the source code are available as electronic supplementary materials.
