Maintenance of connectivity and exchange of data require an efficient way to manage the devices. Distributed beaconing defined by ECMA-368 is used to manage the network in fully distributed fashion. All the devices must acquire a unique beacon slot, with the beacon period accessed using a slotted Aloha scheme. In this paper, we study the efficiency of distributed beaconing in the presence of newcomer devices forming a closed system. Efficiency is measured in terms of energy consumption and network setup delay. ECMA-368 defines two distinct phases: extension and contraction. Both phases are analyzed with particular emphasis on the extension phase by means of an absorbing Markov chain model. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a systematic approach to model distributed beaconing by formulating two equivalent urn occupancy problems of the extension and contraction phases; 2) the use of exponential generating functions to obtain closed-form expressions of the transition probabilities of the absorbing Markov chain; and 3) comparison to computer simulations based on Opnet modeling and with the preexisting literature.", "paper_title": "An Urn Occupancy Approach for Modeling the Energy Consumption of Distributed Beaconing", "paper_id": "WOS:000331966900016"}
