Unlike the core introduced by Aubin in 1981, the core configuration has an inherently inessential games property. Moreover, we propose a necessary and sufficient condition to investigate the non-emptiness of the core configuration. Based on the properties of consistency and its converse, an axiomatization of the core configuration is also proposed.", "paper_title": "The core configuration for fuzzy games", "paper_id": "WOS:000345981600026"}
