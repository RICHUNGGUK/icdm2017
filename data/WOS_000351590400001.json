Home energy management systems (HEMS) have been introduced especially in private home domains to support users in managing and controlling energy consuming devices. Recent studies have shown that informing users about their habits with appliances as well as their usage pattern can help to achieve energy reduction in private households. This requires instruments able tomonitor energy consumption at fine grain level and provide this information to consumers. While the most existing approaches for load disaggregation and classification require high-frequencymonitoring data, in this paperwe propose an approach that exploits low-frequencymonitoring data gathered by meters (i.e., Smart Plugs) displaced in the home. Moreover, while the most existing works dealing with appliance classification delegate the classification task to a remote central server, we propose a distributed approach where data processing and appliance recognition are performed locally in the Home Gateway. Our approach is based on a distributed load monitoring system made of Smart Plugs attached to devices and connected to a Home Gateway via the ZigBee protocol. The Home Gateway is based on the OSGi platform, collects data from home devices, and hosts both data processing and user interaction logic.", "paper_title": "Appliance Recognition in an OSGi-Based Home Energy Management Gateway", "paper_id": "WOS:000351590400001"}
