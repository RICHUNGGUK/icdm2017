The algorithm consists of rotated principal component analysis (RPCA), modified amplitude thresholding with respect to the histograms of the PC planes and final filtering with a neural network. The proposed algorithm achieves an average detection rate of 96% and is very robust to variations ill the image quality.", "paper_title": "Traffic Light Detection Using Rotated Principal Component Analysis for Video-Based Car Navigation System", "paper_id": "WOS:000262010400015"}
