The Z(p,q) index, for a real number for p # 0, is defined as Z(p,q) = Z(p,q) (G) = Sigma(uv is an element of E(G)) M-p (d(u), d(v))/M-q (d(u), d(v)), where M-p (d(u), d(v)) = ((d(u))(p) + (d(v))(p)/2)(1/p) and d(u) is the degree of the vertex u. The Z(p,q) index is a generalization of the geometric arithmetic index. In this paper, some relations between Z(p,q), Randic, and Zagreb indices are presented.", "paper_title": "Some Generalizations of the Geometric-Arithmetic Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000301817800017"}
