The selection of the pair of routes that maximizes the connectivity of a node is not an easy problem, because such connectivity cannot be expressed as an additive function of the availability of links and nodes in the path pairs. Previous algorithms for searching the optimal route use additive costs, which can be a loose assumption either when high failure rates can be locally present, or when fully disjoints paths do not exist. In this paper, we construct a Bayesian network to encode the probabilistic relation between the connectivity of a node and the availability of nodes and links. The problem of selecting an optimal pair of routes becomes equivalent to optimizing the structure of the Bayesian network. By introducing appropriate approximations on the double route availability equations, we propose a new algorithm, which outperforms other classical methods when there are sporadic high error rate elements in the network. Simulations and an application example in an electric transport telecontrol network show the performance of the method when compared to standard search.", "paper_title": "Optimal Double Route Search in a Telecommunication Network: A Telecontrol Network Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000287861400036"}
