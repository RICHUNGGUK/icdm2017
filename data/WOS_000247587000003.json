The combination of MLP with OGMM produces a, hybrid model with high recognition accuracy as well as ail excellent outlier rejection ability. Experimental results show that the proposed model can satisfy the requirements of Chinese bank check printed numeral recognition where high recognition accuracy, high processing speed, and high reliability are needed.", "paper_title": "An MLP-orthogonal Gaussian mixture model hybrid model for Chinese bank check printed numeral recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000247587000003"}
