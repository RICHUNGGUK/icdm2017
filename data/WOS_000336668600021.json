In this structure, a communications network is combined with the power grid in order to gather information that can be used to increase the efficiency of the grid, reduce power consumption, and improve the reliability of services, among other numerous advantages. SG communication networks are unique in their large scale and the limited capabilities of nodes which present several challenges in the design of efficient routing protocols. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the main networking challenges present in the design of SG communication networks, and some of the important routing protocols proposed to address those challenges. Various technologies and architectures proposed for routing in SGs are discussed. A detailed comparison of the protocols considered in this paper is also given, and key areas that require further investigation are highlighted.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Networking Challenges and Routing Protocols in Smart Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600021"}
