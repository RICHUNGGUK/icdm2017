To this end, a specification should be thoroughly verified in manifold perspectives such as grammar/syntax conformance, design compliance, and canonical semantics accordance. A single hand-woven testbed implementation will fail to versatilely support such a variety of testings. In this paper, we propose a novel validation tool of XML documents using an expert system and open validation rule scripts. Particularly, we illustrate a web-based implementation to ensure an XML schema's design compliance to design and naming rules (NDR), namely a quality of schema design (QoD) test.
