The primary objective of chat message characterization is to understand the proper-ties of chat messages for effective message analysis, such as message topic detection. Design/methodology/approach - From the study on chat message characteristics, an indicative term-based categorization approach for chat topic detection is proposed. In the proposed approach, different techniques such as sessionalisation of chat messages and extraction of features from icon texts and URLs are incorporated for message pre-processing. Naive Bayes, Associative Classification, and Support Vector Machine are employed as classifiers for categorizing topics from chat sessions. Findings - Indicative term-based approach is superior to the traditional document frequency based approach, for feature selection in chat topic categorization. Originality/value - This paper studies the characteristics of chat messages and proposes an indicative term-based categorization approach for chat topic detection.", "paper_title": "Structural analysis of chat messages for topic detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000242100100003"}
