In this paper, we propose a novel bottom-up saliency model for detecting salient objects in natural images. First, inspired by the recent advance in the realm of statistical thermodynamics, we adopt a novel mathematical model, namely, the maximal entropy random walk (MERW) to measure saliency. We analyze the rationality and superiority of MERW for modeling visual saliency. Then, based on the MERW model, we establish a generic framework for saliency detection. Different from the vast majority of existing saliency models, our method is built on a purely region-based strategy, which is able to yield high-resolution saliency maps with well preserved object shapes and uniformly highlighted salient regions. In the proposed framework, the input image is first over-segmented into superpixels, which are taken as the primary units for subsequent procedures, and regional features are extracted. Then, saliency is measured according to two principles, i.e., uniqueness and visual organization, both implemented in a unified approach, i.e., the MERW model based on graph representation. Intensive experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art saliency models.", "paper_title": "Maximal Entropy Random Walk for Region-Based Visual Saliency", "paper_id": "WOS:000342227500015"}
