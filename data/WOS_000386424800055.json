To provide data security, sensitive data is encrypted by the DO before it is uploaded to the SR. Compared to existing secure query processing systems like CryptDB [7] and MONOMI [8], in which data operations (e.g., comparison or addition) are supported by specialized encryption schemes, our demo system, SDB, is implemented based on a set of data-interoperable secure operators, i.e., the output of an operator can be used as input of another operator. As a result, SDB can support a wide range of complex queries (e.g., all TPC-H queries) efficiently. In this demonstration, we show how our SDB prototype supports secure query processing on complex workload like TPC-H. We also demonstrate how our system protects sensitive information from malicious attackers.", "paper_title": "SDB: A Secure Query Processing System with Data Interoperability", "paper_id": "WOS:000386424800055"}
