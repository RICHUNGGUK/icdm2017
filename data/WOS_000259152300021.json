The HCRNF system integrates a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to recognize handwritten characters. It employs an RNN to effectively extract oriented features of a handwritten character, and then, these features are applied to create an PIS which can powerfully estimate the similarity ratings between a recognized character and sampling characters in the character database. Experimental results demonstrate that the HCRNF system achieves a satisfying recognition performance.", "paper_title": "Handwritten character recognition using a neuro-fuzzy system", "paper_id": "WOS:000259152300021"}
