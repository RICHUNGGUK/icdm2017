However, the tuning procedure of the ADRC parameters is very complicated due to its reliance on the human experiences. Therefore, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is introduced to regularize the ADRC parameters automatically on line. Simulation results indicate that the algorithm above is feasible.", "paper_title": "Auto-disturbance-rejection controller design based on RBF neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400060"}
