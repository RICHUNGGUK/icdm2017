The proposed method, which is based on Retinex theory and total variational framework, improves the original variational method by using a TV penalty term to force spatial smoothness on the reflectance image. The split Bregman algorithm is employed to solve the proposed model. By practical experiments, it is verified that our method obtains better enhancement performance and much better calculation efficiency.", "paper_title": "A fast algorithm for color image enhancement with total variation regularization", "paper_id": "WOS:000281150500020"}
