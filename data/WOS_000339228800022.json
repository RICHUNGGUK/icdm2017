And all kinds of analysis based on them have to be substituted by coarse interpolations. So both accuracy and reliability of the traditional framework for visualization and analysis of volumetric data are far from our needs of digging information implied in volumetric data fields. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on a C2-continuous seven-directional box spline, under which reconstruction is of high accuracy and differential computations relative to analysis based on the reconstruction model are accurate. We introduce a polynomial differential operator to improve the reconstruction accuracy. In order to settle the difficulty of evaluating upon the seven-directional box spline, we convert it into Bezier form and propose effective theories and algorithms of extracting iso-surfaces, critical points and curvatures. Plentiful of examples are also given in this paper to illustrate that the novel framework is suitable for analysis, the improved reconstruction method has high accuracy, and our algorithms are fast and stable.", "paper_title": "Volumetric data modeling and analysis based on seven-directional box spline", "paper_id": "WOS:000339228800022"}
