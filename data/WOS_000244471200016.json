Timed circuits are a class of asynchronous circuits that are optimized using explicit timing information. In asynchronous circuits, correct operation requires that there are no hazards in the circuit implementation. Therefore, when designing an asynchronous circuit, each internal node and output of the circuit must be verified for hazard-freedom to ensure correct operation. Current verification algorithms for timed circuits require an explicit state exploration that often results in state explosion for even modest-sized examples. The goal of this paper is to abstract the behavior of internal nodes and utilize this information to make a conservative determination of hazard-freedom for each node in the circuit. Experimental results indicate that this approach is substantially more efficient than existing timing verification tools. These results also indicate that this method scales well for large examples that could not be previously analyzed, in that it is capable of analyzing these circuits in less than a second. While this method is conservative in that some false hazards may be reported, our results indicate that their number is small.", "paper_title": "Efficient verification of hazard-freedom in gate-level timed asynchronous circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000244471200016"}
