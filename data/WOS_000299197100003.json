In the present work, we have developed robust conformation-independent fragment-based quantitative structure-activity and structure-selectivity relationship models for a series of quinolines and cinnolines as potent modulators of the two LXR sub-types. The generated models were then used to predict the potency of an external test set and the predicted values were in good agreement with the experimental results, indicating the potential of the models for untested compounds. The final 2D molecular recognition patterns obtained were integrated to 3D structure-based molecular modeling studies to provide useful insights into the chemical and structural determinants for increased LXR beta binding affinity and selectivity.
