Typically, alpha is an element of (1,3]. This problem is important in optimizing the energy consumption of networks. To address this problem, we propose a randomized oblivious routing algorithm. An oblivious routing algorithm makes decisions independently of the current traffic in the network. This feature enables the efficient implementation of our algorithm in a distributed manner, which is desirable for large-scale high-capacity networks. An important feature of our work is that our algorithm can satisfy the integral constraint, which requires that each traffic request Rk should follow a single path. We prove that, given this constraint, no randomized oblivious routing algorithm can guarantee a competitive ratio bounded by o(vertical bar E vertical bar(alpha-1/alpha+1)). By contrast, our approach provides a competitive ratio of O(vertical bar E vertical bar(alpha-1/alpha+1) log(2 alpha/alpha+1) vertical bar V vertical bar . log(alpha-1) D), where D is the maximum demand of traffic requests. Furthermore, our results also hold for a more general case where the objective is to minimize Sigma(e)(l(e))(p), where p >= I is an arbitrary unknown parameter with a given upper bound alpha >1. The theoretical results established in proving these bounds can be further generalized to a framework of designing and analyzing oblivious integral routing algorithms, which is significant for research on minimizing Sigma(e)(l(e))(alpha) in specific scenarios with simplified problem settings. For instance, we prove that this framework can generate an oblivious integral routing algorithm whose competitive ratio can be bounded by O(log(alpha) vertical bar V vertical bar . log(alpha-1) D and O(log(3 alpha) vertical bar V vertical bar . log(alpha-1) D) on expanders and hypercubes, respectively.
