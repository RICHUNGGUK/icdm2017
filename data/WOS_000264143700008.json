After recalling the Aumann type definition of stochastic integral, we shall introduce a new definition of Lebesgue integral of a set-valued stochastic process with respect to the time t. Finally we shall prove the presentation theorem of set-valued stochastic integral and discuss further properties that will be useful to study set-valued stochastic differential equations with their applications.", "paper_title": "SET-VALUED STOCHASTIC LEBESGUE INTEGRAL AND REPRESENTATION THEOREMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000264143700008"}
