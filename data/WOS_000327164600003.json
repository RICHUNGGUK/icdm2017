The MBL equation describes two-phase flow in porous media, and it differs from the classical Buckley-Leverett (BL) equation by including a balanced diffusive-dispersive combination. The classical BL equation gives a monotone water saturation profile for any Riemann problem; on the contrast, when the dispersive parameter is large enough, the MBL equation delivers non-monotone water saturation profiles for certain Riemann problems as suggested by the experimental observations. Numerical results in this paper confirm the existence of non-monotone water saturation profiles consisting of constant states separated by shocks. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
