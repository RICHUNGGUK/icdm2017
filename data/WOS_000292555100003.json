Moreover, diversity in the population is enabled by means of the receptor editing process. The Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA) in its canonical form and its various versions are used to solve different types of problems and are reported to perform better compared with other heuristics (i.e., genetic algorithms, neural networks, etc.) in some cases, such as function optimization and pattern recognition. Although the studies related with CSA are increasingly popular, according to our best knowledge, there is no study summarizing the basic features of these algorithms, hybrid algorithms, and the application areas of these algorithms all in one paper. Therefore, this study aims to summarize the powerful characteristics and general review of CSA. In addition, CSA based hybrid algorithms are reviewed, and open research areas are discussed for further research.", "paper_title": "A review of clonal selection algorithm and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000292555100003"}
