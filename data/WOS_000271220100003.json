This paper presents a new algorithm based on the explicit computation of the coordinates and radii of Euclidean Voronoi diagram vertices for a set of spheres. The algorithm is further applied to compute the Voronoi diagram with a specified precision in a fixed length floating-point arithmetic. The algorithm is implemented using the EC Library (Exact Computation Library) and tested on the example of a 3-dimensional Voronoi diagram of a set of spheres.", "paper_title": "AN EXPLICIT SOLUTION FOR COMPUTING THE VERTICES OF THE EUCLIDEAN d-DIMENSIONAL VORONOI DIAGRAM OF SPHERES IN A FLOATING-POINT ARITHMETIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000271220100003"}
