We choose a known bipartite pure state vertical bar Psi > as an alternative hypothesis and the completely mixed state as a null hypothesis. As a result, we analytically derive an optimal type-2 error and an optimal positive operator valued measure (POVM) for one-way local operations and classical communication (LOCC) POVM and separable POVM. For two-way LOCC POVM, we study a family of simple three-step LOCC protocols, and show that the best protocol in this family has strictly better performance than any one-way LOCC protocol in low-dimensional systems when there may exist differences between two-way LOCC POVM and one-way LOCC POVM.", "paper_title": "Local Hypothesis Testing Between a Pure Bipartite State and the White Noise State", "paper_id": "WOS:000368420200037"}
