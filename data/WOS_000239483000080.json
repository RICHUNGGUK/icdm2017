With global histogram equalization (GHE), the image is enhanced as a whole, and this may induce some areas to be overenhanced or blurred. Although local histogram equalization (LHE) acts adaptively to overcome this problem, it brings noise and artifacts to image. In this paper, a region-based enhancement algorithm is proposed, in which Grossberg network is employed to generate histogram and extract regions. Simulation results show that the image is obviously improved with the advantage of both GHE and LHE.", "paper_title": "A region-based image enhancement algorithm with the Grossberg network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000080"}
