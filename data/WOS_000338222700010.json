A problem of choosing the law of change of the setting angle of the cross section of the wind turbine blade and the value of the angular speed so that the wind energy utilization coefficient is maximal is discussed. Maximization of the respective functional is considered as a variational problem with a priori unknown parameter. Once it is solved numerically or analytically, the optimal value of this parameter is determined, with the sought variables given by rather simple formulas. The results are analyzed on a qualitative level. In particular, the setting angle is found to change monotonically along the blade, which is confirmed by practical wind turbine design. Examples of using the proposed approach to wind turbine blade design are considered.", "paper_title": "On wind turbine blade design optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000338222700010"}
