The paper presents a general framework that integrates the bill of material extensible markup language (XML) files from heterogeneous PLM systems to RoHS compliance management system. This framework is based on the use of Smart Client technology to obtain flexibility required for complex and distributed environments. It also makes use of XML technology and data structure to obtain reuse and robustness.", "paper_title": "Interoperability Between PLM and RoHS Compliance Management Based on XML and Smart Client", "paper_id": "WOS:000269548600011"}
