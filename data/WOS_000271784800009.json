We define also an operation on the representations of two continuous functions between streams that yields a representation of their composite. In the case of discrete-valued functions, the representatives are well-founded (finite-path) trees of a certain kind. The underlying idea can be traced back to Brouwer's justification of bar-induction, or to Kreiseland Troelstra's elimination of choice-sequences. In the case of stream-valued functions, the representatives are non-well founded tree spieced together in a coinductive fashion from well-founded trees. The definition requires an alternating fixpoint construction of some ubiquity.", "paper_title": "REPRESENTATIONS OF STREAM PROCESSORS USING NESTED FIXED POINTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000271784800009"}
