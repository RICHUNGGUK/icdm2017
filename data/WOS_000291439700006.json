The simulated and experimental results show that the proposed optical receiver exhibits coding gains of 2.75 and 6.73 dB for post-forward-error-correction bit error rates of 10(-4) and 10(-9), respectively, over a hard-decision uncoded system for a 60 km single-mode optical fiber transmission. The soft-decision circuitry consumes approximately 5 W and is optimized to provide two confidence levels, one above and one below the hard-decision levels.", "paper_title": "Optical Front-End for Soft-Decision LDPC Codes in Optical Communication Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000291439700006"}
