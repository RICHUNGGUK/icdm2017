Innovative experimental technologies and theoretical frameworks are being actively developed for multicomponent drug research. In this work, we present the Drug Combination Database, with aims to facilitate analyses of known drug combinations, to summarize patterns of beneficial drug interactions, and to provide a basis for theoretical modeling and simulation of such drug interactions. Its current version ( 1.0) collected 499 approved or investigational drug combinations, including 40 unsuccessful drug combinations, involving 485 individual drugs, from > 6000 references.", "paper_title": "DCDB: Drug combination database", "paper_id": "WOS:000274484300026"}
