The model is constructed by using the constrained interpolation profile/multi-moment finite volume method (CIP/MM FVM). Two kinds of moments, i.e. the point value (PV) and the volume-integrated average (VIA) are defined and independently updated in the present model by different numerical formulations. The Lax-Friedrichs upwind splitting is used to update the PV moment in terms of a derivative Riemann problem, and a finite volume formulation derived by integrating the governing equations over each mesh element is used to predict the VIA moment. The cubed-sphere grid is applied to get around the polar singularity and to obtain uniform grid spacing for a spherical geometry. Highly localized reconstruction in CIP/MM FVM is well suited for the cubed-sphere grid, especially in dealing with the discontinuity in the coordinates between different patches. The mass conservation is completely achieved over the whole globe. The numerical model has been verified by Williamson's standard test set for shallow water equation model on sphere. The results reveal that the present model is competitive to most existing ones. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
