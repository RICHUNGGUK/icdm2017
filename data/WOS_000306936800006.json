In the handling of exceptions we dissociate the control from the elementary operation that recovers from the exception. In this way it becomes apparent that there is a duality, in the categorical sense, between exceptions and states.", "paper_title": "A duality between exceptions and states", "paper_id": "WOS:000306936800006"}
