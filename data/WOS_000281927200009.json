However, clinical information is usually distributed among several independent systems that may be syntactically or semantically incompatible. This fact prevents healthcare professionals from accessing clinical information of patients in an understandable and normalized way. In this work, we address the semantic interoperability of two EHR standards: OpenEHR and ISO EN 13606. Both standards follow the dual model approach which distinguishes information and knowledge, this being represented through archetypes. The solution presented here is capable of transforming OpenEHR archetypes into ISO EN 13606 and vice versa by combining Semantic Web and Model-driven Engineering technologies. The resulting software implementation has been tested using publicly available collections of archetypes for both standards. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
