An ultra-low voltage (ULV) amplifier with self-compensated CMFB loop is used to meet the stricter amplifier speed required by SCR feedback. Fabricated in a 0.13 mu m CMOS process, the modulator achieves a peak SNDR of 81.2 dB over 25-kHz signal bandwidth and consumes 625 mu W at 0.5-V supply.", "paper_title": "A 0.5-V 81.2 dB SNDR audio-band continuous-time Delta-Sigma modulator with SCR feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000290162700003"}
