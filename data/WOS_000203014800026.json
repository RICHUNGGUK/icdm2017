These services must be dynamically adapted because the context (user profile, localization, terminal and network resources, etc.) may change at runtime. The existent solutions use an adaptation control based on service-specific rules and strategies. Because of this, a service will not work correctly in a context that was not anticipated by the rules creator. Our proposition consist in an adaptation platform that uses a service-context description in order to analyze if a service works correctly in a given context, to find the problems and the solutions. In order to adapt a service we reconfigure its architecture by inserting, replacing or moving components.", "paper_title": "A service-context model allowing dynamical adaptation", "paper_id": "WOS:000203014800026"}
