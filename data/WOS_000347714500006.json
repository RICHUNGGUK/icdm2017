The platform is based on an aggregate of multiple processing clusters, each containing multiple processing cores, whose architectures are adapted, in execution time, to the instantaneous energy and performance constraints of the software application under execution. This adaptation is ensured by a sophisticated hypervisor engine, implemented as a software layer in the host computer, which keeps a permanent record of a broad set of performance counters, gathered from the execution of each core in the field-programmable gate array (FPGA), in order to dynamically determine the optimal heterogeneous mix of processor architectures that satisfy the considered constraints. By issuing convenient reconfiguration commands to the reconfiguration engine, implemented in a static portion of the FPGA, partial dynamical reconfiguration mechanisms ensure a runtime adaptation of the cores that integrate each cluster. When compared with static instantiations of the considered many-core processor architectures, the obtained experimental results show that significant gains can be obtained with the proposed adaptive computing platform, with performance speedups up to 9.5x, while offering reductions in terms of the consumed energy as high as 10x.", "paper_title": "Morphable hundred-core heterogeneous architecture for energy-aware computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000347714500006"}
