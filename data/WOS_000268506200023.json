Classification of the acoustic environment is performed based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) using coding parameters of the SMV extracted directly from the encoding process of the acoustic input data in the mobile phone. Experimental results show that the proposed environment classification algorithm provides superior performance over a conventional method in various acoustic environments.", "paper_title": "Acoustic Environment Classification Based on SMV Speech Codec Parameters for Context-Aware Mobile Phone", "paper_id": "WOS:000268506200023"}
