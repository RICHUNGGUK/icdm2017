The problem is that it is difficult to identify a user of objects that are used by multiple people and to define a unique way to identify the user. The proposed model identifies the user assuming that the objects are used by multiple people. Further, it introduces three policies. By our experiment, we have proved the following: (1) Addition of user information to sensor data by the model is valid. (2) By presenting a difference in policies, it is possible to draw someone's attention.", "paper_title": "A Model for Addition of User Information to Sensor Data Obtained from Living Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000277724000002"}
