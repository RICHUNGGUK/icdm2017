The partners have to agree on a common data format and meaning as well as on the quality of service (QoS) requirements each partner has to fulfil. The QoS requirements are typically described using service level agreements (SLAs) among the partners. In this paper, a top-down modelling approach for Web service based business processes is proposed to capture the functional and non-functional aspects using a choreography language (WS-CDL) which describes the message interactions among the participants. The choreography is annotated with SLAs for the different partners. For each partner in the process, an orchestration (in WS-BPEL) and the necessary Web service templates are automatically generated. The service level objectives (SLOs) from the partner SLAs are automatically translated into policies that can then be enforced by a BPEL engine during execution. The deployment of the WSDL files, the monitoring of QoS attributes and the execution of the BPEL process itself are then handled by the VRESCo SOA runtime.", "paper_title": "Top-down business process development and execution using quality of service aspects", "paper_id": "WOS:000207471100008"}
