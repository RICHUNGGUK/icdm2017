The nozzles studied include a normal circular nozzle, a V-shaped notched nozzle, and an A-shaped notched nozzle, all with the same circular cross-section. The vortical structures resulting from these different circular nozzles are visualized by using a numerical dye visualization technique. Results for the V-shaped notched nozzle are compared with available experimental measurements using laser-induced fluorescence techniques. In addition to azimuthal vortex rings created because of the shear-layer between the jet and the ambient fluid, the computations also reveal streamwise vortex pairs both inside and outside the vortex rings that spread outward as the vortex rings move downstream. Comparisons of the three different nozzles show that, unlike in the case of the circular nozzle where the streamwise vortex pairs emerge evenly along the nozzle lip, streamwise vortex pairs for the notched circular nozzles are produced only at peak and trough locations. Analysis of the mixing characteristics of the three types of nozzles shows that the notches in the nozzle exit significantly enhance jet mixing. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
