Compared to the exhaustive mode search, the proposed method achieves an average 57% reduction in computation time with negligible degradation in visual quality. The speed and rate-distortion performance is comparable to known fast algorithms that involve more elaborate mechanisms.", "paper_title": "H.264 Fast Inter-Mode Selection Based on Coded Block Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000267639600014"}
