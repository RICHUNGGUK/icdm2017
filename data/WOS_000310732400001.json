Rather than limiting scholarly communication to text-based static documents, the Web makes it possible for scholars to expose and share the full evidence of their research including data, images, video, and other genre of materials. These aggregations of evidence, or compound documents, can then be integrated into a linked data cloud, the basis of Scholarship 2.0an open environment in which scholars collaborate and build new knowledge on the existing scholarship. We present Open Archives InitiativeObject Reuse and Exchange (OAIORE), a set of standards to identify and describe aggregations of WebResources, thereby making the Scholarship 2.0 vision possible.
