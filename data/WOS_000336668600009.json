The proposed method allows an increase in the measurement frequency (six measurements per rotation for a two-pole motor or 12 measurements for a four-pole motor) and the measurement results are not affected by the misalignment mounting of the sensor. The paper describes a conceptual structure of a series PI controller.", "paper_title": "A Novel Speed Measurement Method for a High-Speed BLDC Motor Based on the Signals From the Rotor Position Sensor", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600009"}
