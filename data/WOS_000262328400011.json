Additionally to fixed and variable costs, we present extensions that accommodate transportation costs, capacity risk measures, and interorganizational dependencies such as the success of past collaboration. Experiences from a real case study indicate that these models are helpful in VO decision making; computational experiments suggest that the models are tractable. In general, the MILP models are potentially applicable to a variety of portfolio selection problems.", "paper_title": "Multicriteria Partner Selection in Virtual Organizations With Transportation Costs and Other Network Interdependencies", "paper_id": "WOS:000262328400011"}
