Various types of patterns are observed in control charts. Identification of these control chart patterns (CCPs) can provide clues to potential quality problems in the manufacturing process. Each type of control chart pattern has its own geometric shape and various related features can represent this shape. Feature-based approaches can facilitate efficient pattern recognition since extracted shape features represent the main characteristics of the patterns in a condensed form. In this paper, a set of eight new features, extraction of which does not call for utilizing the experience and skill of the user in any form, is presented. Two feature-based approaches using heuristics and artificial neural network (ANN) are developed, which are capable of recognizing eight most commonly observed CCPs including stratification and systematic patterns. Relative performances of the feature-based heuristic and feature-based ANN recognizers are extensively studied using synthetic pattern data. The feature-based ANN recognizer results in better recognition performance and generalization compared to the feature-based heuristic recognizer. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
