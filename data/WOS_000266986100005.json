However, uniform scaling is limited in its applicability while straightforward non-uniform scaling can destroy features and lead to serious visual artifacts. Our goal is to define a method that protects model features and structures during resizing. We observe that typically, during scaling some parts of the models are more vulnerable than others, undergoing undesirable deformation. We automatically detect vulnerable regions and carry this information to a protective grid defined around the object, defining a vulnerability map. The 3D model is then resized by a space-deformation technique which scales the grid non-homogeneously while respecting this map. Using space-deformation allows processing of common models of man-made objects that consist of multiple components and contain non-manifold structures. We show that our technique resizes models while suppressing undesirable distortion, creating models that preserve the structure and features of the original ones.", "paper_title": "Non-homogeneous Resizing of Complex Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000266986100005"}
