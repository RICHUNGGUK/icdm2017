A consequence of this specification is that 0(-1) = 0, an interesting equation consistent with the ring axioms and many properties of division. The existence of an equational specification of the rationals without hidden functions was an open question. We also give an axiomatic examination of the divisibility operator, from which some interesting new axioms emerge along with equational specifications of algebras of rationals, including one with the modulus function. Finally, we state some open problems, including: Does there exist an equational specification of the field operations on the rationals without hidden functions that is a complete term rewriting system?", "paper_title": "The rational numbers as an abstract data type", "paper_id": "WOS:000245893400003"}
