The vast majority of these FAMs represent distributive models given by single-layer matrix memories. Although the Kosko subsethood FAM (KS-FAM) can also be classified as a fuzzy morphological associative memory (FMAM), the KS-FAM constitutes a two-layer non-distributive model. In this paper, we prove several theorems concerning the conditions of perfect recall, the absolute storage capacity, and the output patterns produced by the KS-FAM. In addition, we propose a normalization strategy for the training and recall phases of the KS-FAM. We employ this strategy to compare the error correction capabilities of the KS-FAM and other fuzzy and gray-scale associative memories in terms of some experimental results concerning gray-scale image reconstruction. Finally, we apply the KS-FAM to the task of vision-based self-localization in robotics.", "paper_title": "The Kosko Subsethood Fuzzy Associative Memory (KS-FAM): Mathematical Background and Applications in Computer Vision", "paper_id": "WOS:000299937900004"}
