New multiple-valued dual-rail encoding, where each code is represented by the minimum set of three values, makes it possible to perform asynchronous communication between modules with just two wires. Since an appropriate current level is individually assigned to the logic value, a sufficient dynamic range between adjacent current signals can be maintained in the proposed multiple-valued current-mode (MVCM) circuit, which improves the robustness against the process variation. Moreover, as the supply-voltage and the temperature variations in smaller dimensions of circuit elements are dominated as the common-mode variation, a local reference voltage signal according to the variations can be adaptively generated to compensate characteristic change of the MVCM-circuit component. As a result, the proposed asynchronous on-chip communication link is correctly operated in the operation range from 1.1 V to 1.4 V of the supply voltage and that from -50 degrees C to 75 degrees C under the process variation of 3 sigma. In fact, it is demonstrated by HSPICE simulation in a 0.13-mu m CMOS process that the throughput of the proposed circuit is enhanced to 435% in comparison with that of the conventional 4-phase asynchronous communication circuit under a comparable energy dissipation.", "paper_title": "Highly Reliable Multiple-Valued One-Phase Signalling for an Asynchronous On-Chip Communication Link", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342300010"}
