In a typical remote experimentation session, students get access to a remote real plant located at the laboratory to carry out their assignments. Usually, the graphical user interface allows users to watch the equipment by video stream in live. However, in some cases, visual feedback by video stream could be enhanced by means of augmented reality techniques, which mix together in one image, the video stream and computer generated data. Such mixture produces an added value to remote experimentation, increasing the sense of presence and reality, and helping to understand much better the concepts under study. In this work, a Java-based approach to be used in the remote experimentation context for pedagogical purposes is presented. Firstly, a pure Java example is given to readers (including the source code) and then, a more sophisticated example using a Java-based open source tool known as Easy Java Simulations is introduced. This latter option takes advantage of a new developed component, called camimage, which is an easy-to-use visual element that allows authors to capture video stream from IP cameras in order to mix real images with computer generated graphics.", "paper_title": "Using Augmented Reality in Remote Laboratories", "paper_id": "WOS:000322561300012"}
