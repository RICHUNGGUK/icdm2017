We propose two double-level parallel metaheuristic algorithms based on the new method of the neighborhood determination. Algorithms proposed here include two major modules: the machine selection module refer to executed sequentially, and the operation scheduling module executed in parallel. On each level a metaheuristic algorithm is used, therefore we call this method meta(2)heuristics. We carry out a computational experiment using Graphics Processing Units (CPU). It was possible to obtain the new best known solutions for the benchmark instances from the literature. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
