The multicast device also exhibited about 22 dB optical signal-to-noise ratio enhancement for all the converted channels compared to the original signal channel without wavelength conversion. Our experiment for the first time revealed the regeneration properties of a SOA-MZI device for WDM wavelength multicast purposes, and proved the excellent performance of a simple scheme for various future network and system applications, such as all-optical wavelength routing and grid networking.", "paper_title": "Regenerative all-optical wavelength multicast for next generation WDM network and system applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000252640700001"}
