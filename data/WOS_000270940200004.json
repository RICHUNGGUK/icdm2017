Although many attempts exist in literature to develop such strategies, deficiencies still exist. One of the major challenges in myoelectric control is finding an optimal feature set that can best discriminate between classes. However, since the myoelectric signal is recorded using multi channels, the feature vector size can become very large. Hence a dimensionality reduction method is needed to identify an informative, yet small size feature set. This paper presents a new feature selection method based on modifying the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm with the inclusion of Mutual Information (MI) measure. The new method, called BPSOMI, is a mixture of filter and wrapper approaches of feature selection. In order to prove its efficiency, the proposed method is tested against other dimensionality reduction techniques proving powerful classification accuracy.", "paper_title": "A novel swarm based feature selection algorithm in multifunction myoelectric control", "paper_id": "WOS:000270940200004"}
