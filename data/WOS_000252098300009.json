The principal challenge with all resistive MRI systems is the implementation of a highly precise magnet current supply. The noise current through the magnet is fundamentally limited by the current transducer used to provide feedback and the voltage reference used to generate the demand signal. Field instability in the main field magnet can both corrupt the received data and degrade the robustness of Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) echo trains, which are paramount to efficient imaging in PMRI. In this work, we present the magnet control system that achieved sufficient field stability for PMRI at 0.5/0.13 T, identify the dominant sources of noise in the control system, examine the imaging artifacts that can occur if the field stability is insufficient, and identify how the design can be improved for better field stability, should it be required for future implementations of PMRI.", "paper_title": "Noise performance of a precision pulsed electromagnet power supply for magnetic resonance imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000252098300009"}
