Cognitive radios been proposed as a key enabling technology for such an opportunistic policy. One of the key challenges to enabling multihop CR communications is how to perform opportunistic medium access control while limiting the interference imposed on licensed users. In this article we highlight the unique characteristics of multihop cognitive radio networks, discuss key MAC design challenges specific to such networks, and present some of the work that has been done on MAC design for CRNs.", "paper_title": "Channel Access Protocols for Multihop Opportunistic Networks: Challenges and Recent Developments", "paper_id": "WOS:000268597800003"}
