The weakly nonlinear model is a truncation of the potential flow equations in deep water, and includes cubic nonlinear terms. Numerically, solitary waves are shown to be generated by a near-monochromatic, subcritical forcing. The presence of these solitary waves is predicted using a forced nonlinear Schrodinger equation.
