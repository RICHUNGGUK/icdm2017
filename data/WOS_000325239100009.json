However, due to the characteristics of heterogeneous, open, and collaborative, the correctness of data-intensive service should be guaranteed during its application. Considering the explosive data among services, this paper proposes a model-based data-intensive services abstraction refinement to model and verify the data-intensive service. First, the data flows and service interactions are formalized into DEFSM (Data-Related Extended Finite State Machine) model, which can describe the functional interactions and their parallel interactions. Second, the CEGAR (Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement) method is employed to verify the correctness of the data-intensive service interaction. Third, the data-related property abstraction is used to refine the DEFSM model through spurious counterexample, partitioning the over-abstracted state into two independent states. Finally, a case study about online ticket sale system is designed to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "Model-Based Data-Intensive Service Abstraction Refinement", "paper_id": "WOS:000325239100009"}
