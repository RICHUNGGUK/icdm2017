The incoming flow separated over the leading edge despite the ramp angle being below the threshold for incipient separation. The separation produced a weak trailing horseshoe vortex system. The flow over the top of the MVG separated off the slant edges to produce a large primary vortex pair. Extra details were revealed at the trailing edge with at least two pairs of singularities. Vortex filaments spring from these singularities. Symmetry breaking from the confluence of the two primary vortices was observed as an unsteady wake to result in a train of possibly ring or hairpin vortices trailing downstream.", "paper_title": "Visualization of supersonic flow around a sharp-edged, sub-boundary-layer protuberance", "paper_id": "WOS:000362972900006"}
