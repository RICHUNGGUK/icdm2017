In such networks, proper dimensioning of soft handoff parameters is critical to overcoming propagation impairments and providing a transparent radio access service for multiple user profiles. We obtain exact expressions for the cell assignment and active set update probabilities of a mobile station traveling along an arbitrary straight-line trajectory. We develop recursive algorithms to compute performance measures such as outage probability, macrodiversity gain, and signaling load. The discrete-time level-crossing analysis yields an accurate and efficient computational tool for designing and dimensioning high performance soft handoff algorithms while avoiding the need for approximations or time-consuming computer simulations.", "paper_title": "Discrete-time level-crossing analysis of soft handoff performance in cellular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238921200028"}
