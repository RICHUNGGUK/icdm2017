The Network-on-Chip (NoC) is expected to undertake the expanding demands of the ever-increasing numbers of processing elements, while-at the same time-technological and application constraints increase the pressure for increased performance and efficiency with limited resources. Although NoC research has evolved significantly the last decade, essential questions remain un-answered and call for fresh research ideas and innovative solutions. In this paper, we summarize a selected set of NoC-related research challenges, with the hope to guide future development and trigger high-impact research progress.", "paper_title": "The fast evolving landscape of on-chip communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000357339400003"}
