Design/methodology/approach - The Ulrich's Periodical Directory, Library of Congress Subject Heading, retrieved from the WorldCat and LISA database were used to identify the main class, subclass and subject of cited journals and books. The highly cited journals and books, the main classes and subclasses of cited journals and books in papers of the four journals, the highly cited subjects in journals and books of library and information science were identified and analyzed. Findings - The study reveals that information science possessing strong self knowledge flow as these four source journals are also the four most cited. The class library science, book industries and trade, general information resources consists of a mainstream of knowledge flow into information science. The highly cited subjects of LIS journals encompass searching, online information retrieval, information work, subject indexing, World Wide Web, technical services, citation analysis, information seeking behavior, etc. The three most cited LCSH subjects on WorldCat of books are information storage and retrieval, information science, human-computer interaction, etc. Originality/value - The knowledge inputs for information science include mainly information science itself and social sciences and general science as well. Moreover, there are minor inputs from various subjects.", "paper_title": "Knowledge input for the domain of information science A bibliometric and citation analysis study", "paper_id": "WOS:000317150400006"}
