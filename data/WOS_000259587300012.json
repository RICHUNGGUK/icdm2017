The situation is even more worrying when we take into account their influence on serious health complications that can threaten patients' lives or significantly reduce their quality of life. The presented modeling-and-simulation study enables us to estimate the number of patients with type-2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension, obese and smoking people and the influence of these conditions on the development of strokes and peripheral arterial-vascular diseases. In addition, an estimate of treatment costs makes it possible to evaluate the social burden and provide information about the potential savings resulting from treating intensive chronic diseases.
