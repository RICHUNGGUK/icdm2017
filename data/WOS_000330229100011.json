The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards committee has recently finished its standardization work in this area by defining the IEEE std 802.21a-2012 (TM). The mechanisms introduced in this standard are aimed to protect the IEEE std 802.21-2008 (TM) messages and services and to reduce handover latency by introducing the concept of proactive authentication. We provide a comprehensive survey of this standard and describe how the defined mechanisms can be used to reduce the overall latency during handover between access networks using heterogenous radio interfaces.", "paper_title": "A NEW STANDARD FOR SECURING MEDIA INDEPENDENT HANDOVER: IEEE 802.21A", "paper_id": "WOS:000330229100011"}
