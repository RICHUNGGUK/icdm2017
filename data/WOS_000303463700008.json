The proposed algorithm also considers the effect of amplified spontaneous emission noise (ASE noise) on a lightpath during propagation of the optical signal from any source to the intended destination. As crosstalk due to FWM and ASE noise are two transmission impairments that degrade the quality of optical signal even at low to medium data rates, it is mandatory for an algorithm for dynamic routing and wavelength assignment in a WDM network to consider the effect of these two impairments on the lightpath to be established. The distinguishing feature of the proposed algorithm is that it is based on an initial population of a single individual and uses a fitness function that is expressed in terms of the number of hops, path cost, variance contributions due to FWM crosstalk, amplifier noise, and different beat noises at the receiver. The performance of a newly introduced FWM aware priority-based wavelength assignment technique is compared with few of the existing wavelength assignment techniques in the present work.", "paper_title": "FWM aware evolutionary programming algorithm for transparent optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000303463700008"}
