In this study, we propose both maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood estimations of ML-NLME models with two-level random effects, using first order conditional expansion (FOCE) and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The FOCE EM algorithm was compared with the most popular Lindstrom and Bates (LB) method in terms of computational and statistical properties. Basal area growth series data measured from Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) experimental stands and simulated data were used for evaluation. The FOCE EM and LB algorithms given the same parameter estimates and fit statistics for models that converged by both. However, FOCE EM converged for all the models, while LB did not, especially for the models in which two-level random effects are simultaneously considered in several base parameters to account for between-group variation. We recommend the use of FOCE EM in ML-NLME models, particularly when convergence is a concern in model selection. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
