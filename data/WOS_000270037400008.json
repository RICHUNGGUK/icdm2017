In the proposed clock generator, the complementary delay line generates a series of multiphase clocks. The 0-to-1 transition detector finds the 2 pi phase delayed position among the multiphase clocks produced by the complementary delay line, and then, the select signal generator chooses the proper path to generate the delayed output clock. As a result, the proposed open-loop and full-digital architecture achieves a fast lock time of two clock cycles. Also, it is a simple, robust and portable IP and consumes only 17 mW at an input clock frequency of 1.6 GHz. In addition, a complementary delay line is implemented to achieve high phase resolution over a wide frequency range. The proposed clock generator is implemented in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process and, occupies an active area of 170 mu m x 120 mu m. Also, it operates at various input frequencies ranging from 800 MHz to 1.6 GHz.", "paper_title": "A Low-Jitter Open-Loop All-Digital Clock Generator With Two-Cycle Lock-Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000270037400008"}
