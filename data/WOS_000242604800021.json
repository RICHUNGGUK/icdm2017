In this paper, globally convergent homotopy methods are combined with the harmonic balance method for simulation of high-Q oscillators. Various homotopy options have been evaluated, and an algorithm has been developed that is robust in simulating a wide range of oscillator circuits.", "paper_title": "Robust simulation of high-Q oscillators using a homotopy-based harmonic. balance method", "paper_id": "WOS:000242604800021"}
