The main geometric contribution is a detailed study of a variety X-nod, which is a compactification of the family U-nod, including the boundary components (degenerations) and a generalization to P-3 of a formula of Zeuthen for nodal cubics in P-2. The computations have been carried out with the WIRIS boost WIT. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
