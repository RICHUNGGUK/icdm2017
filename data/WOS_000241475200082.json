In this paper, a new method based on independent component analysis (ICA) and correlation analysis is proposed for MRS tumour data structure analysis. First, independent components and their coefficients are derived by ICA. Those components are interpreted in terms of metabolites, which interrelate with each other in tissues. Then correlation analysis is performed to reveal the interrelationship on coefficient of ICs, where residue dependence of components of metabolites remains. The method was performed on MRS data of hepatic encephalopathy. Experimental results reveal the intrinsic data structure and describe the pathological interrelation between parts of the structure successfully.", "paper_title": "Exploring the intrinsic structure of magnetic resonance spectra tumor data based on independent component analysis and correlation analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241475200082"}
