By combining a conventional industrial robot with an external compensation mechanism, a significantly higher bandwidth of the control of the relative position between the tool and the workpiece can be achieved. A model-based feedback controller for the compensation mechanism, as well as a mid-ranging control architecture for the combined system with the robot and the compensation mechanism are developed. The system performance is evaluated in extensive machining experiments, and the workpiece accuracies achieved are quantified and compared to the corresponding results obtained with state-of-the-art approaches to robotic machining. It is shown that the proposed approach to machining offers significantly higher accuracy, up to eight times improvement for milling in steel, where the required process forces, and thus the exhibited position deviations of the robot, are significant.
