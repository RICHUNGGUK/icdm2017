Analyzing the contents of an image and retrieving corresponding semantics are important in semantic-based image retrieval systems. Region-based image retrieval systems attempt to reduce the gap between high-level semantics and low-level features by representing images at the object level. In this paper, we apply principal component analysis to extract significant region features and then incorporate them into the proposed two-phase fuzzy adaptive resonance theory neural network (Fuzzy-ARTNN) for real-world image content classification. In general, Fuzzy-ARTNN is an unsupervised classifier. The training patterns in image content analysis are labeled with corresponding categories. This category information is useful for supervised learning. Thus, a supervised learning mechanism is added to label the category of the cluster centers derived by the Fuzzy-ARTNN. Moreover, based on the content analysis by the proposed two-phase Fuzzy-ART, each region in an image is associated with a high-level semantic concept. The proposed system supports both query by keyword(s) with/without region size and query by specified region(s). Experimental results show that the proposed method has high accuracy for semantic-based photograph content analysis and that the results of photograph content analysis are similar to the perception of human eyes. In addition, the semantic-based image retrieval system has a high retrieval rate.", "paper_title": "Semantic real-world image classification for image retrieval with fuzzy-ART neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000309878400034"}
