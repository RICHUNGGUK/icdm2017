This is detrimental to storage and network transmission, but in the near future could also affect the efficiency of the visualization process itself, because of the increasing gap between computing times and external access times. In this article, we attempt to reconcile lossless compression and visualization by proposing a data structure that radically reduces the size of the object while supporting a fast interactive navigation based on a viewing distance criterion. In addition to this double capability, this method works out-of-core and can handle meshes containing several hundred million vertices. Furthermore, it presents the advantage of dealing with any n-dimensional simplicial complex, including triangle soups or volumetric meshes, and provides a significant rate-distortion improvement. The performance attained is near state-of-the-art in terms of the compression ratio as well as the visualization frame rates, offering a unique combination that can be useful in numerous applications.
