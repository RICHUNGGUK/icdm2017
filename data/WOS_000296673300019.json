The generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is employed for detection. By deriving the GLRT, it is shown that the assumption of colored Gaussian noise results in a more complicated problem than with the white noise assumption that was previously examined in the literature. An efficient solution for the detection maximization problem is proposed, based on which the GLRT is implemented. Performance results are presented to illustrate the detector performance.", "paper_title": "Signal Activity Detection of Offset-QPSK in Colored Gaussian Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000296673300019"}
