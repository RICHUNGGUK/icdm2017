However, since they are conceptually oriented, they are not equipped with rule-based reasoning mechanisms for assertional knowledge bases - specifically, rules and facts in Logic Programming (LP), or the interaction of rules and facts with terminological knowledge. To combine rule-based reasoning with terminological knowledge, this paper presents a, hybrid reasoning system for DL knowledge bases (TBox and ABox) and first-order clause sets. The primary result of this study involves the design of a sound and complete resolution method for the composed knowledge bases, and this method possesses features of an effective deduction procedure such as Robinson's Resolution Principle.", "paper_title": "A hybrid reasoning system for terminologies and first-order clauses in knowledge bases", "paper_id": "WOS:000233736000002"}
