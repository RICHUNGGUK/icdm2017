Therefore, a good distance metric is essential to many dimensionality reduction algorithms. In this paper, we present a new dimensionality reduction method for data visualization, called Distance-ratio Preserving Embedding (DrPE), which preserves the ratio between the pairwise distances. It is achieved by minimizing the mismatch between the distance ratios derived from input and output space. The proposed method can preserve the relational structures among points of the input space. Extensive visualization experiments compared with existing dimensionality reduction algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "DISTANCE-RATIO LEARNING FOR DATA VISUALIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000314539000005"}
