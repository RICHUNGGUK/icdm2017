The universe of discourse is formed by a set of satisfaction levels. The fuzzy mark awarded to the answer of each question of the answerscript of a student is represented by a type-2 fuzzy set. The proposed methods can overcome the drawbacks of the existing methods. It can evaluate the answerscripts of students in a more flexible and more intelligent manner.", "paper_title": "New methods for evaluating the answerscripts of students using fuzzy sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623800048"}
