In this paper, we give an algorithm of parametric representation compactly supported trivariate orthogonal wavelet filter, which simplifies the study of trivariate orthogonal wavelet. Four examples are also given to demonstrate the method.", "paper_title": "Parametrization of compactly supported trivariate orthogonal wavelet filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000251284800006"}
