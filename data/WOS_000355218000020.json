As the scale of silicon technology continues shrinking, Iddq values and associated fluctuations increase. In addition, increased design complexity makes defect-induced leakage currents difficult to differentiate from full-chip currents. Consequently, traditional Iddq methods result in more test escapes and yield loss. This brief proposes a new test method, called s-Iddq to provide the following: 1) Iddq analysis with process-parameter deduction and 2) the algorithm for automatic chip-classification called collective analysis without the need to manually determine threshold values. We randomly inserted a number of multiple defects into samples of ISCAS' 89 and IWSL'05 benchmark circuits. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed s-Iddq method can achieve higher classification accuracy than single-threshold Iddq testing or sigma-Iddq in a 45-nm technology. The overall classification accuracy of the collective analysis achieve averaged 99.28% and 99.70% on s-Iddq data from process-parameter deductions with average-case search and multilevel search, respectively, demonstrating that the influence of process variation and design scaling can be significantly reduced to enable a better identification of defective chips.", "paper_title": "Demystifying Iddq Data With Process Variation for Automatic Chip Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000355218000020"}
