The first scheme was proven secure without random oracles while its partial signature contains dozens of group elements. Recently, interactive AOFE was introduced and the construction is more practical, where a partial signature only contains three group elements. It is based on the existence of Designated Confirmer Signature (DCS) with a special property where one is able to sample a confirmer signature efficiently from a signer's signature space. Nevertheless, we note that there are only a few DCS schemes that have this special property. Security of the interactive AOFE construction relies on the q-Computational and Decisional Hidden Strong Diffie-Hellman assumptions. In this paper, we propose a new construction of interactive AOFE from DCS, where the underlying DCS is standard and does not require any special property. We also propose a new DCS construction. By applying our transformation from DCS to interactive AOFE, we build a concrete interactive AOFE which is secure under more standard number-theoretic assumptions, namely Strong Diffie-Hellman and Decision Linear assumptions, without random oracles. A partial signature of the interactive AOFE contains six group elements, while a full signature contains two only. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
