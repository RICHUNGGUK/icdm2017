It is assembled from well-known models of temperature dependent viscoelasticity and structural relaxation and predicts both transient and steady-state stresses in complex 3D glass geometries. The theory and implementation of the model is comprehensively given and the model is carefully checked and validated. It is demonstrated that by adjusting a single parameter in the model, experimental results can be replicated accurately even for cooling rates far from normal. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
