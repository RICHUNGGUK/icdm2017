Identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is important for quantification of methylation levels and for study of allele-specific epigenetic events such as imprinting. However, SNP calling in such data is complex and time consuming. Here, we present an ultrafast and memory-efficient package named BS-SNPer for the exploration of SNP sites from BS-Seq data. Compared with Bis-SNP, a popular BS-Seq specific SNP caller, BS-SNPer is over 100 times faster and uses less memory. BS-SNPer also offers higher sensitivity and specificity compared with existing methods.", "paper_title": "BS-SNPer: SNP calling in bisulfite-seq data", "paper_id": "WOS:000366630400021"}
