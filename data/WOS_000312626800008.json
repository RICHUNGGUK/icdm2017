Experimental definition of the logBCF for all substances is impossible. The CORAL software was tested as a potential tool for modeling of bioconcentration factor. Using this software the data was analyzed in three runs of the program. In three random splits the data was divided into the sub-training (approximate to 45%), the calibration (approximate to 34%), and the test sets (approximate to 22%). The obtained models are characterized by the following statistical quality: Split 1: n=216, r(2) = 0.839, s = 0.54, F = 1115 (sub-training); n = 188, r(2) = 0.839. s = 0.54 (calibration); n = 118, r(2) = 0.878, s = 0.50 (test); Split 2: n = 241, r(2) = 0.830, s = 0.56, F = 1169 (sub-training); n = 167, r(2) = 0.871. s = 0.51 (calibration); n = 114, r(2) = 0.881, s = 0.46 (test); Split 3: n = 244, r(2) = 0.835, s = 0.57, F = 1228 (sub-training); n = 171, r(2) = 0.847, s = 0.53 (calibration); n = 107, r(2) = 0.860, s = 0.49 (test). Structural features which can be extracted from simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) and which are statistically significant promoters of increase or promoters of decrease for bioconcentration factor are identified and discussed.
