(2007) from the point of view of full universal composability (FUC), that is, composability with arbitrary protocols, which was the original Security goal and motivation for UC. By observing a counter-intuitive phenomenon, we note that the GUC feasibility implicitly assumes that the adversary has limited access to arbitrary external protocols. We then clarify a general principle for achieving FUC security, and propose some approaches for fixing the GUC feasibility under the general principle. Finally, we discuss the relationship between GUC and FUC from both technical and philosophical points of view. This should be helpful in gaining a precise understanding of the GUC feasibility, and for preventing potential misinterpretations and/or misuses in practice.", "paper_title": "A note on the feasibility of generalised universal composability", "paper_id": "WOS:000264418400013"}
