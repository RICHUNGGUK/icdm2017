In particular, we tested the hypothesis that ratings for source code maintainability, as employed by the Software Improvement Group (SIG) quality model, are correlated with ratings for issue resolution speed. We tested the hypothesis for issues of type defect and of type enhancement. This study revealed that all but one of the metrics of the SIG quality model show a significant positive correlation with the resolution speed of defects, enhancements, or both.", "paper_title": "Faster issue resolution with higher technical quality of software", "paper_id": "WOS:000303507800002"}
