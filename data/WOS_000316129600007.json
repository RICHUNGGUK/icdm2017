In particular, we demonstrate the consistency between the different approaches and the monotonicity of the two measures for states belonging to the class of phase-randomized coherent states. Moreover, we prove that the exact behavior of one measure with respect to the other depends on the states under investigation and devise possible criteria to discriminate which measure is more useful for the characterization of the states in realistic applications.", "paper_title": "EXPERIMENTAL QUANTIFICATION OF NON-GAUSSIANITY OF PHASE-RANDOMIZED COHERENT STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000316129600007"}
