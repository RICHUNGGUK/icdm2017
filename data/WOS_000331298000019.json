Herein we present a reconstruction procedure based on the inversion of a time-domain forward model incorporating the spatial impulse response due to the shape of the transducer, which is subsequently applied in a tomographic system based on a translation-rotation scan of a linear detector array. The proposed method was also adapted to cope with the data-intensive requirements of high-resolution volumetric optoacoustic imaging. The processing of 2.10(4) individual signals resulted in well-resolved images of both similar to 200 mu m absorbers in phantoms and complex vascular structures in biological tissue. The results reported herein demonstrate that the introduced model-based methodology exhibits a better contrast and resolution than standard back-projection and model-based algorithms that assume point detectors. Moreover, the capability of handling large datasets anticipates that model-based methods incorporating the sensor properties can become standard practice in volumetric optoacoustic image formation.", "paper_title": "Model-Based Optoacoustic Image Reconstruction of Large Three-Dimensional Tomographic Datasets Acquired With an Array of Directional Detectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000331298000019"}
