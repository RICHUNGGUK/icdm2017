The keyphrase extraction task was specifically geared towards scientific articles. Systems were automatically evaluated by matching their extracted keyphrases against those assigned by the authors as well as the readers to the same documents. We outline the task, present the overall ranking of the submitted systems, and discuss the improvements to the state-of-the-art in keyphrase extraction.", "paper_title": "Automatic keyphrase extraction from scientific articles", "paper_id": "WOS:000323754700007"}
