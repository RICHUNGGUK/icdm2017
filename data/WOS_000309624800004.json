This paper focuses on statistical matching, in particular we deal with incoherences. In fact, when logical constraints among the variables are present incoherencies on the probability evaluations can arise. The aim of this paper is to remove such incoherences by using different methods based on distances minimization or least commitment imprecise probabilities extensions. An illustrative example shows peculiarities of the different correction methods. Finally, limited to pseudo distance minimization, we performed a systematic comparison through a simulation study.
