The wide dynamic range is attributed to the novel TIA architecture employing both shunt-shunt and shunt-series feedback networks. The outstanding features of the TIA are wide dynamic range, high gain, low power consumption and design simplicity. A prototype implemented in a 0.5 mu m SiGe BiCMOS technology and operating at -3.3 V power supply features an 18.4 dBm dynamic range with a BER less than 10(-12), an optical sensitivity of -16 dBm, optical overload of +2.4 dBm, a bandwidth of 8.27 GHz, a gain of 950 Omega and a power consumption of 189 mW. The new parallel feedback architecture offers improved overload and noise performance when compared to previously reported, state of the art, single feedback TIA designs and meets all the 10 Gigabit Ethernet and short-reach OC-192 SONET specifications.", "paper_title": "Wide dynamic range parallel feedback transimpedance amplifier for 10 Gb/s optical links", "paper_id": "WOS:000239743600001"}
