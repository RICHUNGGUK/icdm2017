An indirect method to regulate the inductor current to ensure the lamp constant output power is proposed in order to overcome the difficulties in measuring the output power of the HID ballast. The controller is derived using passivity theory which guarantees global stability and asymptotic convergence of all state errors. The simulation and controller design are based on an average model using the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations of the system. As the lamp resistance will inevitably change with ageing, an adaptive method is used to compensate for the lamp performance as the lamp ages. This equips the controller the power to adapt to load variations and there is no need to tune the design parameters values each time manually. Another interconnection and damping assignment (IDA)-PBC method is analyzed and simulation results are provided for comparison. Computer simulation and hardware implementation are carried out to verify the system model and to demonstrate the controller is robust.", "paper_title": "Indirect Adaptive and Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity-Based Controller for Constant Power Control in Steady-State of Automotive HID Headlight Electronic Ballast", "paper_id": "WOS:000350569300005"}
