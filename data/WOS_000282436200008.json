Also, explicit protocols for perfectly teleporting arbitrary one-qubit state, two-qubit state as well as three-qubit state between arbitrary split of six partites are constructed. Moreover, to fulfil the protocol, either the senders or the receivers can make local operations individually in distant places.", "paper_title": "PERFECT TELEPORTATION BETWEEN ARBITRARY SPLIT OF SIX PARTITES BY A MAXIMALLY GENUINELY ENTANGLED SIX-QUBIT STATE", "paper_id": "WOS:000282436200008"}
