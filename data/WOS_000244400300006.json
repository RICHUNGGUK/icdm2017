Game theory techniques have recently been applied to various engineering design problems in which the action of one component impacts (and perhaps conflicts with) that of any other component. In particular, game theory techniques have been successfully used for protocol design and optimization (e.g., radio resource management, power control) in wire-less networks. In this article we present an overview of different game theory formulations. Then a survey on the game-theory-based resource management and admission control schemes in different wireless networks is presented, and several open research issues are outlined. To this end, we propose an adaptive bandwidth allocation and admission control scheme for polling service in an IEEE 802.16-based wireless metropolitan area network. A noncooperative game is formulated, and the solution of this game is determined by the Nash equilibrium for the amount of bandwidth offered to a new connection. The admission control policy ensures QoS for all connections in the system.", "paper_title": "Radio resource management games in wireless networks: An approach to bandwidth allocation and admission control for polling service in IEEE 802.16", "paper_id": "WOS:000244400300006"}
