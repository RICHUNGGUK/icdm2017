A very promising method is to provide high precision navigation service to prevent accidents. Therefore, a Network BDS/RTK System Based on Vehicular Networks (NBRSBVNs) is proposed for high precision positioning in an urban complex traffic environment in this paper. This system considers comprehensively the characteristics of the vehicular network and network RTK techniques, and also provides a new distribution method of high precision differential correction information. According to the massive field tests, this system scheme can support real-time and online high precision navigation service of multiple users at the same time. It has important practical significance in applications for vehicles active safety in a complex urban environment.", "paper_title": "A Distribution Method of High Precise Differential Corrections for a Network Beidou/RTK System Based on Vehicular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000367473800013"}
