Before using clinical data to estimate the model's unknown parameters, structural identifiability analysis was performed to determine the parameters uniqueness given certain clinical observations. A Taylor series expansion method was implemented which found that the model was structurally globally/uniquely identifiable for both on- and off-dialysis phases. The fitted model was then used in a predictive capacity showing that the use of Theralite high cut-off (HCO) or HCO 1100 dialyser gave a significant reduction in myoglobin renal exposure compared to standard haemodialysis (HD).
