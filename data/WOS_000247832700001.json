Experimentally verified noise models for received signals at the excitation and emission wavelengths are combined to generate a stochastic model for the Born ratio. This model is then utilized within a maximum likelihood framework to obtain an inverse solution based on a fixed point iteration. Results are presented for three experimental scenarios: phantom data with a homogeneous background, phantoms implanted within a small animal, and in vivo data using an exogenous probe.", "paper_title": "A statistical approach to inverting the Born ratio", "paper_id": "WOS:000247832700001"}
