The new version offers, besides a significant increase in performance, several optimizations to the algorithm, most importantly to the profile alignment routine. As a result, the annotations of multiple genomes, or parts thereof, can be fed simultaneously into the program, after which it will report all regions of homology, both within and between genomes.
