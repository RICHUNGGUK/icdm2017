Parallelisation provides an attractive prospect to improve the efficiency and solution quality of GAs. This paper investigates the complexity of parallel genetic algorithms (PGAs) based on two evaluation measures: computation time to communication time and population size to chromosome size. Moreover, the paper unifies the framework of PGA models with the function PGA (subpopulation size, cluster size, migration period, topology), and explores the performance of PGAs for the 2-page crossing number problem.
