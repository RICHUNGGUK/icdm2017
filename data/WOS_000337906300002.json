A novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) that considers more information on activation functions of delayed neural networks and delay upper bounds is developed. Simultaneously, most commonly used techniques for treating the derivative of the LKF are reviewed and compared with each other. With the way of introducing slack matrices, those techniques are classified into two categories, including free-weighting matrix (FWM)-based techniques and reciprocally convex combination-based techniques. It is found that the introduced slack matrices play an important role in conservatism reducing and those four types of FWM-based methods lead to same results and are equivalent. Moreover, the obtained criteria are extended to the system with a single time-varying delay. Two numerical examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Delay-Dependent Stability Criteria for Generalized Neural Networks With Two Delay Components", "paper_id": "WOS:000337906300002"}
