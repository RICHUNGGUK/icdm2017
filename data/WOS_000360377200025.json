At the encoder, the key frames of the odd views are protected by WZ encoding to generate the auxiliary bit-stream alongside the multi-view video coded bit-stream. At the decoder, error-concealed multi-view decoded frames are used as the side information (SI) for WZ decoding. Based on the study on the characteristics of multi-view video coding (MVC) and the propagating behavior of channel errors, a recursive model to estimate the transmission distortion is developed in the transform domain, in which the channel-induced distortion takes into consideration both motion and disparity compensation. With the proposed model, we propose a rate control strategy for WZ encoding to infer the minimum bit rate so as to correct the SI errors. The WZ bit rate estimation method exploits the correlation between the original bit-planes and the SI bit-planes as well as the bit-plane interdependency. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed error-resilient scheme outperforms Reed Solomon based forward error correction method by about 1.1 dB and outperforms the adaptive intra refresh algorithm by approximately 1.6 dB at the packet loss rate 10 %.", "paper_title": "Error-resilient multi-view video coding using Wyner-Ziv techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000360377200025"}
