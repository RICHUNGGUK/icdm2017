The L-curve and the generalized cross-validation methods were evaluated as automatic regularization parameter selection techniques. The inversion using regularization produced better results than conventional B-mode imaging for high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). A lower bound of 30 dB for the SNR was found for this study, below which several of the image features were lost during the reconstruction process in order to control the distortion due to the noise.", "paper_title": "A regularized inverse approach to ultrasonic pulse-echo imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000237980700004"}
