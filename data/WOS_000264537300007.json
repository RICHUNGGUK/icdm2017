Many of these systems are inspired by biological systems, and all attempt to use the simplest components and environments possible, while still being capable of achieving their goals. The canonical problems for such biologically-inspired systems are shape assembly and path finding. In this paper, we demonstrate path finding in the well-studied tile assembly model, a model of molecular self-assembly that is strictly simpler than other biologically-inspired models. As in related work, our systems function in the presence of obstacles and can be made fault-tolerant. The path-finding systems use (sic) (1) distinct components and find minimal-length paths in time linear in the length of the path. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
