These outliers can be sparse outliers, isolated or non-isolated outlier clusters. The non-isolated outlier clusters pose a great challenge to the development of an automatic outlier detection method since such outliers are attached to the scanned data points from the object surface and difficult to be distinguished from these valid surface measurement points. This paper presents an effective outlier detection method based on the principle of majority voting. The method is able to detect non-isolated outlier clusters as well as the other types of outliers in a scanned point cloud. The key component is a majority voting scheme that can cut the connection between non-isolated outlier clusters and the scanned surface so that non-isolated outliers become isolated. An expandable boundary criterion is also proposed to remove isolated outliers and preserve valid point clusters more reliably than a simple cluster size threshold. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated by comparing with several existing methods using a variety of scanned point clouds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
