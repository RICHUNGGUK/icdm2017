A comprehensive comparative study has been carried out to show the performance of the MBA over other recognized optimizers in terms of computational effort (measured as the number of function evaluations) and function value (accuracy). Sixteen constrained benchmark and engineering design problems have been solved and the obtained results were compared with other well-known optimizers. The obtained results demonstrate that, the proposed MBA requires less number of function evaluations and in most cases gives better results compared to other considered algorithms.
