The general intractability of the QCSP has motivated the pursuit of restricted cases that avoid its maximal complexity. In this paper, we introduce and study a new model for investigating QCSP complexity in which the types of constraints given by the existentially quantified variables, is restricted. Our primary technical contribution is the development and application of a general technology for proving positive results on parameterizations of the model, of inclusion in the complexity class coNP.
