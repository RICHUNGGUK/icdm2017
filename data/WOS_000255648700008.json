DODDLE-OWL refers to existing ontologies and supports the semi-automatic construction of taxonomic and other relationships in domain ontologies from documents. Integrating several modules, DODDLE-OWL is a practical and interactive domain ontology development environment. In order to evaluate the efficiency of DODDLE-OWL, we compared DODDLE-OWL with popular manual-building method. In order to evaluate the scalability of DODDLE-OWL, we constructed a large sized ontology over 34,000 concepts in the field of rocket operation using DODDLE-OWL. Through the above evaluation, we confirmed the efficiency and the scalability of DODDLE-OWL. Currently, DODDLE-OWL is open source software in Java and has 100 and more users from 20 and more countries.", "paper_title": "DODDLE-OWL: Interactive domain ontology development with open source software in Java", "paper_id": "WOS:000255648700008"}
