Let t(H) = (t(H(n)))(n=0)(infinity) denote the Thue-Morse sequence. In this paper we study the ncomplexity of the sequences t(H) = (t(H(n)))(n=0)(infinity), when H(n)is an element of Q[n] is a polynomial with H(N) subset of N. In particular, we solve an open problem of Allouche and Shallit regarding (t(n)2)(n=o)(infinity). We also study the vector space over Z/2Z, spanned by the sequences t(H). (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
