However, the significant improvements achieved in sensing technologies have allowed an increasing size of the terrain databases. These increasing sizes represent a serious drawback when terrain data must be transmitted and rendered at interactive rates. In this paper, we propose a novel wavelet-tiled pyramid for compressing terrain data that replaces the traditional multiresolution pyramid usually used in wavelet compression schemes. The new wavelet-tiled pyramid modifies the wavelet analysis and synthesis processes, allowing an efficient transmission and reconstruction of terrain data in those applications based on multiresolution tiled pyramids. A comparative performance evaluation with the currently existing techniques shows that the proposed scheme obtains a better compression ratio of the terrain data, reducing the storage space and transmission bandwidth required, and achieving a better visual quality of the virtual terrain reconstructed after data decompression.", "paper_title": "Terrain data compression using wavelet-tiled pyramids for online 3D terrain visualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000326562300011"}
