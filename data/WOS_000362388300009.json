This paper presents a computation-aware algorithm for scalable video coding with spatial/quality scalability aiming for the best trade-off between rate distortion performance and computational consumption. We first observe and analyze and then establish a model for the motion vector difference relationship between the scalable base and enhancement layers. By using the modeling results, a linear algorithm for computation distribution is thus proposed to allocate the computation for each macroblock in the enhancement layer. In addition, the rate distortion costs of the base layer are also taken into account for the computation allocation process in order to further improve the coding performance. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed computation-aware algorithm not only accomplishes better rate distortion performance than other works under the same computational constraints, but also achieves less computation necessities.
