We have dealt with the momentum equation and the divergence free constraint in a new manner by rewriting the original equations. The originality of the proposed approach is that we have used different numerical methods to evaluate the evolution of the velocity and pressure. Compared with some established methods, the proposed approach is parameter-free, more flexible and can avoid the difficulties caused by the original equations. The stability analysis of the method is performed to show that our method is stable. Finally, numerical experiments are given to show the accuracy, efficiency and validness of this method for variable density incompressible flows. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
