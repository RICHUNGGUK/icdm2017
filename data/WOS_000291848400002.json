It is shown that, in the presence of at least two actions, the collection of process equations over BCCSP with the priority operator that are valid modulo bisimilarity, irrespective of the chosen priority order over actions, is not finitely based. This holds true even if one restricts oneself to the collection of valid process equations that do not contain occurrences of process variables. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
