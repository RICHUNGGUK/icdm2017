SREE is intended for meeting the application's sensing objectives, where sensor nodes are densely deployed and have the determinate accuracy requirement. The primary contribution of this paper is active group head node selection with round-robin procedure, which increases the sensing accuracy and distributes the nodes energy consumption. The second contribution is using energy efficient intermediate node selection by considering both group size and energy consumption. We present the design of SREE and provide simulation results.", "paper_title": "A sensing resolution-based energy efficient communication protocol for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300105"}
