Unlike existing algorithms, the folded product will conform to the surface of the target polyhedron without external flaps. The crease patterns of frusta are drawn first and then composed by the algorithm to draw the crease pattern of the rotationally symmetric polyhedron. The composition is performed by splitting creases that were folded on pleats from frustum crease patterns. A CAD program has been written to implement the algorithm automatically, allowing users to specify a target polyhedron and generate a crease pattern that folds into it. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
