The Boolean network is considered as one of the simplest discrete dynamical systems and is often used as a model of genetic networks. It is known that detection of a fixed point in a Boolean network with n nodes and maximum indegree K can be polynomially transformed into (K + 1)-SAT with n variables. In this paper, we focus on the case of K = 2 and present an O(1.3171(n)) expected time algorithm, which is faster than the naive algorithm based on a reduction to 3-SAT. where we assume that nodes with indegree 2 do not contain self-loops. We also show an algorithm for the general case of K = 2 that is slightly faster than the naive algorithm.", "paper_title": "On Finding a Fixed Point in a Boolean Network with Maximum Indegree 2", "paper_id": "WOS:000269648400005"}
