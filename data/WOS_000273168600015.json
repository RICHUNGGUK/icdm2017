In lattice QCD calculation of physical quantities on a given configuration demands us to solve the Dirac equation with multiple sources. We show that a new block Krylov subspace algorithm recently proposed by the authors reduces the computational cost significantly without losing numerical accuracy for the solution of the O(a)-improved Wilson-Dirac equation.
