Using this new idea, the notion of interval valued (alpha, beta)-fuzzy H-v-ideal in an H-v-ring, which is a generalization of a fuzzy H-v-ideal, is defined and related properties are investigated. In particular, the study of interval valued (is an element of, is an element of vq)-fuzzy H-v-ideal in an H-v-ring is dealt with. Finally, we consider the concept of implication-based interval valued fuzzy H-v-ideal in an H-v-ring.", "paper_title": "Generalized fuzzy H-v-ideals of H-v-rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000256767200004"}
