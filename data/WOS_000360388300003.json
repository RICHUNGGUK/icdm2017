The corresponding extremal graphs are characterized completely. Then we explore the -decomposition for the reciprocal sum-degree distance. Finally, we establish formulas for the reciprocal sum-degree distance of join and the Cartesian product of graphs.", "paper_title": "Some results on the reciprocal sum-degree distance of graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000360388300003"}
