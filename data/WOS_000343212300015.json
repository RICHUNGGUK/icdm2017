We prove necessary and sufficient conditions of finite-time stability and finite-time boundedness with non-zero initial state for nonlinear descriptor systems. Using Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy dynamic models and proposed sufficient conditions, we define fuzzy sets and use linear matrix inequalities to satisfy differential linear matrix inequalities. A simulation confirms efficiency and precision of the given method.", "paper_title": "Finite-time fuzzy stabilisation and control for nonlinear descriptor systems with non-zero initial state", "paper_id": "WOS:000343212300015"}
