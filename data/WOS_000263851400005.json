This study reveals that increasing amounts of waste LCD glass incorporated into concrete increases WGCLSM fluidity and reduces the setting time, resulting in good working properties. By increasing the glass to sand replacement ratio, the compressive strength decreases to achieve low-strength effects. Furthermore, the electrical resistance also rises as a result of increasing the glass to sand replacement ratio. Early-high-strength WGCSLM aged 28 days has twice the electrical resistance compared to general WGCSLM. Early-high-strength WGCSLM aged 7 days has a higher ultrasonic pulse velocity similar to WGCSLM aged 28 days. The variation of length with age of different compositions is all within the tolerance range of 0.025%. This study demonstrates that the proper composition ratio of waste LCD glass to sand in early-high-strength WGCSLM can be determined by using different amounts of glass-sand. A mechanism for LCD optical waste glass usage can be established to achieve industrial waste minimization, resource recycling, and economic security.", "paper_title": "Study of thin film transition liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) optical waste glass applied in early-high-strength controlled low strength materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000263851400005"}
