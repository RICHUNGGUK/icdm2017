The aim is to improve fault-tolerant capability by selecting subcodes in communications and storage systems. One application is to serve a suitable code for the realization of the transport format combination indicators (TFCIs) of code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems. Another application is in the field of address retrieval on optical media.", "paper_title": "On the Optimum Distance Profiles About Linear Block Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000275561000007"}
