Mobile workforces do not work at a fixed area in a company and they have to visit customers or sell their products in public areas. Therefore, it is important for these enterprises to properly allocate their mobile workforces and leverage their collaborative cooperation. In this paper, we present a novel mechanism, named the collaborative ART learning (CART), which drives social-awareness collaboration between mobile workforces in a public area (e.g., an exhibition center). Because of the characteristics of a pubic working space, this method is situated in a wireless P2P network environment. The mobile workforce peers self-organize dynamically into appropriate collaborative work groups to accomplish tasks on demand. With CART, each peer of a task group receives adjustments of recognized capability levels after the task assigned is completed. CART learns the way to organize filling collaborative work groups through cycles of problem solving and work force status adopting, leading to continued satisfactory collaborative performance.", "paper_title": "Self-organizing contextualized mobile workforce management with collaborative art learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000242538100001"}
