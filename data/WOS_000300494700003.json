We show that by using a cardinality operator in the GNF we obtain the new representation CGNF that allows a natural and efficient Boolean encoding for n-ary finite discrete extensional CSPs. We prove that the space complexity of a CSP encoded in the CGNF is identical to its space complexity when it is expressed in the classical CSP representation. We prove that the generalized resolution rule applies for the CGNF encoding and introduce a new inference rule whose application until saturation achieves arc-consistency in a linear time complexity for n-ary CSP expressed in the CGNF encoding. Two enumerative methods for solving CSP instances encoded in this Boolean framework are studied: the first one (equivalent to MAC in CSPs) maintains full arc-consistency at each node of the search tree while the second (equivalent to FC in CSPs) performs partial arc-consistency on each node. Both methods are experimented and compared on some instances of the Ramsey problem, randomly generated 3/4-ary CSPs and promising results are obtained. We also adapted the notion of clause learning defined in SAT for the CGNF encoding. Finally, we show how the proposed inference rule can be used to achieve Path-consistency in the case of binary CSPs encoded in CGNF, and how it can be used to enforce strong path consistency when it is combined with the generalized resolution rule.", "paper_title": "Dealing with Satisfiability and n-ary CSPs in a Logical Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000300494700003"}
