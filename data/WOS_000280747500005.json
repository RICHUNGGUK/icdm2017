The scheme formulated in time domain theoretically preserves the properties of zero-divergence, symplecticity, and dispersion relation. The mathematically inherent Hamiltonian can be also retained all the time. Moreover, both spatial and temporal terms are approximated to yield the equal fourth-order spatial and temporal accuracies. Through the computational exercises, modified equation analysis and Fourier analysis, it can be clearly demonstrated that the proposed triple-preserving solver is computationally accurate and efficient for use to predict the Maxwell's solutions.
