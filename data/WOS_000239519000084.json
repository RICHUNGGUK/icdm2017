The aim of the project was to produce an accessible web-based study product, as well as to clarify the sign language students' deepening of knowledge and conceptualization related to the subject of cinematic expression, as well as their collaboration during the web-based course. The aim of the design research was connected to the general aim of inclusion, for a shared university for all, which adapts flexibly to the needs of different and diverse students. The design research was positioned in the areas of film art and pedagogy. By merging participatory action research and WWW production a collaborative study concept dealing with cinematic expression entitled, CinemaSense, was developed and produced as part of the research work. It can be accessed at http://elokuvantaju.uiah.fi/. The usability and accessibility of the CinemaSense was observed during web-based courses in cinematic expression during 2001, with the help of a concept survey and network-based communication.", "paper_title": "Searching knowledge CinemaSense as a case study in collaborative production of a WWW service in two universities", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000084"}
