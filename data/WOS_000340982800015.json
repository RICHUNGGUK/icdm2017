The proposed approach detects anomalies based on a hierarchical activity-pattern discovery framework, comprehensively considering both global and local spatio-temporal contexts. The discovery is a coarse-to-fine learning process with unsupervised methods for automatically constructing normal activity patterns at different levels. A unified anomaly energy function is designed based on these discovered activity patterns to identify the abnormal level of an input motion pattern. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the UCSD anomaly-detection datasets and compare the performance with existing work. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
