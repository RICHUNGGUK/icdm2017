The influence of geometrical, material and loading parameters on the impact response is investigated using validated numerical models. Results are quantified in terms of important impact response parameters and indicate that the foam filler stabilizes the crushing process and thus improves the energy absorption capacity. The superior performance of foam-filled conical tubes as impact energy absorbers is evident from the results. The research information generated will be useful in developing guidance towards the design of these devices in impact applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
