Two new concepts, same points and inverse points, are defined for this analysis. The basic properties of fuzzy distance, ideas about the containment of a fuzzy point on a fuzzy line segment and the coincidence of two fuzzy points are also described. A linear combination of two fuzzy points is introduced to define a fuzzy line segment. The fuzzy point dividing a fuzzy line segment in a given ratio is also investigated. All the discussion points are supported by suitable examples. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Analytical fuzzy plane geometry I", "paper_id": "WOS:000310411300005"}
