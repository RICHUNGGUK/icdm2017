This graph can be viewed as the graph of the d-dimensional torus. We prove that one can delete a fraction of at most O(log d/m) of the vertices of G so that no topologically non-trivial cycles remain. This is tight tip to the log d factor and improves earlier estimates by various researchers.", "paper_title": "Economical Elimination of Cycles in the Torus", "paper_id": "WOS:000269984900002"}
