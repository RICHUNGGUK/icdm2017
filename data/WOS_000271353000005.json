One drawback of this model is that large cognitive maps are difficult to exploit and understand. This paper introduces an ontological cognitive map model that enables the designer to organize concepts in an ontology. On the one hand, this model provides an ontological influence mechanism that shows the influence from any concept of the ontology to any other according to the map. The map is then easier to exploit. On the other hand, the ontology is used for providing a synthetical view of a map. The map is then easier to understand.", "paper_title": "ONTOLOGICAL COGNITIVE MAP", "paper_id": "WOS:000271353000005"}
