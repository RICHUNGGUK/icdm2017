In the proposed technique two identical CMOS LC-voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) are coupled in an in-phase anti-phase manner via the substrates of the MOS varactors. Use of substrates (in other words the intrinsic gate-bulk capacitances) of the MOS varactors for coupling, results in elimination of any extra coupling elements and also their associated noises. Utilizing the proposed technique, a quadrature VCO (QVCO) is designed and simulated in TSMC 0.18 mu m RF-CMOS technology. The phase noise of the proposed LC-QVCO is -137.5 dBc/Hz at 3 MHz frequency offset from 5.4 GHz center frequency, while the total DC current drawn from a 1.8-V power supply is 8.37 mA. Generalizing the proposed coupling scheme to several identical LC-VCOs, low-phase noise multiphase signals can be generated. The proposed circuits can operate with power supplies as low as 0.6 V without any performance degradation.", "paper_title": "A new coupling scheme for multiphase and quadrature signals generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000310639400035"}
