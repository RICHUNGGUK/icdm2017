Based on an adaptive fuzzy backstepping control method, a dynamic sliding mode control is proposed to compensate and adjust the external disturbances and model uncertainties. The fuzzy control method with adaptive backstepping controller can approximate the system nonlinearities well without accurate system model and. It can make the controller have the ability to learn and adjust the fuzzy parameters in real time. In addition, dynamic sliding mode control can transfer discontinuous terms to the first-order derivative of the control input in order to effectively reduce the chattering. Simulation studies are investigated to demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Fuzzy Backstepping Control of MEMS Gyroscope Using Dynamic Sliding Mode Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000377535700003"}
