It is based on the assumption that the priority of a job in the initial sequence is given by the sum of its processing times on the bottleneck machines. The initial sequence of jobs thus generated is further improved using a new job insertion technique. We show, through computational experimentation, that the proposed method significantly outperforms the best-known heuristics while retaining its time complexity of O(n(2)). Statistical tests of significance are used to confirm the improvement in solution quality. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
