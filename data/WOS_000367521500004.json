In order to give a detailed description of dune wake flow, the instantaneous velocity, vorticity, and pressure were decomposed into the large-, intermediate-and relatively small-scale components by 3D wavelet multi-resolution technique. To get a further understanding of coherent structure, the decomposed wavelet components were employed to calculate Q-criterion. It was found that the rollers and horse-shoe structures in the separation bubble were mainly contributed from large-scale structures and it made the most significance to the vorticity concentration. The observations of intermediate-scale horse-shoe structures indicated that the coherent structure was the combined effect of large-and intermediate-scale structures. Besides, from the visualization of 3D streamlines and pressure iso-surfaces, the separation bubble and pressure distribution are found to be dominated by large-scale structure.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional wavelet analysis on turbulent structure of dune wake flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000367521500004"}
