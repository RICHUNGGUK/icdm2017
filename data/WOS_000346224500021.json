In this paper, we revealed the correlation coefficient of 20 factors critical in the product design process and the quality of design creativity via investigation of the design processes and outcomes of 30 senior student designers. Six closely related factors were identified as variables to calculate the design creativity. An assessment formula was proposed: the corresponding correlation coefficient is the weight factor of each variable, and the sum represents the design creativity degree. Our quantitative approach can improve the validity and reliability of assessment of creativity in product design. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
