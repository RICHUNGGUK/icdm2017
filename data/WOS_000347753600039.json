HeCoS is a new variant of cuckoo search algorithm with heterogeneous searching strategies based on the quantum mechanism. Through the experimental analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a balance between exploration and exploitation. Comparing with other existing methods, we achieve that iTaSuM can generate good fuzzy system model with high accuracy and strong generalization ability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
