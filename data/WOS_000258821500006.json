We first introduce a simple logical language which makes it possible to express that a fact causes another fact and that a fact explains another fact. We present a set of formal inference patterns from causal statements to explanation statements. We introduce an elementary ontology which gives greater expressiveness to the system while staying close to propositional reasoning. We provide an inference system that captures the patterns discussed, firstly in a purely propositional framework, then in a datalog (limited predicate) framework.", "paper_title": "Ontology-based inference for causal explanation", "paper_id": "WOS:000258821500006"}
