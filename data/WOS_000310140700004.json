Sparse representations of images have shown to be efficient approaches for image recovery. Following this idea, in this paper, we propose to learn a dictionary from the logarithmic transformed image, and then to use it in a variational model built for noise removal. Extensive experimental results suggest that in terms of visual quality, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and mean absolute deviation error, the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Multiplicative Noise Removal via a Learned Dictionary", "paper_id": "WOS:000310140700004"}
