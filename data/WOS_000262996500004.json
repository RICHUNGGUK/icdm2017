Gaining, secure access to 3G services from 802.11 WLANs is a primary challenge for this new integrated wireless technology. Successful execution of 3G security algorithms can be limited to a specified area by encrypting a user's authentication challenge with spatial data defining his visited WLAN. With limited capacity to determine a user's location only to within a current cell and restrictions on accessing users' location due to privacy. 3G operators Must rely on spatial data sent from visited WLANs to implement spatial authentication control. A potential risk is presented to 3G operators since no prior relationship or trust may exist with a WLAN owner. Algorithms to quantify the trust between all parties of 3G-WLAN integrated networks are presented to further secure user authentication. Ad-hoc serving networks and the trust relationships established between mobile users are explored to define stronger algorithms for 3G-WLAN user authentication.", "paper_title": "Secure authentication in heterogeneous wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262996500004"}
