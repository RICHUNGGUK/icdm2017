Such loads are encountered in plants and trees, cereal crop plants such as wheat and corn in particular. The wind loads acting on the grain-bearing spike of a wheat stalk vary with the orientation of the spike as the stalk bends; this bending and the ensuing change in orientation depend on the deformation of the plant under the same load. The uprooting of the wheat stalks under wind loads is an unresolved problem in genetically modified dwarf wheat stalks. Although it was thought that the dwarf varieties would acquire increased resistance to uprooting, it was found that the dwarf wheat plants selectively decreased the Young's modulus in order to be compliant. The motivation of this study is to investigate why wheat plants prefer compliant stems. We analyze this by seeking an optimal shape of the wheat plant's stem, which is modeled as a cantilever beam, by taking the large deflection of the stem into account with the help of co-rotational finite element beam modeling. The criteria considered here include minimum moment at the fixed ground support, adequate stiffness and strength, and the volume of material. The result reported here is an example of flexibility, rather than stiffness, leading to increased strength.", "paper_title": "Size optimization of a cantilever beam under deformation-dependent loads with application to wheat stalks", "paper_id": "WOS:000268315300007"}
