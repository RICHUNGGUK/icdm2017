By taking full advantage of the characteristics of the packet-based transmission in NCSs, new network delay compensation approaches are proposed to actively compensate the network communication delay under the fuzzy control framework. The nonlinear plant is represented by a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model, and the predictive control input packets are constructed based on parallel distributed compensation technique. Both state and output feedback fuzzy delay compensation controllers are designed. Finally, two examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the developed techniques.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Delay Compensation Control for T-S Fuzzy Systems Over Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000317643500021"}
