Large program codes require large memories, which increase the size and cost of the chip. In addition, the power consumption is increased due to higher memory I/O bandwidth. Program compression is one of the most often used methods to reduce the size of the program code. In this paper, dictionary-based program compression is evaluated on a customizable processor architecture with parallel resources. In addition to code density, the effectiveness of the method is evaluated in terms of area and power consumption. Furthermore, a mechanism is proposed to maintain the programmability after compression. Up to 77% reduction in area and 73% reduction in power consumption of the program memory and the associated control logic were obtained. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
