It is applicable to a wide variety of integrals without restrictions and is readily generalized to higher-dimensional problems. The feasibility of the method results from a reinterpretation of the density of states in statistical physics to an appropriate measure for numerical integration. The properties of this algorithm as a new kind of Monte Carlo integration scheme are investigated with some simple integrals, and a potential application of the method is illustrated by the evaluation of integrals arising in perturbation theory of quantum many-body systems.
