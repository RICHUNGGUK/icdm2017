The RTS4 is initiated by system analysis ascertaining functional requirements, which is sequentially followed by conceptual model, pattern languages, concrete pattern-based design, implementations and applications. The proposed conceptual model helps sketch out a core software skeleton in relation to prior system requirement analysis. Of the proposed pattern languages, each can be regarded as a 'building block' on which the concrete pattern-based design is built. Finally, the RTS4 is implemented by following the proposed pattern-oriented design. The applicability of RTS4 is demonstrated with respect to storm sewer simulation and real-time operations. The results of the simulation show that the proposed pattern-oriented approach offers a promising basis for software system developments such as RTS4.", "paper_title": "A pattern-oriented approach to development of a real-time storm sewer simulation system with an SWMM model", "paper_id": "WOS:000282659200004"}
