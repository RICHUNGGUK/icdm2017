This law affected the Basque nationalist party \"Batasuna'', due to its proved relation with ETA. In this paper, taking data from the Euskobarometro (Basque Country survey) related to the attitude of the Basque population towards ETA, we propose a dynamic model for the pre-LPP scenario. This model will be extrapolated to the future in order to predict what would have happened to the attitude of the Basque population if the law had not been passed. These model predictions will be compared to post-LPP data from the Euskobarometro using a bootstrapping approach in order to quantify the effect of the LPP on the attitude of Basque Country population towards ETA.
