We model the quantum dynamics of a system described by a nearest neighbor tight-binding formulism, and apply the non-equilibrium Green's function technique to calculate the electronic transport properties, in which the non-equilibrium (transmitted) electronic density is self-consistently determined by solving Poisson's equation in capacitive network modeling. Numerical results find that the transmission spectrum of the quasicrystalline nanotube illustrates crossover characteristics from local order (like in periodic lattices) to global disorder (like in amorphous solids) with varying energy. Moreover, the electronic transport properties of nanoprobes through multiple atomic channels follow the rule of Landauer's formula. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
