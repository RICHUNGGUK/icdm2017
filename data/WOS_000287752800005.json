Research in this field has mainly adopted techniques based on supervised learning algorithms, but these systems suffer from scalability issues with respect to the number of considered activities and contextual data. In this paper, we propose a solution based on the use of ontologies and ontological reasoning combined with statistical inferencing. Structured symbolic knowledge about the environment surrounding the user allows the recognition system to infer which activities among the candidates identified by statistical methods are more likely to be the actual activity that the user is performing. Ontological reasoning is also integrated with statistical methods to recognize complex activities that cannot be derived by statistical methods alone. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is supported by experiments with a complete implementation of the system using commercially available sensors and an Android-based handheld device as the host for the main activity recognition module.", "paper_title": "COSAR: hybrid reasoning for context-aware activity recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000287752800005"}
