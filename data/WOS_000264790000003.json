The main objective of our study is to look into the validity of LES for the assessment of vehicle aerodynamics, especially in the context of its possibility for unsteady or transient aerodynamic forces. Firstly, the aerodynamic LES proposed is quantitatively validated on the ASMO simplified model by comparing the mean pressure distributions on the vehicle surface with those obtained by a conventional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulation (RANS) or a wind tunnel measurement. Then, the method is applied to the full-scale vehicle with complicated geometry to qualitatively investigate the capability of capturing organized flow structures around the vehicle. Finally, unsteady aerodynamic forces acting on the vehicle in transient yawing angle change are estimated and relationship between the flow structures and the transient aerodynamic forces is mentioned. As a result, it is demonstrated that LES will be a powerful tool for the vehicle aerodynamic assessment in the foreseeable future, because it can provide precious aerodynamic data which conventional wind tunnel tests or RANS simulations are difficult to provide.
