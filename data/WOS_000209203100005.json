The theoretical foundation of this topic is that under what conditions two sample sets can be separated in Banach space. In this paper, motivated by developing new support vector machine (SVM) in Banach space, we present a necessary and sufficient condition of separating two finite classes of samples by a hyper-plane in Banach space. We also present an attainable expression of maximal margin of the separating hyper-planes which includes some cases of the classes of infinite samples in Banach space.", "paper_title": "Separating theorem of samples in Banach space for support vector machine learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000209203100005"}
