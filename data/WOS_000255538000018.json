The objective is to simultaneously minimize makespan and total tardiness of jobs. By constructing the corresponding relation between real vector and the chromosome obtained by using priority rule-based representation method, job shop scheduling is converted into a continuous optimization problem. We then design a Pareto archive particle swarm optimization, in which the global best position selection is combined with the crowding measure-based archive maintenance. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a set of benchmark problems and the computational results show that the proposed particle swarm optimization is capable of producing a number of high-quality Pareto optimal scheduling plans.
