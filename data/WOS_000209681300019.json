A low complexity subchannel assignment is followed by an optimal power allocation that is obtained via a single non-linear equation. The proposed algorithm has the same computational complexity as the best algorithm in the literature for the same problem but with minimum rate constraints. While the convergence of the algorithm in the literature is not guaranteed, the algorithm in this paper is proven to converge. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm out-performs the one in the literature when the rate constraints are ignored.", "paper_title": "Frequency and Power Allocation for Energy Efficient OFDMA Systems with Proportional Rate Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681300019"}
