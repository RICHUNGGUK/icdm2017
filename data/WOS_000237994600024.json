In this paper, we propose a new dynamic multicast routing problem under delay constraints (DMR-DC) for finding an optimal light-forest with the minimum multicast cost from these links with available wavelengths for routing a multicast request that arrives in random with a given delay bound in a WDM network with heterogeneous light splitting capabilities, where a light-forest is a set of light-trees used to set up switches to route the request. Multicast cost is defined by communication cost ratio and wavelength consumption ratio. The problem is to determine a light-forest with less wavelength consumption and less communication cost. This problem is NP-hard because it can be reduced from the minimum Steiner tree problem. In this paper, we propose an efficient three-phase (generation, refinement, and conversion) solution model to find approximate solutions in a reasonable time. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
