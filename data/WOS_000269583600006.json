In this process, an iron nitrate nonahydrate solution in isopropyl alcohol with a concentration of (400 mu gr/milt) was used to catalyst nanoparticle formation on an oxidized silicon wafer. The oxide on the substrate was made of a thick layer of wet oxide sandwiched between two thin layers of dry oxide. The process results in semiconducting Single-Walled carbon NanoTabes (SWNTs) with diameters of less than 0.7 nm and more than a 1 ev band gap energy, which are amongst the smallest diameters of SWNTs ever reported.", "paper_title": "CVD Synthesis of Small-Diameter Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes on Silicon", "paper_id": "WOS:000269583600006"}
