Research in the last 50 years has served to clarify the sources of visual and nonvisual information that contribute to successful steering, but has yet to determine how this information is optimally combined under conditions of uncertainty. Here, we test the conditions under which a locomotor robot with a mobile camera can steer effectively using simple visual and extra-retinal parameters to examine how such models cope with the noisy real-world visual and motor estimates that are available to humans. This applied modeling gives us an insight into both the advantages and limitations of using active gaze to sample information when steering.", "paper_title": "Modeling Locomotor Control: The Advantages of Mobile Gaze", "paper_id": "WOS:000289362900001"}
