Due to the nature of scale-free network, newly defined reverse-query message will cover more than 80% of all the clients, with relaying reverse-query message under probability as low as 10%, being effective to reduce the total traffic generated by query propagation. This platform is built on percolation theory to propagate the message and contents, which each agent on P2P client relays reverse-query to randomly selected peers. This can be applied for quasi-broadcast platform on P2P network, and for business application, to flyer delivery over the Internet targeting common attributes such as residential area.", "paper_title": "Efficient stream delivery over unstructured overlay network by reverse-query propagation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600036"}
