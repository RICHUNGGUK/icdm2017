When visualized by wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE), the sequence of frames that represents a contraction is characterized by a clear wrinkle structure in the central frames that corresponds to the folding of the intestinal wall. In this paper, we present a new method to robustly detect wrinkle frames in full WCE videos by using a new mid-level image descriptor that is based on a centrality measure proposed for graphs. We present an extended validation, carried out in a very large database, that shows that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance for this task.", "paper_title": "Detection of Wrinkle Frames in Endoluminal Videos Using Betweenness Centrality Measures for Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000344993100012"}
