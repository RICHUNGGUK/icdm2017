By discharging the charge of the capacitor connected between the input and output terminals of an amplifier before the output voltage of the amplifier exceeds its maximum range, the amplifier always operates in the active region and the Miller operation can be guaranteed. Thus a large value capacitor with a wide dynamic operation range can be realized using a small value capacitor. The Miller capacitor proposed in this paper is applied to a loop filter of phase locked loop (PLL) circuit that requires a large value capacitor to realize a low cutoff frequency. SPICE simulation of the PLL circuit using the Miller capacitor confirms the operation of the Miller capacitor and shows good performances that are similar to those obtained using a passive capacitor of a large value.", "paper_title": "Miller capacitor with wide input range and its application to PLL loop filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000242878600038"}
