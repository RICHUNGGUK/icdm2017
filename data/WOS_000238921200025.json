The vector MAC with a single antenna at the base station and multiple antennas at each user is shown to be equivalent to a scalar MAC. We also determine the capacity enhancement due to feedback at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the scalar and vector MAC for any number of users. Extensions of the high SNR results to the vector broadcast channel are also provided.", "paper_title": "On the capacity of the vector MAC with feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000238921200025"}
