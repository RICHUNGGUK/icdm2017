A widely used approach for statistical process monitoring in the case of autocorrelated data is the residual chart. This chart requires that a suitable model has been identified for the time series of process observations before residuals can be obtained. In this work, a new neural-based procedure, which is alleviated from the need for building a time series model, is introduced for quality control in the case of serially correlated data. In particular, the Elman's recurrent neural network is proposed for manufacturing process quality control. Performance comparisons between the neural-based algorithm and several control charts are also presented in the paper in order to validate the approach. Different magnitudes of the process mean shift, under the presence of various levels of autocorrelation, are considered. The simulation results indicate that the neural-based procedure may perform better than other control charting schemes in several instances for both small and large shifts. Given the simplicity of the proposed neural network and its adaptability, this approach is proved from simulation experiments to be a feasible alternative for quality monitoring in the case of autocorrelated process data.
