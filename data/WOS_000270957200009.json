The proposed solution is based on the basic reversed nested Miller compensation and exploits a voltage buffer and two nulling resistors in the compensation network, along with a feedforward stage to improve slewing and settling performance. A well-defined design procedure using the loop gain phase margin as the main design parameter is also developed. SPECTRE simulations on a three-stage amplifier are carried out and are found to be in excellent agreement with the theoretical analysis, showing a significant improvement of the proposed approach over traditional compensation strategies in terms of small-signal and large-signal performance. Monte Carlo simulation results finally prove the proposed technique to be well-guarded against process parameter variations.", "paper_title": "IMPROVED POWER-EFFICIENT RNMC TECHNIQUE WITH VOLTAGE BUFFER AND NULLING RESISTORS FOR LOW-POWER HIGH-LOAD THREE-STAGE AMPLIFIERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000270957200009"}
