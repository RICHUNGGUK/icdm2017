The importance of this model is that each muscle fiber has a separate neural input. This model is robust and accounts for the neural activity for both large and small saccades. The muscle fiber model consists of serial sequences of muscle fibers in parallel with other serial sequences of muscle fibers. Each muscle fiber is described by a parallel combination of a linear length tension element, viscous element and active state tension generator.", "paper_title": "A NEW LINEAR MUSCLE FIBER MODEL FOR NEURAL CONTROL OF SACCADES", "paper_id": "WOS:000317626200001"}
