The proof does not require choice and can be understood in any of the usual varieties of constructive mathematics. Classical (dis) continuity is a weakening of the notion of (dis) continuity, where the existential quantifiers are replaced by negated universal quantifiers. We also show that the classical continuity of all functions is equivalent to the negation of the weak limited principle of omniscience. We use this to relate uniform continuity and searchability of the Cantor space.", "paper_title": "Constructive decidability of classical continuity", "paper_id": "WOS:000360469600008"}
