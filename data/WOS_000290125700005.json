By using the multiplexer, the proposed FIR filter and interpolator can provide high clock frequency and low hardware complexity. A binary representation method was used for designing the high order FIR filter. Also, in order to compensate the truncation error of FIR filter outputs, a fixed-point range detection method was used. The proposed partially folded architecture was designed and implemented with 90-nm CMOS technology that had a supply voltage of 1.1 V. The implementation results show that the proposed architectures have 12% and 16% less hardware complexity than the other kinds of architecture. Also, both the filter and the interpolator operate at a clock frequency of 200 MHz and 385 MHz, respectively.", "paper_title": "Low Complexity Filter Architecture for ATSC Terrestrial Broadcasting DTV Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125700005"}
