The filter antenna module is designed as a second order filter, with the output resonator loaded with the radiating element. The design procedure is developed in three stages, which are explained in detail through the design of two filter-antenna modules with different electrical specifications. The integrated filter-antenna response of the designed modules is verified through electromagnetic simulations and experimental results. One of the designed modules is fabricated and measured. Measurement results yield central frequency of 1.94 GHz, -10 dB-fractional bandwidth of 1.55 % and directive radiation pattern with maximum gain of 4.87 dBi and front-to-back ratio of 25.60 dB. These experimental results present good agreement with electromagnetic simulations.", "paper_title": "Design procedure of a filter-antenna module implemented in substrate integrated waveguide technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000310639400025"}
