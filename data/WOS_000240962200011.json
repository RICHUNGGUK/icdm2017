After reviewing the lessons and experiences of success and failure in the Internet and summarizing related work, we analyze the basic targets of providing trustworthiness and controllability. Then, the anticipant architecture is introduced. Based on the resulting design, several trustworthy and controllable mechanisms are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Research on network architecture with trustworthiness and controllability", "paper_id": "WOS:000240962200011"}
