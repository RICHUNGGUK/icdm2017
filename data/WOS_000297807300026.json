Such channels are motivated by storage applications in which the spatial resolution of the reader may be insufficient to isolate adjacent symbols. Reading symbols as pairs changes the coding-theoretic error model from the standard bounded number of symbol errors to a bounded number of pair errors. Starting from the most basic coding-theoretic questions, the paper studies codes that protect against pair-errors. It provides answers on pair-error correctability conditions, code construction and decoding, and lower and upper bounds on code sizes. Asymptotic analysis of pair-error correction shows that there exist pair-error codes with rates that are strictly higher than the best known codes in the Hamming metric.", "paper_title": "Codes for Symbol-Pair Read Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000297807300026"}
