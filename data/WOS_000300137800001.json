Since there exist different wired/wireless technologies for Internet access such as digital subscriber line (DSL), Ethernet, and worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMax), a mobile host can use multiple access networks simultaneously with multipath transmission. Taking the advantage of heterogeneous environment, multipath transmission through the Internet can improve service reliability and network flexibility. Ensuring a reliable end-to-end connection-oriented communication with satisfactory quality of service (QoS) and maintaining congestion control and flow control are the main responsibilities of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the dominant transport layer protocol in the Internet. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art of multipath transmission techniques for QoS provisioning in wireless Internet access, focusing on the end-to-end transport layer protocols. The main challenges for the design of multipath TCP are reviewed, and the existing transport layer congestion control schemes are categorized. Multipath TCP and stream control transmission protocol (SCTP)-based transport layer protocols are discussed, and their limitations and/or impractical assumptions are addressed. Open research issues on the development of an effective, efficient, and practical multipath TCP protocol are summarized.", "paper_title": "Multipath Transmission for Wireless Internet Access - From an End-to-End Transport Layer Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000300137800001"}
