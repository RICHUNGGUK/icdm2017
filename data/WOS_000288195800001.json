The solution is developed based on the tools of invariant set analysis and Lyapunov-function method. As an integral part of the solution, we derive less conservative sufficient conditions on robust attractor for discrete-time systems with delays in terms of strict linear matrix inequalities to guarantee the desired l(1)-performance. A robust state-feedback controller is designed and the associated gain is determined using strict LMIs. The developed results are tested on a representative example.", "paper_title": "Persistent bounded disturbance rejection for discrete-time delay systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000288195800001"}
