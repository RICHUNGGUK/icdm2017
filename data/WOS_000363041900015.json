Therefore, improving the performance of these algorithms is an important issue. In this paper, we design an intensity-based contraction (IC) algorithm that works in combination with other machine-learning algorithms in model-based collaborative filtering, which is currently the most popular filtering algorithm. The main challenges for this algorithm are sparseness of the database and lack of scalability. To demonstrate how IC is used, we implemented IC clustering as an example, which can effectively reduce the sparseness of the database and improve the efficiency. Moreover, we created a scalable IC on a MapReduce model, the scalability of which is demonstrated with actual experiments.", "paper_title": "Improved collaborative filtering with intensity-based contraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000363041900015"}
