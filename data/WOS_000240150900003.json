Design/methodology/approach - Using the FSEM, the effective strain field of flat rolled wire is predicted for different reductions in height and frictional conditions. The validity of the method is assessed by performing the Vickers microhardness measurements on the flattened wire cross section. Also, the creation of macroscopic shear bands in cross section of the flat rolled wire is investigated and confirmed by microhardness and metallographic examinations. Moreover, the lateral spread and width of contact area are predicted by the FSEM for different reductions in height and frictional conditions. Findings - The FSEM and microhardness results show the minimum and the maximum effective strains at the round edge and center of the flattened wire, respectively. Also, the results show the bands of maximum effective strain at cross section of the flattened wire, i.e. macroscopic shear bands. Practical implications - This paper can be useful in rolling industries to produce electronic parts, various springs, trolley cables, piston rings, and guide rails. Originality/value - The paper shows the applicability of the FSEM for calculating the effective strain field and geometry of wire after wire flat rolling process.", "paper_title": "Applicability of the FSEM for analyzing wire flat rolling process", "paper_id": "WOS:000240150900003"}
