The traffic networks used are discrete time models which use green times at all the intersections throughout the considered period of oversaturation as the decision variables. The ACO algorithm finds intelligent timing plans which take care of dissipation of queues and removal of blockages as opposed to the sole cost minimization usually performed for undersaturation conditions. Two scenarios are considered and results are rigorously compared with solutions obtained using the genetic algorithm (GA), traditionally employed to solve oversaturated conditions. ACO is shown to be consistently more effective for a larger number of trials and to provide more reliable solutions. Further, as a master-slave parallelism is possible for the nature of ACO algorithm, its implementation is suggested to reduce the overall execution time allowing the opportunity to solve real-time signal control systems.", "paper_title": "Comparing Ant Colony Optimization and Genetic Algorithm Approaches for Solving Traffic Signal Coordination under Oversaturation Conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000298090800003"}
