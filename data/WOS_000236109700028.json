The approach makes use of a feature-enhanced string matching technique which takes full advantage of a huge number of sentence patterns in a Treebank. The first stage of the approach is a coarse-grained syntactic parsing which is complementary to a semantic dissimilarities analysis in its latter stage. The approach goes beyond shallow parsing to a deeper level of case role identification, while preserving robustness, without being bogged down into a complete linguistic analysis. The ideas described have been implemented and an evaluation of 5,000 Chinese sentences is examined in order to justify its significances.", "paper_title": "Shallow case role annotation using two-stage feature-enhanced string matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000236109700028"}
