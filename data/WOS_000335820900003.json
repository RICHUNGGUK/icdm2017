Given a source s and a destination t on a terrain, a shortest descending path from s to t is a path of minimum Euclidean length on the terrain subject to the constraint that the height decreases monotonically as we traverse that path from s to t. Given any epsilon is an element of (0, 1), our algorithm returns in O(n(4) log(n/epsilon)) time a descending path of length at most 1 + epsilon times the optimum. This is the first algorithm whose running time is polynomial in n and log(1/epsilon) and independent of the terrain geometry.", "paper_title": "APPROXIMATE SHORTEST DESCENDING PATHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000335820900003"}
