A new recursive algorithm is presented, which produces the minimal nonlinear feedback shift register of a given binary sequence. Moreover, it is shown that the eigenvalue profile of a sequence uniquely determines its nonlinear complexity profile, thus establishing a connection between Lempel-Ziv complexity and nonlinear complexity. Furthermore, a lower bound for the Lempel-Ziv compression ratio of a given sequence is proved that depends on its nonlinear complexity.", "paper_title": "On the Nonlinear complexity and Lempel-Ziv complexity of finite length sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000250448800036"}
