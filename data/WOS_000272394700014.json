It targets ultra-low complexity, cost, and power. for low-data-rate wireless connectivity. However, one of the main problems of this new standard is its insufficient, and inefficient, media access control (MAC) for priority data. This paper introduces an extended contention access period (XCAP) concept for priority packets, also an traffic adaptive contention differentiation utilizing the XCAP (TACDX). The TACDX determines appropriate transmission policy alternatively according to the traffic conditions and type of packet. TACDX,achieves not only enhanced transmission for priority packets but it also has a high energy efficiency for the overall network. The proposed TACDX is verified with simulations to measure the performances.", "paper_title": "Traffic Adaptive Contention Differentiation Scheme for LR-WPANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000272394700014"}
