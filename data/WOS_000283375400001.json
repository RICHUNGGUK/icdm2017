In this paper we enhance an existing list scheduling algorithm designed for minimising the workflow makespan with advance reservation-based negotiation functionality. As an instantiation of the new negotiation phase, we investigate two advance reservation functionality from the resource provider perspective: attentive and progressive. We illustrate through real-world experiments a two-fold benefit of our approach: improved execution predictability from the user's perspective, and higher resource utilisation fairness through a new progressive allocation strategy from the provider's perspective.", "paper_title": "Negotiation-Based Scheduling of Scientific Grid Workflows Through Advance Reservations", "paper_id": "WOS:000283375400001"}
