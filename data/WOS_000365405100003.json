Rather than using electrically powered nodes in an otherwise fully passive fiber plant, the proposed node is optically fed. The incorporation of energy scavenging mechanisms and optoelectronics with low power consumption guarantee operation at low optical feed levels of -10 dBm. Feeder protection for optical access is experimentally demonstrated that features a fast switching time of 10.7 ms in interaction with a control plane. Finally we identify options for self-pumping of the network node through simple optical power tapping of feeder and drop signals.", "paper_title": "Fully Passive Resiliency Node for Optical Access [Invited]", "paper_id": "WOS:000365405100003"}
