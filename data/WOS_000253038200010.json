The neurocontroller design uses the novel optimization neuro-dynamic programming algorithm based on dual heuristic programming (DHP), which has the most robust control capability among the adaptive critic designs family. The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is used as the function approximator to implement the DHP technique. The DHP based optimal neurocontroller (DHPNC) using the RBFNN shows improved dynamic damping compared to the CONVC even when a power system stabilizer is added. Also, the DHPNC provides a robust feedback loop in real-time operation without the need for continual on-line training, thus reducing any risk of possible instability associated with the neural network based controllers.
