A three-way decision is made based on a pair of thresholds on conditional probabilities. A positive rule makes a decision of investment, a negative rule makes a decision of non-investment, and a boundary rule makes a decision of deferment. Both cost functions and revenue functions are used to calculate the required two thresholds by maximizing conditional profit with the Bayesian decision procedure. A case study of oil investment demonstrates the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Three-way Investment Decisions with Decision-theoretic Rough Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000286636000007"}
