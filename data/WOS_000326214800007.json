Supply chain constructed from the perspective of the GBOM is able to respond swiftly to market demand and lean production can be achieved by managing the total cost of supply chain effectively. Based on the GBOM, this paper examines the control of production disruption risk related to supply chain and investigates the uncertainty of production in supply chain enterprises for the purpose of achieving optimal profits in supply chain. As the production disruption risk is controlled at a certain level, the selection model of supply chain partners, which is specific and more feasible, can be constructed. A combination of random simulation and neural network is deployed to approximate uncertain function, and genetic algorithm and simulated annealing arithmetic are also used to approximately achieve the optimal scheme of supply chain construction in the context of uncertainty.
