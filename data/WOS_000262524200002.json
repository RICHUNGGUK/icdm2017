The decision to use flooding or DHT largely depends on the Population of desired data. Previous works either use local information only, or do not consider dynamic factors of P2P systems. In this paper. we propose a Popularity Adaptive Search method for Hybrid (PASH) protocol. By dynamically estimating the content popularity, PASH properly selects search methods so as to efficiently saves query traffic cost and response time. We evaluate PASH through synthetic and trace-driven simulations. The results show that PASH Outperforms existing approaches and it also scales well.
