As the first step, individual pulse contribution in each track is given by RCM, and the number N of candidate pulses is then specified. Subsequently, the replacement of a pulse is performed through the search over the sorted top N pulses by IFPR, and those of 2 to 4 pulses are carried out by a standard IFPR. Implemented on a G. 729A speech codec, this proposal requires as few as 24 searches, a search load tantamount to 7.5% of G. 729A, 37.5% of the global pulse replacement method (iteration=2), 50% of IFPR, but still provides a comparable speech quality in any case. The aim of significant search performance improvement is hence achieved in this work..", "paper_title": "An Efficient Search Strategy for ACELP Algebraic Codebook by Means of Reduced Candidate Mechanism and Iteration-Free Pulse Replacement", "paper_id": "WOS:000337733200008"}
