This new scheme modifies the existing MoF scheme to operate in a pairwise manner, utilising both the moment of the material being extracted, and the moment of the materials remaining. The Symmetric MoF scheme is shown, via a number of two- and three-material test cases, to deal with errors in the reference moment data with greater accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, due to the symmetric nature of the scheme, gains in computational efficiency over the existing MoF scheme are seen. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
