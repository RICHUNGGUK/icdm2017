This property attracts the interest of researchers worldwide in recent years. This paper presents the development of a linearized model of the TWIP mobile robot based on its nonlinear dynamical model using Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy modeling technique, which can allow the application of linear control techniques in analyzing and efficiently controlling such under-actuated nonlinear system. The complete nonlinear dynamical equations of motion of the TWIP mobile robot were first derived using Kane's Method. Based on the nonlinear dynamical equations of motion, a T-S fuzzy model of the TWIP robot was then developed using local approximation technique. To validate the proposed model, simulations study was carried out and the results show that the proposed model approximates the original nonlinear TWIP mobile robot in the pre-specified domains to certain degree of accuracy.", "paper_title": "Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy modeling of a two-wheeled inverted pendulum robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000321326100003"}
