In particular, we study applicability of tensor approximations for the numerical solution of Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham equations on 3D Cartesian grids. We show that the orthogonal Tucker-type tensor approximation of electron density and Hartree potential of simple molecules leads to low tensor rank representations. This enables an efficient tensor-product convolution scheme for the computation of the Hartree potential using a collocation-type approximation via piecewise constant basis functions on a uniform n x n x n grid. Combined with the Richardson extrapolation, our approach exhibits O(h(3)) convergence in the grid-size h = O(n(-1)). Moreover, this requires O(3rn + r(3)) storage, where r denotes the Tucker rank of the electron density with r = O(log n), almost uniformly in n. For example, calculations of the Coulomb matrix and the Hartree-Fock energy for the CH(4) molecule, with a pseudopotential on the C atom, achieved accuracies of the order of 10(-6) hartree with a grid-size n of several hundreds. Since the tensor-product convolution in 3D is performed via I D convolution transforms, our scheme markedly outperforms the 3D-FFT in both the computing time and storage requirements.
