Common to both methodologies is the need to vary the object's shape and to assess the resulting change in performance, both executed within an automatic loop. This shape change can be realised by modifying the parameter values of a suitably parameterised Computer Aided Design (CAD) model. This paper presents the adopted methodology and the achieved results when performing optimisation of a gas turbine disk. Our approach to hierarchical modelling employing design tables is presented, with methods to ensure satisfactory geometry variation by commercial CAD systems. The conducted studies included stochastic and probabilistic design optimisation. To solve the multi-objective optimisation problem, a Pareto optimum criterion was used. The results demonstrate that CAD centric approach enables significant progress towards automating the entire process while achieving a higher quality product with the reduced susceptibility to manufacturing imperfections.", "paper_title": "CAD based shape optimization for gas turbine component design", "paper_id": "WOS:000275544100011"}
