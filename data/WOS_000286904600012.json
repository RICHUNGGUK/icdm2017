To get a broad view of the techniques used, first, some operational laws on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy values are introduced. Based on these operational laws, a generalized interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy geometric aggregation operator is proposed which is used to aggregate decision makers' opinions in group decision making process. In addition, some of its properties are discussed. Then Choquet integral-based Hamming distance between interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy values is defined. Combining the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy geometric aggregation operator with Choquet integral-based Hamming distance, an extension of TOPSIS method is developed to deal with a multi-criteria interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy group decision making problems. Finally, an illustrative example is used to illustrate the developed procedures. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
