In this research, we compare three different approaches to the problem: a genetic algorithm, a simulated annealing approach, and a hill climbing algorithm. In all cases, we adopt a solution representation that depends on a duplicate code for both the pickup request and its delivery. We also present an intelligent neighborhood move, that is guided by the time window, aiming to overcome the difficult problem constraints efficiently. Results presented herein improve upon those that have been previously published.", "paper_title": "The single vehicle pickup and delivery problem with time windows: intelligent operators for heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000276908400010"}
