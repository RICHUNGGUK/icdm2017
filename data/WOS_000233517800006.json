In this paper, we study a kind of hyperchaotic systems by using some classical methods. The results show that besides the high dimension, the sub-Nyquist sampling interval (SI) is also an important factor that can improve the security of the chaotic cryptosystems. We use the method of time series analysis to verify the results.", "paper_title": "Study on the communication method for chaotic encryption in remote monitoring systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000233517800006"}
