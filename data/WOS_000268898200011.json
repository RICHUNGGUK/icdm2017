We find that the numerical solutions are sensitive to viscosity, either incorporated a priori or effectively realized in computational models. In particular, anisotropic viscosity can lead to regular convective structures that mimic naturally realizable Rayleigh-Benard cells, which are unphysical for the specified external parameter range. Details of the viscosity appear to play a secondary role; that is, similar structures can occur for prescribed constant viscosities, explicit subgrid-scale turbulence models, ad-hoc numerical filters, or implicit dissipation of numerical schemes. This implies the need for a careful selection of numerical tools suitable for convection-resolving simulations of atmospheric circulations. The implicit large-eddy-simulation (ILES) approach using non-oscillatory schemes is especially attractive, as for under-resolved calculations it reproduces well the coarsened results of finely-resolved boundary layer convection.
