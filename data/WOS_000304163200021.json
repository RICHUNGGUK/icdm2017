Many algorithms have been proposed in the past decade and achieved good performance. Efforts have focused upon model representations of keywords, whereas properties of features have not been well investigated. In most cases, a group of features is preselected, yet important feature properties are not well used to select features. In this paper, we introduce a regularization-based feature selection algorithm to leverage both the sparsity and clustering properties of features, and incorporate it into the image annotation task. Using this group-sparsity-based method, the whole group of features [e.g., red green blue (RGB) or hue, saturation, and value (HSV)] is either selected or removed. Thus, we do not need to extract this group of features when new data comes. A novel approach is also proposed to iteratively obtain similar and dissimilar pairs from both the keyword similarity and the relevance feedback. Thus, keyword similarity is modeled in the annotation framework. We also show that our framework can be employed in image retrieval tasks by selecting different image pairs. Extensive experiments are designed to compare the performance between features, feature combinations, and regularization-based feature selection methods applied on the image annotation task, which gives insight into the properties of features in the image annotation task. The experimental results demonstrate that the group-sparsity-based method is more accurate and stable than others.", "paper_title": "Automatic Image Annotation and Retrieval Using Group Sparsity", "paper_id": "WOS:000304163200021"}
