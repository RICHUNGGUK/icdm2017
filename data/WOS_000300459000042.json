To this aim we propose a novel active learning algorithm that relies on a k-nearest neighbors graph and a new constraint utility function to generate queries to the human expert. This mechanism is paired with propagation and refinement processes that limit the number of constraint candidates and introduce a minimal diversity in the proposed constraints. Existing constraint selection heuristics are based on a random selection or on a min-max criterion and thus are either inefficient or more adapted to spherical clusters. Contrary to these approaches, our method is designed to be beneficial for all constraint-based clustering algorithms. Comparative experiments conducted on real datasets and with two distinct representative constraint-based clustering algorithms show that our approach significantly improves clustering quality while minimizing the number of human expert solicitations.
