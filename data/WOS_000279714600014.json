In this case, traditional statistical process control methods are not sufficient to control such manufacturing system. Here, we design an intelligent web information system, where quality data are collected from DMS and stored in the central database. The processes of manufacturing SAPs in DMS are then controlled by clustering homogenous SAPs using the quality control of SAP in DMS (QCSD) and process smoothness factor based SAP predefined clustering (PSFSPC) algorithms, respectively. A prototype system called an intelligent web information system quality control (IWIS-QC) has been developed to trace the quality profiles of SAPs. Finally, a case study has been presented to illustrate and validate the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Designing a new model of distributed quality control for sub-assemble products based on the intelligent web information system", "paper_id": "WOS:000279714600014"}
