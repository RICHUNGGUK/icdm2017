Our results show why this problem landscape is so hard to search, and we quantify the large degree of neutrality found in various ways. We show that a particular subspace of the solution space, called the \"Olympus\", is where good solutions concentrate, and give measures to quantitatively characterize this subspace.", "paper_title": "Neutral fitness landscape in the cellular automata majority problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000241484300029"}
