It can also be applied to generate multi-atom entanglement state with high fidelity and entanglement degree. The analysis for the effect of atomic spontaneous emission on the fidelity and homodyne detection (HD) shows that the present scheme is not only robust in the condition of a bad cavity, but also feasible with the current technology due to the relaxed experimental condition.", "paper_title": "NONDESTRUCTIVE ENTANGLEMENT ANALYSIS AND GENERATION WITH ATOMS IN LOW-Q CAVITIES ASSISTED BY COHERENT LIGHT", "paper_id": "WOS:000328903100002"}
