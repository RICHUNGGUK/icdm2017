The collaborative real time editing provides creativity teams of which members are physically distributed with an emulation of the synchronous collaboration where presence of the team members is required simultaneously (e.g., brainstorming, meetings). The concept of recommendation is based on matchmaking the currently performed activities at the user interface and external linked open data provided through SPARQL endpoints. The real time propagation of the changes in editor and recommendation is achieved by reverse AJAX and observer pattern. An experiment in the area of the creativity domain shows that the recommendation in collaborative real time editing activities are useful in task performance, guidance, and inspiration.", "paper_title": "Recommending Open Linked Data in Creativity Sessions using Web Portals with Collaborative Real Time Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000298051000005"}
