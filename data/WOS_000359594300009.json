RMS applications can tolerate errors emanating from data-intensive program phases rather than control. Thus, the authors reserve reliable cores for control and execute error-tolerant data-intensive phases on error-prone cores. They also provide a design space exploration for decoupled control and data processing to mitigate variation at near-threshold voltages.", "paper_title": "DECOUPLED CONTROL AND DATA PROCESSING FOR APPROXIMATE NEAR-THRESHOLD VOLTAGE COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000359594300009"}
