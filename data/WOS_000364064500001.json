A cooperative automatic retransmission request (ARQ) protocol based on two-relay node selection was proposed in this paper. A novel discrete time Markov chain model in order to analyze the throughput and energy efficiency was built, and system throughput and energy efficiency performance of proposed protocol and traditional ARQ protocol were studied based on such model. The numerical results reveal that the throughput and energy efficiency of the proposed protocol could perform better when compared with the traditional ARQ protocol.", "paper_title": "A Novel Cooperative ARQ Method for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000364064500001"}
