Robots are modeled as points, and each of them is equipped with a compass. Compasses of robots may be incoherent. Robots construct their routes, but the actual walk of each robot is decided by the adversary that may, e.g., speed up or slow down the robot. We consider several scenarios, depending on three factors: (1) obstacles in the terrain are present, or not, (2) compasses of both robots agree, or not, (3) robots have or do not have a map of the terrain with their positions marked. The cost of a rendezvous algorithm is the worst-case sum of lengths of the robots' trajectories until they meet. For each scenario, we design a deterministic rendezvous algorithm and analyze its cost. We also prove lower bounds on the cost of any deterministic rendezvous algorithm in each case. For all scenarios these bounds are tight. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Asynchronous deterministic rendezvous in bounded terrains", "paper_id": "WOS:000297442600005"}
