How to establish secure communications among the communication entities such as mesh routers and mobile clients (or mesh clients) even when roaming to different mesh networks (called mesh domains) is a challenging task. In this paper, we leverage the ID-based cryptography and propose a novel secure architecture to enable secure communications in large-scale multi-domain wireless mesh networks. Under this architecture, mesh clients can conveniently gain services securely even when roaming.", "paper_title": "How to secure multi-domain wireless mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000278968500001"}
