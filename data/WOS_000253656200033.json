In this letter, we propose an efficient Side-Information Frame Generator (SIFG). It considers smoothness constraints of both the motion vector field and spatial adjacent pixels. Simulation results show that the proposed techniques provide potential rate-distortion performance advantages. Besides, the fine visual quality of the S frame is obtained.", "paper_title": "A novel local smoothness constrained side-information frame generator", "paper_id": "WOS:000253656200033"}
