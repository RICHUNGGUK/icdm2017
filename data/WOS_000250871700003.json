We first define the critical causal order relation among the events. Then, we propose some mechanisms to enhance the prevalent RO (receive order delivery) mechanism in DVEs so that the real-time property of DVEs is preserved while the critical causal order violations are reduced. These mechanisms are implemented as a middleware. Experimental results show that the middleware performs well in reducing the critical causality violations in simulation and incurs little processing overhead.", "paper_title": "Critical causal order of events in distributed virtual environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000250871700003"}
