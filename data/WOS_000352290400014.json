The coordinated control requires information exchange among the distributed agents, which can be implemented using either periodic or need-based aperiodic data transmission. For reducing the data communication requirements among the agents, an aperiodic self-triggered communication-based coordinated control is proposed. Centralized as well as distributed self-triggered coordinated control is implemented. The performance evaluation results show that self-triggered aperiodic communication requires lower data rates, while delivering the same performance as that of periodic sampled data control.", "paper_title": "Self-Triggered Communication Enabled Control of Distributed Generation in Microgrids", "paper_id": "WOS:000352290400014"}
