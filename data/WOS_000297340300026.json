Based on these features, a practical segment detection method is proposed which has the ability to determine complete straight line segment parameters including the location of the center, length, slope and the Euclidean distance to the origin. The proposed method does not rely on edge point verification in the image space, i.e., the complete set of segment features are determined only using the information embodied in the HT data. The proposed method can distinguish between highly collinear straight line segments. Segment detection is robust to disturbing edge points, especially ones collinear with the object. A predefined collinear segment resolution that provides a theoretical criterion to determine straight line contiguity is derived. Image processing and analysis experiments show consistent robust performance.", "paper_title": "Collinear Segment Detection Using HT Neighborhoods", "paper_id": "WOS:000297340300026"}
