The aim is to develop an innovative method for the interpretation of known patterns that can be detected in system configurations during its dynamic evolution. The originality of the approach concerns the inspiration from the Chinese Go game for the pattern interpretation process. The focus of the paper is an experimental work conducted with the collaboration of the System Research Department of Austrian Research Center (ARC) to verify the suitability of the method to study forest ecosystem dynamics.", "paper_title": "Emergent pattern interpretation in vegetable population dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000252004500002"}
