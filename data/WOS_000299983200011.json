Continuous wavelet transforms represent the shape attributes of time series and enhance their delineation in the time-scale domain. As such, they allow identification of localized shape changes of dynamic responses for signal change detection. This change detection capacity enables identifying the damage-affected responses as well as formulating the characteristic effects of individual damaged components on the modeled dynamic response. The results obtained from simulated acceleration of a nine-storey building are 90% and 100% accurate with the steady-state and transient accelerations, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
