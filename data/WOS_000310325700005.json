First of all, the network model is established according to knight's tour theory. By using the method of network element abstracting with constraints, the network topology is mapped into the special chessboard with holes logically. Then, the probing messages are sent periodically along pre-computed knight's tour paths, so that the available light-paths are collected dynamically at the destination. Finally, the failed links could be determined by iteratively matching the links. Through the established general performance analysis model, it is shown that the proposed protocol has lower time complexity than other related classical protocols. Further, the simulation experiment is used to demonstrate that the proposed protocol can achieve unambiguous parallel localization under multiple link failures scenario in the different network topologies.", "paper_title": "Multi-fault aware parallel localization protocol for backbone network with many constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000310325700005"}
