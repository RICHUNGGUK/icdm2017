However, insufficient study has been conducted to explore how perceptual factors can provide viewers better quality of experience on fused images. We propose two perceptual quality measures: perceived local contrast and color saturation, which are embedded in our novel hierarchical multivariate Gaussian conditional random field model, to illustrate improved performance for multi-exposure fusion. We show that our method generates images with better quality than existing methods for a variety of scenes.", "paper_title": "QoE-Based Multi-Exposure Fusion in Hierarchical Multivariate Gaussian CRF", "paper_id": "WOS:000318477500030"}
