To empower clouds with the ability to capture and respond to quality feedback provided by users at runtime, we propose a reputation guided genetic scheduling algorithm for independent tasks. Current resource management services consider evolutionary strategies to improve the performance on resource allocation procedures or tasks scheduling algorithms, but they fail to consider the user as part of the scheduling process. Evolutionary computing offers different methods to find a near-optimal solution. In this paper we extended previous work with new optimisation heuristics for the problem of scheduling. We show how reputation is considered as an optimisation metric, and analyse how our metrics can be considered as upper bounds for others in the optimisation algorithm. By experimental comparison, we show our techniques can lead to optimised results.", "paper_title": "Reputation-guided evolutionary scheduling algorithm for independent tasks in inter-clouds environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000351951500002"}
