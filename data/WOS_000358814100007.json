Many approaches, including range-based and range-free techniques, have been proposed to determine the optimal location for sensor nodes. This paper presents a simple range-free localization scheme that is based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) geometric localization for wireless sensor networks. The node locations are computed by performing simple geometric calculations that rely on the specific approximate RSSI values with the position of a mobile beacon equipped with a global positioning system. The simulation results showed that the proposed scheme is efficient, and that the node positions can be determined accurately.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Geometric Localization Approach for Distributed Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000358814100007"}
