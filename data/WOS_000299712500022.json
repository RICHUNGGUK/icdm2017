CORAL software (http://www.insilico.eu/CORAL) has been used to build up quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) for prediction of toxicity to Daphnia magna. The QSARs developed in this study are one-variable models based on the optimal descriptors calculated with the Monte Carlo method. The toxicity has been modeled with the following representations of the molecular structure: (i) by hydrogen-suppressed graph (HSG); (ii) by simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES); and (iii) by hybrid representation, i.e. the HSG together with SMILES. Four random splits into the sub-training, calibration, and test sets were examined. The hybrid version of the representation of the molecular structure provided the best accuracy of the prediction for the considered endpoint. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
