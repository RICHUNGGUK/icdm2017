It generates new individuals close to an isolated individual in a current population as a niching scheme. This mechanism will evenly allocate search resources for each optimum. The proposed method was evaluated along with the existing methods through computational experiments using eight two-dimensional multimodal functions as benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed method shows better performance for several functions which are not effectively solved by existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "DE/isolated/1: a new mutation operator for multimodal optimization with differential evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000209204000002"}
