We refer to this multiple access mode as network-coded multiple access (NCMA). Prior studies on PNC mostly focused on relay networks. NCMA is the first realized multiple access scheme that establishes the usefulness of PNC in a non-relay setting. NCMA allows multiple nodes to transmit simultaneously to the access point (AP) to boost throughput. In the non-relay setting, when two nodes A and B transmit to the AP simultaneously, the AP aims to obtain both packet A and packet B rather than their network-coded packet. An interesting question is whether network coding, specifically PNC which extracts packet A circle plus B, can still be useful in such a setting. We provide an affirmative answer to this question with a novel two-layer decoding approach amenable to real-time implementation. Our USRP prototype indicates that NCMA can boost throughput by 100 percent in the medium-high SNR regime (>= 10 dB). We believe further throughput enhancement is possible by allowing more than two users to transmit together.", "paper_title": "Network-Coded Multiple Access", "paper_id": "WOS:000344592900012"}
