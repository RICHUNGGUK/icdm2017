The power of high-level statistical computing environments like R enables data analysts to easily try out various distance measures with only minimal programming effort. A new variant of centroid neighborhood graphs is introduced which gives insight into the relationships between adjacent clusters. Artificial examples and a case study from marketing research are used to demonstrate the influence of distances measures on partitions and usage of neighborhood graphs. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
