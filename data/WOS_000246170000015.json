An extension of the split game to generalized omega-regular expressions is also established. To gain insight into how the split game can be applied to attack the long-standing generalized star height 2 problem, we propose and solve the omega power problem, a similar but tractable problem it the context of omega-languages. Namely we show that omega powers, together with boolean combinations and concatenations, are not sufficient to express the class of co-regular languages. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
