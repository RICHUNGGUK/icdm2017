Many statistical problems have been viewed as missing data problems. To cope with incomplete data, several methods are currently being used. They are all based on assumptions some of which might not be valid in a particular case. The choice mostly depends on the objective of the study. Considerable mensuration research is motivated by the need for yield projections that can support forest management decisions. This paper is focused on a new approach for filling gaps in diameter measurements on standing tree boles. Dealing with this problem, an attempt was made to examine the applicability of artificial neural network models for missing data estimation and to use the estimated values in the subsequent analysis. The procedure that should be followed in the development of such models is outlined. The results show good performance of the examined ANN models compared to regression treatments for missing data and ANN models demonstrate their adequacy and potential for filling gaps in diameter measurements on standing tree boles. The ANN models applied in this study are sufficiently general and have great potential to be applicable for estimating the missing values of many variables in environmental applications.
