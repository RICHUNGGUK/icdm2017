Given the total transmit power of all relay nodes, the distributed spatial precoder assigns different transmitting power to each relay node. Each distributed precoder is equivalent to a spot in multi-dimensional space. Based on system capacity maximization, an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed, which is used to search for a global optimal solution in d-dimension space. The simulation shows that the distributed spatial precoding algorithm based on the PSO algorithm can enhance system capacity performance effectively. Compared with the traditional QRD broadcast scheme, this paper's new distributed precoding can enhance about 20% system capacity gain. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
