The N-intertwined virus spread model of the SIS-type is introduced as a promising and analytically tractable model of which the steady-state behavior is fairly completely determined. Compared to the exact SIS Markov model, the N-intertwined model makes only one approximation of a mean-field kind that results in upper bounding the exact model for finite network size N and improves in accuracy with N. We review many properties theoretically, thereby showing, besides the flexibility to extend the model into an entire heterogeneous setting, that much insight can be gained that is hidden in the exact Markov model.", "paper_title": "The N-intertwined SIS epidemic network model", "paper_id": "WOS:000303802600006"}
