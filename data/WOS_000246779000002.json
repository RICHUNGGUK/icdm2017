Design/methodology/approach - A general review and survey of selected research and development topics. Findings - Illustrates the multi- and trans-disciplinary natures of studies in cybernetics, systems and management science with a view to further research and development activity. Practical iinplications - The choice of reviews provides the awareness of the current trends in these areas of endeavour. Originality/value - The reviews are selected from a global database and give a studied assessment of current research and development initiatives.", "paper_title": "Contemporary cybernetics, systems and management science - New initiatives in building human-computer interfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000246779000002"}
