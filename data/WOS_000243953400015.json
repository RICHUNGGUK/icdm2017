As the proposed bound is numerically intensive in its general form, we consider two special cases, namely, the spherical bound and the DS2-exponential bound, which are found to be tight in nonergodic and near-ergodic block-fading channels, respectively. The tightness of the proposed bounds is demonstrated for turbo codes. Many existing bounds for quasistatic or fully interleaved fading channels can be viewed as special cases of the proposed Gallager bound.", "paper_title": "New Gallager bounds in block-fading channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000243953400015"}
