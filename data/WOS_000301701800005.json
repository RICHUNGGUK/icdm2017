Column ratio and screen resolution were examined, in order to enrich our understanding of web page usability. Based on the 960 grid system rule used to divide web page columns, the two variables adopted in the experiment are: screen resolution and column ratio. Screen resolutions of 800 x 600 and 1024 x 768 pixels were examined. Six column ratios were used: 7:93, 15:85, 24:76, 33:67,41:59. and 50:50. The experiment adopted a within-subjects design. Sixty-one participants were asked to search for a text target. Reaction time and error rate were automatically recorded by software. Repeated measurements revealed that the 1024 x 768 resolution yields shorter reaction times than the 800 x 600 resolution. The 1024 x 768 resolution showed higher subjective preferences than the 800 x 600. With an 800 x 600 resolution, the column ratio of 24:76 yielded the best score. In addition, with a 1024 x 768 resolution, the column ratio of 15:85 produced the best score. A regression equation was used to describe the dependence of reaction time on column ratio levels. Two second-degree polynomial regression equations proved appropriate for describing the subjective preferences of 1024 x 768 and 800 x 600 resolutions at each level of column ratio. The generated results enabled the development of design guidelines applicable to future web page interface design. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.
