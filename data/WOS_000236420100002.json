The system introduces the algorithm of rnulti-phenotypic mitotic analysis (MMA) and integrates that with algorithms of correlation analysis and compound clustering used in gene microarray studies. The HCS-MMA system combines different phenotypic information of cellular images obtained from three-channel acquisitions to distinguish and label individual cells at various phases of mitosis. The proposed system can also be used to extract and count the number of cells in each phase in cell-based assay experiments and archive the extracted data into a structured database for more sophisticated statistical and data analysis. To recognize different mitotic phases, binary patterns are set up based oil a known biological mitotic spindle model to characterize cellular morphology of actin, microtubules, and DNA. To illustrate its utility, the HCS-MMA system has been applied to screen the quantitative response of 320 different drug Compounds in suppressing Monastrol. The results are validated and evaluated by comparing the performance of HCS-MMA with visual analysis, as well as clustering of the drug compounds under evaluation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
