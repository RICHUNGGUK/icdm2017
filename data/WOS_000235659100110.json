There is no unified data accessing approach. This paper proposes an implementation of web based adaptive Grid data transfer solution over multiple protocols, The system is made up of three tiers: a transfer core named PAFTP, transfer service based on WSRF, and portlet application. The core hides diversity of various protocols and provides a universal interface to higher level data access. This solution not only offers multi-protocol reliable data transfer, simple file operation and monitoring on transfer status, but also emphasizes performance of mass file transfer.", "paper_title": "A web-based system for adaptive data transfer in grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100110"}
