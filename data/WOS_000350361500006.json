We show that the number of outliers can be minimized in polynomial time with respect to the number of measurements, although exponential in the model dimension. Moreover, for a large class of problems, we prove that the statistically more desirable truncated -norm can be optimized with the same complexity. In a similar vein, it is also shown how to transform a multi-model estimation problem into a purely combinatorial one-with worst-case complexity that is polynomial in the number of measurements but exponential in the number of models. We apply our framework to a series of hard fitting problems. It gives a practical method for simultaneously dealing with measurement noise and large amounts of outliers in the estimation of low-dimensional models. Experimental results and a comparison to random sampling techniques are presented for the applications rigid registration, triangulation and stitching.", "paper_title": "Tractable Algorithms for Robust Model Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000350361500006"}
