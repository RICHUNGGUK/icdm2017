It emphasises the importance of understanding and designing for the classroom, as well as involving key stakeholders, such as teachers and students in the design process. A focus is placed on the orchestration feature of visibility and a short case study is presented which describes and reflects on a technology, the Subtle Stone, which aimed to make emotion more visible in the classroom.
