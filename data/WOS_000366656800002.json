The project was initiated for the International Architecture Biennale Rotterdam (IABR 2014) and was exhibited in the seminal Kunsthal Rotterdam in the summer of 2014. The project, entitled Weerkas, was a set of twelve intaglio etchings. A combination of digital modeling programs such as Rhino, Grasshopper and 3D Studio Max and drafting software AutoCAD were used to develop the drawings. The digital files were photo-transferred and etched using a polymer intaglio plate. The analog/digital hybrid explores the limitations of such a combined means of expression and its possible significance in developing a two from three-dimensional drawing technique.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Representation: Intaglio Etching of Digital Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000366656800002"}
