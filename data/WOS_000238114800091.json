We analytically present the multicast routing mechanism behind our scheme as well as the multicast group management functionality of it. Furthermore, we present an evaluation of our scheme in terms of its performance. The critical parameters for the evaluation of the scheme are the number of multicast users within the multicast group, the amount of data sent to the multicast users, the density of the multicast users within the cells and the type of transport channel used for the transmission of the multicast data over the air.", "paper_title": "A multicast approach for UMTS: A performance study", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800091"}
