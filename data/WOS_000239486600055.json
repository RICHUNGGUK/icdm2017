Calculating locomotion for extinct species is mainly based on the direct application of captured trajectories to numerically reconstructed skeletons. The gait is judged realistic compared to another if it minimizes energy and preserves balance. In computer animation, adapting a motion to a skeleton is addressed by so-called motion retargeting techniques. The goal is then to ensure that the resulting motion is close to the initial one while dealing with new bones' dimensions. In this paper, we adapt methods used in computer animation in order to solve such a problem. This approach is based on a two-steps framework: first, a reference motion of the feet is warped in order to optimize a set of biomechanical general laws, such as energy and Jerk minimization. Second, the remaining degrees of freedom (denoted DOF) are calculated thanks to inverse kinematics (denoted IK). This method is applied on a small woman, a tall man, a chimpanzee and Lucy.", "paper_title": "Plausible locomotion for bipedal creatures using motion warping and inverse kinematics", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600055"}
