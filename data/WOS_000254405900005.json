This new work enjoys the advantages of the surface wave pole extraction directly carried out by the generalized integral path without troubles of that all components of Green's function in spectral domain should be reformed respectively in transmission line network analogy, and then the Green's functions for mixed-potential integral equation (MPIE) analysis in both near-field and far-field in multilayered media are obtained. In addition, the curl operator for coupled field in MPIE is avoided conveniently. It is especially applicable and useful to characterize the electromagnetic scattering by, and radiation in the presence of, the electrically large 3-D objects in multilayered media. The numerical results of the S-parameters of a microstrip periodic bandgap (PBG) filter, the radar cross section (RCS) of a large microstrip antenna array, the characteristics of scattering, and radiation from the three-dimensional (3-D) targets in multilayered media are obtained, to demonstrate better effectiveness and accuracy of this technique.", "paper_title": "Efficient approach and application of the Green's functions in spatial domain in multilayered media", "paper_id": "WOS:000254405900005"}
