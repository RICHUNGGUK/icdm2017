It shows what energy efficiency improvements are possible for any data processing/transmission/storage system. The metric's versatility is also displayed by applying it to biologically based and quantum-level information systems. As an exemplar, we identify ten different and independent approaches, each of which on its own could achieve at least a 50% energy efficiency saving, so as to enable a thousand-fold (i.e., 30 dB) improvement in overall energy efficiency in photonic telecommunications networking.", "paper_title": "Roadmapping ICT: An Absolute Energy Efficiency Metric", "paper_id": "WOS:000294898200007"}
