Laplace and Hankel transforms were employed to solve the governing equation. Explicit analytical solutions are obtained in the Laplace-Hankel transform domain when groundwater drawdown is induced by a constant pumping well. Based on the solutions, numerical computations were performed to study the influences of the compressibility of the fluid constituent on the consolidation behavior of the soil layer.
