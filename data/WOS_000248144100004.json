To prevent degradation of picture quality due to unstable discharges between two facing electrodes, the common electrode was biased at a negative voltage during the set-up period, and the data electrode was biased at a positive voltage during the sustain period. A pre-reset pulse was used before the first reset to reduce the reset voltage and to form a proper wall charge state for sustain discharges. This waveform could drive a 15% Xe 42 in. XGA (1024 x 768) PDP with the single-scan method. The measured black luminescence, peak 2 luminescence, and contrast ratio were 0.45, 1490 cd/m(2) and 33 10: 1, respectively. The measured margin of the sustain voltage was better than +/- 10 V. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
