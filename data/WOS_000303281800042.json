Some researchers have attempted to develop an agent-based model of the stock market to investigate the behavior of investors and provide decision support for innovation of trading mechanisms. However, challenges remain regarding the design and implementation of such a model, due to the complexity of investors, financial information, policies, and so on. This paper will describe a novel architecture to model the stock market by utilizing stock agent, finance agent and investor agent. Each type of investor agent has a different investment strategy and learning method. A prototype system for supporting stock market simulation and evolution is also presented to demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of the proposed intelligent agent-based artificial stock market system architecture.
