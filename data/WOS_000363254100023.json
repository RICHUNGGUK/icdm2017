To achieve scalable mean delays in file downloads under stochastic loads, we allow multiple servers to work together as a pooled resource to meet individual download requests. In such systems, basic questions include: How and where to replicate files? What is the impact of dynamic service allocation across request types, and whether such allocations can provide substantial gains over simpler load balancing policies? What are tradeoffs among performance, reliability and recovery costs, and energy? This paper provides a simple performance model for large systems towards addressing these basic questions.", "paper_title": "High-Performance Centralized Content Delivery Infrastructure: Models and Asymptotics", "paper_id": "WOS:000363254100023"}
