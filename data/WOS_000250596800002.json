Capture of trajectory data at fine temporal and spatial granularities has allowed with the representation of detailed geospatial lifelines, opening new options for analysis. In this respect we propose a dynamic perspective to analysis which, in contrast to summary trajectory statistics on speed, motion azimuth or sinuosity, that refers to the variability of motion properties throughout the developing lifeline. Four specific lifeline context operators are identified in this paper: 'instantaneous', 'interval', 'episodal' and 'total'. Using this framework, we discuss standardisations that integrate the extended set of motion descriptors within various temporal and spatial frames of reference and the proposed lifeline context operators and standardisations are illustrated using high resolution trajectory data obtained from homing pigeons carrying miniature global positioning devices.
