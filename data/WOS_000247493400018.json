With careful comparison of classical P-C completely synchronization and the effectively synchronization phenomena, projective synchronization are further investigated in this paper. It is found that, the projective synchronization phenomenon exists for all parameter value ranges: alpha is an element of [0,1] when coupling two unified chaotic systems through transferring the third variable. This is quite different from the classical situations proposed by Pecora and Carroll. This can be considered as one special case of generalized synchronization phenomenon. Control of the 'projective synchronization scale-factor' is also considered based on theoretical and numerical analysis. In the last part, the effect on projective synchronization (P(j)Syn) caused by slight system parameter mismatch and channel noise are also briefly numerically discussed. This character can be further applied in some fields, such as secure communication, etc. Numerical experiments are also provided to show the accuracy of the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Different type of synchronization phenomena in unidirectional coupled unified chaotic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000247493400018"}
