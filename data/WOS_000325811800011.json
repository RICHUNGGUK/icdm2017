However, most existing methods do not consider the content and style separately. In this paper, we propose a style transfer algorithm via a novel component analysis approach, based on various image processing techniques. First, inspired by the steps of drawing a picture, an image is decomposed into three components: draft, paint and edge, which describe the content, main style, and strengthened strokes along the boundaries. Then the style is transferred from the template image to the source image in the paint and edge components. Style transfer is formulated as a global optimization problem by using Markov random fields, and a coarse-to-fine belief propagation algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. To combine the draft component and the obtained style information, the final artistic result can be achieved via a reconstruction step. Compared to other algorithms, our method not only synthesizes the style, but also preserves the image content well. We also extend our algorithm from single image stylization to video personalization, by maintaining the temporal coherence and identifying faces in video sequences. The results indicate that our approach performs excellently in stylization and personalization for images and videos.", "paper_title": "Style Transfer Via Image Component Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000325811800011"}
