The productivity of such a system, in part, hinges on the efficient allocation of terminal resources such that the container transit time is minimized. This study provides an analytical framework, which entails efficient scheduling of quay and yard cranes, to minimize the time spent by containers at a terminal. A mixed-integer programming model is developed to capture the two-stage multi-processor characteristic of the problem, where each crane has specific time window availability. A genetic algorithm equipped with a novel decoding procedure is developed. The mixed-integer model is tested on a number of problem instances of varying sizes to gain managerial insights.
