In this paper, a concept of alpha-path to uncertain differential equation is first introduced, which is a type of deterministic function that solves an associate ordinary differential equation. Then, a numerical method is designed for solving uncertain differential equations, which essentially solves each alpha-path and produces an inverse uncertainty distribution of the solution. To illustrate the efficiency of the numerical method, several examples are given.", "paper_title": "A numerical method for solving uncertain differential equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000321326100030"}
