Efraimidis and Spirakis [5] presented an algorithm for weighted sampling without replacement from data streams. Their algorithm works under the assumption of precise computations over the interval [0,1]. Cohen and Kaplan [3] used similar methods for their bottom-k sketches. Efraimidis and Spirakis ask as an open question whether using finite precision arithmetic impacts the accuracy of their algorithm. In this paper we show a method to avoid this problem by providing a precise reduction from k-sampling without replacement to k-sampling with replacement. We call the resulting method Cascade Sampling. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.", "paper_title": "Weighted sampling without replacement from data streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000361402400003"}
