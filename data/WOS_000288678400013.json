This paper presents a model, labeled hybrid Petri nets (LHPNs), that is developed to model this heterogeneous set of components. To support formal verification, this paper presents an efficient zone-based state space exploration algorithm for LHPNs. This algorithm uses a process known as warping which allows zones to describe continuous variables changing at variable rates. Finally, this paper describes the application of this algorithm to analog/mixed-signal circuit examples.", "paper_title": "Verification of Analog/Mixed-Signal Circuits Using Labeled Hybrid Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000288678400013"}
