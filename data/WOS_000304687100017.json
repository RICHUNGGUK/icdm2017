In a classic covering problem, the customer is assumed to be covered if he/she is located within the critical distance zone around the facility and is otherwise not covered. This problem is caused by customer facility selection, which differs from the classic covering problem in which services are determined only by proximity. This paper proposes a mixed integer programming formulation based on customer restrictions and also develops a heuristic solution procedure using Lagrangian relaxation. The suggested solution procedure is shown to yield acceptable results in a reasonable computation time. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
