It has been actively used in various applications such as opinion mining of customer reviews in online review sites, improving answering of opinion questions in community question-answering (CQA) sites, multi-document summarization, etc. However, there has not been much focus on subjectivity analysis in the domain of online forums. Online forums contain huge amounts of user-generated data in the form of discussions between forum members on specific topics and are a valuable source of information. In this work, we perform subjectivity analysis of online forum threads. We model the task as a binary classification of threads in one of the two classes: subjective (seeking opinions, emotions, other private states) and non-subjective (seeking factual information). Unlike previous works on subjectivity analysis, we use several non-lexical thread-specific features for identifying subjectivity orientation of threads. We evaluate our methods by comparing them with several state-of-the-art subjectivity analysis techniques. Experimental results on two popular online forums demonstrate that our methods outperform strong baselines in most of the cases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
