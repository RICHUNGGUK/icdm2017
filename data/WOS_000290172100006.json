In this paper, we give lower bounds for such linear codes. For radius r = 2, we give some general constructions. We give many (optimal) constructions which were found by a computer search. New constructions improve some previously known upper bounds for r-identifying codes in the case where linearity is not assumed.", "paper_title": "On binary linear r-identifying codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000290172100006"}
