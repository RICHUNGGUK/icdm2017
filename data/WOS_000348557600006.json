Among many applications, CLSMs can be used for rapid and sustainable construction of bridge abutments. This paper describes the finite element analysis of a full-scale loading test of a bridge abutment backfilled with the CLSM referred to as \"CISM bridge abutment\". The finite element analysis will help with the understanding of the behavior of CLSM bridge abutments, in terms of bearing capacity, displacements and the developed axial force in anchors. The accuracy of the finite element results for the response and failure behavior of a CLSM mass was evaluated by a comparison with the experimental results. The experimental program included both standard compressive strength testing on CLSM cylinders and a laboratory full-scale testing on a CLSM bridge abutment. The analysis shows that the performance of a CLSM abutment while subject to a service load or a limiting failure load from a bridge superstructure can be simulated in a reasonably accurate manner. In addition, a parametric study was conducted to better understand the performance of the CLSM bridge abutments in terms of bearing capacity and overall behavior. This study investigated the performance of the CLSM bridge abutments as they are affected by material curing age, environment temperature and construction details. The results indicated that the CLSM bridge abutment is capable of carrying typical bridge loads with relatively after only one day from the placement. It was observed that the bearing capacity increased with further curing of the CLSM material. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
