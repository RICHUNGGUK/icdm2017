However, the majority of these methods are known to be computationally expensive requiring minutes of computation. In this paper, we propose a fast minimisation scheme that produces high quality stereo reconstructions for significantly reduced running time, requiring only a few seconds of computation. The minimisation scheme is carried out using our iterated dynamic programming algorithm, which iterates over entire rows and columns for fast stereo matching. A quadtree subregioning process is also used for efficient computation of a matching cost volume where iterated dynamic programming operates on.
