The (local) resilience of a graph G with respect to a property P measures how Much one has to change G (locally) to destroy P. Estimating the resilience leads to many new and challenging problems. Here we focus on random and pseudorandom graphs and prove several sharp results. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
