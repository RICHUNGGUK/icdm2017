The H.264/AVC, a high-efficiency video coding technique, is considered for high definition (HD) video application. Considering the transmission of H.264/AVC based HD video over WiMedia, in this paper, we will propose a cross-layer architecture and an analytical model to calculate the optimal payload length with the constraints in error criteria, retransmission mechanism, and the delay budget. Besides, the required minimum reservation slots in WiMedia are also investigated to optimize the transmission performance of HD video.", "paper_title": "Optimal transmission of high definition video transmission in WiMedia systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000286829700001"}
