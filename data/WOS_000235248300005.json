It is shown that almost all lattices L in E-d contain infinitely many pairwise disjoint d-tuples, that is sets of d linearly independent points in B. A consequence of this result is the following: let S be a star body in E-d with V(S ) = infinity. Then for almost all lattices L in E-d the successive minima lambda(1)(S,L),..., lambda(d)(S,L) of S with respect to L are 0. A corresponding result holds for most lattices in the Baire category sense. A tool for the latter result is the semi-continuity of the successive minima.", "paper_title": "Lattice points in large borel sets and successive minima", "paper_id": "WOS:000235248300005"}
