EGT is a suitable tool to address the problem of resource allocation in self-organizing small cells since it allows the players with bounded-rationality to learn from the environment and take individual decisions for attaining the equilibrium with minimum information exchange. EGT-based resource allocation can also provide fairness among users. We show how EGT can be used for distributed subcarrier and power allocation in orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based small cell networks while limiting interference to the macrocell users below given thresholds. Two game models are considered, where the utility of each small cell depends on average achievable signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and data rate, respectively. For the proposed distributed resource allocation method, the average SINR and data rate are obtained based on a stochastic geometry analysis. Replicator dynamics is used to model the strategy adaptation process of the small cell base stations and an evolutionary equilibrium is obtained as the solution. Based on the results obtained using stochastic geometry, the stability of the equilibrium is analyzed. We also extend the formulation by considering information exchange delay and investigate its impact on the convergence of the algorithm. Numerical results are presented to validate our theoretical findings and to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in comparison to a centralized resource allocation scheme.", "paper_title": "An Evolutionary Game for Distributed Resource Allocation in Self-Organizing Small Cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000347098100004"}
