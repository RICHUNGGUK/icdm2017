Our model displays self-organized criticality behaviors with different network parameters, and the average earthquake size has been introduced to show the different effects of these parameters. Transient and oscillatory activity have been detected based on our weighted network, and the transient time increases with decreasing dissipative parameter.", "paper_title": "SELF-ORGANIZED CRITICALITY IN A WEIGHTED EARTHQUAKE MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000264633600002"}
