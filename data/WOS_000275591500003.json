This paper gives an overview of several upper bound heuristics that have been proposed and tested for the problem of determining the treewidth of a graph and finding tree decompositions. Each of the heuristics produces tree decompositions whose width may be larger than the optimal width However, experiments show that in many cases, the heuristics give tree decompositions whose width is close to the exact treewidth of the input graphs (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
