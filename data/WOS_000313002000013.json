In contrast to other popular GSCMs, the COST 2100 approach is generic and flexible, making it suitable to model multi-user or distributed MIMO scenarios. In this article a concise overview of the COST 2100 channel model is presented. Main concepts are described, together with useful implementation guidelines. Recent developments, including dense multipath components, polarization, and multi-link aspects, are also discussed.", "paper_title": "THE COST 2100 MIMO CHANNEL MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000313002000013"}
