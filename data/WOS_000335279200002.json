The approach is based on the notion of perfect curve introduced from the concepts and results presented in Blasco and Perez-Diaz (2013). In addition, we study some properties concerning perfect curves and in particular, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a plane curve to be perfect. Finally, we show that the equivalent class of generalized asymptotes for a branch of a plane curve can be described as an affine space R-m for a certain m. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
