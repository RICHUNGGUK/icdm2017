Sequences from scenes with different levels of complexity have been manually annotated. Each person present at a scene has been labeled frame by frame, in order to automatically obtain a people detection ground-truth for each sequence. Sequences have been classified into different complexity categories depending on critical factors that typically affect the behavior of detection algorithms. The resulting corpus, which exceeds other public pedestrian datasets in the amount of video sequences and its complexity variability, is freely available for benchmarking and research purposes under a license agreement.
