However, current measurement error inherent in the measurement system degrade the control accuracy, since the motor currents are not guaranteed to follow the desired references. In this paper, quantization error caused by analog-to-digital converters is studied. The dithering techniques combined with Kalman filter are proposed to suppress the quantization effects. First, two dithered systems, including the subtractively dithered and nonsubtractively dithered systems, are designed to whiten the quantization error. In the design of nonsubtractively dithered system, the probability characteristic of the metering noise is utilized to minimize the measurement noise level. Then, Kalman filter is designed to estimate the real current signals from the dithered current measurements. Since the variance of the total measurement error is theoretically calculable according to the proposed dithering techniques, Kalman gain can be determined analytically. Finally, simulations and experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches using a high-precision positioning system.", "paper_title": "Suppression of Current Quantization Effects for Precise Current Control of SPMSM Using Dithering Techniques and Kalman Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800049"}
