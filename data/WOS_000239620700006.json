However, most of the current recommendation mechanisms need to generate all association rules before recommendations. This takes lots of time in offline computation, and cannot provide real-time recommendations for online users. This study proposes a Navigational Pattern Tree structure for storing the web accessing information. Besides, the Navigational Pattern Tree supports incremental growth for immediately modeling web usage behavior. To provide real-time recommendations efficiently, we develop a Navigational Pattern mining (NP-miner) algorithm for discovering frequent sequential patterns on the proposed Navigational Pattern Tree. According to historical patterns, the NP-miner scans relevant sub-trees of the Navigational Pattern Tree repeatedly for generating candidate recommendations. The experiments study the performance of the NP-miner algorithm through synthetic datasets from real applications. The results show that the NP-miner algorithm can efficiently perform online dynamic recommendation in a stable manner. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
