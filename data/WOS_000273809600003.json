This classification includes, as a proper subset, the classification of toric surface patches from geometric modeling which have linear precision. Besides the well-known tensor product patches and B,zier triangles, we identify a family of toric patches with trapezoidal shape, each of which has linear precision. Furthermore, B,zier triangles and tensor product patches are special cases of trapezoidal patches.", "paper_title": "Linear Precision for Toric Surface Patches", "paper_id": "WOS:000273809600003"}
