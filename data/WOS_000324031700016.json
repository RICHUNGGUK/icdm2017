The term \"justifiable\" pertains to the construction of the information granule, which is formed in such a way that it is (a) highly legitimate (justified) in light of the experimental evidence, and (b) specific enough meaning it comes with a well-articulated semantics (meaning). The design process associates with a well-defined optimization problem with the two requirements of experimental justification and specificity. A series of experiments is provided as well as a number of constructs carried for various formalisms of information granules (intervals, fuzzy sets, rough sets, and shadowed sets) are discussed as well.
