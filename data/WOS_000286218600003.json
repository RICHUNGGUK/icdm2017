In connection with such a problem, we introduce several new notions as variances of the classical KKT conditions. These notions are shown to be closely related to the notions of sharp or weak sharp solutions. As applications, we extend some results on metric regularity of inequalities from the convex case to the convex-composite case.", "paper_title": "Strong KKT conditions and weak sharp solutions in convex-composite optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000286218600003"}
