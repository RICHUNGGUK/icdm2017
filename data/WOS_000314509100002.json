Since the inception of Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLSs), they have been applied with great success to numerous real world applications. The vast majority of FLSs so far have been traditional type-1 FLSs. However, type-1 FLSs cannot fully handle the high levels of uncertainties available in the vast majority of real world applications. This is because type-1 FLSs employ crisp and \"precise\" type-1 fuzzy sets. A type-2 FLS can handle higher uncertainty levels to produce improved performance. This paper follows on [1] to show how type-2 FLSs are starting to find their way into a variety of real world applications, promising a continuous growth both in number and variety of type-2 FLS applications in the next decade.", "paper_title": "Towards the Wide Spread Use of Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems in Real World Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000314509100002"}
