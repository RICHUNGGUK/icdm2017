Motivated by the inhibitory effect of interneurons and summarizing experimental findings, it was recently proposed that the corresponding gamma cycle realizes a rapidly repeating winner-take-all algorithm, a role that was proposed to be compatible with binding-by-synchrony. Here, this interpretation is considered from the modeling perspective, starting from an oscillatory network model with columnar architecture and several stored patterns. Local synchronization is modeled as a so-called pooling mechanism. It is then argued and demonstrated that the locally synchronizing effect of the interneurons may be essential for realizing the winner-take-all behavior. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
