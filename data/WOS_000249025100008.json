The channel is assumed to be the additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Analytical bounds on the channel distortion for the investigated systems with maximum-likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) are developed. The bounds are based on the transfer function technique, which was modified and generalized to include continuous-amplitude discrete-time signals. For a memoryless; uniform source, the constructed bounds for the investigated systems are shown to be asymptotically tight for increasing channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. For a memoryless nonuniform source, the constructed bounds are not as tight as the one for the uniform source, however, it still can be used as an indication to how the system performs. It is concluded that the minimum Euclidean distance of the system alone is not enough to evaluate the performance of the considered systems. The number of error events having minimum Euclidean distance and the total distortion caused by those error events also affect the asymptotic performance. This work provides an analysis tool for the investigated systems. The analysis method is very general. It may be applied to any trellis based JSCC schemes.
