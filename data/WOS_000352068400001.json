However, both the synchronous DAIC model and the asynchronous DAIC model only satisfy some given conditions, respectively, and perform poorly under other conditions either for high synchronization cost or for many redundant activations. As a result, the whole performance of both DAIC models suffers from the serious network jitter and load jitter caused by mult-itenancy in the cloud. In this paper, we develop a system, namely HybIter, to guarantee the performance of iterative algorithms under different conditions. Through an adaptive execution model selection scheme, it can efficiently switch between synchronous and asynchronous DAIC model in order to be adapted to different conditions, always getting the best performance in the cloud. Experimental results show that our approach can improve the performance of current solutions up to 39.0%.", "paper_title": "An adaptive switching scheme for iterative computing in the cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000352068400001"}
