Decision support tools for this have been built using causal models represented by Bayesian Networks (BNs), incorporating empirical data and expert judgement. Previously, this required a custom BN for each development lifecycle. We describe a more general approach that allows causal models to be applied to any lifecycle. The approach evolved through collaborative projects and captures significant commercial input. For projects within the range of the models, defect predictions are very accurate. This approach enables decision-makers to reason in a way that is not possible with regression-based models. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
