As an algebra fundament of linguistic truth-valued intuitionistic fuzzy logic, some properties of linguistic truth-valued intuitionistic fuzzy algebra are discussed. The results show that linguistic truth-valued intuitionistic fuzzy lattice is a residual lattice, but it is not MTL-algebra, R-0-algebra, BL-algebra, MV-algebra and quasi lattice implication algebra.", "paper_title": "On an algebra of linguistic truth-valued intuitionistic lattice-valued logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000316113700004"}
