These actors establish contracts with each other with the intention of optimizing their costs and offering quality service. Paying attention to end users' context and providing context awareness as a service at the PaaS provider level offers several benefits, including that it lets PaaS clients develop multimodal services and thus optimize infrastructure use.", "paper_title": "Context Awareness as a Service for Cloud Resource Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000351771900004"}
