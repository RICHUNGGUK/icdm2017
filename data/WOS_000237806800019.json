They were used in a number of real-world simulations and scientific problems, but seldom considered an effective means to describe and/or generate music. The purpose of this paper is demonstrating that Petri Nets (enriched with some peculiar extensions) can well represent the results of a musicological analysis process.", "paper_title": "Music analysis and modeling through Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000237806800019"}
