Our method utilizes tactile sensing data to estimate grasp stability and make necessary hand adjustments after an initial grasp is established. We first discuss a learning approach to estimating grasp stability based on tactile sensing data. This estimator can be used as an indicator to the stability of the current grasp during a grasping procedure. We then present a tactile experience based hand adjustment algorithm to synthesize a hand adjustment and optimize the hand pose to achieve a stable grasp. Experiments show that our method improves the grasping performance under pose uncertainty.", "paper_title": "Stable grasping under pose uncertainty using tactile feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000331978600002"}
