The key idea behind these algorithms is to use a grid-based discretization scheme to transform the continuous optimization problem into a search problem over a specially constructed finite graph, and then to apply dynamic programming to find an approximation of the global solution. In the analyzed example it is the minimum-time ski line, represented as a piecewise-linear function (a method of elimination of unfeasible solutions is proposed). Serial and parallel versions of the basic optimization algorithm are presented in detail (pseudo-code, time and memory complexity). Possible extensions of the basic algorithm are also described. The implementation of these algorithms is based on OpenCL. The included experimental results show that contemporary heterogeneous computers can be treated as mu-HPC platforms-they offer high performance (the best speedup was equal to 128) while remaining energy and cost efficient (which is crucial in embedded systems, e.g., trajectory planners of autonomous robots). The presented algorithms can be applied to many trajectory optimization problems, including those having a black-box represented performance measure.", "paper_title": "HIGH-PERFORMANCE SIMULATION-BASED ALGORITHMS FOR AN ALPINE SKI RACER'S TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZATION IN HETEROGENEOUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000343105700007"}
