However, the dynamic and steady-state behaviors of these motors are quite dependent on the permanent magnet (PM) type, configuration, and volume in rotor structures. This paper uses a novel structure of Interior-PMSMs for traction applications with fragmental buried rotor magnets in order to achieve low torque ripple, iron losses, and cogging torque. In this paper, first, the effect of the PM type on a d-q equivalent circuit model is examined. Next, the design and simulation of an Interior-PMSM for HEV traction drive application, in order to extract the output values of the motor and sensitivity analysis of the PM type, are done using a 3-dimensional finite element method model. We then present the back electromotive force, power factor, cogging torque, flux density, torque per ampere diagram, PM volume, and constant power speed ratio value behavior of the designed Interior-PMSM with different PMs in the rotor structure, and we discuss the effect of temperature variation on these output parameters. This study can help designers in the design approach of such motors.", "paper_title": "Study on interior permanent magnet synchronous motors for hybrid electric vehicle traction drive application considering permanent magnet type and temperature", "paper_id": "WOS:000344740600010"}
