The IT2FNN, which combines the merits of interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (FLS) and neural network, is developed to simplify the computation and to confront the uncertainties of the X-Y-theta motion control stage. Moreover, the parameter learning of the IT2FNN based on the supervised gradient descent method is performed on line. The experimental results show that the tracking performance of the IT2FNN is significantly improved compared to type-1 FNN. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
