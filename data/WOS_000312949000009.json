Despite this direct advantage, the introduction of femtocells challenges traditional interference mechanisms because of the ad hoc and dense nature of femtocell deployment. In this paper, we propose an optimal downlink frequency assignment scheme. The proposed algorithm is modeled as a transportation problem to optimally allocate frequency subcarriers with the objective of maximizing the system capacity. The scheme can be used as a benchmark for assessing the suitability of interference mitigation schemes in femtocellular networks.
