However, the temporal consistency of animations synthesized under dynamic environment sequences has not been fully studied. This paper addresses this problem and proposes a novel method, namely spatiotemporal sampling, to fully exploit both the temporal and spatial coherence of environment sequences. Our method treats an environment sequence as a spatiotemporal volume and samples the sequence by stratifying the volume adaptively. For this purpose, we first present a new metric to measure the importance of each stratified volume. A stratification algorithm is then proposed to adaptively suppress the abrupt temporal and spatial changes in the generated sampling patterns. The proposed method is able to automatically adjust the number of samples for each environment frame and produce temporally coherent sampling patterns. Comparative experiments demonstrate the capability of our method to produce smooth and consistent animations under dynamic environment sequences.", "paper_title": "Spatiotemporal Sampling of Dynamic Environment Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000293456100013"}
