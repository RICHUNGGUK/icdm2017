This task, defined as wastewater treatment process synthesis, is currently based on expert decisions and previous experiences. This paper proposes a new approach based on mathematical programming to manage the complexity of the problem. The approach generates/identifies novel and optimal wastewater treatment process selection, and the interconnection between unit operations to create a process flow diagram. Towards this end, a superstructure approach is used to represent the treatment alternatives for reaction and separation. A generic process interval model is used to describe each alternative in terms of input-output mass balances including conversion and separation factors. Next the design problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer (Non)linear Programming problem - MI(N)LP - and solved. A case study is formulated and solved to highlight the application of the framework.
