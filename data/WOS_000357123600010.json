Since all modern web browsers support JavaScript, it provides a medium that is both easy to distribute for developers and easy to access for users. This paper provides empirical data to answer the question: Is JavaScript fast enough for numerical computations? By measuring and comparing the runtime performance of benchmarks representative of a wide variety of scientific applications, we show that sequential JavaScript is within a factor of 2 of native code. Parallel code usingWebCL shows speed improvements of up to 2.28 over JavaScript for the majority of the benchmarks.", "paper_title": "Using JavaScript and WebCL for Numerical Computations: A Comparative Study of Native and Web Technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000357123600010"}
