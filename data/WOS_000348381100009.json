We determine an approximation to the number of decomposables over a finite field. The tame case, where the field characteristic p does not divide the degree n of f, is reasonably well understood, and we obtain exponentially decreasing relative error bounds. The wild case, where p divides n, is more challenging and our error bounds are weaker.", "paper_title": "Counting Decomposable Univariate Polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000348381100009"}
