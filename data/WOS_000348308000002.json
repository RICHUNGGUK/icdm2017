The promise of this modern technology is dependent on our understanding of cellular complexity to allow us to engineer cells with novel function. In this regard, the fields of computer science and synthetic biology are critical for accelerating both our understanding of biological systems, and our ability to quantitatively engineer cells. Thus, advances in biology and biotechnology are arising at the intersection of computer science and synthetic biology approaches. This review seeks to introduce the field of synthetic biology to the computer science community, and to ignite a curiosity and interest in fostering a unique synergy for possible collaborations between synthetic biologists and computer scientists.", "paper_title": "Parallel Networks: Synthetic Biology and Artificial Intelligence", "paper_id": "WOS:000348308000002"}
