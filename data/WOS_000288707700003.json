This becomes possible with the development of commodity computation resources that are capable of processing massive data in parallel across multiple processors. On the other hand, there is always a trade-off between the quantity of the model features that are simulated and the plausibility of the visual realism because of the limited computation resources. Also, to keep the resources' to be used efficiently within the other modeling approaches such as skin reflectance, aging, animation, etc., one must consider the efficiency of the method being used in the simulation. In this paper, we present an efficient method to customize the size of a human body model to personalize it with industry standard parameters. One of the major contributions of this method is that it is possible to generate a range of different size body models by using anthropometry surveys. This process is not limited by data-driven mesh deformation but also adapts the skeleton and motion to keep the consistency between different body layers.", "paper_title": "Skeleton-aware size variations in digital mannequins", "paper_id": "WOS:000288707700003"}
