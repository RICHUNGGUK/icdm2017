A controller applying the predictive functional control is hence designed, for the purpose of improving the control capability through realizing the presumption of mould matching and multi-step prognosis. The results of both the simulation based on MATLAB and the experiment based on distributed control system (DCS) show that the method put forward in this paper are not only correct but also effective.", "paper_title": "The networked control systems based on predictive functional control", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300136"}
