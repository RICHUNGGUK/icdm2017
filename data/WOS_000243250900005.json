Principle components analysis followed by Fisher analysis is used for dimensionality reduction and construction of individual feature spaces. Recognition is done by probabilistically fusing the confidence weights derived from each feature space. The performance of the method is validated on FERET and AR databases. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
