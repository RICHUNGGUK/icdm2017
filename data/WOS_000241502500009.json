A mission-adaptable hybrid route-planning algorithm based on flight roadmap is proposed, which combines existing global and local methods (Dijkstra algorithm, SAS and D*) into a two-level framework. The environment information and constraints for UAV are integrated into the procedure of building flight roadmap and searching for routes. The route-planning algorithm utilizes domain-specific knowledge and operates in real time with near-optimal solution quality, which is important to uncertain and adversarial environment. Other planners do not provide all of the functionality, namely real-time planning and replanning, near-optimal solution quality, and the ability to model complex 3D constraints.", "paper_title": "Mission-adaptable route planning in uncertain and adversarial environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000241502500009"}
