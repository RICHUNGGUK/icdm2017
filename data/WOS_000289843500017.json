The link lengths are firstly transformed into independent components through independent component analysis. Then, the value of positional variables is computed by using the Nelder-Mead algorithm by taking advantage of the relationships between the independent components and the positional variables. Simulations have been conducted to test the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a better performance than the other published algorithms.", "paper_title": "Forward Kinematics Analysis of a Six-Degree-of-Freedom Stewart Platform Based on Independent Component Analysis and Nelder-Mead Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000289843500017"}
