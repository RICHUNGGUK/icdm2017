Functions in the special class of submodular functions satisfy the criterion , . As an alternative to the standard continuous greedy algorithm, the proposed algorithm can substantially reduce the computational expense by removing redundant computational steps and, therefore, is able to efficiently handle the maximization problems for this special class of submodular functions. Examples of such functions are presented.", "paper_title": "An accelerated continuous greedy algorithm for maximizing strong submodular functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000363033600019"}
