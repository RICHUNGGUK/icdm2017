Aiming to discover novel CYP53 inhibitors, we employed two parallel virtual :screening protocols and evaluated highest scoring hit compounds by analyzing the spectral binding interactions, by surveying the antifungal activity, and assessing the inhibition of catalytic activity. On the basis of combined results, we selected 3-Methyl-4-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)berizoic acid (compound 2) is the best candidate for hit-to-lead follow-up in the antifungal drug discovery process.", "paper_title": "Virtual Screening Yields Inhibitors of Novel Antifungal Drug Target, Benzoate 4-Monooxygenase", "paper_id": "WOS:000311461400025"}
