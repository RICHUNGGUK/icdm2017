The technique called opportunistic interference management achieves dirty paper coding capacity asymptotically with minimum feedback required. When there are K antennas at the base station with M mobile users in the cell, the proposed technique only requires K integer numbers related to channel state information between mobile users and base station. The encoding and decoding complexity of this scheme is the same as that of point-to-point communications, which makes the implementation of this technique easy. An antenna selection scheme is proposed at the base station to reduce the minimum required mobile users significantly at the expense of reasonable increase in feedback. In order to guarantee fairness, a new algorithm is presented that incorporates opportunistic interference management into existing Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) standard.
