LAEq generalises classical propositional logic to the effect that conclusions can be drawn with a quantified imprecision. To this end, properties are modelled by subsets of a distance space and statements are of the form that one property implies another property within a certain limit of tolerance. We adopt the conceptual framework defined by E. Ruspini; our work is towards a contribution to the investigation of suitable logical calculi. LA(q) is based on the assumption that the distance function is a quasimetric. We provide a proof calculus for LAEq and we show its soundness and completeness for finite theories. As our main tool for showing completeness, we use a representation of proofs by means of weighted directed graphs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
