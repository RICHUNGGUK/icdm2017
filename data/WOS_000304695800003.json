Somewhat surprisingly, the CP protocol has never been improved for nearly two decades since its advent. We note that the CP protocol is usually used as a non-interactive proof by using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, which inevitably relies on the random oracle model (ROM) and assumes that the adversary is computationally bounded. In this paper, we present an EQDL protocol in the ROM which saves approximately 40% of the computational cost and approximately 33% of the prover's outgoing message size when instantiated with the same security parameter. The catch is that our security guarantee only holds for computationally bounded adversaries. Our idea can be naturally extended for simultaneously showing the equality of n discrete logarithms with O(1)-size commitment, in contrast to the n-element adaption of the CP protocol which requires O(n)-size. This improvement benefits a variety of interesting cryptosystems, ranging from signatures and anonymous credential systems, to verifiable secret sharing and threshold cryptosystems. As an example, we present a signature scheme that only takes one (offline) exponentiation to sign, without utilizing pairing, relying on the standard decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption.", "paper_title": "Zero-Knowledge Argument for Simultaneous Discrete Logarithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000304695800003"}
