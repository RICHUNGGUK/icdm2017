Ben-Sasson and Wigderson have proved a general width-size tradeoff result that can be used to prove many of the lower bounds on resolution complexity in a uniform manner. However, it does not apply directly to the well known pigeonhole clauses. The present paper generalizes their width-size tradeoff so that it applies directly to (a monotone transformation of) the pigeonhole clauses. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
