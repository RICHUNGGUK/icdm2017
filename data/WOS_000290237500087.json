However, the deficiency is not due to the method itself, but lies in the monitoring statistic construction and its confidence limit determination. This paper proposed a distribution-free method, which employs the one-class SVM to construct new monitoring statistics. Thus two new statistics are developed separately in two subspaces of the PCA model: the principal component subspace and the residual subspace. When some fault has been detected, a novel fault reconstruction scheme is proposed. For fault identification, two new identification indices are constructed. The performance of the proposed method in fault detection, reconstruction and identification is evaluated through a case study of the Tennessee Eastman (TE) benchmark process. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
