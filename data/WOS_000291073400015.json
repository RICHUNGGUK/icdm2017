From the perspective of rule acquisition, a new framework of knowledge reduction for decision formal contexts is formulated and a corresponding reduction method is also developed by using the discernibility matrix and Boolean function. The presented framework of knowledge reduction is for general decision formal contexts, and based on the proposed reduction method, knowledge hidden in a decision formal context can compactly be unravelled in the form of implication rules.
