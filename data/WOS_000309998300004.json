The approach is motivated by an analysis of the functional and structural properties of relational diagrams in terms of their role as external representations. This analysis informs the design of a multiple perspective hierarchy-based model that captures modality independent features of a diagram when translating it into an audio accessible form. The paper outlines design lessons learnt from two user studies that were conducted to evaluate the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Interactive hierarchy-based auditory displays for accessing and manipulating relational diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000309998300004"}
