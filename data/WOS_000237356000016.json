Although the research results were somewhat inconclusive, the authors recommend that practitioners generally use inspections for requirements and design and testing for code. Also, because different defect detection methods find different types of defects, the methods might be complementary. Finally, they list factors that help frame the question and guide practitioners in integrating and evaluating the detection methods in their environments.", "paper_title": "What do we know about defect detection methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000237356000016"}
