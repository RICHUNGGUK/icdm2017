In this paper, we propose the probabilistic Voronoi diagram (PVD) for processing moving nearest neighbor queries on uncertain data, namely the probabilistic moving nearest neighbor (PMNN) queries. A PMNN query finds the most probable nearest neighbor of a moving query point continuously. To process PMNN queries efficiently, we provide two techniques: a pre-computation approach and sin incremental approach. In the pre-computation approach, we develop an algorithm to efficiently evaluate PMNN queries based on the pre-computed PVD for the entire data set. In the incremental approach, we propose an incremental probabilistic safe region based technique that does not require to pre-compute the whole PVD to answer the PMNN query. In this incremental approach, we exploit the knowledge for a known region to compute the lower bound of the probability of an object being the nearest neighbor. Experimental results show that our approaches significantly outperform a sampling based approach by orders of magnitude in terms of I/O, query processing time, and communication overheads.
