The aim of this study is to show the feasibility of a broader monitoring concept, embracing many more subjects, by monitoring contactless vital signs with sensors embedded in non-ICU settings. In order to conduct the experiments, a system was designed to measure electrocardiograms (ECG) unobtrusively by capacitive sensors in various patient fitments e.g., stretchers, hospital-beds and wheelchairs. Contact ECG and contactless ECG measurements by shielded textile electrodes are contrasted to each other to display the potential of contactless monitoring. Our experiments demonstrate that the contactless ECG recordings are of sufficient quality and later used for further standard ECG analysis like QRS-complex detection. We believe that our results are motivating for the potential future care facility featuring a personal, non-obtrusive and yet permanent health monitoring system.", "paper_title": "Textile-based, contactless ECG monitoring for non-ICU clinical settings", "paper_id": "WOS:000209332400017"}
