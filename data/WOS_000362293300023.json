The important problem is to represent topological structures hidden in a cloud by using skeletons with cycles. All past skeletonization methods require extra parameters such as a scale or a noise bound. We define a homologically persistent skeleton, which depends only on a cloud of points and contains optimal subgraphs representing 1-dimensional cycles in the cloud across all scales. The full skeleton is a universal structure encoding topological persistence of cycles directly on the cloud. Hence a 1-dimensional shape of a cloud can be now easily predicted by visualizing our skeleton instead of guessing a scale for the original unstructured cloud. We derive more subgraphs to reconstruct provably close approximations to an unknown graph given only by a noisy sample in any metric space. For a cloud of n points in the plane, the full skeleton and all its important subgraphs can be computed in time O(nlogn)", "paper_title": "A one-dimensional homologically persistent skeleton of an unstructured point cloud in any metric space", "paper_id": "WOS:000362293300023"}
