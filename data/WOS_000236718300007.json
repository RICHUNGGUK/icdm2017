For EPON, two main transmission overhead groups are defined, namely, Ethernet encapsulation overhead and EPON-specific scheduling overhead. Simulations are performed using the source aggregation algorithm (SAA) to verify the Ethernet encapsulation overhead for various synthetic and measured packet size distributions (PSDs). A SAA based an EPON simulator is used to verify both upstream and downstream overall channel efficiencies. The obtained simulation results closely match the theoretical limits estimated based on the IEEE 802.3ah standard. An estimated throughput of 820 to 900 Mbits/s is available in the upstream direction, whereas in the downstream direction effective throughput ranges from 915 to 935 Mbits/s.
