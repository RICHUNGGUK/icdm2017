First, the proposed method calculates the normalized weighting vector of each closest fuzzy rule. Then, it calculates the composite weight of each closest fuzzy rule. Then, it calculates the left normal point b(l)* and the right normal point b(r)(*) of the fuzzy interpolative reasoning result B* = (b(0)*, b(1)*, ..., b(l)*, b(r)*, ..., b(t-2)*, b(t-1)*), respectively. Finally, it calculates the characteristic points b(0)*, b(1)*, ..., b(l-1)*, b(r-1)*, ..., b(t-2)* and b(t-1)* of the fuzzy interpolative reasoning result B*, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate more reasonable fuzzy interpolative reasoning results than the existing methods for sparse fuzzy rule-based systems. The proposed method can overcome the drawbacks of Chang et al.'s method (IEEE Trans. Fuzzy Syst. 16(5) (2008) 1285-1301), Chen and Ko's method (IEEE Trans. Fuzzy Syst. 16(6) (2008) 1626-1648) and Huang and Shen's method (IEEE Trans. Fuzzy Syst. 14(2) (2006) 340-359) for multiple fuzzy rules interpolation. It provides us with a useful way for dealing with multiple fuzzy rules interpolation in sparse fuzzy rule-based systems.", "paper_title": "MULTIPLE FUZZY RULES INTERPOLATION WITH WEIGHTED ANTECEDENT VARIABLES IN SPARSE FUZZY RULE-BASED SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000325277900009"}
