It is shown that the Hopf bifurcation occurs as the bifurcation parameter, the mean delay, passes a critical value where a family of periodic solutions emanates from the equilibrium. The existence and stability Of such solutions are determined by the Hopf bifurcation theorem in the frequency domain and the generalized Nyquist stability criterion. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
