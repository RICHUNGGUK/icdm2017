The approach is based on the use of an inventory of three types of modules i.e., power and control module, joint module and specialized module. Each module type aims to balance versatility and functionality. Their design permits rapid and cost effective design and fabrication. They are interchangeable in different ways to form different robot or system configurations. Depending on the task, the operator decides what type of robot can provide the best performance within the mission. A spherical joint module is described and used to build different robots, hence, forward and inverse kinematics models are obtained. Finally, from the modules described in this work, several robot configurations such as robotic arms, leg-based robots and wheel-based robots are assembled to demonstrate the execution of manipulation and locomotion tasks.
