To cope with this challenge, in the first part of the paper, a general model for distributed supply-chain including suppliers, processing units. assemblers, and transportation systems is presented with the aim of keeping the framework as general as possible. In the second part of the paper, an optimisation algorithm is also discussed. (C) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
