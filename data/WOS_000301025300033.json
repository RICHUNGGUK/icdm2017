In most ASM applications, calibration is based on more or less ad-hoc and trial and error approaches. Calibration of the ASMs remains the weakest link in the overall process of modelling biological wastewater treatment. In this paper, a calibration approach is proposed where the need for expert knowledge and modeller effort is significantly reduced. The calibration approach combines identifiability analysis and evolutionary optimisers to automate the ASM calibration. Identifiability analysis is used to deal with poor identifiability of the model structures and evolutionary optimisers are used to identify the model parameters. The applied evolutionary optimisers are Genetic Algorithms and Differential Evolution. Performance of the evolutionary optimisers is compared with a previously proposed calibration approach based on Monte Carlo simulations. All methods were capable of calibrating the model when given enough computation time. However, some of the evolutionary optimisation methods had an advantage in terms of computation time against the Monte Carlo method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
