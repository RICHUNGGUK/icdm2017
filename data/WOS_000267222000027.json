For each user, the transmission of packets follows a specific periodical pattern, called the protocol sequence. Due to the lack of feedback, the beginning of the protocol sequences cannot be synchronized and nonzero relative offsets are inevitable. It results in variation of throughput. In this paper, we investigate optimal protocol sequence sets, in the sense that the throughput variance is zero. Such protocol sequences are said to be shift-invariant (SI). The characterizing properties of SI protocol sequences are presented. We also prove that SI sequences are identifiable, meaning that the receiver is able to determine the sender of each successfully received packet without any packet header. A general construction of SI sequences that meets the lower bound on sequence length is given. Besides, we study the least periods of SI sequences, and show that the least periods must be distinct in some cases. The throughput performance is compared numerically with other protocol sequences.", "paper_title": "Shift-Invariant Protocol Sequences for the Collision Channel Without Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000267222000027"}
