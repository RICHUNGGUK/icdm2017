We prove that the known implementations of full laziness are all equivalent in terms of the number of beta-reductions performed, although they behave differently regarding the duplication of terms. We establish a link between the optimality theories of weak lambda-calculi and first-order rewriting systems by expressing fully lazy lambda-lifting in our framework, thus emphasizing the first-order essence of weak reduction.", "paper_title": "A Unified Approach to Fully Lazy Sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000300548100037"}
