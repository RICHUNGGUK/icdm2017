We show that our scheme is very cost effective while keeping connection availability, recovery time, and power budget at an acceptable level. We focus on the protection schemes, overview the existing methods, and introduce a link protection scheme compatible with smooth migration from TDM-PON to hybrid WDM/ TDM-PON. Furthermore, we analyze the cost, connection availability, recovery time, and optical link budget for different protection schemes in order to find the cost-effective solution both for the TDM-PON and hybrid WDM/ TDM- PON.
