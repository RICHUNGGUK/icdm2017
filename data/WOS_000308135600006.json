A series of 14 \"Podcasted\" exemplars were developed to help graduate online students visualize the application of health informatics concepts in real-world settings and to determine the impact of podcasting on student cognition, engagement, and satisfaction. Although no significant differences in student cognition scores or student engagement were found between course conditions, course satisfaction was significantly higher in Podcasted weeks of the course. Also, student engagement was positively correlated with aspects of course satisfaction and overall cognition scores under both course conditions. This result suggests that student engagement plays an important mediating role in improving cognition. Students' use of podcasting did produce a temporary drop in scores for one group; therefore, more research is needed to understand these unintended consequences. With distance/online education becoming mainstream, it is imperative that faculty deploy and confirm ways to improve student cognition, engagement, and satisfaction.", "paper_title": "Using Podcasts to Help Students Apply Health Informatics Concepts Benefits and Unintended Consequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000308135600006"}
