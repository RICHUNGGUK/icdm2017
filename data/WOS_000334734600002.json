A weighted knowledge base is a set of weighted formulas of the form (phi(i),alpha(i)) where phi(i) is a propositional formula and alpha(i) is the certainty degree associated with phi(i). This paper addresses two issues in the possibility theory framework: i) how to compare two weighted knowledge bases with respect to their information contents ? and ii) how to syntactically define the concept of forgetting variables ? We show that comparing knowledge bases is the counterpart of the concept of the specificity relation defined between possibility distributions.", "paper_title": "Comparing and Weakening Possibilistic Knowledge Bases", "paper_id": "WOS:000334734600002"}
