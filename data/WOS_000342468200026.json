As the number of cores on a chip keeps increasing, it adds up the complexity and impacts more on both power and performance of a processor. In multi-processors, the number of cores and various parameters, such as issue-width, number of instructions and execution time, are key design factors to balance the amount of thread-level parallelism and instruction-level parallelism. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive simulation study that aims to find the optimum number of processor cores in desktop/laptop computing processor models with shallow pipeline depth. This paper also explores the trade-off between the number of cores and different parameters used in multi-processors in terms of power-performance gains and analyzes the impact of 3D stacking on the design of simultaneous multi-threading and chip multiprocessing. Our analysis shows that the optimum number of cores varies with different classes of workloads, namely: SPEC2000, SPEC2006 and MiBench. Simulation study is presented using architectures with shorter pipeline depth, showing that (1) the optimum number of cores for power-performance is 8, (2) the optimum number of threads in the range [2, 4], and (3) for beyond 32 cores, multi-core processors are no longer efficient in terms of performance benefits and overall power consumption.", "paper_title": "A comparative simulation study on the power-performance of multi-core architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000342468200026"}
