This set is closely related to the feasible set of the multi-module capacitated lot-sizing (MML) problem with(out) backlogging. We present a family of valid inequalities for the continuous multi-mixing set and identify conditions under which they are facet-defining. The cycle inequalities, -step MIR inequalities, and mixed -step MIR inequalities are special cases of these inequalities. We also present an exact separation algorithm for our inequalities. We then use these inequalities to generate valid inequalities for MML with(out) backlogging. Our computational results show that our cuts are very effective in solving the MML instances, resulting in substantial reduction in the integrality gap, number of nodes, and total solution time.", "paper_title": "#NAME?", "paper_id": "WOS:000364528000006"}
