Design/methodology/approach -Critical managerial issues and success factors for conflict management in client-supplier collaborative NPD were first identified. A self-assessment process and associated methodologies were then established. With the development of a prototype self-assessment system, the proposed self-assessment methodologies and process were validated in industry. Findings - A total of 13 critical factors for conflict management in client-supplier collaborative NPD environment were identified. Based on the hierarchy model of the factors, a self-assessment system and process, called PAIR, was established. The proposed self-assessment system and process was developed and validated with six companies with positive results. Originality/value - Conflict is an inevitable phenomenon in client-supplier collaborative NPD, which affects NPD performance in terms of product quality, meeting of target delivery schedule and development cost. The developed system and process enables clients and suppliers to assess their conflict management practices and identify improvement areas. It provides a platform for the collaborating parties to continually improve their conflict management and in turn NPD performance.", "paper_title": "Self-assessment of conflict management in client-supplier collaborative new product development", "paper_id": "WOS:000248068600006"}
