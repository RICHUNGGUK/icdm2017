The third proposed estimator is ((theta) over cap (mix)) which is the mixture of maximum likelihood ((theta) over cap (1)) and ((theta) over cap (2)) which is the first Bayes estimator, the value of proportion (p) which minimize the mean square error of ((theta) over cap (mix)) is also derived. The comparison has been done through simulation using different sets of initial values and different sample size using mean square error (MSE).
