We express first the new flattened simulation structure and give the corresponding transformation functions. We analyze performance tests conducted on this new simulation structure to measure its efficiency. Then, having selected the essential concepts in the elaboration of the Workflow, we present a language of description to define the Workflow processes. Finally, we define a distributed Workflow Reference Model that interfaces components of the Workflow with respect to the High-Level Architecture standard. Today enterprises can take advantage of this platform in the context of networking where interoperability, flexibility, and efficiency are challenging concepts.", "paper_title": "A Generalized Discrete Event System (G-DEVS) Flattened Simulation Structure: Application to High-Level Architecture (HLA) Compliant Simulation of Workflow", "paper_id": "WOS:000274912500003"}
