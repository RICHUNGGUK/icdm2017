The experiences are gathered in collaborative applied research projects between the enterprises and the research team. Our model also integrates applied research and education. It contains technology expertise and business knowledge with collaboration involving the enterprises, the research personnel and educational personnel. The model emphasizes to proactively take into account the needs of current and future customers. The research approach has been found beneficial both sides: innovation capability has increased remarkably in both partners. The collaborative applied research projects have produced tens of new business opportunities and many of them have already been used in the enterprises. Cognitive infocommunications has a remarkable role in many of these innovations. The developed concept is planned to be extended to wider users in the future via gamification where use, design, elements and characteristics for computer games are used in non-game contexts.", "paper_title": "Enhancing innovation capability with cognitive infocommunications", "paper_id": "WOS:000357256900007"}
