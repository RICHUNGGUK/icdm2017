Firstly, the different total stress paths followed by DDS devices that impose constant cross-sectional area using a stiff external boundary, and those that use a constant total stress lateral boundary condition are explored. This is done by conducting finite element analysis of a single cubic element. It is shown that this element may be subjected to perfect simple shear using four different boundary condition types. Each boundary condition type results in the same effective stress path, but different total stress paths and excess pore pressures. The boundary condition types are related to DSS devices in use. The second aspect investigated is the fact that no DSS device can impose true simple shear conditions, as they are unable to generate the required complementary shear stress on the vertical boundaries. Full three-dimensional finite element analysis of a UWA/Berkeley type simple shear device, which has a constant total stress lateral boundary, is then presented. The results are compared to the ideal solution and effects of stress non-homogeneity on the friction angle and undrained shear strength, deduced from a standard interpretation, are established.
