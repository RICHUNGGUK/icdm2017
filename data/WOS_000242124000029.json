We show that their graph dimension, a kind of measure for PAC learning complexity in the multiclass classification setting, is Theta(n + k). This graph dimension is significantly smaller than the graph dimension Omega(nk) of the class of {1, 2,..., k}-valued decision-list functions naturally defined using k - 1 linear discrimination functions. We also show a risk bound of learning linear ranking functions in the ordinal regression setting by a technique similar to that used in the proof of an upper bound of their graph dimension.", "paper_title": "Learning-related complexity of linear ranking functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000242124000029"}
