The peculiar attribute of an RPS system, in tracking the compliance of individual profit-maximizer electricity producers with a collective target (share) for renewable sources, resembles a coupled constraint game. After presenting a generic game theoretic model for an RPS system, a special case study will be explored, to pave the path for an analytical outcome. This is accompanied by a result analysis section to investigate the impact of key parameters on the equilibrium, leading to recommendations and future research avenues.", "paper_title": "Renewable Portfolio Standard Policy: A Game-theoretic Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000290699800007"}
