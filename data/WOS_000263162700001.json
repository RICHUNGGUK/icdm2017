In single-chip digital cameras, the resolution is further degraded because such devices use a color filter array to capture only one spectral component at a pixel location. The process of estimating the missing two color values at each pixel location is known as demosaicking. Demosaicking methods usually exploit the correlation among color channels. When there are multiple images, it is possible not only to have better estimates of the missing color values but also to improve the spatial resolution further (using super-resolution reconstruction). In this paper, we propose a multi-frame spatial resolution enhancement algorithm based on the projections onto convex sets technique.", "paper_title": "Restoration of Bayer-sampled Image Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000263162700001"}
