It assumes the reflected signals have negligible Doppler shifts, so the correlations are calculated along the time axis only. In this correspondence, a systematic construction for radar arrays is provided by means of homogeneous uniform difference matrices. A systematic construction for properly centered permutation matrices, a special kind of homogeneous uniform difference matrices, is also provided, which partially solves the open problems posed by Zhang and Tu.", "paper_title": "A systematic construction for radar arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000252256900031"}
