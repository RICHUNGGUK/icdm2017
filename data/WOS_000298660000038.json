By carrying out global qualitative and bifurcation analysis, it is shown that the system exhibits some new and complicated behaviors: if the basic reproduction number is larger than unity, the number of infected individuals will show persistent behavior, either converging to some positive constant or oscillating; and if the basic reproduction number is below unity, the model may exhibit complicated behaviors including: (i) backward bifurcation; (ii) almost sure disease eradication where the number of infective individuals tends to zero for all initial positions except the interior equilibria; (iii) \"oscillating'' backward bifurcation where either the number of infective individuals oscillates persistently, if the initial position lies in a region covering the stable endemic equilibrium, or disease eradication, if the initial position lies outside this region; (iv) disease eradication for all initial positions if the basic reproduction number is less than a turning point value. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the conclusions. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
