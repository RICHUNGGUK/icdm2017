Among the most successful formulations is the finite-volume scheme proposed by Xu [K. Xu, A gas-kinetic BGK scheme for the Navier-Stokes equations and its connection with artificial dissipation and Godunov method, J. Comput. Phys. 171 (48) (2001) 289-335]. In this paper we build on this theoretical framework mainly with the aim to improve the efficiency and convergence of the scheme, and extend the range of application to three-dimensional complex geometries using general unstructured meshes. To that end we propose a modified BGK finite-volume scheme, which significantly reduces the computational cost, and improves the behavior on stretched unstructured meshes. Furthermore, a modified data reconstruction procedure is presented to remove the known problem that the Chapman-Enskog expansion of the BGK equation fixes the Prandtl number at unity. The new Prandtl number correction operates at the level of the partial differential equations and is also significantly cheaper for general formulations than previously published methods. We address the issue of convergence acceleration by applying multigrid techniques to the kinetic discretization. The proposed modifications and convergence acceleration help make large-scale computations feasible at a cost competitive with conventional discretization techniques, while still exploiting the advantages of the gas-kinetic discretization, such as computing full viscous fluxes for finite volume schemes on a simple two-point stencil.
