Design/methodology/approach - The proposed control method uses two kind of techniques: a flux-based commutation technique prevents the negative phase torque always. On the other hand, a direct phase-torque distribution technique gives suitable each phase-torque command under limited DC voltage. These techniques can track motor torque to the command. These control schemes are implemented on a small processor and a field programmable gate array. Findings - The experimental results of the EV show small torque ripple at low speed on both acceleration and regenerative braking. Changing the parameter of the current stop angle can improve torque ripple at high speed. The proposed method can effectively control motor torque. Practical implications - The proposed method can reduce torque ripple but the implementation is very simple. The proposed control method can be used for any applications. So, that contributes to expand the application of SR motors. Originality/value - The proposed control scheme requires just static torque curve obtain by finite element analysis or simple experiments. Complex parameters, such as nonlinear inductance, current to torque profiles, and other heuristics parameters, are not necessary. The proposed control is simple but practical.", "paper_title": "Instantaneous torque control using flux-based commutation and phase-torque distribution technique for SR motor EV", "paper_id": "WOS:000274517900012"}
