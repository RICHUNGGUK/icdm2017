This interest yields considerable amount of proposals targeting to overcome the main bottleneck (i.e. the exhaustive search over the list of all tag entries) which appears in the back-end database for large-scale RFID tag deployments. A class of these proposals contains RFID protocols where the server authenticates the tag in a negligible constant/sub-linear time for a more frequent normal state and needs a linear search in a rare abnormal states. In this study, however, we show that such protocols having unbalanced states are subject to side-channel attacks and do not preserve the RFID privacy. To illustrate this brutal security flaw, we conduct our analysis on different RFID protocols.", "paper_title": "Unbalanced states violates RFID privacy", "paper_id": "WOS:000332668100007"}
