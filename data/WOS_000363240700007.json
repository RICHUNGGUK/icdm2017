Its key advantages are low-complexity hardware and high-error tolerance. SC has recently been finding application in several important areas, including image processing, artificial neural networks, and low-density parity check decoding. Despite a long history, SC still lacks a comprehensive design methodology, so existing designs tend to be either ad hoc or based on specialized design methods. In this paper, we demonstrate a fundamental relation between stochastic circuits and spectral transforms. Based on this, we propose a general, transform-based approach to the analysis and synthesis of SC circuits. We implemented this approach in a program spectral transform use in stochastic circuit synthesis (STRAUSS), which also includes a method of optimizing stochastic number-generation circuitry. Finally, we show that the area cost of the circuits generated by STRAUSS is significantly smaller than that of previous work.", "paper_title": "STRAUSS: Spectral Transform Use in Stochastic Circuit Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000363240700007"}
