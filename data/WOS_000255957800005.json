Our findings indicate that the budget deficit, private investment and economic growth are cointegrated. The directed graph results show that the innovations in private investment lead real GDP and the innovations in budget deficits lead real GDP and interest rates in contemporaneous time. And, the budget deficit is the major contribution to the changes of private investment and economic growth.", "paper_title": "On the causal relationship between fiscal and macroeconomic variables: A directed graphs approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000255957800005"}
