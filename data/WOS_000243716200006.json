The model is based on the cut-cell technique in a fixed-grid system. In this model, a body is approximated by the partial cell treatment (PCT), in which an irregular body is represented by the volumetric fraction of solid in Cartesian cells. The body motion is tracked by Lagrangian method whereas the fluid motion around the body is solved by Eulerian method. The concept of \"locally relative stationary (LRS)\" is introduced in this study. In the LRS method, a Source term is added locally to the conventional continuity equation on body surfaces to take account or body motions, which subsequently affects the computational results of fluid pressure and flow velocity around the body. The LRS method is incorporated into an earlier Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations model developed by Lin and Liu [A numerical study of breaking waves in the surf zone. J Fluid Mech 1998359:239-64]. The new model is capable of simulating generic turbulent free surface flows and their interaction with a moving body or multiple moving bodies. A series of numerical experiments have been conducted to verify the accuracy of the model for simulation of moving body interaction with a free surface flow. These tests include the generation of a solitary wave with the prescribed wave paddle movements, water exit and water impact and entry of a horizontal circular cylinder, fluid sloshing in a horizontally excited tank, and the acceleration/deceleration of an elliptical cylinder near a water surface. Excellent agreements are obtained when numerical results are compared to available analytical, experimental, and other numerical results. The model is a simple-to-implement Computational tool for simulating a moving body in turbulent free surface flows. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
