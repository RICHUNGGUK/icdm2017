This latter feature, which follows from Bell and Kochen Specker type arguments, is only present in systems with three or more mutually exclusive outcomes. Conversely, there exist local hidden variable models based on chocolate ball configurations utilizable for cryptography which cannot be realized by quantum systems. The possibility that quantum cryptography supported by value indefiniteness (contextuality) has practical advantages over more conventional quantum cryptographic protocols remains highly speculative.
