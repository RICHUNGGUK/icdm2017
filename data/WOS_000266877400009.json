We introduce generalized impact factor, which involves the historical citation observed, and potential future citation of a journal. It can be used to assess the journal influence dynamically. Gamma distributions are used to fit the distribution of the citation frequency. Variations of impact factor are used to rank the relative influence of several journals in biology.", "paper_title": "Using Extended R-Impact to Assess Journal Influence", "paper_id": "WOS:000266877400009"}
