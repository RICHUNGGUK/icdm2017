The idea is that these solutions can be used as benchmark problems when testing new algorithms for finding pure 0-1 solutions to topology optimization problems defined on discretized ground structures.", "paper_title": "Globally optimal benchmark solutions to some small-scale discretized continuum topology optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000248944600009"}
