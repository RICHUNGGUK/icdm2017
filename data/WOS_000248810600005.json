Particularly in the area of information space (re)construction, however, there is a need for inverse solutions; i.e., finding weights that result in regions with predefined area ratios. In this paper, we formulate an adaptive Voronoi solution and propose a raster-based optimization method for finding the associated weight set. The solution consists of a combination of simple, fixed-point iteration with an optional spatial resolution refinement along the regions' boundaries using quadtree decomposition. We present the corresponding algorithm and its complexity analysis. The method is successfully tested on a series of ideal-typical cases and the interactions between the adaptive technique and boundary resolution refinement are explored and assessed.", "paper_title": "Weight-proportional space partitioning using adaptive Voronoi diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000248810600005"}
