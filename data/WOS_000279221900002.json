Computer games are a multi-billion pound worldwide part of the entertainment industry. However, they are a relatively new type of software product and as such the manner in which they are designed and developed is still evolving. Computer games can be highly complex software systems that involve the expertise of a wide range of professionals ranging from programmers to animators, artists and musicians. When designing computer games, new game concepts can be difficult to communicate. In addition, the creative process could be benefited if game design ideas were capable of being shared widely and discussed. In this paper, we are to some extent shifting the focus from real world situation to what we shall term game world situation. That is, a logically simulated environment is created by defining situations and events based on the hierarchy structure of the situation. Our study defines event type, causality events and event normalization, and aims to develop a logical simulation method. These methods allow us to understand the communication of new game environment design. Specially, the introduction of the definition of events allows us to approach game design in a structural manner rather than by their classification. The proposed method was implemented in the context of changing among natural phenomena in a game environment.", "paper_title": "EVENT NORMALIZATION METHODOLOGY FOR COMPUTER GAME ENVIRONMENT SIMULATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000279221900002"}
