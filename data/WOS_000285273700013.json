This study develops an edge-sensitive demosaicing (ESD) algorithm for reconstructing a full-color image from a CFA image and to improve the reconstructed image quality. Based on the Bayer pattern, a CFA image contains twice as much information about green samples than red and blue samples. Hence, the green samples have strongly affected the quality of the final demosaiced color image. Conequently, the ESD algorithm demosaics green plane first. In reconstructing the green plane, the algorithm analyzes neighboring samples to estimate the value of missing green pixel. Moreover, according to the high spectral-spatial correlation between two of color different planes, R-G or B-C, the ESD algorithm interpolates the missing value of R-G and B-G color different planes by combining neighboring samples using appropriate weights, as determined by the spectral correction among samples to improve the quality of demosaiced 11 and B planes. The demosaiced G, R and B planes are used to complete the interpolation of the image. The simulation results demonstrate that the ESD algorithm achieves better visual perception with fewer false colors or zipper effects. Furthermore, the average CPSNR measurement of the proposed ESD algorithm exceeds those of previous demosaicing algorithms.", "paper_title": "AN EFFECTIVE DEMOSAICING ALGORITHM FOR CFA IMAGE", "paper_id": "WOS:000285273700013"}
