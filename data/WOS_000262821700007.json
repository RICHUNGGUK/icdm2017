Our principal objective is to develop an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) suggesting pedagogical assistances to the human teacher. For that, the ITS must obviously detect and classify erroneous actions produced by learners during the realization of procedural and collaborative work. Further, in order to better support human teacher and facilitate his comprehension, it is necessary to show the teacher why learner made an error. Addressing this issue, we firstly modeling the Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method (CREAM). Then, we integrate the retrospective analysis mechanism of CREAM into our existing ITS, thus enable the system to indicate the path of probable cause-effect explaining reasons why errors have occurred.", "paper_title": "Modeling of Errors Realized by a Human Learner in Virtual Environment for Training", "paper_id": "WOS:000262821700007"}
