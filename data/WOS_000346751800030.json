The crop model STICS was encapsulated in the modelling platform RECORD and new process-based developments were added to address environmental issues. We present plant and soil processes developed recently in STICS and describe three projects using STICS within RECORD: MICMAC-Design aims to design innovative cropping systems at field scale, integrating economic and epidemiological analysis and using a database to represent agricultural management; CRASH aims to develop and evaluate crop-allocation strategies at farm scale that meet water-shortage regulations, using links with databases, optimisation processes and farmers' representation; AICHA aims to analyse impacts of irrigation on the water table at catchment scale using links to a hydrological model, cluster computation, integrated economic and agronomic optimisation. Automated encapsulation procedures allow STICS and RECORD communities to work independently but to benefit from mutual exchanges. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
