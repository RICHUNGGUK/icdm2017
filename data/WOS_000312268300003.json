This increases the delivery delay and needs more computational power. However, in general, only a small region within medical video is of interest to the physician and thus if only this area is considered, the number of computations can be curtailed. In this paper, we present a technique whereby the region of interest specified by the physician is used to delimit the area where the more complex concealment techniques are applied. A cross-layer design approach in mobile worldwide interoperability for microwave access wireless communication environment is adopted in this paper to provide an optimized quality of experience in the region that matters most to the mobile physician while relaxing the requirements in the background, ensuring real-time delivery. Results show that a diagnostically acceptable peak signal-to-noise-ratio of about 36 dB can still be achieved within reasonable decoding time.", "paper_title": "Cross-Layer Design for Optimized Region of Interest of Ultrasound Video Data Over Mobile WiMAX", "paper_id": "WOS:000312268300003"}
