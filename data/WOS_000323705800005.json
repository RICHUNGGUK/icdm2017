Recently, Awasthi et al. proposed an efficient RSA-based remote user authentication scheme. In this paper, we will point out that Awasthi et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to a privileged insider attack, a password guessing attack and an impersonation attack. To improve the security, we also propose a new RSA-based remote user authentication scheme. The analysis shows our scheme could overcome the weaknesses in Awasthi et al.'s scheme and has better performance than their scheme.", "paper_title": "An Efficient RSA-Based Remote User Authentication Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000323705800005"}
