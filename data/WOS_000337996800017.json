To achieve good service quality for crowd sensing applications, incentive mechanisms are indispensable to attract more participants to guarantee long-term extensive user participation. Most of existing research works apply only for instantaneous sensing data collections, where all participants' information are known as a priori. Thus, how to tackle long-term extensive user participation occurring in practical crowd sensing applications with the coverage constraint becomes peculiarly challenging. In this paper, we model the problem as a restless multi-armed bandit process rather than a regular auction, where users submit their sensing data to the platform (the campaign organizer) over time, and the platform chooses a subset of users to collect sensing data. Then, to maximize the social welfare satisfying the coverage constraint for the infinite horizonal continuous sensing, we design incentive schemes based on heterogeneous-belief values for joint social states and realtime throughput. Analysis results indicate that our schemes outperform the best existing solution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
