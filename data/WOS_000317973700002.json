Let Delta(G) denote the maximum degree of a vertex in G. Two Brooks-type conjectures on equitable Delta(G)-colorability have been proposed in Chen and Yen (Discrete Math., 2011) and Kierstead and Kostochka (Combinatorica 30:201-216, 2010) independently. We prove the equivalence of these conjectures.", "paper_title": "Equivalence of two conjectures on equitable coloring of graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000317973700002"}
