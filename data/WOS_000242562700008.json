The server takes a (single and multiple) vacation as soon as the queue length falls below 'a' at the completion of service. The interarrival times of batches are assumed to be independent and geometrically distributed. The service times of the batches and vacation times of the server are generally distributed and their durations are integral multiples of slot duration. We obtain queue length distributions at service completion, vacation termination, arbitrary, and prearrival epochs. Finally, we discuss various performance measures and numerical results.
