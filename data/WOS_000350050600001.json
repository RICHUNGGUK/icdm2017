In this work, a detailed mathematical deflection model of a hot leveller with bending mechanism and its experimental validation are presented. The roll intermesh profiles are calculated based on the deflection of the work rolls that are elastically supported by support rolls, frames, posts and adjustment screws. The deflection model is suited to compensate the effect of deflection on the roll intermesh and the plate flatness as well as to assess the loads of critical parts, for example the support rolls. A new experimental design to measure the deflection of a leveller is presented and successfully applied for model validation. The work roll deflection is measured directly by means of displacement sensors that are inserted in cut-outs of test plates. These test plates are modelled as linear elastic stripes. For normal load levels, the relative accuracy (repeatability) of the roll intermesh prediction of the model is better than 0.08mm.", "paper_title": "Modelling and experimental validation of the deflection of a leveller for hot heavy plates", "paper_id": "WOS:000350050600001"}
