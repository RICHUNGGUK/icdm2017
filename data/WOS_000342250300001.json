In this paper, we present a robust system based on the concepts of Mutual Direction Symmetry (MDS), Mutual Magnitude Symmetry (MMS) and Gradient Vector Symmetry (GVS) properties to identify text pixel candidates regardless of any orientations including curves (e.g. circles, arc shaped) from natural scene images. The method works based on the fact that the text patterns in both Sobel and Canny edge maps of the input images exhibit a similar behavior. For each text pixel candidate, the method proposes to explore SIFT features to refine the text pixel candidates, which results in text representatives. Next an ellipse growing process is introduced based on a nearest neighbor criterion to extract the text components. The text is verified and restored based on text direction and spatial study of pixel distribution of components to filter out non-text components. The proposed method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets, namely, ICDAR2005 and ICDAR2011 for horizontal text evaluation, MSRA-TD500 for non-horizontal straight text evaluation and on our own dataset (CUTE80) that consists of 80 images for curved text evaluation to show its effectiveness and superiority over existing methods.
