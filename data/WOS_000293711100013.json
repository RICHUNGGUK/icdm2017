The algorithm combines moving-object detection with feature extraction in order to identify the specific target in the environment. The algorithm was tested in a mobile robotics experiment in which a robot, with the Eye-RIS mounted on it, pursued another one representing the moving target, demonstrating its performance and capabilities.", "paper_title": "Implementation of a Moving Target Tracking Algorithm Using Eye-RIS Vision System on a Mobile Robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000293711100013"}
