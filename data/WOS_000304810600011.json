Two second-order accurate methods are developed: one for accurately evaluating boundary integral solutions at a point, and another for computing Stokes solution values on a rectangular mesh. We first describe a method for computing singular or nearly singular integrals, such as a double layer potential due to sources on a curve in the plane, evaluated at a point on or near the curve. To improve accuracy of the numerical quadrature, we add corrections for the errors arising from discretization, which are found by asymptotic analysis. When used to solve the Stokes equations with sources on an open, immersed interface, the method generates second-order approximations, for both the pressure and the velocity, and preserves the jumps in the solutions and their derivatives across the boundary. We then combine the method with a mesh-based solver to yield a hybrid method for computing Stokes solutions at N-2 grid points on a rectangular grid. Numerical results are presented which exhibit second-order accuracy. To demonstrate the applicability of the method, we use the method to simulate fluid dynamics induced by the beating motion of a cilium. The method preserves the sharp jumps in the Stokes solution and their derivatives across the immersed boundary. Model results illustrate the distinct hydrodynamic effects generated by the effective stroke and by the recovery stroke of the ciliary beat cycle. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
