As we known, the true machining errors are deviations between designed surface and tool envelope surface. But it is impossible to determine the whole shape of the tool envelope surface before all tool positions are obtained. Hence, it is difficult to position the tool individually and consider true errors at the same time. Basic Curvature Equations of Locally Tool Positioning (BCELTP) are presented to solve this problem in some degree. By using them under some special conditions, given one tool position, the local shape (second order approximation) of the tool envelope surface can be calculated precisely at the corresponding cutter contact point. These equations make it convenient to adjust the tool position individually until true errors are reduced in some degree. So, they are useful for optimizing tool positions locally. Finally, some examples are given to verify the correctness and practicability of theory. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
