The optimization of the software testing process is a major challenge, and the generation of the independent test paths remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we present an approach based on metaheuristic firefly algorithm to generate optimal test paths. In order to optimize the test case paths, we use a modified firefly algorithm by defining appropriate objective function and introducing guidance matrix in traversing the graph. Our simulations and comparison show that the test paths generated are critical and optimal paths. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
