This paper proposes a novel prediction model where the optimal correlated prediction for a set of pixels is obtained in the sense of the least code length. It not only exploits the spatial statistical correlations for the optimal prediction directly based on 2D contexts, but also formulates the data-driven structural interdependencies to make the prediction error coherent with the underlying probability distribution for coding. Under the joint constraints for local coherence, max-margin Markov networks are incorporated to combine support vector machines structurally to make max-margin estimation for a correlated region. Specifically, it aims to produce multiple predictions in the blocks with the model parameters learned in such a way that the distinction between the actual pixel and all possible estimations is maximized. It is proved that, with the growth of sample size, the prediction error is asymptotically upper bounded by the training error under the decomposable loss function. Incorporated into the lossless image coding framework, the proposed model outperforms most prediction schemes reported.", "paper_title": "Large Discriminative Structured Set Prediction Modeling With Max-Margin Markov Network for Lossless Image Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000329581800005"}
