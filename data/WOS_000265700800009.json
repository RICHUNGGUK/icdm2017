We address two problems: (i) Path Maximum Query: Preprocess T so that, for a query pair of nodes u and v, the maximum weight on pi(u, v) can be found quickly. (ii) Path Maximum Sum Query: Preprocess T so that, for a query pair of nodes u and v, the maximum weight sum subpath of pi(u, v) can be found quickly. For the problems we present solutions with O(l) query time and O(n log n) preprocessing time.", "paper_title": "Path Maximum Query and Path Maximum Sum Query in a Tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000265700800009"}
