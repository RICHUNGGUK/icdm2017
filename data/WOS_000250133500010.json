These parameters are essential for rate theory computer codes that model nucleation and growth of voids, helium bubbles, dislocation loops, and the evolution of microstructures in materials subject to high dose irradiations. Compact formulae for these factors are derived and the accuracy of several approximations is explored.", "paper_title": "The dislocation bias", "paper_id": "WOS:000250133500010"}
