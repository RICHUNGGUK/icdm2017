For this purpose, the measured load-deformation response of ten (10) full-scale R/C beam specimens is utilised. These specimens were loaded monotonically in a four-point bending arrangement up to failure. Open hoop FRP strip shear reinforcement was applied externally to upgrade the shear capacity of eight (8) R/C beam specimens. Four of these specimens had these FRP strips without anchorage, whereas for the other four the FRP strips were attached together with novel anchoring devices. This successful numerical simulation predicts with a very good degree of approximation the observed load-deformation behaviour and the ultimate shear capacity of all these specimens as well as the observed modes of failure including diagonal concrete cracking, debonding of the FRP strips in the case of no anchoring, or the plastification of parts of the anchoring devices plus the adjacent crushing of the concrete.
