Conditions for the strong interference regime are characterized and the corresponding capacity region is derived, which is the same as that of the compound Poisson multiple-access channel with each receiver decoding both messages. For the cases when the strong interference conditions are not satisfied, inner and outer bounds on the capacity region are derived. The inner bound is derived via approximating the Poisson interference channel by a binary interference channel and then evaluating the corresponding Han-Kobayashi region. The outer bounds are obtained via various techniques, including noise reduction, genie-aided scheme, and channel transformation. The Poisson Z-interference channel is then studied. The sum rate capacity is obtained when the cross link coefficient is either sufficiently small or sufficiently large.", "paper_title": "On the Capacity Bounds for Poisson Interference Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000346980400017"}
