Details of the methodology are included along with subtleties associated with its integration into a massively parallel hybrid LB finite element (FE) suspension flow solver. A comparison of the computational performance of the coupled LB-SL method with that of the previously implemented LB-FE is given for an isolated RBC and for a dense suspension in Hagen-Poiseuille flow. Validating results for RBCs isolated in shear and parachuting in microvessel flow are also presented.
