Providing seamless communication in mobile networks means that the networks have to be able to provide not only fast but also lossless handoff. This paper presents a two-layer downlink queuing model and a scheduling mechanism for providing lossless handoff and QoS in mobile networks, which exploit IP as a transport technology for transferring datagrams between base stations and the high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) at the radio layer. In order to reduce handoff packet dropping rate at the radio layer and packet forwarding rate at the IP layer and provide high system performance, e. g., downlink throughput, scheduling algorithms are performed at both IP and radio layers, which exploit handoff priority scheduling principles and take into account buffer occupancy and channel conditions. Performance results obtained by computer simulation show that, by exploiting the downlink queuing model and scheduling algorithms, the system is able to provide low handoff packet dropping rate, low packet forwarding rate, and high downlink throughput.", "paper_title": "Downlink queuing model and packet scheduling for providing lossless handoff and QoS in 4G mobile networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235953800002"}
