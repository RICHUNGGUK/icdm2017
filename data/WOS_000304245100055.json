In this paper, we introduce a general constructive method for the sets of cross-bifix-free binary words of fixed length. It enables us to determine a cross-bifix-free words subset which has the property to be non-expandable.", "paper_title": "A New Approach to Cross-Bifix-Free Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000304245100055"}
