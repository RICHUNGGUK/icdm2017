However, highly parallel, general-purpose computing systems face serious challenges in terms of performance, energy, heat dissipation, space, and cost. We believe that there is significant opportunity to look beyond parallelization and focus on domain-specific customization to bring significant power-performance efficiency improvement.", "paper_title": "Customizable Domain-Specific Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000288224400002"}
