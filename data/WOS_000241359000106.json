The system is described and evaluated in the context of our participation in the CLEF 2005 GeoCLEF Monolingual English task. The GIR system is based on Lucene and uses a modified version of the Passage Retrieval module of the TALP Question Answering (QA) system presented at CLEF 2004 and TREC 2004 QA evaluation tasks. We designed a Keyword Selection algorithm based on a Linguistic and Geographical Analysis of the topics. A Geographical Thesaurus (GT) has been built using a set of publicly available Geographical Gazetteers and a Geographical Ontology. Our experiments show that the use of a Geographical Thesaurus for Geographical Indexing and Retrieval has improved the performance of our GIR system.", "paper_title": "The GeoTALP-IR system at GeoCLEF 2005: Experiments using a QA-based IR system, linguistic analysis, and a geographical thesaurus", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000106"}
