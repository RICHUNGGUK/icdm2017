By using the contracting mapping principle, method of iteration and inequality techniques, a sufficient condition is established to ensure the existence, uniqueness and finite-time stability of the equilibrium point of the proposed networks. Finally, based on the Predictor-Corrector Approach, two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the validity and feasibility of the obtained result. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
