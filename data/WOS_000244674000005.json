Two main building blocks of the pipelined ADC, sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit and multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC) are constructed of CCII instead of operational amplifier (OA). Experimental results show that the proposed CCII-based pipelined ADC can work at 12.5 MHz with a 7.3-bit resolution. The DNL is within -0.4 LSB and 0.4 LSB and INL is within -0.8 LSB and 0.8 LSB, respectively. The pipelined ADC is realized in TSMC 0.35 mu m CMOS technology and consumes 29 mW under a 3.3 V power supply. The core size is 0.85 x 0.85 mm(2).", "paper_title": "A new pipelined analog-to-digital converter using current conveyors", "paper_id": "WOS:000244674000005"}
