Both low cost and stand-alone solutions are particularly emphasized. The SoC, consisting of RISC core and decoder core, has advantages in terms of flexibility, testability and various I/O interfaces. For decoder core design, the proposed H.264/AVC coprocessor in the SoC employs a new block pipelining scheme instead of a conventional macroblock or a hybrid one, which greatly contribute to reducing drastically the size of the core and its pipelining buffer. In addition, the decoder schedule is optimized to block level which is easy to be programmed. Actually, the core size is reduced to 138 KGate with 3.5 kbyte memory. In our practical development, a single external SDRAM is sufficient for both reference frame buffer and display buffer. Various peripheral interfaces such as a compact flash, a digital broadcast receiver and a LCD driver are also provided on a chip.", "paper_title": "Low cost SoC design of H.264/AVC decoder for handheld video player", "paper_id": "WOS:000255647700035"}
