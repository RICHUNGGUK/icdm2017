Neutron and X-ray imaging provide complementary information for precisely identifying the three phases (silica sand, air, and water) of a compacted sand specimen that is partially saturated. Neutron tomography provides high contrast of the water phase, whereas X-ray tomography provides high contrast of the silica sand phase due to different fundamental interaction mechanisms of neutron and X-ray with matters. X-ray interacts with the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus, whereas neutron radiation interacts with the nucleus of an atom. In this paper, a computational technique was developed to unify digital images of dual-modal data obtained at different image resolution and specimen orientations based on the maximization of the normalized mutual information to combine the information from the water phase inferred from a neutron image and information from the sand and pore phases obtained from an X-ray image. The combined microstructure obtained from registered X-ray and neutron images can thus be analyzed in 3D to precisely differentiate silica, air, and water distribution spatially. Microstructure information for granular assembly including pore size distribution and coordination number was determined from X-ray tomography data due to higher precision in identifying solid particle boundaries. Local values of saturation along the height of the specimen are obtained from the pore and water phases segmented from the registered neutron and X-ray images. Image registration of neutron and X-ray images provides the ability to obtain the microstructure of partially saturated sand in terms of the detailed variation of solid particles, air, and water phases spatially.
