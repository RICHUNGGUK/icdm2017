In the presented IB method, a set of Lagrangian points represent the solid boundary and will exert force on the surrounding Eulerian points which are the cell centers within the finite-volume framework. This force is calculated by a special iterative procedure and has an effect on the flux at the interface of cell, which guarantees the fulfillment of the no-slip boundary condition and entirely avoids the flow penetration. The flow field is obtained from the BGK scheme with local grid refinement. Without complex mesh generation and transformation, the present technique can be conveniently applied to simulations with complex and moving solid boundaries. The second-order temporal accuracy and better than first-order spatial accuracy in L-2 norm are testified by the simulation of Stokes' first problem. Other three different test cases, including flows around a stationary circular cylinder, two circular cylinders in tandem and an oscillating circular cylinder, demonstrate the good capability of the present method.
