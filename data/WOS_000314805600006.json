Two key challenges faced by designers when testing these systems lie in the difficulty of monitoring the deployment environment for inappropriate outcomes and subsequently tracing the physical and digital causal factors leading to specific situations. This paper presents InSitu, a situation-based testing approach that applies generalised situation specifications to a global representation of simulated environment state to detect instances of specified situations. An access control case study demonstrates the modelling capabilities of InSitu and notes the importance of the overlap, exclusivity, and subsumption relationships between situation specifications in order to achieve informative results.
