Enjoying the ecological behaviour of colonising weeds, IWO has demonstrated its ability in solving different optimisation problems. Since making a proper balance between these two components is essential, especially to cope with constraint optimisation problems, two new rules are added to the algorithm to improve its performance. The first rule is utilising principles of social standard deviation as proposed in social harmony search (SHS) algorithm. The second rule is utilised to prevent the algorithm to get stuck on local optima. Finally, for constraint handling, three simple heuristic rules of Deb are utilised. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method are tested on many constrained benchmark problems and compared against those of state-of-the-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "Constrained optimisation and robust function optimisation with EIWO", "paper_id": "WOS:000320230800002"}
