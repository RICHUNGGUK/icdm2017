Given a set of offset data representing the ship hull, the system first creates a surface model of the ship. From the surface model, the wetted part of the ship is obtained by computing the intersection between the water surface and the hull, which is then processed to generate quadrilateral panels for the hull and the water surface. The system is designed to handle various kinds of ships such as ships with a mono-skeg, a twin-skeg and/or a bulbous bow in either an automatic or an interactive manner. Moreover, it can generate input panels for three different seakeeping analysis methods. Examples are provided to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
