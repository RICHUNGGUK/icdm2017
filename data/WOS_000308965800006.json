Two sufficient conditions for the robust exponential stability in the mean square of the given network are developed by using a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, an integral inequality, and some analysis techniques. The conditions, which are expressed by linear matrix inequalities, can be easily checked. Two simulation examples are given to demonstrate the reduced conservatism of the proposed conditions.", "paper_title": "Robust Exponential Stability of Uncertain Stochastic Neural Networks With Distributed Delays and Reaction-Diffusions", "paper_id": "WOS:000308965800006"}
