The S- and R-warfarin human serum albumin (HSA, site I) complexes were used as an interaction model. The process for a verified estimation includes the following: (i) ionized open chain forming at physiological pH (a recent focus); (ii) conformational search (molecular mechanics and Monte Carlo methods); (iii) rigid protein flexible ligand docking (GlideXP) generating low energy paired Sand R-poses; (iv) graphical comparison against the X-ray crystal structure (unsatisfactory verification step); (v) quantum polarized ligand docking (insufficient verification step); (vi) induced fit docking (one pose satisfying the verification criterion; selection step); (vii) converting docking scores to affinity and enantioselectivity estimates (log K-S = 5.43, log K-R = 5.34, ES = K-S/K-R = 1.23) and numerical comparison against equivalent literature data from bioanalytical techniques (validation step); (viii) intermolecular forces explaining ES (hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interactions).", "paper_title": "Experimental-Like Affinity Constants and Enantioselectivity Estimates from Flexible Docking", "paper_id": "WOS:000310043800026"}
