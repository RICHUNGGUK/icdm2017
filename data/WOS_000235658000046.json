While learning styles describe the influence of cognitive factors, learning orientations describe the influence of emotions and intentions. The system responds to students' needs according to their learning orientations. Such a system requires cooperation among several educational organizations, since it is quite difficult for a single organization to develop an item pool of questions tailored for individuals with different learning orientations. The cooperation needs serious consideration of security issues. We propose a model for sharing protected Web resources that secures privacy.", "paper_title": "Automated discovering of what is hindering the learning performance of a student", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000046"}
