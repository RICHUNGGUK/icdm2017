First, we extend the notion of full tilings which was recently introduced by Karhumaki, Lifshits, and Rytter to partial tilings. Second, we investigate the notion of quasiperiods and show in particular that the set of quasiperiodic words is a context-sensitive language that is not context-free, answering a conjecture by Domosi, Horvath and Ito.", "paper_title": "REMARKS ON TWO NONSTANDARD VERSIONS OF PERIODICITY IN WORDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000262289900011"}
