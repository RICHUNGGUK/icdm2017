We focus on the protein residue contact map. When this map is assigned, it is possible to reconstruct the 3D structure of the protein backbone. The general problem of recovering a set of 3D coordinates consistent with some given contact map is known as a unit-disk-graph realization problem, and it has been recently proven to be NP-hard. In this paper, we describe a heuristic method (COMAR) that is able to reconstruct with an unprecedented rate (3-15 seconds) a 3D model that exactly matches the target contact map of a protein. Working with a nonredundant set of 1,760 proteins, we find that the scoring efficiency of finding a 3D model very close to the protein native structure depends on the threshold value adopted to compute the protein residue contact map. Contact maps whose threshold values range from 10 to 18 Angstroms allow reconstructing 3D models that are very similar to the proteins' native structure.", "paper_title": "Reconstruction of 3D structures from protein contact maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000257981800005"}
