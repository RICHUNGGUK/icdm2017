The optimization is performed by simultaneous shape, material, and orientational design. The shape of the hole is designed, and the material design is the design of an orthotropic material that can be considered as a fiber-net within each finite element. This fiber-net is optimally oriented in the individual elements of the finite element discretization. The optimizations are performed using the finite element method for analysis, and the optimization approach is a two-step method. In the first step, we find the best design on the basis of a recursive optimization procedure based on optimality criteria. In the second step, mathematical programming and sensitivity analysis are applied to find the final optimized design.", "paper_title": "On simultaneous shape and orientational design for eigenfrequency optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000244689200009"}
