We explore the problem by studying the immobilization of a serial chain of polygons connected by rotational joints, or hinges, in a given placement with frictionless point contacts. We show that n + 2 such contacts along edge interiors or at concave vertices suffice to immobilize any serial chain of n not equal 3 polygons without parallel edges;, it remains open whether five contacts can immobilize three hinged polygons. At most n + 3 contacts suffice to immobilize a serial chain of n polygons when the polygons axe allowed to have parallel edges. We also study a robust version of immobility, comparable to the classical notion of form closure, which is insensitive to perturbations. The robustness is achieved at the cost of a small increase in the number of contacts: << 6/5 (n + 2)>> and << 5/4 (n + 2)>> frictionless point contacts suffice for a chain of n hinged polygons without and with parallel edges respectively.", "paper_title": "Immobilizing hinged polygons", "paper_id": "WOS:000250845000003"}
