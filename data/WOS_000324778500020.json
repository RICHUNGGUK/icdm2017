The quality of the sequencing data is crucial for all applications. A significant portion of the data produced contains errors, and ever more efficient error correction programs are needed. Results: We propose RACER (Rapid and Accurate Correction of Errors in Reads), a new software program for correcting errors in sequencing data. RACER has better error-correcting performance than existing programs, is faster and requires less memory. To support our claims, we performed extensive comparison with the existing leading programs on a variety of real datasets.", "paper_title": "RACER: Rapid and accurate correction of errors in reads", "paper_id": "WOS:000324778500020"}
