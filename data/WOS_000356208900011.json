The sustain driver with resonant operation, converting high dc voltage to ac square-wave voltage with high frequency for strong visible light emission, have great influence on the entire circuit efficiency and cost, from driving circuit point. Although circuit losses and costs of PDP drivers are of the utmost importance, comparative study of the sustain drivers has been missed in literature, despite numerous publications for PDP drivers. This paper, in detail, presents the theoretical analyses and systematic comparisons of the PDP drivers, in terms of switch current and voltage ratings. Based on analytical expressions and comparative features, the sustain drivers are evaluated from standpoint of switch ratings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
