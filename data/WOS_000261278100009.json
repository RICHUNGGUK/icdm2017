During the past three decades, paradigms for networked information, services, and collaboration its resources for community development have evolved in many respects. Ill this paper we revisit it theoretical analysis of broadband Internet community networks [Carroll, J.M., Rosson, M.B., 2003a. A trajectory for community networks. The Information Society 19(5), 381-393], and extend that analysis to mobile/wireless community networks. This analysis is part of the planning, for it specific municipal wireless project in the town of State College, Pennsylvania. But more broadly, it is intended to engage and to help focus human-computer interaction (HCI) design perspectives in the development of wireless community networks throughout North America and elsewhere.
