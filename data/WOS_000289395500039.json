By the decreasing time-dependent job processing times, we mean that the processing time is a decreasing function of its execution starting time. When some dominant relationships between m - 1 machines can be satisfied, we show that the makespan minimization problem can be solved in polynomial time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
