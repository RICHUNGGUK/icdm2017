This study compares S-index with Impact Factor (IF), which is the most well-known evaluation index, using the Korea Citation Index data. It is shown that S-index is positively correlated with the number of articles published in a journal. Tapered h-index (h(T)-index), which is based on all articles of a journal like S-index, is compared with S-index. It is shown that there is a very strong positive correlation between S-index and h(T)-index. Although S-index is similar to h(T-)index, S-index has a slightly better differentiating power and ranks the journal with evenly cited articles higher. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
