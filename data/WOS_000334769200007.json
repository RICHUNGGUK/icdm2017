These decisions involve: selection of field and pipeline development projects, scheduling of selected projects, production planning, and upstream transmission planning. The proposed model is formulated as a linear mixed- integer-programming model. It is implemented in a case study to demonstrate its usefulness and applicability in practice. Finally, a number of sensitivity analyses are carried out to analyze the impact of most influential uncertainties on the solutions and the corresponding results are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
