First, the definitions of feasible allocations and divisible goods auctions are given based on several important assumptions of divisible goods auction. Second, an optimal auction mechanism of divisible goods is designed, and a method of how to use the uniform price auction to implement the optimal auctions is discussed under the background of allocating the total permitted pollution discharge capacity (TPPDC). Lastly, this method is applied to the environmental planning of Wuhan City Circle in Hubei Province, China.", "paper_title": "MECHANISM DESIGN FOR OPTIMAL AUCTION OF DIVISIBLE GOODS", "paper_id": "WOS:000283740300008"}
