The online learning adaptive neural controller compensates the nonlinearities in the system and uncertainties in the modeling of the dynamics to provide the desired performance. The control strategy uses a neural controller aiding an existing conventional controller. The neural controller is based on a online learning dynamic radial basis function network, which uses a Lyapunov based online parameter update rule integrated with a neuron growth and pruning criteria. The online learning dynamic radial basis function network does not require a priori training and also it develops a compact network for implementation. The proposed adaptive law provides necessary global stability and better tracking performance. Simulation studies have been carried-out using a nonlinear (desktop) simulation model similar to that of a BO105 helicopter. The performances of the proposed adaptive controller clearly shows that it is very effective when the helicopter is performing highly nonlinear maneuvers. Finally, the robustness of the controller has been evaluated using the attitude quickness parameters (handling quality index) at different speed and flight conditions. The results indicate that the proposed online learning neural controller adapts faster and provides the necessary tracking performance for the helicopter executing highly nonlinear maneuvers.
