The approach consists of direct simulation of the undisturbed turbulent flow and an analytical representation of local small-scale disturbance flows induced by the particles. This hybrid DNS approach provides, for the first time, a quantitative research tool to study the combined effects of turbulence and hydrodynamic interactions on the motion and collisional interactions of small particles. Several numerical implementation issues are discussed, along with consistency and accuracy of the approach. Areas for further development of the approach are indicated. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
