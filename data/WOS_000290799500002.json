Additionally, a development methodology for industry solutions is applied, which, given the empirically founded typification process and the theoretically derived performance measurement systems, is characterized by a high degree of structure and transparency. The new approach thus systematically integrates both inductive-empirical and deductive-analytical elements.", "paper_title": "Reference Data Models for the Strategic Controlling of Waste Management Firms A New Methodology for Industry Solution Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000290799500002"}
