In general, WSNs perform clustering and routing using localized neighbor information only. Therefore, some studies have used self-organized systems and smart mechanisms as research methods. In this paper, we propose a self-organized and smart-adaptive clustering (SOSAC) and routing method, which performs clustering in WSNs, operates the formed clusters in a smart-adaptive way, and performs cluster-based routing. SOSAC is comprised of three mechanisms, which are used to change the fitness value over time, to back up routing information in preparation for any potential breakdown in WSNs, and to adapt to the changes of the number of sensor nodes for a WSN. We compared the performance of the proposed SOSAC with that of a well-known clustering and routing protocol for WSNs. Our computational experiments demonstrate that the network lifetime, energy consumption, and scalability of SOSAC are better than those of the compared method.", "paper_title": "A Self-Organized and Smart-Adaptive Clustering and Routing Approach for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000299532500001"}
