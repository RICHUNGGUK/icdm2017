In these, the core issues are supporting increased forwarding speed, avoiding state in the forwarding elements, and scaling in terms of the multicast tree size. This paper addresses all these challenges-which are crucial for any scalable multicast scheme to be successful-by revisiting the idea of in-packet Bloom filters and source routing. As opposed to the traditional in-packet Bloom filter concept, we build our Bloom filter by enclosing limited information about the structure of the tree. Analytical investigation is conducted and approximation formulas are provided for optimal-length Bloom filters, in which we got rid of typical Bloom filter illnesses such as false-positive forwarding. These filters can be used in several multicast implementations, which are demonstrated through a prototype. Thorough simulations are conducted to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed Bloom filters compared to its counterparts.", "paper_title": "Optimal False-Positive-Free Bloom Filter Design for Scalable Multicast Forwarding", "paper_id": "WOS:000367100900011"}
