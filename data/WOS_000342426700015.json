It is realized that automated controllers are profoundly nonlinear frameworks, and a faultless numerical model is hard to get, in this way making it troublesome to control utilizing tried and true procedure. Here, a design of an adaptive compliant gripper is presented. This design of the gripper has embedded sensors as part of its structure. The use of embedded sensors in a robot gripper gives the control system the ability to control input displacement of the gripper and to recognize specific shapes of the grasping objects. Since the conventional control strategy is a very challenging task, soft computing based controllers are considered as potential candidates for such an application. In this study, the polynomial and radial basis function (RBF) are applied as the kernel function of Support Vector Regression (SVR) to estimate and predict optimal inputs displacement of the gripper according to experimental tests and shapes of grasping objects. Instead of minimizing the observed training error, SVR (poly) and SVR (rbf) attempt to minimize the generalization error bound so as to achieve generalized performance. The experimental results show that an improvement in predictive accuracy and capability of generalization can be achieved by the SVR approach compared to other soft computing methodology.", "paper_title": "Support vector regression methodology for prediction of input displacement of adaptive compliant robotic gripper", "paper_id": "WOS:000342426700015"}
