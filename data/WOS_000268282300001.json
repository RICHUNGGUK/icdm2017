However, the past corresponding researches of media synchronization mainly focused on the mono-quality and single-layer (nonscalable) audiovisual data. To overcome challenges of ubiquitous multimedia streaming, a scalable audiovisual coder that can provide flexible scalabilities and adaptive streaming control to adapt to complicated network situations are both required. This paper proposes a multilayered audiovisual streaming scheme to deliver layered audiovisual data synchronously, which is called ML-AVSS. Fine-granular scalability (FGS) and bit-sliced arithmetic coding (BSAC) techniques are used to segment video and audio data into one base-layer and multiple enhancement-layer bitstreams. With advantages of audiovisual layer coding, a de-jitter procedure, a conditional retransmission mechanism and a playout synchronization mechanism are designed to transmit hybrid multilayered audiovisual bitstreams in consideration of the result of a network bandwidth adaptation and the distinct decoding time-complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed ML-AVSS is a feasible streaming scheme to overcome challenges of ubiquitous multimedia streaming, e. g., constrained channel bandwidth, quality degradation, unsmooth playout, etc.", "paper_title": "A Multilayered Audiovisual Streaming System Using the Network Bandwidth Adaptation and the Two-Phase Synchronization", "paper_id": "WOS:000268282300001"}
