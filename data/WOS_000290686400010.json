The hydrogen-bubble visualization results show that the boundary layer separation occurs upstream of the roughness, and the separated shear layer is incised by roughness to different extent, resulting in different kinds of secondary vortices formed immediately downstream of the roughness. During the evolution of the secondary vortex, two types of instabilities are observed, which are denoted as large-and small-scale instabilities, respectively, according to different spatial scale of the hairpin vortices formed afterward. A merging process of hairpin vortices is also observed when the secondary vortices undergo the small-scale instability, and a potential new transition control strategy based on the present observation is proposed.", "paper_title": "Effects of roughness elements on bypass transition induced by a circular cylinder wake", "paper_id": "WOS:000290686400010"}
