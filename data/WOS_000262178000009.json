Despite the requirements of International Convention on Standards of Training. Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW), held by International Maritime Organization (IMO), especially the quality and competency of personnel who are being employed on board ships arc primarily issue of shore-based ship management organizations. This paper proposes an extendable and applicable model based on Analytic Network Process to support the personnel selection facilities of crewing departments in ship management companies, The priorities of evaluation factors are outlined for employing the Master, the most significant and key personnel on board merchant ships, as a case application in this study. Consequently, the results are elaborated to construct a scheme on evaluating of job applications for embarking Master on board ships. The model can be achieved to modify for carrying Out to evaluate the employment criteria for other ranks on board ships as a further study. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
