The piecewise linear chaotic map (PWLCM) is utilized as transfer function, and the 4-dimensional and one-way coupled map lattices (4D OWCML) is employed as key generator of the chaotic neural network. Theoretical analysis and computer simulation indicate that the proposed algorithm presents several interesting features, such as high message and key sensitivity, good statistical properties, collision resistance and secure against meet-in-the-middle attacks, which can satisfy the performance requirements of Hash function.", "paper_title": "A novel Hash algorithm construction based on chaotic neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000286674800013"}
