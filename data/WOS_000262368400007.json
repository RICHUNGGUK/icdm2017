The P system framework is also used to formally specify this evolutionary algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on a well-known combinatorial optimization problem, the knapsack problem, to test the effectiveness of the approach. These experimental results show that this evolutionary algorithm performs better than quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms, for certain arrangements of the compartments of the P system structure utilized.", "paper_title": "A Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm Based on P systems for Knapsack Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000262368400007"}
