In contrast to the QNN published in the literature, the proposed model can perform both quantum learning and simulate the classical models. This is partly due to the neural model used elsewhere which has weights and nonlinear activations functions. Here a quantum weightless neural network model is proposed as a quantisation of the classical weightless neural networks (WNN). The theoretical and practical results on WNN can be inherited by these quantum weightless neural networks (qWNN). In the quantum learning algorithm proposed here patterns of the training set are presented concurrently in superposition. This superposition-based learning algorithm (SLA) has computational cost polynomial on the number of patterns in the training set. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
