To solve nonlinear equations of motion of two coupled sub-systems: multi-span cable and carriers idealized as physical pendulums, the special numerical method is developed, where initial vibrations of carriers (before entering a cable track) are used as a base for predicting further history of motion. Numerical analysis performed for different inclinations of a cable track led to the conclusion that nonlinear interaction effects are not significant and can be neglected to simplify the computational procedure in further research.
