In this paper, we propose a digital right protection mechanism to resolve both the publisher's copyright and customer's ownership protection issues related to digital music. We use 3-level discrete wavelet and audio cryptography technique to generate secret shares of customer and publisher. On verification, public shares will be extracted from digital music, and we can verify customer and publisher's digital rights by superimposing its secret shares and public shares. A D2RP model and protocol in practice are also proposed. To test the robustness of our proposed mechanism, six signal processing attacks are introduced. After experiment, our proposed mechanism can resist most of signal processing attacks; however, Mpeg compression can cause more damage than other attacks.", "paper_title": "A robust copyright and ownership protection mechanism for music", "paper_id": "WOS:000360377200004"}
