This increase in data traffic on cellular networks has caused an immediate need for offloading traffic for optimum performance of both voice and data services. As a result, different innovative solutions have emerged to manage data traffic. Some of the key technologies include Wi-Fi, femtocells, and IP flow mobility. The growth of data traffic is also creating challenges for the backhaul of cellular networks; therefore, solutions such as core network offloading and media optimization are also gaining popularity. This article aims to provide a survey of mobile data offloading technologies including insights from the business perspective as well.", "paper_title": "A SURVEY ON MOBILE DATA OFFLOADING: TECHNICAL AND BUSINESS PERSPECTIVES", "paper_id": "WOS:000318518300016"}
