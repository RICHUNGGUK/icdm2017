We demonstrate that our CWB filters can well exploit the fast trilinear texture-fetching capability of modern GPUs, and outperform the state-of-the-art box-spline filters not just in terms of efficiency, but in terms of visual quality and numerical accuracy as well. Furthermore, we rigorously show that the CWB filters are better tailored to the BCC lattice than the previously proposed quasi-interpolating BCC B-spline filters, because they form a Riesz basis; exactly reproduce the original signal at the lattice points; but still provide the same approximation order.", "paper_title": "Cosine-Weighted B-Spline Interpolation: A Fast and High-Quality Reconstruction Scheme for the Body-Centered Cubic Lattice", "paper_id": "WOS:000322027300003"}
