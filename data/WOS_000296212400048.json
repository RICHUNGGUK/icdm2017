By using the Leray-Schauder alternative theorem in multivalued analysis, matrix theory and generalized Lyapunov-like approach, we obtain some sufficient conditions ensuring the existence, uniqueness and global asymptotic stability of the periodic solution. Moreover, when all the variable coefficients and time delays are real constants, we discuss the global convergence in finite time of the neural network dynamical system. Our results extend previous works not only on discrete and distributed time-varying delayed neural networks with continuous or even Lipschitz continuous activations, but also on discrete and distributed time-varying delayed neural networks with discontinuous activations. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our main results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
