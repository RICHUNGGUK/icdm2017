We also show preliminary results on the generalization of the problem to biased sampling. In addition, we provide an extension of CAN that requires only O(1) space per node and achieves O(log n) lookup latency and message complexities.", "paper_title": "On sampling in higher-dimensional peer-to-peer systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000236886100059"}
