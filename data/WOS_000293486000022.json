The program is built on an earlier version of the golem95 library, which performs the reduction to a certain set of basis integrals using a formalism where inverse Gram determinants can be avoided. It can be used to calculate one-loop amplitudes with arbitrary masses in an algebraic approach as well as in the context of unitarity-inspired numerical reconstruction of the integrand.

Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEEO_v1_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 180 (2009) 2317 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Evaluation of one-loop multi-leg integrals occurring in the calculation of next-to-leading order corrections to scattering amplitudes in elementary particle physics. In the presence of massive particles in the loop, propagators going on-shell can cause singularities which should be regulated to allow for a successful evaluation. Solution method: Complex masses can be used in the loop integrals to stand for a width of an unstable particle, regulating the singularities by moving the poles away from the real axis. Reasons for new version: The previous version was restricted to massless particles in the loop. Summary of revisions: Real and complex masses are supported, a general mu parameter for the renormalization scale is introduced, improvements in the caching system and the user interface. Running time: Depends on the nature of the problem. A single call to a rank 6 six-point form factor at a randomly chosen kinematic point, using complex masses, takes 0.06 seconds on an Intel Core 2 Q9450 2.66 GHz processor.", "paper_title": "Golem95C: A library for one-loop integrals with complex masses", "paper_id": "WOS:000293486000022"}
