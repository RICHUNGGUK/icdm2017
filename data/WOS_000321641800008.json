To solve the secure communications problem between two heterogeneous systems, we propose two efficient signcryption schemes that can simultaneously achieve confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and nonrepudiation in a logical single step. The first scheme allows a sender in a public key infrastructure (PKI) to send a message to a receiver in an identity-based cryptosystem (IBC) and the second scheme allows a sender in the IBC system to send a message to a receiver in the PKI system. We prove that the first scheme has indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2) under the q-bilinear Diffie-Hellman inversion problem (q-BDHIP) and existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen messages attacks (EUF-CMA) under the Diffie-Hellman inversion problem in the random oracle model. We also prove that the second scheme has the IND-CCA2 property under the BDHIP and EUF-CMA property under the q-strong Diffie-Hellman problem (q-SDHP) in the random oracle model.", "paper_title": "Efficient Signcryption for Heterogeneous Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000321641800008"}
