It is characterized by the number of scatterplots (plots) of which it consists of. Unfortunately, this number quadratically grows with the number of the data sets dimensions. Thus, an SPLOM scales very poorly. Consequently, the usefulness of SPLOMs is restricted to a small number of dimensions. For this, several approaches already exist to explore such small SPLOMs. Those approaches address the scalability problem just indirectly and without solving it. Therefore, we introduce a new greedy approach to manage large SPLOMs with more than 100 dimensions. We establish a combined visualization and interaction scheme that produces intuitively interpretable SPLOMs by combining known quality measures, a pre-process reordering and a perception-based abstraction. With this scheme, the user can interactively find large amounts of relevant plots in large SPLOMs.", "paper_title": "Selecting Coherent and Relevant Plots in Large Scatterplot Matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000309070200008"}
