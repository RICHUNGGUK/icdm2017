The aim of this study was to employ the multifractality approach in cardiac surgery patients and evaluate the multifractality before and after beating-heart myocardial revascularization (off-pump CABG). Methods: Twenty-four hour Holter recordings were performed pre- and postoperatively in 60 patients undergoing off-pump CABG. Selected conventional time- and frequency-domain linear HRV indices were calculated from the 24 h and 5 min ECG segments, and preselected multifractal parameters tau(q=2), tau(q=3), h_top and Delta h were determined for daytime (12:00-18:00) and nighttime (00:00-06:00) periods of the ECG recordings using Ivanov's method. Mean differences over time were tested using paired-samples t-test and exact Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. The results are reported as mean +/- SD and median with interquartile range. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: All selected conventional linear HRV parameters decreased significantly after off pump CABG (p from <0.001-0.015). Preoperatively, multifractal parameter tau(q=2) was -0.60 +/- 0.12 and -0.54 +/- 0.12, tau(q=3) -0.52 +/- 0.18 and -0.49 +/- 0.17, h_top 0.20 +/- 0.07 and 0.15 +/- 0.07 and Delta h 0.31 +/- 0.14 and 0.17 +/- 0.14 for daytime and nighttime periods, respectively. Postoperatively, tau(q=2) and tau(q=3) were significantly higher for daytime (-0.49 +/- 0.15, p <0.001 and -0.43 +/- 0.23, p= 0.015), whereas h_top and Delta h were significanly higher for both daytime and nighttime (0.25 +/- 0.07, p <0.001 and 0.19 +/- 0.06, p=0.002 for h_top and 0.41 +/- 0.20, p= 0.003 and 0.31 +/- 0.19, p <0.001 for Delta h, respectively). All pre- and postoperative parameters, except tau(q=2) and tau(q=3) preoperatively, were significantly lower for nighttime as compared to daytime periods. Conclusions: A significant breakdown of multifractal complexity and anti-correlation behavior with a significant sympathetic overdrive and a concomitant parasympathetic withdrawal occurs after off-pump CABG. The circadian pattern of multifractality regains its day-night variation in the first week after the surgical procedure. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
