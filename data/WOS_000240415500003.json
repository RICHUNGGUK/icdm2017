We have investigated the effect of noise at 20 dB SNR and also mismatch resulting from incorrect correspondences between the object space points and the image space points, on the estimation of pose parameters. The maximum error in translation parameters is less than 0.45 cm and rotational error is less than 0.2 degree at 20 dB SNR. The error in parameter estimation is insignificant upto 7 pairs of mismatched points out of 24 points in object space and the results skyrockets when 8 or more pairs of points are mismatched. We have compared our result with that obtained by least square technique and it shows that GA based method outperform the gradient based technique when the number of vertices of the object to be inspected is small. These results have clearly established the robustness of GA in estimating the pose of an object with small number of vertices in automated visual inspection.", "paper_title": "Pose estimation in automated visual inspection using genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000240415500003"}
