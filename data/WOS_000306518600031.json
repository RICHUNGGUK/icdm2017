Previously, such results required a strong condition on the existence of a certain differential. We also show a similar result on Hermitian self-orthogonal algebraic geometry codes. As a consequence, we can apply our result to quantum codes and obtain some good quantum codes. In particular, we obtain a q-ary quantum [[q + 1, 1]]-MDS code for an even power q which is essential for quantum secret sharing.", "paper_title": "Euclidean and Hermitian Self-Orthogonal Algebraic Geometry Codes and Their Application to Quantum Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000306518600031"}
