Sensor nodes have constraints in operation which small size and distribution features so that they should be operated using low power. In this paper we propose a grid computing scheme to solve limited energy problems which can maintain the energy consumption as a same level though measuring remain energy with analyzing energy consumption of nodes. We confirm the improvement of survival time of entire nodes and less variation of topology in case of our proposed scheme through simulation.", "paper_title": "A grid routing scheme considering node lifetime in ubiquitous sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000104"}
