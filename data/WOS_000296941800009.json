Similar methods are also used in groundwater engineering. In this paper we present the new approach of decoupled overlapping grids for accurately computing time-dependent pressure at the oil well. Our method is implemented in two stages: a global stage with a simple point or line source well approximation, and a local post-process stage with the well modeled correctly as an internal boundary. We investigate the accuracy of our method for a representative 2D problem in both homogeneous and heterogeneous isotropic domains, and compare our results with the widely used Peaceman well index solution (in the homogeneous case), and the approximate solution on locally refined grids. We also present a theoretical analysis that explains the observed O(h(2)) behavior of the error in our method for the homogeneous case. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
