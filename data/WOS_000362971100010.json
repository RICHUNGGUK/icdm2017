We prove several infinite families of Wilf-equivalences for k-ary words involving vincular patterns containing a single dash, which explain the majority of the equivalences witnessed for such patterns of length four. When combined with previous results, numerical evidence, and some arguments in specific cases, we obtain the complete Wilf-classification for all vincular patterns of length four containing a single dash. In some cases, our proof shows further that the equivalence holds for multiset permutations since it is seen to respect the number of occurrences of each letter within a word. Some related enumerative results are provided for patterns tau of length four, among them generating function formulas for the number of members of [k](n) avoiding any tau of the form 11a-b.", "paper_title": "On avoidance of patterns of the form sigma-tau by words over a finite alphabet", "paper_id": "WOS:000362971100010"}
