The objective is to generate tool paths suited to high speed follow-up during machining in order to respect cutting conditions, while ensuring the geometrical conformity of the machined part. For this purpose, the optimization of the tool axis orientations is performed using a surface model for the tool path, which allows integrating kinematical limits of the machine tool as well as classical geometrical constraints. The illustration of the optimization through an example highlights the gain in machining time. thereby demonstrating the feasibility of such an approach. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
