It applies a systematic software engineering approach to patient/subject-specific meshing and assignment of material properties. The prototype program is based on the component object model (COM), which enables ease of combination of existing mesh generation algorithms and material property assignment schemes, and incorporation of new ones. It also facilitates utilization by other programming languages or platforms. Data input comprises a series of medical images captured from the patient. The output is a patient-specific finite element model for computational analysis using commercially available finite element software. The prototype software system provides a framework to compare the different finite element mesh generation methods as well as schemes for material property assignment. Our focus is on patient/subject-specific modeling of the human vertebrae. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
