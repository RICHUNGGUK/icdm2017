Aiming to extend the achievements of product configuration in manufacturing industry to service industry, an ontology-based product-service configuration approach is presented in this paper. Firstly, value attributes of product-service are defined based on the analysis of customer demands. And the demand cluster method is proposed to identify value demands of customers. Secondly, the modular system of product-service is established which is the basis of building product-service ontology. Thirdly, the product-service configuration method based on ontology modeling is put forward. Finally, the proposed approach to product-service configuration is demonstrated by an example of configuring service packages of civil aircraft materials. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
