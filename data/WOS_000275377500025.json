The proposed model attempts to minimize the total weighted tardiness and makespan simultaneously. In this problem, a proposed FMOLP method is applied with respect to the overall acceptable degree of the decision maker (DM) satisfaction. A number of numerical examples are solved to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The related results are compared with the Wang and Liang's approach. These computational results show that the proposed FMOLP model achieves lower objective functions and higher satisfaction degrees. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
