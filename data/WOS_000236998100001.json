To test the effectiveness of such labs, a web-based virtual laboratory on the topic of torsion of engineered and biological materials was developed, The lab contains extensive data sets, videos of experiments, narrated presentations on lab practice and theory and assignments. Flexibility of use is built into the lab by providing the capability for the web-pages to be tailored to the needs of a particular institution. The lab was implemented and evaluated in a standard, sophomore level statics, and strength of materials course. Results of the evaluation show that the virtual lab is clear, helped students with their understanding of torsion concepts, and offered a number of benefits. However students also rated hands-on labs to be more fun and more interesting.
