On the other hand, grids consist on the aggregation of distributed computational resources and presentation of these as a single service with a common interface. The deployment of distributed data warehouses on a grid architecture with QoS control strategies could lead to high levels of flexibility, scalability, reliability and efficiency. However, due to grids characteristics, it could also lead to great challenges. In this paper we investigate an efficient architecture to deploy large data warehouses in grids with high availability and good load balancing. We propose architecture and present experimental results.", "paper_title": "Data warehouses in grids with high QoS", "paper_id": "WOS:000241158200020"}
