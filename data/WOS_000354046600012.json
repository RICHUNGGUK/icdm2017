A comprehensive and structured survey of the scheduling algorithms proposed so far is presented here using a novel multidimensional classification framework. These dimensions are (i) meeting quality requirements, (ii) scheduling entities, and (iii) adapting to dynamic environments; each dimension has its own taxonomy. An empirical evaluation framework for these algorithms is recommended. This survey identifies various open issues and directions for future research.", "paper_title": "Classification Framework of MapReduce Scheduling Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000354046600012"}
