Fictitious crack model (FCM) for three-point bend test geometry for cracked concrete beam of laboratory size range 100-400 mm is developed and the different fracture parameters from size effect model, effective crack model, double-K fracture model and double-G fracture model are evaluated using the input data obtained from FCM. In addition, the fracture parameters of two parameter fracture model are obtained using the mathematical coefficients available in literature. From the study it is concluded that the fracture parameters obtained from various nonlinear fracture models including the double-K and double-G fracture models are influenced by the specimen size. These fracture parameters maintain some definite interrelationship depending upon the specimen size and relative size of initial notch length.", "paper_title": "Size-effect of fracture parameters for crack propagation in concrete: a comparative study", "paper_id": "WOS:000298825600001"}
