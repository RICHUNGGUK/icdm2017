In the cloud environment, users can access the resources and services without knowing the location of data, computing devices and platforms. With the popularity of cloud computing applications, authentication and security issues of cloud computing have become important research topics. Considering the benefits of implementing a service system in the cloud environment and the convenience of the integration of different ticket-sale systems, we propose a novel and secure diverse ticket-sale system (DTS) in hybrid cloud using smart cards. The accuracy of involved participant authentication is demonstrated according to the BAN logic. The DTS contains a ticket integration platform that the service providers can delegate the sale of their service tickets to the integrated server, and the customers can freely browse and purchase electronic service tickets from the system in any networked place. We also show that the DTS system possesses many good features and can effectively resist a number of potential attacks.", "paper_title": "A Secure Diverse Ticket-Sale System in a Distributed Cloud Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000343417100001"}
