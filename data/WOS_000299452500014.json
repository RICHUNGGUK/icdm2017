This paper presents a novel pixon-based algorithm for image segmentation. The key idea is to create a pixon model by combining fuzzy filtering as a kernel function and a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm for image segmentation. Use of fuzzy filters reduces noise and slightly smoothes the image. Use of the proposed pixon model prevented image over-segmentation and produced better experimental results than those obtained with other pixon-based algorithms.", "paper_title": "A Novel Pixon-Based Image Segmentation Process Using Fuzzy Filtering and Fuzzy C-mean Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000299452500014"}
