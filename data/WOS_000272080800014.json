Due to the manifold of enzymatic reactions the system has become highly complex. Assignment of enzymes to the enzyme classes requires a detailed knowledge of the system and manual analysis. Frequently rearrangements and deletions of enzymes and sub-subclasses are necessary. Results: We use the Dugundji-Ugi model for coding of biochemical reactions which is based on electron shift patterns occurring during reactions. Changes of the bonds or of non-bonded valence electrons are expressed by reaction matrices. Our program calculates reaction matrices automatically on the sole basis of substrate and product chemical structures based on a new strategy for maximal common substructure determination, which allows an accurate atom mapping of the substrate and product atoms. The system has been tested for a large set of enzymatic reactions including all sub-subclasses of the EC classification system. Altogether 147 different representative reaction operators were found in the classified enzymes, 121 of which are unique with respect to an EC sub-subclass. The other 26 comprise groups of enzymes with very similar reactions, being identical with respect to the bonds formed and broken. Conclusion: The analysis and comparison of enzymatic reactions according to their electron shift patterns is defining enzyme groups characterised by unique reaction cores. Our results demonstrate the applicability of the Dugundji-Ugi model as a reasonable pre-classification system allowing an objective and rational view on biochemical reactions.", "paper_title": "Automatic assignment of reaction operators to enzymatic reactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000272080800014"}
