The optimization problem addresses the questions of selecting number of workstations, number and type of paralleling identical machines as well as operation setups (OSs) for each workstation. The inputs include a precedence graph for a part, relationships between OSs and operations, machine options for each OS. The objective is to minimize the capital costs of the SPFL configurations. A 0-1 nonlinear programming (NLP) model is developed to handle the key issue of sharing machine utilization over consecutive OSs which is ignored in existing 0-1 integer linear programming (ILP) model. Then a GA-based approach is proposed to identify a set of economical solutions. To overcome the complexity of search space, a novel procedure is presented to guide GA to search within a refined solution space comprising the optimal configurations associated with feasible OS sequences. A case study shows that the best solution derived from the 0-1 NLP model through GA is better than the optimum of existing 0-1 ILP model. The results illustrate the effectiveness of our model and the efficiency of the GA-based approach.", "paper_title": "A GA-based approach for optimizing single-part flow-line configurations of RMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288222000014"}
