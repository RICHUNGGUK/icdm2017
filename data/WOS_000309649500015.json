In this paper we propose an agent-oriented decentralized and embedded architecture based on wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) for enabling efficient and effective management of buildings. The main objective of the proposed architecture is to fully support distributed and coordinated sensing and actuation operations. The building management architecture is implemented at the WSAN side through MAPS (Mobile Agent Platform for Sun SPOTs), an agent-based framework for programming WSN applications based on the Sun SPOT sensor platform, and at the base station side through an OSGi-based application. The proposed agent-oriented architecture is demonstrated in a simple yet effective operating scenario related to monitoring workstation usage in computer laboratories/offices. The high modularity of the proposed architecture allows for easy adaptation of higher-level application-specific agents that can therefore exploit the architecture to implement intelligent building management policies.", "paper_title": "Decentralized Management of Building Indoors through Embedded Software Agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000309649500015"}
