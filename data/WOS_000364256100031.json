Using the principle of reflection-free optimal thin film, the permittivity 8 and the permeability mu have been extended to the complex field. The electric conductivity sigma(e) and the equivalent magnetic loss sigma(m) relate to the complex value and are suitable for the impedance-matched condition (IMC). The propagation wave can be absorbed well at the circular boundary. Moreover, computational efficiency has been much enhanced when those useless square-corners have been eliminated by using the proposed method. In TMz wave, the sinusoidal wave is set near the circular boundary. Applying the CFT strategy, the E-z amplitudes and phases show the concentric circles in the different timesteps. Compared with the square PML, numerical experiments in near- and far-field have come to the fulfillment. At the same numerical example, the CFT strategy has higher accuracy than the conformal PML. These results have fully verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
