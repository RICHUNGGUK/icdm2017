This problem arises in Volumetric Intensity-Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for radiation cancer treatment, where the circular structure represents a delivery arc path of 360 degrees around the patient and the matrices represent the radiation fluence maps at selected delivery angles on that path. By computing the minimum k matrices, the CMM algorithm produces a most efficient delivery plan that meets clinical requirements. Based on dynamic programming and computing a set of k-link shortest paths, we present a polynomial time algorithm for the CMM problem, improving the quality and efficiency of VMAT delivery.
