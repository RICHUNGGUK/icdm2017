In this work, an improved algorithm called MC-JBIG2 is developed, which aims at improving compression ratio for Chinese textual images. In the proposed method, first multiple features are extracted from the characters in the images. After that, a cascade of clusters is introduced to accomplish the pattern-matching task for the characters. Finally, to optimize the parameters used in the cascade of clusters, a Monte Carlo strategy is implemented to traverse the feasible space. Experimental results show MC-JBIG2 outperforms existing representative JBIG2 algorithms and systems on Chinese textual images. MC-JBIG2 can also improve compression ratio on Latin textual images, however, the improvement on Latin textual images is not as stable as the improvement on Chinese ones.", "paper_title": "MC-JBIG2: an improved algorithm for Chinese textual image compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000284778100003"}
