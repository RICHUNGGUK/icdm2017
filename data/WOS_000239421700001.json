Traditional pattern matching has assumed the possibility of errors in the data content. We present motivation from text editing, computational biology, and computer architecture, that points to a new paradigm - where the errors occur in the address. It turns out that there are differences in techniques, complexities, and tools between the two different models, making it important to recognize their differences. We motivate and define the new model and present some problems that are worth pursuing.", "paper_title": "Asynchronous pattern matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000239421700001"}
