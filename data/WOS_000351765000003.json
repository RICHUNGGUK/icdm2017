However, by construction, tree structures are inherently prone to failure caused by variations. The robustness of a clock tree can be improved by inserting redundancy in the form of cross links or multilevel fusion trees. Such near-tree structures can provide robustness at low cost. In this paper, we establish that the locations of the inserted redundancy are crucial in providing cost-effective robustness. We present two methods to systematically insert redundancy. The redundancy is realized by either inserting cross links or performing local merges. Moreover, we present a vertex reduction method that reduces the amount of redundancy that needs to be inserted in our near-tree structures. Empirical results show that our structures are more robust to variations and have lower power consumption compared to the state-of-the-art clock networks. Furthermore, our near-tree structures provide smooth trade-offs between cost and robustness, reducing clock skews by 11%-39% at an expense of 3%-68% higher power consumption.", "paper_title": "Cost-Effective Robustness in Clock Networks Using Near-Tree Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000351765000003"}
