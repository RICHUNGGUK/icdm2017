However, this presupposition does not always hold. This paper analyses this presupposition and argues that it exerts a negative influence on the recall rate and precision to current matchmaking algorithms. A formal service model is then introduced, which extends the service profile of OWL-S. A new service matchmaking algorithm based on the model and semantics is proposed. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed one takes interface dependencies into consideration while performing matchmaking. This algorithm has been applied in a service composition framework called DartFlow. Our experimental data show that this novel service matchmaking outperforms others in terms of the recall rate and precision.", "paper_title": "Service matchmaking based on semantics and interface dependencies", "paper_id": "WOS:000239658700021"}
