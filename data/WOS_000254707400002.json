Our protocols represent a significant improvement over existing protocols using real hyperelliptic curves. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments indicate that they are comparable to the imaginary model in terms of efficiency, and hold much more promise for practical applications than previously believed.", "paper_title": "Cryptographic protocols on real hyperellelliptic curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000254707400002"}
