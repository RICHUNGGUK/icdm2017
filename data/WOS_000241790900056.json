It supposes a damage in the performance of the classifier. In this paper, an appropriate metric for imbalanced data is applied as a filtering technique in the context of Nearest Neighbor rule, to improve the classification accuracy in RBF and MLP neural networks. We diminish atypical or noisy patterns of the majority-class keeping all samples of the minority-class. Several experiments with these preprocessing techniques are performed in the context of RBF and MLP neural networks.", "paper_title": "Improving the classification accuracy of RBF and MLP neural networks trained with imbalanced samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900056"}
