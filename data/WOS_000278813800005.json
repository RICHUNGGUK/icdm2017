These models introduce two additional layers of difficulties with respect to the standard Gaussian additive noise scenario: 1) the noise is multiplied by (rather than added to) the original image; 2) the noise is not Gaussian, with Rayleigh and Gamma being commonly used densities. These two features of multiplicative noise models preclude the direct application of most state-of-the-art algorithms, which are designed for solving unconstrained optimization problems where the objective has two terms: a quadratic data term (log-likelihood), reflecting the additive and Gaussian nature of the noise, plus a convex (possibly nonsmooth) regularizer (e.g., a total variation or wavelet-based regularizer/prior). In this paper, we address these difficulties by: 1) converting the multiplicative model into an additive one by taking logarithms, as proposed by some other authors; 2) using variable splitting to obtain an equivalent constrained problem; and 3) dealing with this optimization problem using the augmented Lagrangian framework. A set of experiments shows that the proposed method, which we name MIDAL (multiplicative image denoising by augmented Lagrangian), yields state-of-the-art results both in terms of speed and denoising performance.", "paper_title": "Multiplicative Noise Removal Using Variable Splitting and Constrained Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000278813800005"}
