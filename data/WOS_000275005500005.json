The strict triangular norms to which this method is applicable have been called zero-reconstructible triangular norms. This paper shows that every continuous triangular norm can be approximated (with an arbitrary precision) by a zero-reconstructible, one, and thus substantiates the significance of this subclass of strict triangular norms.", "paper_title": "ZERO-RECONSTRUCTIBLE TRIANGULAR NORMS AS UNIVERSAL APPROXIMATORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000275005500005"}
