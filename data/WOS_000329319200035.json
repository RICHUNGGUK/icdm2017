In the process of writing, the author cites many types of publications such as journals, journal articles, reports, web sources and books. Collecting and analyzing these citations in selected academic books, leads to the creation of book citation indexes. Based on this concept and design, the Chinese book citation index (CBkCI) is produced. The value of the CBkCI lies not only in filling the domestic vacuum in book citation, but also in promoting the quality of academic book publishing, and in contributing to a better library collection development. More importantly it helps to lay a solid foundation in the area of academic evaluation.", "paper_title": "Development, significance and background information about the \"Chinese Book Citation Index\" (CBkCI) demonstration database", "paper_id": "WOS:000329319200035"}
