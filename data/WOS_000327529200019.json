To speed up the convergence and obtain the global solution of this problem, a hybrid optimality criterion (OC) and genetic algorithm (GA) method for truss optimization is presented in this paper. Firstly, the OC method is developed for multiple frequency constraints. Then, the most efficient variables are identified by sensitivity analysis and modified as iteration scheme. Finally, OC method, serving as a local search operator, is integrated with GA. The numerical results verify that the hybrid method provides powerful ability in searching for more optimal solution and reducing computational effort. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
