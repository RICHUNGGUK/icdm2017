Our results suggest that the method is an attractive alternative to current approaches to predict the agonist-induced or antagonist-blocked LBD responses. The ratio between the eigenvalues of the first and second eigenvectors (R-1,R-2) is also proposed as a numerical descriptor for discriminating the ligand behavior as a mGluR5 agonist or antagonist.
