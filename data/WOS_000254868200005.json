Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Principal Component Regression (PCR) models were built and used to predict pMICs. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were performed for training and training + prediction sets. Agent-receptor interaction descriptors were calculated for complexes with these or the most similar agents, as retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Good substrates of VmrA from Vibrio parahaemolyticus AQ3334 are nonlinear, rigid, and condensed hetero-aromatics, rather hydrophobic, involved in aromatic-aromatic, hydrophobic- hydrophobic, hydrophobic - hydrophilic, and hydrogen bond contacts with VmrA. Qualitative and quantitative structure-activity relationships [(Q)SARs] predicted well the resistance/ sensitivity of VmrA to 19 agents. This can have practical application in assays with V parahaemolyticus and other noncholera Vibrio spp. Agent-receptor interaction descriptors correlate with experimental and predicted pMICs, giving a new insight into possible VmrA-mediated agent efflux mechanisms.", "paper_title": "Comparative chemometric and QSAR/SAR study of structurally unrelated substrates of a MATE efflux pump VmrA from V. parahaemolyticus: Prediction of multidrug resistance", "paper_id": "WOS:000254868200005"}
