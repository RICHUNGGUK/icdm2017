We introduce a new progress measure that is often much smoother than the MIP gap. We propose a double exponential smoothing technique to predict the solution time of B&B algorithms and evaluate the prediction method using three MIP solvers. Our computational experiments show that accurate predictions of the solution time are possible, even in the early stages of B&B algorithms.", "paper_title": "Predicting the Solution Time of Branch-and-Bound Algorithms for Mixed-Integer Programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000293387500005"}
