However, current probabilistic methods for generating such mappings are ill-suited to certain types of evolutionary models, in particular, the widely used models of codon substitution. Results: We describe a general method, based on a uniformization technique, which can be utilized to generate realizations of a Markovian substitution process conditional on an alignment of character states and a given tree topology. The method is applicable under a wide range of evolutionary models, and to illustrate its usefulness in practice, we embed it within a data augmentation-based Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, for approximating posterior distributions under previously proposed codon substitution models. The sampler is found to be more efficient than the conventional pruning-based sampler with the decorrelation times between draws from the posterior reduced by a factor of 20 or more.", "paper_title": "Uniformization for sampling realizations of Markov processes: applications to Bayesian implementations of codon substitution models", "paper_id": "WOS:000251865000008"}
