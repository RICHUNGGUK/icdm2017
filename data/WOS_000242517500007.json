This allows to deal with perception-based information-in the sense of Zadeh-and with a rigorous treatment of the concept of likelihood, dealing also with its role in statistical inference. A coherent conditional probability is looked on as a general non-additive \"uncertainty\" measure m(.) = P(E\\.) of the conditioning events. This gives rise to a clear, precise and rigorous mathematical frame, which allows to define fuzzy subsets and to introduce in a very natural way the counterparts of the basic continuous T-norms and the corresponding dual T-conorms, bound to the former by coherence. Also the ensuing connections of this approach to possibility theory and to information measures are recalled. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
