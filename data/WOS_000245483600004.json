The results remove the usual assumption that the activation functions are of monotonous or differential character. Exponential converging velocity index is estimated, which depends on the delay kernel functions and system parameters. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the validity and feasibility of our results.", "paper_title": "New criteria on global exponential stability of BAM neural networks with distributed delays and reaction-diffusion terms", "paper_id": "WOS:000245483600004"}
