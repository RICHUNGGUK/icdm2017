The usage of standard Web-based technologies leads to easier, effective and more general applications suitable for small and medium size companies with limited resources in that field of research. Designers not only exchange just geometry data, but also more information about design knowledge and design solutions, and collaboration is performed on remote locations. In this work the framework is proposed to model a mechanical product focusing on behavioural criteria. In order to avoid time-consuming virtual model preparation, product variety is defined in single configuration file. The configuration file is covering all the variations, with formalisation of the assembly structure and linking the parts and attributes in uniform way. It enables visualisation of the models from different modelling systems and allows interactive changes and evaluation of the virtual prototype.", "paper_title": "Web-based environment for mechanism simulation integrated with CAD system", "paper_id": "WOS:000275953000005"}
