Many approaches have been proposed to solve this problem. In this study, we consider the visual attention problem blue with respect to two aspects: low-level prior learning and high-level prior learning. On the one hand, inspired by the concept of chance of happening, the low-level priors, i.e., Color Statistics-based Priors (CSP) and Spatial Correlation-based Priors (SCP), are learned to describe the color distribution and contrast distribution in natural images. On the other hand, the high-level priors, i.e., the relative relationships between objects, are learned to describe the conditional priority between different objects in the images. In particular, we first learn the low-level priors that are statistically based on a large set of natural images. Then, the high-level priors are learned to construct a conditional probability matrix blue that reflects the relative relationship between different objects. Subsequently, a saliency model is presented by integrating the low-level priors, the high-level priors and the Center Bias Prior (CBP), in which the weights that correspond to the low-level priors and the high-level priors are learned based on the eye tracking data set. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing techniques. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
