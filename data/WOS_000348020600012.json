The PRP is solved in an attempt to jointly optimize production, inventory, distribution and routing decisions and is thus a generalization of the inventory routing problem (IRP). Although the PRP has a complicated structure, there has been a growing interest in this problem during the past decade in both academia and industry. This article provides a comprehensive review of various solution techniques that have been proposed to solve the PRP. We attempt to provide an in-depth summary and discussion of different formulation schemes and of algorithmic and computational issues. Finally, we point out interesting research directions for further developments in production routing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
