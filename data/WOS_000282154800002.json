Firstly, a computational model of the ion diffusion coefficient, which is associated with ion species, pore solution concentration, concrete mix parameters including water-cement ratio and cement volume fraction, and microstructure parameters such as the porosity and tortuosity, is proposed in the saturated concrete. Secondly, the experiments, on which the chloride diffusion coefficient is measured by the rapid chloride penetration test, have been carried out to investigate the validity of the proposed model. The results indicate that the chloride diffusion coefficient obtained by the proposed model is in agreement with the experimental result. Finally, numerical simulation has been completed to investigate the effects of the porosity, tortuosity, water-cement ratio, cement volume fraction and ion concentration in the pore solution on the ion diffusion coefficients. The results show that the ion diffusion coefficient in concrete increases with the porosity, water-cement ratio and cement volume fraction, while we see a decrease with the increasing of tortuosity. Meanwhile, the ion concentration produces more obvious effects on the diffusivity itself, but has almost no effects on the other ions.", "paper_title": "Modeling of ion diffusion coefficient in saturated concrete", "paper_id": "WOS:000282154800002"}
