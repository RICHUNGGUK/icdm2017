We first extract visual keypoints from images and establish initial point correspondences between two images by comparing their descriptors. Our method is based on two types of graphs, named relational graphs and correspondence graphs. A relational graph of a point is constructed by thresholding geometric and topological distances between the point and its neighboring points. A threshold value of a geometric distance is determined according to the scale of each keypoint, and a topological distance is defined as the shortest path on a Delaunay triangulation built from keypoints. We also construct a correspondence graph whose nodes represent two pairs of matched points or correspondences and edges connect consistent correspondences. Two correspondences are consistent with each other if they meet the local consistency induced by their relational graphs. The consistent neighborhoods should represent an object or a part of an object contained in a pair of images. The enumeration of maximal cliques of a correspondence graph results in groups of keypoint pairs which therefore involve common objects or parts of objects. We apply our method to common visual pattern detection, object detection, and object recognition. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our method is comparable to or better than other methods.", "paper_title": "Visual Correspondence Grouping via Local Consistent Neighborhood", "paper_id": "WOS:000320013600011"}
