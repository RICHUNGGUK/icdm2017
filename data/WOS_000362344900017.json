The most attractive of the characteristics of ReRAM is its cross-point structure, which features a 4 F-2 cell size. In a cross-point structure, the existence of sneak current and resulting voltage loss due to the wire's resistance might cause read and write failures if not designed properly. In addition, a robust ReRAM design needs to deal with both soft and hard errors. In this article, we summarize mechanisms of both soft and hard errors of ReRAM cells and propose a unified model to characterize different failure behaviors. We quantitatively analyze the impact of cell failure types on the reliability of the cross-point array. We also propose an error-resilient architecture, which avoids unnecessary writes in the hard error detection unit. Assuming constant soft error rate, our approach can extend the lifetime of ReRAM up to 75% over a design without hard error detection and up to 12% over the design with a \"write-verify\" detection mechanism. Our approach yields greater significant lifetime improvement when considering postcycling retention degradation.", "paper_title": "Impact of Cell Failure on Reliable Cross-Point Resistive Memory Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000362344900017"}
