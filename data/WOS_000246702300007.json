To this end, we reformulate the above pair of conic systems as a primal-dual pair of conic programs. Each of the conic programs corresponds to a natural relaxation of each of the two conic systems. When C is a self-scaled cone with a known self-scaled barrier, the conic programming reformulation can be solved via an interior-point algorithm. For a well-posed instance A, a strict solution to one of the two original conic systems can be obtained in O(root nu(C) log(nu(C) C(A)) interior-point iterations. Here nu(C) is the complexity parameter of the self-scaled barrier of C and C(A) is Renegar's condition number of A. A central feature of our approach is the conditioning of the system of equations that arise at each interior-point iteration. The condition number of such system of equations grows in a controlled manner and remains bounded by a constant factor of C(A)(2) throughout the entire algorithm. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
