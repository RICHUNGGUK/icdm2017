However, most studies in this area have focused on scheduling algorithm design and have not addressed implementation challenges in larger realistic networking environments, particularly multidomain. As a result, this paper develops a detailed solution for distributed AR in multidomain networks. Novel link-state routing extensions and update triggering policies are introduced to exchange inter-domain bandwidth-timeline state information. Distributed path scheduling algorithms are then designed to leverage this state and schedule user requests across domains based upon various traffic engineering policies. The proposed solutions are then analyzed in detail using network simulation.", "paper_title": "Advance Reservation in Distributed Multidomain Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356714100013"}
