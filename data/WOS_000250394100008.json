We present a different and simpler proof than the one given by Prei beta and Stoer [Prei beta, M. and Stoer, J., 2004, Analysis of infeasible-interior-point paths arising with semidefinite linear complementarity problems. Mathematical Programming 99, 499-520.] that a weighted central path as a function of. can be extended analytically beyond 0. In addition, the characterization of the limit points of the path and its normalized first-order derivatives is also provided. We also derive an error bound on the distance between a point lying in a certain neighborhood of the central path and the set of primal-dual optimal solutions. Finally, we make some observation for the superlinear convergence of some primal - dual interior point SDP algorithms using AHO neighborhood.", "paper_title": "Limiting behavior of the Alizadeh-Haeberly-Overton weighted paths in semidefinite programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000250394100008"}
