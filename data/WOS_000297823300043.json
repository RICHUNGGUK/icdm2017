The faults of HGU involve overlapping fault patterns which may denote a kind of faults in the early stage or a subset of samples that caused by multi-fault. But until now it has not been considered in the traditional classifier of fault diagnosis for HGU. In this paper, a novel classifier combined rough sets and support vector machine is proposed and applied in the fault diagnosis for HGU. Instead of classifying the patterns directly, the fault patterns lying in the overlapped region are extracted firstly. Then, upper and lower approximations of each class are defined on the basis of rough set technique. Next, for the fault patterns lying in the overlapped region, the reliability they belong to a certain class is calculated. At last, the proposed method is successfully applied in analyzing an international standard data set, as well as diagnosing the vibrant faults of a HGU. The results show that the proposed classifier can more properly describe the complex map between the faults and their symptoms, and is suitable to fault diagnosis for HGU. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
