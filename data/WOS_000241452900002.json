The problems relating to time delays are solved by incorporating the Smith-predictor scheme in a control-law derivation. A nonlinear-mapping approximation, employing either continuous piece-wise linear functions or a fuzzy system, is also an integral part of the control scheme, and thus removes the need for output-function invertibility. An illustrative experiment is conducted to compare the control quality in both approaches when tackling a time-delayed Wiener-type system control.", "paper_title": "A comparison of fuzzy and CPWL approximations in the continuous-time nonlinear model-predictive control of time-delayed Wiener-type systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241452900002"}
