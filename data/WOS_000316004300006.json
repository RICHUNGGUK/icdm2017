Once a memory has learned, patterns can be recalled in two directions. BAMs have many applications in pattern recognition and image processing. The aim of this survey is to present several models of BAM throughout time, since Kosko [1988] proposed the first model; followed by those works based on or inspired by it, trying to improve recall capacity; to some recent one-shot models-such as Morphological BAM and Alpha-Beta BAM-which are of particular interest, given their superior performance.", "paper_title": "Bidirectional Associative Memories: Different Approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000316004300006"}
