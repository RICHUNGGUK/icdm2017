It is not assumed that the agents' clocks are synchronized. Nor is it assumed that the time sequence over which each agent update its state information is evenly spaced. By using tools from graph theory and nonnegative matrix theory, particularly the product properties of row-stochastic matrices from an infinite set, we finally show that essentially the same result as that for the synchronous discrete-time system holds in the face of asynchronous setting. This generalizes the existing result to a very general case.", "paper_title": "Stationary Consensus of Asynchronous Discrete-Time Second-Order Multi-Agent Systems Under Switching Topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000310388400026"}
