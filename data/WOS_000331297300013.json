The considered systems possess the unstructured uncertainties, unknown dead zone, and the dynamics uncertainties, and they do not assume the states being available for the controller design. In the controller design, fuzzy logic systems are first used to approximate the unstructured uncertainties, and by utilizing the information of the bounds of the dead-zone slopes and treating the time-varying inputs coefficients as a system uncertainty, a fuzzy state observer is designed to estimate the unmeasured states. By combining a back-stepping technique with a nonlinear small-gain approach, a new adaptive fuzzy robust output feedback control has been developed. It is proved that the proposed fuzzy adaptive control approach can guarantee the semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness for all the solutions of the closed-loop systems. Simulation studies and comparisons with previous methods are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Fuzzy Robust Output Feedback Control of Nonlinear Systems With Unknown Dead Zones Based on a Small-Gain Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000331297300013"}
