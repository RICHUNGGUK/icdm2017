In Tanaka's scheme, the computational complexity to generate each user's secret information is much smaller than that of Maurer-Yacobi's scheme. Tanaka's original key sharing scheme does not provide completeness, and so Tanaka has corrected the original scheme to provide completeness. In this paper, we show that Tanaka's corrected key sharing scheme is not secure against collusion attacks. That is two users can collaborate to factorize a system modulus with their secret information and thus break the key sharing scheme.", "paper_title": "Collusion Attacks to Tanaka's Corrected ID-Based Non-interactive Key Sharing Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000265630900031"}
