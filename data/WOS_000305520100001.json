In this paper, we explicitly determine the factorization of the composite polynomial for the case a = 1 and and for the case a not equal 0, 1. A recursive construction of irreducible polynomials basing on this composition and a construction with the form are also presented. Moreover, Cohen's method of composing irreducible polynomials and linear fractions are considered, and we show a large number of irreducible polynomials can be obtained from a given irreducible polynomial of degree n provided that gcd(n, q (3) - q) = 1.", "paper_title": "On the reducibility of some composite polynomials over finite fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000305520100001"}
