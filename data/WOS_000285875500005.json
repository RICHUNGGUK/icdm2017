Since a major goal of SystemC is to enable verification at higher levels of abstraction, the tendency is now directing to introducing formal verification approaches for SystemC. In this article, we propose an approach for formal verification of SystemC designs, and provide the semantics of SystemC using Labeled Transition Systems (LTS) for this purpose. An actor-based language, Rebeca, is used as an intermediate language. SystemC designs are mapped to Rebeca models and then Rebeca verification toolset is used to verify LTL and CTL properties. To tackle the state-space explosion, Rebeca model checkers offer some reduction policies that make them appropriate for SystemC verification. The approach also benefits from the modular verification and program slicing techniques applied on Rebeca models. To show the applicability of our approach, we verified a single-cycle MIPS design and two hardware/software co-designs. The results show that our approach can effectively be used both in hardware and hardware/software co-verification.", "paper_title": "Sysfier: Actor-Based Formal Verification of SystemC", "paper_id": "WOS:000285875500005"}
