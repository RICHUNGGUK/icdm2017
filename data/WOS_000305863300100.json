The mobile intelligent synthetic character is an example of one of these desired services. It is hard to apply an intelligent synthetic character to the smartphone environment because of its dynamism and complexity. This paper proposes a method for generating behaviors of a smart synthetic character that infers user contexts with Bayesian networks. In order to generate more realistic behaviors, the OCC model is utilized to create the character's emotion. Behaviors are produced through large-scale modular behavior networks with inferred contexts. A working progress is the mobile log collected with a Samsung SPH-M4650 smartphone that is used to verify the naturalness and flexibility of the generated behaviors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
