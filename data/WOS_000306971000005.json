An equation which shows some degree of self-similarity is obtained. It is shown that rule 54 exhibits Bernoulli shift and is topologically mixing on its closed invariant subsystem. Finally, many complex Bernoulli shifts are explored for the finite symbolic sequences with periodic boundary conditions.", "paper_title": "COMPLEX DYNAMICS OF THE ELEMENTARY CELLULAR AUTOMATON RULE 54", "paper_id": "WOS:000306971000005"}
