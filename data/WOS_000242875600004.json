However, recent work employs double threshold nonlinear models to capture both mean and volatility asymmetry. A Bayesian model comparison procedure is proposed to compare the GJR-GARCH with various double threshold GARCH specifications, by designing a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. A simulation experiment illustrates good performance in estimation and model selection over reasonable sample sizes. In a study of seven markets strong evidence is found that the DTGARCH, with US market news as threshold variable, outperforms the GJR-GARCH and traditional self-exciting DTGARCH models. This result was consistent across six markets, excluding Canada. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
