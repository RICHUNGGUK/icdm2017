The analogous conditions are known to be insufficient to characterise generic global rigidity in higher dimensions. Recently Laman-type characterisations of rigidity have been obtained for generic frameworks in R-3 when the vertices are constrained to lie on various surfaces, such as the cylinder and the cone. In this paper we obtain analogues of Hendrickson's necessary conditions for the global rigidity of generic frameworks on the cylinder, cone and ellipsoid.", "paper_title": "Necessary Conditions for the Generic Global Rigidity of Frameworks on Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000341913500007"}
