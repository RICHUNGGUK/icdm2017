The proposed control scheme incorporates a neural controller and a sliding mode controller. The neural controller is constructed based on the approximation capability of the single-hidden layer feedforward network (SLFN). The sliding mode controller is built to compensate for the modeling error of SLFN and system uncertainties. In the designed neural controller, its hidden node parameters are modified using the recently proposed neural algorithm named extreme learning machine (ELM), where they are assigned random values. However, different from the original ELM algorithm, the output weight is updated based on the Lyapunov synthesis approach to guarantee the stability of the overall control system. The proposed adaptive neural controller is finally applied to control the inverted pendulum system with two different reference trajectories. The simulation results demonstrate good tracking performance of the proposed control scheme.", "paper_title": "Direct adaptive neural control of nonlinear systems with extreme learning machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000314844300017"}
