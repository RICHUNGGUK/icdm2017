These methods thus allow customizing the precision of a multilevel DWT to a given error tolerance requirement and ensuring an energy-minimal implementation, which increases the applicability of DWT-based algorithms such as JPEG 2000 to energy-constrained platforms and environments. Additionally, quantization of DWT coefficients to a specific target step size is performed as an inherent part of the DWT computation, thereby eliminating the need to have a separate downstream quantization step in applications such as JPEG 2000. Experimental measurements of design performance in terms of area, speed, and power for 90-nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor implementation are presented. Results indicate that while BP designs exhibit inherent speed advantages, DS designs require significantly fewer hardware resources with increasing precision and DWT level. A four-level DWT with medium precision, for example, while the BP design is four times faster than the digital-serial design, occupies twice the area. In addition to the BP and DS designs, a novel flexible DWT processor is presented, which supports run-time configurable DWT parameters.", "paper_title": "Precision-Aware Self-Quantizing Hardware Architectures for the Discrete Wavelet Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000300559700029"}
