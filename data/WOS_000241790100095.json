It is developed to achieve a better performance for complex distribution problems even when the two parameters of SVM are not appropriately selected. One problem remained is that the trained internal nodes may be high complex for those high-dimensional feature space problems due to undesirable complexity added to the underlying probability distribution of the concept label for learning algorithm to capture -thus, learning models with high complexity are likely to depress the test efficiency and performance. In this paper, we proposed a feature selection based CSVMT (FS-SCVMT) learning approach in which the input space for each internal node is adaptively dimensionality reduced by sensitivity based feature selection. Experimental results showed that FS-SCVMT approach performed well.", "paper_title": "Support vector machine tree based on feature selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100095"}
