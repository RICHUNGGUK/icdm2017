We aim at maximizing the sum rate of the system by jointly optimizing subcarrier pairing, subcarrier pair-user assignment, and power allocation in such a single DF relay system. When the relay does not perform any transmission on some subcarriers in the second phase, we further allow the source to transmit new symbols on these inactive subcarriers. We effectively solve the formulated mixed integer programming problem by using continuous relaxation and dual minimization methods. Numerical results verify the theoretical analysis, and illustrate the remarkable gains resulted from the extra direct-link transmissions.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Resource Allocation for Improved DF Aided Downlink Multi-User OFDM Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696400002"}
