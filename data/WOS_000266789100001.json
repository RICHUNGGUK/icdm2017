The SSNFS model is based on a generic definition of incremental perceptron and a new learning algorithm that is capable of both structural (rule) learning and parametric learning. It constructs the fuzzy system by detecting a suitable number of rule patches and their positions and shapes in the input space. Initially the rule base consists of one single fuzzy rule; during the iterative learning process the rule base expands according to a supervised spawning validity measure. The rule induction process terminates when a given stop criterion is satisfied. SSNFS is very general since it does not require the prior knowledge about the input space and can be used in any application based on the scatter-partitioning fuzzy system. To demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our algorithm, we present a synthetic example and real-world modelling problems.", "paper_title": "Self-spawning neuro-fuzzy system for rule extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000266789100001"}
