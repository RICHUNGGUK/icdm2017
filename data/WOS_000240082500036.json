Our algorithm is based on the detection of strong backdoor sets of bounded size; each instantiation of the variables of a strong backdoor set puts the given formula into a class of formulas for which models can be counted in polynomial time. For the backdoor set detection we utilize an efficient vertex cover algorithm applied to a certain \"obstruction graph\" that we associate with the given formula. This approach gives rise to a new hardness index for formulas, the clustering-width. Our algorithm runs in uniform polynomial time on formulas with bounded clustering-width. It is known that the number of models of formulas with bounded clique-width, bounded treewidth, or bounded branchwidth can be computed in polynomial time; these graph parameters are applied to formulas via certain (hyper)graphs associated with formulas. We show that clustering-width and the other parameters mentioned are incomparable: there are formulas with bounded clustering-width and arbitrarily large clique-width, treewidth, and branchwidth. Conversely, there are formulas with arbitrarily large clustering-width and bounded clique-width, treewidth, and branchwidth.", "paper_title": "Solving #SAT using vertex covers", "paper_id": "WOS:000240082500036"}
