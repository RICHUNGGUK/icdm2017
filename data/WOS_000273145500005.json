The random variables are first assumed to follow the normal distribution. Comparison between analysis using negatively correlated and uncorrelated friction angle and cohesion indicates that the results of reliability analysis are conservative if negative correlation among strength parameters is not modeled. The reliability analysis involving correlated non-normal distributions is also investigated. The probability density functions are obtained from reliability indices and compared to those generated from Monte Carlo simulations. Reliability-based design of tunnel support pressure is also illustrated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
