The vision system assembled performed the image acquisition, processing and recognition by first creating a database with a single view of each \"client\" and then by using multiple test images of each individual candidate to access. To get the test images, a video sequence was captured during the individual's approach path to the camera. Because subjects presented themselves in a random pose before the camera, the synthesis of frontal views was incorporated, by using a view-morphing method. ne modelling and the recognition were handled through the use of ICA methods. The identification of valid \"clients\" was fully successful. In order to check the rejection of \"impostors\", a leave-one-out test was performed which gave promising results.", "paper_title": "Face recognition from spatially-morphed video sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600033"}
