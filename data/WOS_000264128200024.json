Therefore, we can decrease briefly a DNA sequence into a plot set in two-dimensional space. The proposed method is tested on the coding sequences of the first exon of beta-globin gene belonging to eleven species. The utility of our approach can be illustrated by the examination of similarities/dissimilarities among the coding sequences.", "paper_title": "A New Method to Analyze the Similarity Based on Dual Nucleotides of the DNA Sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000264128200024"}
