We establish a constant upper bound for the time needed to construct all graphs resulting from an application of a fixed rule to an input graph. We also give an improved upper bound under the stronger condition that all edges outgoing from a node must have distinct labels. Then this result is applied to identify a class of graph reduction systems that define graph languages with a linear membership test. In a case study we prove that the (non-context-free) language of balanced binary trees with backpointers belongs to this class.", "paper_title": "Graph transformation in constant time", "paper_id": "WOS:000241436800026"}
