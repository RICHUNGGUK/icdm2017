A new wavelet support vector machine (WN v-SVM) is proposed based on wavelet theory and modified support vector machine. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is designed to select the best parameters of WN v-SVM model in the scope of constraint permission. The results of application in car sale series forecasting show that the forecasting approach based on the PSOWN v-SVM model is effective and feasible, the comparison between the method proposed in this paper and other ones is also given which proves this method is better than PSOW v-SVM and other traditional methods.
