In this paper we propose an approach to model and analyze the architecture of TMSs. A TMS is networked of a number of components and thus is a typical component-based system. Based on the methodology of model-driven development, we design platform-independent component model: the components are extended with real-time properties; the time critical interaction mechanism of components is modeled by timed automata; the functional behavior of the system is modeled with refinement calculus of object systems method. Our approach has the following benefits: (1) with this approach, we can describe the distributed and real-time dynamic process system in multiple views, (2) we can use service architecture to model the distributed structure and (3) we can use interface automata to directly model the time critical interaction mechanism of a system.", "paper_title": "Modeling and analysis of interactive telemedicine systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000357527900005"}
