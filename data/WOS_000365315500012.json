In this paper, a biased discriminant analysis with feature line embedding (FLE-BDA) is proposed for performance enhancement in relevance feedback schemes. Maximizing the margin between relevant and irrelevant samples at local neighborhoods was the aim in this study. In reduced subspace, relevant images and query images can be quite close, while irrelevant samples are far away from relevant samples. The results of four benchmark datasets are given to show the performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Biased Discriminant Analysis With Feature Line Embedding for Relevance Feedback-Based Image Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000365315500012"}
