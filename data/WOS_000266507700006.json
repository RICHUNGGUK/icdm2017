EPR pairs, generalized Bell states, qubit GHZ states, standard W states and its variations, genuine multiqubit entanglement states, etc., have been developed. Recently, three-qutrit quantum states and two-qudit quantum states have also been considered as quantum channels for teleportation. In this paper, we investigate the teleportation of an unknown qudit using a d level GHZ state, i.e. a three-qudit maximally entangled state, as quantum channel. We design a general scheme of faithful teleportation of an unknown qudit using a d-level GHZ state shared between the sender and the receiver, or among the sender, the receiver and the controller; an unknown two-qudit of Schmidt form using a d level GHZ state shared between the sender and the receiver; as well as an unknown arbitrary two-qudit using two shared d level GHZ states between the sender, the receiver and the controller, or using one shared d level GHZ state and one shared generalized Bell state. We obtain the general formulas of Alice's measurement basis, Charlie's measurement basis and Bob's unitary operations to recover the input state of Alice. It is intuitionistic to generalize the protocols of teleporting an arbitrary two-qudit state to teleporting an arbitrary n-qudit state.", "paper_title": "PERFECT TELEPORTATION OF UNKNOWN QUDIT BY A d-LEVEL GHZ CHANNEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000266507700006"}
