Our method does not require information about the cameras intrinsic parameters. For obtaining a geometrical relation among the cameras, we use projective grid space (PGS) which is 3D space defined by epipolar geometry between two basis cameras. The other cameras are registered to the same 3D space by trifocal tensors between these basis cameras. We simultaneously reconstruct and render novel view using our proposed plane-sweep algorithm in PGS. To achieve real-time performance, we implemented the proposed algorithm in graphics processing unit (CPU). We succeed to create novel view images in real-time from uncalibrated cameras and the results show the efficiency of our proposed method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
