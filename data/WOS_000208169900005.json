We develop algorithms that, given any user-supplied arbitrary likelihood function, conduct a likelihood ratio hypothesis test (LRT) over each rectangular region in the grid, rank all of the rectangles based on the computed LRT statistics, and return the top few most interesting rectangles. To speed this process, we develop methods to prune rectangles without computing their associated LRT statistics.", "paper_title": "A Model-Agnostic Framework for Fast Spatial Anomaly Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000208169900005"}
