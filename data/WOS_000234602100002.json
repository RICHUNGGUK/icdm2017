If the input function f is a histogram with O(n) steps or a piecewise linear function with O(n) linear pieces, we design algorithms for computing phi in linear time. We also give an algorithm to approximate f with a function consisting of the minimum number of unimodal pieces under the condition that each unimodal piece is within a fixed L-2-distance from the corresponding portion of f.", "paper_title": "Linear time algorithm for approximating a curve by a single-peaked curve", "paper_id": "WOS:000234602100002"}
