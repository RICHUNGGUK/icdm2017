However, as a result, people forfeit their lives and property through accidents due to traffic congestion and traffic chaos. To ensure safe driving, anti-collision warning applications have been widely discussed. Most vehicular safety applications use vehicular positioning and vehicular communication technologies to avoid car accidents. With Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks, it is common to use the global positioning system (GPS) as the vehicular positioning tool owing to its comprehensive development in vehicular navigation. However, there are factors that affect GPS positioning accuracy (e.g., multipath effect, atmospheric effect, etc.). To improve GPS vehicular positioning accuracy, we propose a cooperative positioning algorithm that can improve localization accuracy. We also demonstrate that our algorithm can work well in a real city environment.", "paper_title": "Improving positioning accuracy for VANET in real city environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000355231600003"}
