Recently, multi-resolution analysis such as wavelet decompositions provides very good multi-resolution analytical tools for different scales of pavement analysis and distresses classification. This paper present an automatic diagnosis system for detecting and classification pavement crack distress based on Wavelet-Radon Transform (WR) and Dynamic Neural Network (DNN) threshold selection. The algorithm of the proposed system consists of a combination of feature extraction using WR and classification using the neural network technique. The proposed WR + DNN system performance is compared with static neural network (SNN). In test stage; proposed method was applied to the pavement images database to evaluate the system performance. The correct classification rate (CCR) of proposed system is over 99%. This research demonstrated that the WR + DNN method can be used efficiently for fast automatic pavement distress detection and classification. The details of the image processing technique and the characteristic of system are also described in this paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
