This makes the identity tracing of perpetrators during forensic investigations a challenging task since conventional speaker recognition techniques are limited to un-encrypted speech communications. In this paper, we propose techniques for speaker identification and verification from encrypted VoIP conversations. Our experimental results show that the proposed techniques can correctly identify the actual speaker for 70-75% of the time among a group of 10 potential suspects. We also achieve more than 10 fold improvement over random guessing in identifying a perpetrator in a group of 20 potential suspects. An equal error rate of 17% in case of speaker verification on the CSLU speaker recognition corpus is achieved. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
