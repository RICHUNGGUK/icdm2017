Traditional thinning algorithms often have a simple, iterative structure, yet producing skeletons that are overly sensitive to boundary perturbations. We present a novel thinning algorithm, operating on objects represented as cell complexes, that preserves the simplicity of typical thinning algorithms but generates skeletons that more robustly capture global shape features. Our key insight is formulating a skeleton significance measure, called medial persistence, which identify skeleton geometry at various dimensions (e. g., curves or surfaces) that represent object parts with different anisotropic elongations (e. g., tubes or plates). The measure is generally defined in any dimensions, and can be easily computed using a single thinning pass. Guided by medial persistence, our algorithm produces a family of topology and shape preserving skeletons whose shape and composition can be flexible controlled by desired level of medial persistence.", "paper_title": "A Simple and Robust Thinning Algorithm on Cell Complexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000283159400028"}
