We formulate the jumper insertion for antenna avoidance/ fixing as a tree-cutting problem and present the first optimal algorithm for the general tree-cutting problem. We show that the tree-cutting problem exhibits the properties of optimal substructures and greedy choices. With these properties, we present an O((V + D) lg D)-time optimal jumper-insertion algorithm that uses the least number of jumpers to avoid/fix the antenna violations on a Steiner/spanning tree with V vertices and D obstacles. Experimental results show the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.", "paper_title": "An exact jumper-insertion algorithm for antenna violation avoidance/fixing considering routing obstacles", "paper_id": "WOS:000245190500010"}
