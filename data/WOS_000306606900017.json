This method, proposed by Leveque, provides accurate and correct solutions of non-sonic shocks. Rarefactions need some adjustments which are explored in the present work with scalar equation and systems of equations. The non-conservative terms that appear in systems of conservation laws introduce an extra difficulty in practical application. The way to deal with source terms is incorporated into the proposed procedure. The boundary treatment is analysed and a reflection wave technique is considered. In presence of strong discontinuities or important source terms, a strategy is proposed to control the stability of the method allowing the largest time step possible. The performance of the above scheme is evaluated to solve the homogeneous shallow water equations and the shallow water equations with source terms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
