A conceptual model of the visualization support to DM[ modeling process and a novel interactive visual decision tree (IVDT) classification process have been proposed in this paper, with the aim of exploring humans' pattern recognition ability and domain knowledge to facilitate the knowledge discovery process. An IVDT for categorical input attributes has been developed and experimented on 20 subjects to test three hypotheses regarding its potential advantages. The experimental results suggested that, compared to the automatic modeling process as typically applied in current decision tree modeling tools, lVDT process can improve the effectiveness of modeling in terms of producing trees with relatively high classification accuracies and small sizes, enhance users' understanding of the algorithm, and give them greater satisfaction with the task.
