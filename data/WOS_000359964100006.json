The analyzed test geometry is a bottom mounted, polygonal structure in a channel flow. The aim of the study is to analyze the effect of shape variations of the structure on the resulting horizontal forces. Steady current conditions, dynamic loading due to waves, and combined wave-current scenarios are considered. A clear focus is put on simplicity and reproducibility, allowing for efficient testing of related methods and codes. This is achieved by defining a simple test geometry, altered in one design variable only, and by designing the test case such that a two dimensional analysis of the flow fields is possible. The force sensitivities to changes in the geometry are determined both numerically and experimentally for a great bandwidth of different load cases. The experiments are carried out in a recirculating wave-current flume while the numerical simulations are based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Data is also provided to analyze the effect of wave-current interaction on structural loads. Furthermore, a reference study is carried out that focuses on differences in load curves resulting from 2D and 3D flows. It is shown that the major trends predicted by the numerical simulations are also captured in the experiment, highlighting the potential of CFD as a powerful tool for shape optimization studies. The overall aim of the paper is to provide clear and thorough information for validation and verification of methods and codes used to analyze fluid related shape optimization problems.
