Firstly, the novel model determines the processing order of exemplar according to a composite function, which is the product of the colour property and structure property in exemplar. Then the exemplar along a geometric structure is processed prior to other parts of the image. Secondly, the most similar exemplar is found in the CIELAB colour space, and the size of it is adaptively determined by the local textured information. Thirdly, a Poisson equation is adopted to remove the seams, block effects, and artifacts in the image generated by the exemplar-based model. Finally, a bi-directional diffusion PDE is used to assist the completion of lathy linear structure. Experimental results demonstrate that the novel model can properly reconstruct the target region while preserving the geometric structure without inducing block effects, which leads to its better performance than the conventional exemplar-based image completion models.", "paper_title": "Exemplar-Based Image Completion Model Employing PDE Corrections", "paper_id": "WOS:000279506000008"}
