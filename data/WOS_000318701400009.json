A cell searching and direction-of-arrival estimation method for an MRS with a uniform linear array is proposed for OFDM-based cellular systems in a multipath environment, even with the existence of the symbol timing offsets and carrier frequency offsets. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by computer simulation using the standard profile of IEEE 802.16e.", "paper_title": "Cell Searching and DoA Estimation for a Mobile Relay Station in a Multipath Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000318701400009"}
