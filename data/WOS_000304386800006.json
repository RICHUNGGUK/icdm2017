This notion of primeness is equivalent to level cuts being crisp prime ideals. It also generalizes the one provided by Kumbhojkar and Bapat in 1993, which lacks this equivalence in a noncommutative setting. Semiprime fuzzy ideals over a noncommutative ring are also defined and characterized as intersection of primes. This allows us to introduce the fuzzy prime radical and contribute to establish the basis of a Fuzzy Noncommutative Ring Theory. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
