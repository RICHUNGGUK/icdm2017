To deal with multiple routing layers and preferred routing orientations, we consider the multilayer obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimal tree (ML-OARSMT) problem and the obstacle-avoiding preferred direction Steiner tree (OAPD-ST) problem. First, we prove that the multilayer case is theoretically different from the 2D one, and propose a reduction to transform a multilayer instance into a 3D instance. Based on the reduction, we apply computational geometry techniques to develop an efficient algorithm, utilizing existing OARSMT heuristics, for the ML-OARSMT problem and the OAPD-ST problem. Furthermore, we develop an advanced Steiner point selection to avoid inferior Steiner points and to improve the solution quality. Experimental results show that our algorithm provides a solution with excellent quality and has a significant speed-up compared to previously known results.", "paper_title": "Efficient Multilayer Obstacle-Avoiding Rectilinear Steiner Tree Construction Based on Geometric Reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000345518500013"}
