Unlike previous work by using trained prior shapes, we employ a parametric super-ellipse as a global prior shape for a human kidney. The Fisher-Tippett distribution is employed to describe the grey level statistics. Combining the grey level statistics with a global character of a kidney shape, we propose a new active contour model to segment ultrasound kidney images. The proposed model involves two subproblems. One subproblem is to optimize the parameters of a super-ellipse. Another subproblem is to segment an ultrasound kidney image. An alternating minimization scheme is used to optimize the parameters of a super-ellipse and segment an image simultaneously. To segment an image fast, a convex relaxation method is introduced and the split Bregman method is incorporated to propose a fast segmentation algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated by numerical experiments on both simulated images and real ultrasound kidney images. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
