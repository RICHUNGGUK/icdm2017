Based on this variational principle, the quadrilateral finite elements are derived for the numerical investigation. These elements, consisting of eight fields per node including three displacements, two rotations and three higher order moments, are applied for the bending analysis of laminated plates. An elegant least-square based variational projection method for the recovery of the transverse shearing stresses is also included. The Navier-type analytical solution using the developed mixed functional is appended to evaluate the present elements. The accuracy of the present elements and the effectiveness of the transverse-stress recovery scheme are illustrated through numerical examples. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
