This poses new challenges and research opportunities in spatial-based discovery media resources over varied sources, since location context is being increasingly supported in most of these social networks and services. In this paper, we present a virtual globe tool for searching and visualizing geo-referenced media resources. Our approach is based on the integration of search technologies, description languages for annotating collections of geo-referenced media resources and visualization techniques. The combination of these techniques is materialized in a virtual globe-based tool to facilitate searching and presentation of geo-referenced media resources available in different social networks.", "paper_title": "A virtual globe tool for searching and visualizing geo-referenced media resources in social networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000316763600009"}
