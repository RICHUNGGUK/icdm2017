However, performance is poor when no regularization is used in the estimation and otherwise computationally impractical to implement for 3-D imaging methods. We propose a method which accounts for spatial context in MR images by the imposition of a Gaussian Markov random field (MRF) structure on a transformation of the spin-lattice relaxation time, the spin-spin relaxation time and the proton density at each voxel. The MRF structure is specified through a matrix normal distribution. We also model the observed magnitude images using the more accurate but computationally challenging Rice distribution. A one-step-late expectation-maximization approach is adopted to make our approach computationally practical. We evaluate predictive performance in generating synthetic MR images in a clinical setting: our results indicate that our suggested approach is not only computationally feasible to implement but also shows excellent performance.", "paper_title": "Synthetic Magnetic Resonance Imaging Revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000276308800026"}
