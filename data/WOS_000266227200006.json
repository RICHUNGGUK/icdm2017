The proposed approach is implemented in an homogenization scheme based on Voigt and Reuss localization assumption. The fabric tensor-based approach is then combined with a new kinematic localization rule and yields a general homogenization scheme for anisotropic granular media. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
