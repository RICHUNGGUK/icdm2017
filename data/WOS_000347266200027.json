Being able to satisfy the demand with a limited outpatient service capacity is an important operational challenge. The objective of our research consists in studying the relationships and interactions between patient flows, resource capacity (number of consulting rooms and number of nurses) and appointment scheduling rules in order to improve an outpatient orthopaedic clinic performance. Discrete event simulation is used to model outpatient flows. An experimental design was developed to test how to assign consulting rooms and nurses to each orthopedist considering four appointment scheduling rules and three patient flow types of varied complexity. Analysis of variance and the Tukey test are used to evaluate the simulation results. Our conclusion is that in order to improve the outpatient orthopaedic clinic performance, resources (consulting rooms, nurses) and appointment scheduling rules must be adapted to the different patient flows.
