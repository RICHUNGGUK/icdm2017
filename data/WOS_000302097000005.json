It is not a trivial task to discover meaningful visual patterns from images because the content variations and spatial dependence in visual data greatly challenge most existing data mining methods. This paper presents a novel approach to coping with these difficulties for mining visual collocation patterns. Specifically, the novelty of this work lies in the following new contributions: 1) a principled solution to the discovery of visual collocation patterns based on frequent itemset mining and 2) a self-supervised subspace learning method to refine the visual codebook by feeding back discovered patterns via subspace learning. The experimental results show that our method can discover semantically meaningful patterns efficiently and effectively.", "paper_title": "Mining Visual Collocation Patterns via Self-Supervised Subspace Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000302097000005"}
