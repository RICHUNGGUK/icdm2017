They can be solved by centralized algorithms, but this requires to make public preference lists, something that members would prefer to avoid for privacy reasons. This motivates a distributed formulation to keep privacy. We propose a distributed constraint approach that solves all the considered problems, keeping privacy.", "paper_title": "Distributed stable matching problems with ties and incomplete lists", "paper_id": "WOS:000241582400048"}
