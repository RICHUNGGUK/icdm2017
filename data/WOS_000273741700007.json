This article discusses a number of challenging computational problems in elucidating the genomic structures at multiple levels and the information that is encoded through these genomic structures, gearing towards the ultimate understanding of the governing rules of bacterial genome organization.", "paper_title": "Computational Challenges in Deciphering Genomic Structures of Bacteria", "paper_id": "WOS:000273741700007"}
