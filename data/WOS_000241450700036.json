During those iterations, the abstraction of concepts and relationships is an important step. In this paper, we propose to automate this abstraction process using techniques based on Formal Concept Analysis in a model-driven context. Using UML2.0 class diagrams as modeling language for class models, in this proposal we show how our model-driven approach enables parameterization, tracing and generalization to any metamodel to express class models.", "paper_title": "Building abstractions in class models: Formal concept analysis in a model-driven approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000241450700036"}
