VOs represent an interesting approach for companies to achieve new and profitable business opportunities by being able to dynamically partner with others. Thus, choosing the appropriate VO partners is a crucial aspect. Ensuring trustworthiness of the members is also fundamental for making the best decisions. In this paper, we show how trust negotiation represents an effective means to select the best possible members during different stages in the VO lifecycle. We base our discussion on concrete application scenarios and illustrate the tools created by us that integrate trust negotiation with a VO Management toolkit. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
