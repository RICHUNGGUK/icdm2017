This paper proposes HORSIC, an efficient one-time signature scheme for broadcast authentication in wireless sensor networks. Different from previous one-time signature schemes. HORSIC can reduce the public key size and signature size simultaneously at the cost of increased overhead in key generation and signature verification. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
