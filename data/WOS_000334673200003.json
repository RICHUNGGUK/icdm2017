Current wireless network data search systems are not suitable for large-scale highly mobile and dense wireless networks. This paper presents a scalable and mobility-resilient LOcality-based distRibuted Data search system (LORD) for large-scale wireless networks with high mobility and density. Taking advantage of the high density, rather than mapping data to a location point, LORD maps file metadata to a geographical region and stores it in multiple nodes in the region, thus enhancing mobility-resilience. LORD has a novel region-based geographic data routing protocol that does not rely on flooding or GPSs for data publishing and querying, and a coloring-based partial replication algorithm to reduce data replicas in a region while maintaining the querying efficiency. LORD also works for unbalanced wireless networks with sparse regions. Simulation results show the superior performance of LORD compared to representative data search systems in terms of scalability, overhead, and mobility resilience in a highly dense and mobile network. The results also show the high scalability and mobility-resilience of LORD in an unbalanced wireless network with sparse regions, and the effectiveness of its coloring-based partial replication algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Scalable and Mobility-Resilient Data Search System for Large-Scale Mobile Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000334673200003"}
