Network Analysis and Inference Library (NAIL) is a set of software tools to simplify the range of computational activities involved in regulatory network inference. It uses a modular approach to connect different network inference algorithms to the same visualization and network-based analyses. NAIL is technology-independent and includes an interface layer to allow easy integration of components into other applications.", "paper_title": "NAIL, a software toolset for inferring, analyzing and visualizing regulatory networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000347832300023"}
