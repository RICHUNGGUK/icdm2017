The first reduction is global while the second one is local and asynchronous. We prove that for LAL (EAL, respectively) typed terms, Lamping's abstract algorithm also admits a polynomial (elementary, respectively) bound. We also give a proof of its soundness and completeness (for EAL and LAL with type fixpoints), by using a simple geometry of interaction model (context semantics). (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
