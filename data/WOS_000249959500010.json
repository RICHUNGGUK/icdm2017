The method relies on 2-D motion correction from two radiopaque markerballs located on each side of the stent. The two markerballs are on a guidewire and linked to the balloon, which is introduced into the artery. Once the balloon has been inflated, deflated, and the stent deployed, a rotational sequence around the patient is acquired. Under the assumption that the guidewire and the stent have the same 3-D motion during rotational acquisition, we developed an algorithm to correct cardiac pstent motion on the 2-D X-ray projection images. The 3-D image of the deployed stent is then reconstructed with the Feldkamp algorithm using all the available projections. Although the correction is an approximation, we show that the intrinsic geometrical error of our method has no visual impact on the reconstruction when the 2-D markerball centers are exactly detected and the markerballs have the same 3-D motion as the stent. Qualitative and quantitative results on simulated sequences under different realistic conditions demonstrate the robustness of the method. Finally, results from animal data acquired on a rotational angiography device are presented.", "paper_title": "Motion correction for coronary stent reconstruction from rotational X-ray projection sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000249959500010"}
