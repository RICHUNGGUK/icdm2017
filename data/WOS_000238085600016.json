From knowledge of available resources at the user interface, and task information needs we can identify whether the system provides the user with adequate support for task execution. We look at how we can use tools to help reason about these issues, and illustrate their use through an example. We also consider a full range of analyses suggested using this approach which could potentially be supported by automated reasoning systems.", "paper_title": "Supporting resource-based analysis of task information needs", "paper_id": "WOS:000238085600016"}
