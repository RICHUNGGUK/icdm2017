The conceptual level of the framework describes how sub-ontologies are extracted and extended with new features, while the architectural level of the framework describes the components of the framework. These components allow the sub-ontology extraction and extension process to be performed using shared resources in the Semantic Grid environment. A prototype of the framework is built using Web Services and a complexity evaluation measure is presented. The results of several simulations show that the sub-ontology extraction and extension process in the Semantic Grid is a viable solution and can be optimized by using better quality, initial labeling set.
