The diameter of a tree refers to the maximum weight of the path connecting two different leaves in the tree. This problem is called the minimum diameter cost-constrained Steiner tree problem, which is NP-hard even when the topology of the Steiner tree is fixed. In this paper, we deal with the fixed-topology restricted version. We prove the restricted version to be polynomially solvable when the topology is not part of the input and propose a weakly fully polynomial time approximation scheme (weakly FPTAS) when the topology is part of the input, which can find a -approximation of the restricted version problem for any with a specific characteristic.", "paper_title": "Minimum diameter cost-constrained Steiner trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000330209400004"}
