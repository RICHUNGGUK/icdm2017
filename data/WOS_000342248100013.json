Since some existing algorithms have a bottleneck caused by expensive computational cost when handling uncertain objects, supervised Uncertain K-means (UK-means) algorithm is proposed to classify uncertain objects more efficiently. Supervised UK-means assumes that the classes are well separated. However, in real data sets, objects from the same class are usually interspersed among (disconnected by) other classes. Thus, we propose a supervised UK-means with multiple subclasses (SUMS) which considers that the objects in the same class can be further divided into several groups (subclasses) within the class. Moreover, we propose a bounded supervised UK-means with multiple subclasses (BSUMS) to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate that SUMS and BSUMS perform better than some existing algorithms by extensive experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
