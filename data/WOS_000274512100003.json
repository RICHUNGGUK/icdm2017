This paper discusses a network DEA model which distributes the system inefficiency to its component processes. The model is applied to assess the impact of information technology (IT) on firm performance in a banking industry. The results show that the impact of IT on firm performance operates indirectly through fund collection. The impact increases when the IT budget is shared with the profit generation process.
