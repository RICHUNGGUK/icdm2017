The bounds are tight when the ratio max(M,N)/min(M,N) = R is equal to an integer. For this case, we show that the total number of degrees of freedom is equal to min(M, N) K if K <= R and min(M, N) R/R+1 K if K > R. Achievability is based on interference alignment. We also provide examples where using interference alignment combined with zero forcing can achieve more degrees of freedom than merely zero forcing for some MIMO interference channels with constant channel coefficients.", "paper_title": "Degrees of Freedom of the K User M x N MIMO Interference Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000284419900011"}
