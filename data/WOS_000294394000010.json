Context-based adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC), context-based adaptive variable length coding (CAVLC), and universal variable length coding (UVLC) are three entropy coding tools adopted by H.264/AVC. CABAC can be used to encode the texture and the header data while CAVLC and UVLC are employed to encode the texture and the header data, respectively. Although CABAC can provide better R-D performance than CAVLC/UVLC, its decoding complexity is higher. Thus, by taking the entropy decoding complexity into account, CABAC may not be the best tool, which motivates us to examine the entropy coding mode decision problem in depth. It will be shown experimentally that the proposed mode decision algorithm can help the encoder generate the bit streams that can be decoded at much lower complexity with little R-D performance loss.
