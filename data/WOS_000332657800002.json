This paper demonstrates the approach by considering steel frames retrofitted with posttensioned energy dissipating (PTED) connections. A multiphase genetic algorithm is applied for discrete optimization to determine robust steel moment-resisting frame (MRF) designs incorporating PTED connections. Nonlinear dynamic time history finite-element analyses are employed to evaluate potential designs. For the case studies in this paper, results indicate that the performance of the MRF with optimal PTED connections exceeds that of MRFs with conventional moment-resisting connections for a specified seismic environment. This suggests that the PTED connections are a promising alternative to conventional welded moment-resisting connections in seismic regions. Furthermore, the developed computational framework is shown to provide an attractive approach for the design of MRFs with PTED connections and may be employed for the optimal design of other self-centering systems.", "paper_title": "Computational Framework for Automated Seismic Design of Steel Frames with Self-Centering Connections", "paper_id": "WOS:000332657800002"}
