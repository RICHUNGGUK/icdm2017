In addition to the capacity constraints on the plants, there is a limit on the total distance traveled by each vehicle to serve its assigned customers by means of round trips. This paper presents several formulations for the problem and proposes different families of valid inequalities. The results of extensive computational experiments are presented and analyzed.
