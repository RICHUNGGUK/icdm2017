Rather than recomputing paths after temporary topology changes, we argue for a separation of timescale between offline computation of multiple diverse paths and online spreading of load over these paths. We believe decoupling failure recovery from path computation leads to networks that are inherently more efficient, more scalable, and easier to manage.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Route Computation Considered Harmful", "paper_id": "WOS:000277061000010"}
