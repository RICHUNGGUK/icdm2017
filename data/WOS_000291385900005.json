Advances in wide baseline correspondence extraction require looking beyond the robust feature extraction and matching approach. This study examines new techniques of extracting correspondences that take advantage of information contained in affine feature matches. Methods of improving the accuracy of a set of putative matches, eliminating incorrect matches and extracting large numbers of additional correspondences are explored. It is assumed that knowledge of the camera geometry is not available and not immediately recoverable. The new techniques are evaluated by means of an epipolar geometry estimation task. It is shown that these methods enable the computation of camera geometry in many cases where existing feature extractors cannot produce sufficient numbers of accurate correspondences.", "paper_title": "Wide baseline correspondence extraction beyond local features", "paper_id": "WOS:000291385900005"}
