By leveraging on the information from the Lagrangean multiplier, we could construct more power efficient routing paths. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing approaches for broadcast, multicast, and unicast communications.", "paper_title": "A Novel Optimization-Based Approach for Minimum Power Multicast in Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000287947400005"}
