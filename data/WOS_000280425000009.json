Such interval valued bimatrix games are considered in this paper. There are many questions arising in this context. First, we discuss the problem of existence of an equilibrium being common for all instances of interval values. We show that this property is equivalent to solvability of a certain linear mixed integer system of equations and inequalities. Second, we characterize the set of all possible equilibria by mean of a linear mixed integer system.", "paper_title": "INTERVAL VALUED BIMATRIX GAMES", "paper_id": "WOS:000280425000009"}
