Tunable generalization is possible based on non-linear (sigmoid) positive valuation functions; moreover, the FLR classifier can deal with missing data. Learning is carried out both incrementally and fast by computing disjunctions of join-lattice interval conjunctions, where a join-lattice interval conjunction corresponds to a hyperbox in R-N. Our testbed in this work concerns the problem of estimating ambient ozone concentration from both meteorological and air-pollutant measurements. The results compare favorably with results obtained by C4.5 decision trees, fuzzy-ART as well as back-propagation neural networks. Novelties and advantages of classifier FLR are detailed extensively and in comparison with related work from the literature. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
