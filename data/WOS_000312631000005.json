This process is highly complex because a big number of variables take part in it. Furthermore, huge sets of data must be taken into account to perform a grounded investment, making the process even more complicated. In this paper we present a real trading system that has been developed using semantic technologies. These cutting-edge technologies are very useful in this context because they enable the definition of schemes that can be used for storing financial information, which, in turn, can be easily accessed and queried. Additionally, the inference capabilities of the existing reasoning engines enable the generation of a set of rules supporting this investment analysis process.", "paper_title": "FAST: Fundamental Analysis Support for Financial Statements.
