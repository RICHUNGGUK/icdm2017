There are no measurable criteria used by human resource personnel, since most decisions are based on intuitive experience and subjective market knowledge. The present problem focuses on outsourcing of private training programs that are partly government funded, which has been facing accountability challenges. Due to the unavailability of a scientific decision-making approach in this context, a 12-step algorithm is proposed and tested in a Japanese multinational company. The model allows the decision makers to revise their criteria expectations, in turn witnessing the change of the training providers' quota distribution. Finally, this multi-objective sensitivity analysis provides a forward-looking approach to training needs planning and aids decision makers in their sourcing strategy.", "paper_title": "A MULTI-OBJECTIVE SENSITIVITY APPROACH TO TRAINING PROVIDERS' EVALUATION AND QUOTA ALLOCATION PLANNING", "paper_id": "WOS:000286224800007"}
