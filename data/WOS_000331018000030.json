The proposed algorithm dynamically adjusts distribution schedules from various supply points according to the requirements at demand points in order to minimize unsatisfied demand for resources, time to delivery, and transportation costs. The proposed algorithm was applied to the case of the Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan to verify its performance. Simulation results demonstrate that under conditions of a limited/unlimited number of available vehicles, the proposed algorithm outperforms the MOGA and standard greedy algorithm in 'time to delivery' by an average of 63.57% and 46.15%, respectively, based on 10,000 iterations.
