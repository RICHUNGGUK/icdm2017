The dirty-paper coding (DPC) rate region is shown to coincide with the capacity region. To that end, a new notion of an enhanced broadcast channel is introduced and is used jointly with the entropy power inequality, to show that a superposition of Gaussian codes is optimal for the degraded vector broadcast channel and that DPC is optimal for the nondegraded case. Furthermore, the capacity region is characterized under a wide range of input constraints, accounting, as special cases, for the total power and the per-antenna power constraints.", "paper_title": "The capacity region of the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000240076700005"}
