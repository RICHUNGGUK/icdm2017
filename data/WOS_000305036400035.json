This study intends to contribute to our understanding on student technology use by focusing on identifying the factors that influence students' adoption of technology for learning and the relationships between these factors. Students studying at a Hong Kong university were surveyed and the results revealed that the compatibility of technology and their learning styles and needs, the availability of encouragement and supports from peers and teachers, and their attitudes toward technology use were dominant predictors of students' technology use for learning. Perceived usefulness of technology for learning and students' perceptions of their general ICT literacy skills had less predictive power on their technology use. The findings suggest promoting students' adoption of technologies for learning through enhancing their appreciation of technologies' utilities in learning and through maximizing teachers' and peers' role in shaping and supporting their technology use.
