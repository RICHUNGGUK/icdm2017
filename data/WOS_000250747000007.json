While much research has been carried out in this aspect using various methods, no attention has been made on utilizing modern heuristics for this purpose. This paper proposes a memetic algorithm-based solution for energy-aware topology control for wireless sensor networks. This algorithm (called ToCMA), using a combination of problem-specific light-weighted local search and genetic algorithms, is able to solve the minimum energy network connectivity (MENC) this NP-hard problem in an approximated manner that performs better than the classical minimum spanning tree (MST) solution. The outcomes of ToCMA can also be utilized for various network optimization and fault-tolerant purposes. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
