With increasing incorporation of environmental flows in water planning worldwide, governments require decision support tools to manage these flows in regulated rivers. We developed the Environmental Water Allocation Simulator with Hydrology (eWASH), a fast, flexible and user-friendly scenario-based hydrological modelling tool, supporting environmental flow management decisions for single-or multi-reservoir systems. Environmental flow demands and management rules are easily specified via the graphical user interface, and batch processing functions aid in uncertainty assessment. eWASH modelled main processes of complex regulated rivers and the tool is widely applicable. We calibrated eWASH for the Gwydir and Macquarie Rivers of Australia's MurrayeDarling Basin. Modelled monthly environmental flow allocations exhibited NasheSutcliffe efficiencies of 0.55 for the Gwydir and 0.72 for the Macquarie catchments respectively when validated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
