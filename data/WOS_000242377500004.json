In the present study, the melting behavior of polymer pellets under compression is studied by a simplified model with the finite element method, based on the fact that mechanical energy from the deformation of a single pellet is converted into heat energy. The model shows that the heating of the pellet is not uniform. Under compression, the contact area of the pellet yields first, and the deformation in the pellet depends on the compression ratio and properties of the pellet. The simulated results show that the temperature in the volume around the line passing through the contacting point and the center of the pellet is higher than the temperature further from the contact area.", "paper_title": "A simplified model for the melting of polymer pellets under compression in a twin-screw extruder", "paper_id": "WOS:000242377500004"}
