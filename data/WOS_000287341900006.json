With the effect of the multi-agents system in the Internet environment and the promotions of Government, digital product industry grows fast. The authors proposed a digital product transaction mechanism for electronic auction in the multi-agents system environment. The research introduced a convenient platform to protect the privacies of both buyers and sellers, and track digital product further in an electronic auction environment. In addition, by using simple cryptography techniques supplemented with encryption, the authors ensure the security of information transactions, thereby providing a mechanism of safe and fair digital product electronic auction.", "paper_title": "Digital product transaction mechanism for electronic auction environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000287341900006"}
