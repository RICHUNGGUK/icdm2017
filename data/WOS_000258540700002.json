It has been pointed out that, in braid groups, it is unlikely to provide adequate security. Therefore, new structures need to be found. In this paper, we give a formulation of the CSP for left conjugacy closed loops. In order to construct a generalization of the Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld key establishment method, we also define a partial conjugacy search problem PCSP and show it to be equivalent to the CSP, if the underlying structure is a group. We also study more closely the PCSP in a class of conjugacy closed loops of order p(2), where p is a prime.", "paper_title": "On the conjugacy search problem and left conjugacy closed loops", "paper_id": "WOS:000258540700002"}
