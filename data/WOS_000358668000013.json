There are many proposals for resource management approaches for cloud infrastructures, but effective resource management is still a major challenge for the leading cloud infrastructure operators (e.g., Amazon, Microsoft, Google), because the details of the underlying workloads and the real-world operational demands are too complex. Among those proposals, accurate host load prediction is one of the most effective measures to address this challenge. In this paper, we proposed a new method for host load prediction, which uses an autoencoder as the pre-recurrent feature layer of the echo state networks. The aim of our proposed method is to predict the host load in the future interval based on Google cluster usage dataset. Experiments performed on Google load traces show that our proposed method achieves higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Multi-step-ahead host load prediction using autoencoder and echo state networks in cloud computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000358668000013"}
