An open architecture control system capable of distributed processing of decision-making and extraction of task information provides a premise for intelligent control and flexible operation. Intelligent detection with database feedback based on real-time assignment of tasks is proposed to achieve dynamic modification of the processing trajectory. In the context of flexible task control, a multi-robot architecture with collision-free path planning and a novel programming approach based on parameter-driven technology are developed. The proposed CNC system has been successfully implemented and demonstrated on an H-beam steel-cutting task that requires flexible and accurate machining. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
