In this paper, we propose the prime discriminant simplicial complex (PDSC) by utilizing persistent homology to capture such structures. Assuming that each class is represented with a prime simplicial complex, we classify unlabeled samples based on the nearest projection distances from the samples to the simplicial complexes. We also extend the extrapolation ability of these complexes with a projection constraint term. Experiments in simulated and practical datasets indicate that, compared with several published algorithms, the proposed PDSC approaches achieve promising performance without losing structure representation.", "paper_title": "Prime Discriminant Simplicial Complex", "paper_id": "WOS:000312844800012"}
