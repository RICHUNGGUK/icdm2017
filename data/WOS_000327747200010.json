As a first step, a pharmacophore model of various known AT(1)R ligands exhibiting a wide range of binding affinities was generated. Second, a structural model of AT(1)R was built making use of the growing set of crystal structures of GPCRs, which was further used for the docking of the AT(1)R ligands based on the devised pharmacophore model. Next, ligand-receptor-lipid bilayer systems were studied by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Overall, the present study has permitted, combining the pharmacophore model with binding free energy calculations obtained from the MD simulations, to propose the molecular mechanisms by which sartans interact with AT(1)R", "paper_title": "Ligand Binding Determinants for Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor from Computer Simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000327747200010"}
