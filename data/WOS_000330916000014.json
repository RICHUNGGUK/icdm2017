Unlike the potential flow solutions that have several restrictive assumptions, the Euler equations are directly solved herein by the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, which is a Lagrangian approach without a mesh. The coefficient of flow contraction is obtained in terms of the ratio of the channel widths and the turning angle. The velocity field and pressure distribution in a right-angled bend are calculated. The shape of the free streamlines for a symmetric bend with several turning angles is obtained. The numerical steady-state results are validated against available theoretical solutions. The computed velocity on the free streamline is consistent with Kirchhoff's theory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
