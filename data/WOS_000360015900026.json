The subspace distance d(S)(X, Y) = dim(X) + dim(Y)-2dim(X boolean AND Y) defined on P-q(n) turns it into a natural coding space for error correction in random network coding. A subset of P-q(n) is called a code and the subspaces that belong to the code are called codewords. Motivated by classical coding theory, a linear coding structure can be imposed on a subset of P-q(n). Braun et al. conjectured that the largest cardinality of a linear code, that contains F-q(n), is 2(n). In this paper, we prove this conjecture and characterize the maximal linear codes that contain F-q(n).", "paper_title": "On the Bounds of Certain Maximal Linear Codes in a Projective Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000360015900026"}
