The approach is realized using the framework of a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy modeling and control. The nonlinear control algorithm consists of three parts. The first part determines a trimmed equilibrium of the F16 dynamics for a given desired flight condition. The second part generates a T-S fuzzy model from the F16 dynamics around the trimmed equilibrium determined in the first part. In the third part, a linear matrix inequality based design is carried out to automatically design a T-S fuzzy controller satisfying some kinds of performance from the T-S fuzzy model generated in the second part. Since there are an infinite number of trimmed equilibriums in the F16 dynamics and the trimmed equilibriums widely change according to different flight conditions, T-S fuzzy models are multiply re-generated according to widely change of the trimmed equilibriums. T-S fuzzy controllers are also re-designed from re-generated T-S fuzzy models whenever different desired flight conditions are selected. Control performance of the proposed control is tested for the original dynamics (not T-S fuzzy models). The testing results demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach of nonlinear control of the F16 aircraft via multiple nonlinear model generation for any trimmed equilibriums.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear Control of F16 Aircraft via Multiple Nonlinear Model Generation for Any Trimmed Equilibriums", "paper_id": "WOS:000338826200002"}
