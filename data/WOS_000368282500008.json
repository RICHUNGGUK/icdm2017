Given the high complexity and large traffic load of communication networks, these correlated challenges cause substantial damage to reliable network communication. In this work, we extend the GeoDivRP routing protocol to consider delay-skew requirement when using multiple geographically diverse paths for telecommunication networks under area-based challenges. We present a flow-diverse minimum-cost routing multicommodity flow problem. Furthermore, we present a nonlinear delay-skew optimization problem to balance between delay and traffic skew on paths. We investigate the tradeoff between the delay and skew in choosing multiple geodiverse paths. We implement GeoDivRP in ns-3 to use the optimized paths given by the two optimization solutions and demonstrate their effectiveness compared to open shortest path first Equal-Cost Multi-Path routing in terms of overall link utilization. It guarantees the delay-skew constraint provided by the upper layer while satisfies the traffic demand imposed by multiple routing commodities in the telecommunication networks. c 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
