The situation when the two cells are connected by a tunnelling nanotube (TNT) is simulated. Two mechanisms of prion transport are considered: lateral diffusion in the TNT membrane and active actin-dependent transport inside endocytic vesicles that are propelled by myosin Va molecular motors. Analytical solutions describing prion concentrations and fluxes are obtained. Numerical results are compared with those predicted by a single prion population model that relies on a single reaction-diffusion equation and accounts for the two modes of prion transport in an effective way.", "paper_title": "A two population model of prion transport through a tunnelling nanotube", "paper_id": "WOS:000337530300007"}
