The main axes of change are discussed: wireless technology, user population, and applications. Evolution of wireless technology realized a 200-fold increase in data rate, and facilitated a continuous enrichment of the traffic mix traversing legacy and modern wireless networks. New applications emerged, such as peer-to-peer file sharing online gaming, and multimedia, establishing a trend of significant increase in traffic volume. User population has also increased and even saturated some markets. However, not all benefits of wireless technologies are equally mu exploited, with only a few users exercising high mobility or regularly enjoying timedia services. Future indications include a requirement for either integration or interoperability of two mainstream wireless technologies, WiFi and cellular, as well as continuous user demand for more bandwidth, broader coverage, and better mobility support.", "paper_title": "Wireless Data Traffic: A Decade of Change", "paper_id": "WOS:000264629300005"}
