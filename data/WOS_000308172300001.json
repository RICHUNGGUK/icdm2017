In order to support efficient spectrum sharing between M2M devices and normal mobile users, in the paper, we propose a multilayer orthogonal beamforming (MOBF) scheme for M2M communications over orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA-) based cellular systems. Using MOBF, each subcarrier in OFDMA systems could be efficiently reused by both normal mobile users and machine-type devices which are organized into multiple virtual layers. The users located in higher layers (e. g., mobile users) are not to be interfered by those in lower layers (e. g., machine devices). To improve the performance, the orthogonal deficiency (OD-) based user selection is carried out, where the intralayer fairness and quasimaximal performance can be guaranteed, simultaneously. Moreover, the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) is investigated to measure the performance lower bound of different layers. It is demonstrated by both theoretical and numerical results that the proposed approach provides a stable SINR performance for each layer, that is, the interference free ability from lower level layers.", "paper_title": "Multilayer Orthogonal Beamforming for Priority-Guaranteed Wireless Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000308172300001"}
