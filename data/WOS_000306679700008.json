This study presents Gene-Expression Programming (GEP), which is an extension to Genetic Programming (GP), as an alternative approach to estimating the scour depth at culvert outlets. The data sets of laboratory measurements of scour depths at culverts were compiled from published literature and used to train the GEP network or evolve the program. The developed network and evolved programs were validated using a random subset of the scour observations that were not used in GEP training. The GEP was found to be more effective in predicting the scour depth at culvert outlets (R-2 = 0.989, RMSE = 0.0678), compared with the regression equations and artificial neural networks (ANN) modelling.", "paper_title": "PREDICTION OF SCOUR DEPTH AT CULVERT OUTLETS USING GENE-EXPRESSION PROGRAMMING", "paper_id": "WOS:000306679700008"}
