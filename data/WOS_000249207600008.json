The most difficult problem in creating fire animation is how to simulate the mechanism of emitting the light and heat of fire. We attack the difficulty by presenting a simulation scheme for the combustion process in voxelized space where the numerical solution of the classical fluid equations is implemented. Therefore, the combustion process is simulated at each voxel and the amount of heat generated at the voxel is estimated. The generated heat will increase the temperature at the voxel, which results in the increase of the turbulent motion of fire. We also propose a visualization scheme that is based on a photon mapping algorithm in order to render fire and various lighting effects of fire to the environments.", "paper_title": "A combustion-based technique for fire animation and visualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000249207600008"}
