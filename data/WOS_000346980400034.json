Our algorithm is computationally efficient, and achieves a regret of (O) over tilde(root T) in a sequence of T auctions. This holds even when the number of bidders is stochastic with a known distribution.", "paper_title": "Regret Minimization for Reserve Prices in Second-Price Auctions", "paper_id": "WOS:000346980400034"}
