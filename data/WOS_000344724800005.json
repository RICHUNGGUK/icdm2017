This paper reports on an action design research project that addressed the problem of limited adoption of e-Government in Bangladesh. Inadequate knowledge of the nature of e-Government systems had been identified as an underlying cause of many other problems in this 'wicked' problem context. The project aimed to reduce knowledge deficiencies among key decision makers through activities that included the delivery of a custom-made training program and a handbook targeted at senior government officers. The project had modest resources and yet yielded significant outcomes. Critical reflection established a number of design principles for a 'sweet spot change strategy' for interventions of this type, with the most important principle being to first identify a 'sweet spot', a point of maximum leverage, and then to act on it.", "paper_title": "A 'sweet spot' change strategy for a least developed country: leveraging e-Government in Bangladesh", "paper_id": "WOS:000344724800005"}
