Therefore, it has been a great challenge for practicing engineers to ensure temporal correctness and reliability of interaction behaviors among industrial equipments. Nowadays, pi-calculus, a process algebra and NuSMV, a symbolic model checker, have been widely applied to address this posed challenge respectively. However, they are always used separately. Because different formal methods focus on different aspects of systems, only one single method is still difficult to cope very well with the posed challenge. Therefore in this paper, an integrated framework of formal methods, which combines it-calculus with NuSMV, is constructed. pi-Calculus can definitely specify equipment interaction, and NuSMV can automate verification process. Especially counterexamples fed back by NuSMV can help practicing engineers to trace temporal violations. Furthermore, a cooperative traffic lights control strategy is illuminated to show how the framework works. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
