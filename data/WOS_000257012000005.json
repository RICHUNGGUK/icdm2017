The emphasis is placed on the practice of the representation methodology. The integrated and application framework for the knowledge-based product information model in OWL/SWRL is described. The interoperation between the product information model and existing rule engines is discussed. As most rule engines have their own fact and rule syntax different from OWL/SWRL, Jess, a Java-based rule engine, is employed to perform the inference and the transformation between the OWL/SWRL and Jess syntax by means of XSLT is investigated. In order to access the product information, querying methods are also introduced. The practice is illustrated through stand-alone experimental applications, oriented to the ontology stemming from a test case of a product information model in EXPRESS language. Meanwhile, the present study proves the feasibility and validity of ontologies as a support to product data exchange, information and knowledge sharing, and reasoning. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
