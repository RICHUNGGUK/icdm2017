The results show that selling public companies' share in Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) leads to a structural break in degree of market development. To model this phenomenon a catastrophe approach is used and it is demonstrated that this structural break can be better explained by a cusp catastrophe model.", "paper_title": "MODELING THE EFFECT OF PRIVATIZATION ON BEHAVIOR OF HURST EXPONENT USING STOCHASTIC CATASTROPHE THEORY", "paper_id": "WOS:000278088800002"}
