We develop a norm-based technique for analyzing this simple procedure. By applying the technique, we prove several bounds for the expected load factor. Specifically, if we keep uniformly splitting the bins without joining them, the expected load factor is between Omega(n(0.5)) and O(n(0.742)), however, if we alternatively join and split bins, the expected load factor converges to O(n(1/root 1/2 log2 n)). These bounds justify the intuition that the power of being adaptive to the current loads is essential for load balancing tasks, and they also show a somehow surprising phenomenon that joins can actually help load balancing if such power is not available.
