(Theor. Comput. Sci. 88(2):191-229, 1991) showed that every m-multiple context-free language L is weakly 2m-iterative in the sense that either L is finite or L contains a subset of the form {u(0)w(1)(i)u(1) ... w(2m)(i)u(2m) vertical bar i is an element of N}, where w(1) ... w(2n) not equal epsilon. Whether every m-multiple context-free language L is 2m-iterative, that is to say, whether all but finitely many elements z of L can be written as z = u(0)w(1)u(1) ... w(2m)u(2m) with w(1) ... w(2m) not equal epsilon and {u(0)w(1)(i)u(1) ... w(2m)(i)u(2m) vertical bar i is an element of N} subset of L, has been open.
