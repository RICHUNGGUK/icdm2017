We deal with the objective of the minimisation of the maximum completion time of the jobs, usually referred to as makespan or C(max). This is a type of assignment problem that has been frequently studied in the scientific literature due to its many potential applications. We propose a set of metaheuristics based on a size-reduction of the original assignment problem that produce solutions of very good quality in a short amount of time. The underlying idea is to consider only a few of the best possible machine assignments for the jobs and not all of them. The results are simple, yet powerful methods. We test the proposed algorithms with a large benchmark of instances and compare them with current state-of-the-art methods. In most cases, the proposed size-reduction algorithms produce results that are statistically proven to be better by a significant margin. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
