This paper presents a simple and unified view of all these construction methods both for unweighted and weighted regular expressions. It describes simpler algorithms with time complexities at least as favorable as that of the best previously known techniques, and provides a concise proof of their correctness. Our algorithms are all based on two standard automata operations: epsilon-removal and minimization. This contrasts with the multitude of complicated and special-purpose techniques previously described in the literature, and makes it straightforward to generalize these algorithms to the weighted case. In particular, we extend the definition and construction of follow automata to the case of weighted regular expressions over a closed semiring and present the first algorithm to compute weighted Antimirov automata.", "paper_title": "A unified construction of the Glushkov, follow, and Antimirov automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000240271700010"}
