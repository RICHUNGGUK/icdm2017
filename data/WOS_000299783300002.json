What characterizes a paradigm? Paradigms are central to the scientific revolutions and to the normal science in every field, but are a rather misunderstood term. This paper introduces the main theme of this issue with a clarifying approach to the concept of paradigm and appropriate concerns on its use. Aiming at identifying candidates for new paradigms by reviewing the literature, a search path is suggested aligning prospective paradigmatic targets in sound and music technologies, and then a method is proposed to search the literature and rank the most likely new candidates for paradigms. The method was applied in a selected set of scientific papers and led to a list of ten candidates for paradigms ranked by relevance. Discussions on the results, perspectives of the method, and about the potential candidates in the sound and music technology scenario are presented.", "paper_title": "Profiling New Paradigms in Sound and Music Technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000299783300002"}
