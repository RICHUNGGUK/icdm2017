Two major adaptations to DDP are proposed. Firstly, since information system development is human-capital intensive. and firms should choose projects that help grow the value of the finite skilled labor resource, Return on Invested Time (ROTI) becomes the optimization target, instead of simply Return On Investment (ROI). Secondly. standard cost and effort estimation frameworks, from the software industry, are incorporated. Attention is targeted at high impact revenue and expense assumptions that often outweigh software development time-cost concerns. Priority is given to gathering high-value knowledge first, and valuable project progression or abandonment decisions can be made earlier on in the system development life cycle.", "paper_title": "IT-DDP: A NOVEL METHODOLOGY FOR ASSURING ECONOMIC VALUE FROM ENTREPRENEURIAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000265556800001"}
