To quantify and control such errors and obtain high accuracy solutions, we consider a class of problems which involve second derivative of unknowns with respect to time. Here, we analyse numerical metrics such as the numerical group velocity, numerical phase speed and the numerical amplification factor for different methods in solving the model bi-directional wave equation (BDWE). Such equations can be solved directly, for example, by Runge-Kutta-Nystrom (RKN) method. Alternatively, the governing equation can be converted to a set of first order in time equations and then using four-stage fourth order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method for time integration. Spatial discretisation considered are the classical second and fourth order central difference schemes, along with Lele's central compact scheme for evaluating second derivatives. In another version, we have used Lele's scheme for evaluating first derivatives twice to obtain the second derivative. As BDWE represents non-dissipative, non-dispersive dynamics, we also consider the canonical problem of linearised rotating shallow water equation (LRSWE) in a new formulation involving second order derivative in time, which represents dispersive waves along with a stationary mode. The computations of LRSWE with RK4 and RKN methods for temporal discretisation and Lele's compact schemes for spatial discretisation are compared with computations performed with RK4 method for time discretisation and staggered compact scheme (SCS) for spatial discretisation by treating it as a set of three equations as reported in Rajpoot et al.
