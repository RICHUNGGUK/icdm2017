In this paper, we present an algorithm based on correlation between error components in three directions, i.e. Delta x, Delta y, Delta z to decrease positioning error of a GPS receiver for kinematic applications. The main feature of proposed algorithm is that it modifies data at each instant and in, each direction using data of two other directions at the same instant (i.e. some sort, of online modification). This feature was acquired using an approach introduced to model state transition matrix using AR coefficients of two other directions. The algorithm was implemented on the output raw position data collected from a low cost GPS receiver. Experimental results showed a reduction of approximately 20% at every direction of the positioning errors.", "paper_title": "ERROR REDUCTION OF A LOW COST GPS RECEIVER FOR KINEMATIC APPLICATIONS BASED ON A NEW KALMAN FILTERING ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000281072400036"}
