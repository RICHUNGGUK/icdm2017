We first highlight several unique aspects of WSNs, and describe the basic design criteria and challenges of transport protocols, including energy-efficiency, quality of service, reliability, and congestion control. We then provide a summary and comparison of existing transport protocols for WSNs. Finally, we discuss several open research problems.", "paper_title": "A survey of transport Protocols for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237821700007"}
