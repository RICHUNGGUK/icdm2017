We consider both schedulability and energy consumption of individual components, while analyzing a single core setting with a voltage frequency scaling CPU. According to the CPU frequency scaling, each task has a set of different execution times. Thus, the energy consumption of the whole system varies from one execution to another. We analyze each component individually by checking the feasibility of its workload against both the CPU availability and energy consumption constraints of such a component. Our periodic task model considers both static and dynamic priorities together with preemptive and non-preemptive behaviors. The models are realized using different forms of Hybrid Automata, all of which are analyzed using variants of UPPAAL. The CPU frequencies, task behavior and scheduling policies used in each component are some of the reconfigurable parameters of the system. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability and scalability of our framework by analyzing the schedulability and power consumption of an avionics system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
