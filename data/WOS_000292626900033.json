Special mathematical techniques called algebra of functions complemented by differential geometrical tools are considered to solve the fault decoupling problem. Existing conditions are formulated and calculating relations are given for the control law in nonlinear and linear cases.", "paper_title": "FAULT ACCOMMODATION IN NONLINEAR AND LINEAR DYNAMIC SYSTEMS: FAULT DECOUPLING BASED APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000292626900033"}
