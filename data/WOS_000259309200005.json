Word segmentation is an essential step prior to natural language processing in the Myanmar language, because a Myanmar text is a string of characters without explicit word boundary delimiters. The proposed method has two phases: syllable segmentation and syllable merging. A rule-based heuristic approach was adopted for syllable segmentation, and a dictionary-based statistical approach for syllable merging. Evaluation of test results showed that the method is very effective for the Myanmar language.", "paper_title": "Word segmentation for the Myanmar language", "paper_id": "WOS:000259309200005"}
