We present a hybrid approach that combines integer and constraint programming using logic-based Benders decomposition. Computational experiments demonstrate that the Benders model is able to find and prove optimal solutions up to three orders-of-magnitude faster than an existing integer programming approach; it also finds better feasible solutions in less time when compared with an existing tabu search algorithm.", "paper_title": "Using Logic-Based Benders Decomposition to Solve the Capacity- and Distance-Constrained Plant Location Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000307207000005"}
