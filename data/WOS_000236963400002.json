The technique uses a single external resistor as a reference to implement multiple, different valued integrated resistors without requiring any accurate reference voltage. The algorithm provides a method to calibrate several on-chip resistors without replicating the calibration circuit, and it can achieve an arbitrary accuracy limited only by the external resistor's accuracy and mismatch errors. Terminations for two high speed wire line transceivers are implemented using the algorithm and simulations and measurements results show adequate performance across process, temperature, and supply voltage.", "paper_title": "A digital calibration algorithm for implementing accurate on-chip resistors", "paper_id": "WOS:000236963400002"}
