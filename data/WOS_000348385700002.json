They are equipped with resources/components to enable services for vehicle occupants, other vehicles on the road, and third-party recipients. In-vehicle sensors, communication modules, and on-board units with computing and storage capabilities allow the intelligent vehicle to work as a mobile service provider of sensing, data storage, computing, cloud, data relaying, infotainment, and localization services. In this article we introduce the concept of Vehicle as a Resource and shed light on the services a vehicle can potentially provide on the road or parked. We anticipate that an intelligent vehicle can be a significant service provider in a variety of situations, including emergency scenarios.", "paper_title": "Vehicle as a Resource (VaaR)", "paper_id": "WOS:000348385700002"}
