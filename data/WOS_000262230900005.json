The goal of this paper is to analyze the performance effects of different security features that may be represented as aspect models. This is part of a larger research effort to integrate methodologies and tools for the analysis of security and performance properties early in the software development process. In this paper, we describe an extension to the AOM approach that provides support for performance analysis. We use the performance analysis techniques developed previously in the PUMA project, which take as input UML models annotated with the standard UML Profile for Schedulability, Performance and Time (SPT), and transform them first into Core Scenario Model (CSM), and then into different performance models. The composition of the aspects with the primary (base) model is performed at the CSM level. A new formal definition of CSM properties and operations is described as a foundation for scenario-based weaving. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example that utilizes two standards, TPC-W and SSL. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
