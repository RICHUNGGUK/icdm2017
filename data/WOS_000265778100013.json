The types of scientific output distinguished are output resulting from international cooperation, national cooperation, and single address publications, in which no apparent cooperation is found. A fourth type is distinguished by focusing on first authorship, within the international cooperation output. Changes in especially the share of a country's output from first-authored international cooperation and the share of single address publications can be regarded as indicators of strength and/or weakness of a science system.", "paper_title": "Strength and weakness of national science systems: A bibliometric analysis through cooperation patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000265778100013"}
