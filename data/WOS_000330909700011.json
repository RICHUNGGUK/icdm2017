However, there are times when reaching agreement may be well within their grasp but it is not realized and the process ends with a loss of benefits for the negotiators. We use self-esteem theory to examine the influences that offers and comments have on this behavior when negotiators use an audio as opposed to instant messaging for communications. To help explain the moderating effects of these media, we use a theory on grounding. We find, for example, that when using instant messaging, the inability to reach agreement though negotiator offers are very close to each other is increased by initial offers containing relatively large concessions, by violations of reciprocity norms, and by critical comments.
