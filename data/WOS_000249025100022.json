Since two direct methods exist for defining conditional entropy based on its partition entropy, the inequality postulates of monotonicity, which conditional entropy satisfies, are actually additional constraints on its entropy. Thus, in this paper partition entropy is defined as a function of probability distribution, satisfying all the inequalities of not only partition entropy itself but also its conditional counterpart. These inequality postulates formalize the intuitive understandings of uncertainty contained in partitions of finite sets. We study the relationships between these inequalities, and reduce the redundancies among them. According to two different definitions of conditional entropy from its partition entropy, the convenient and unified checking conditions for any partition entropy are presented, respectively. These properties generalize and illuminate the common nature of all partition entropies.", "paper_title": "On defining partition entropy by inequalities", "paper_id": "WOS:000249025100022"}
