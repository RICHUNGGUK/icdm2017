The hierarchical clustering can represent a multi-level hierarchy which show the tree relation of cluster distance. SOM can adapt the winner node and its neighborhood nodes, it can learn topology and represent roughly equal distributive regions of the input space, and similar inputs are mapped to neighboring neurons. By calculating distances between neighboring units and Davies-Boulding clustering index, the cluster boundaries of SOM are decided by the best Davies-Boulding clustering index. The experimental results show the effectiveness of clustering for molecular data, between-cluster distance of low energy samples from transition networks is far bigger than that of \"local sampling\" samples, the former has a better cluster result, \"local sampling\" data nevertheless exhibit some clusters.", "paper_title": "Self-organizing map clustering analysis for molecular data", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000185"}
