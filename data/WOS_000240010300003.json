Transparency in IP handoffs, however, must be effected in two separate contexts: IP-addressing and (re-)connection latency. Excessive delays during an IP handoff degrades the seamlessness of IP transmission between the MN and its peers. Motivated by experimental results over heterogeneous wireless networks, we discuss why dynamic establishment of IP context-state can help address these limitations that seem inherent in heterogeneous environments. To this end, we provide an in-depth evaluation of Proactive Mobile IPv6 by means of simulations. Our study contrasts the efficiency of proactive context-state establishment, between candidate points of attachment (PoAs), against reactive MIPv6 standard practices over handoff delay, jitter and associated packet loss. Departing from reactive MIPv6 standards, this study brings new insights towards seamless handoffs by investigating the influential aspects of non-determinism in the mobility pattern of the MN. In addition, it demonstrates quantitatively the performance benefit attained by maximising MN's service utility through PoA selectivity embedded in MN IPv6 handoff decision.
