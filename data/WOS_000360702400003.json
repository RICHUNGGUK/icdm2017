His results gave a key step in the characterisation of generic global rigidity in the plane. We extend these results to frameworks on surfaces in . For a framework on a family of concentric cylinders, cones or ellipsoids, we show that there is a natural surface stress matrix arising from assigning edge and vertex weights to the framework, in equilibrium at each vertex. In the case of cylinders and ellipsoids, we show that having a maximum-rank stress matrix is sufficient to guarantee generic global rigidity on the surface. We then show that this sufficient condition for generic global rigidity is preserved under 1-extension and use this to make progress on the problem of characterising generic global rigidity on the cylinder.", "paper_title": "Stress Matrices and Global Rigidity of Frameworks on Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000360702400003"}
