The problem is motivated by surgery scheduling such that we regard the planned uniform available time interval in each day as a unit size bin and surgeries as items to be packed. Our focus is on the asymptotic performance of NF (Next Fit) and NF-based online algorithms. We show that the classical NF algorithm without use of the buffer has an asymptotic competitive ratio of . An NF-based algorithm which makes use of the buffer is further proposed, and proved to be asymptotic 13/9-competitive for any given buffer size not less than 1. We also present a lower bound of 4/3.", "paper_title": "NF-based algorithms for online bin packing with buffer and bounded item size", "paper_id": "WOS:000357045600010"}
