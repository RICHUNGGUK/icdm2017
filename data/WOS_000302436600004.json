Furthermore, if K is an a-rectifiable compact subset of Euclidean space (a an integer) with positive and finite a-dimensional Hausdorff measure, it is possible to generate such a quasi-uniform sequence of configurations that also has (as N -> infinity) a prescribed positive continuous limit distribution with respect to alpha-dimensional Hausdorff measure.
