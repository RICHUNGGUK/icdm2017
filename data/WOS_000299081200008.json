This problem is formally defined in three versions, which are shown to be polynomially equivalent. The one that looks most general, namely, f -MAX QUASIINDEPENDENT SET, consists of, given a graph and a non-decreasing function f, finding a maximum size subset Q of the vertices of the graph, such that the number of edges in the induced subgraph is less than or equal to f (|Q|). For this problem, we show an exact solution method that runs within time O*(2(d-27/23/d+1 n)) on graphs of average degree bounded by d. For the most specifically defined gamma-MAX QUASI-INDEPENDENT SET and k-MAX QUASI-INDEPENDENT SET problems, several results on complexity and approximation are shown, and greedy algorithms are proposed, analyzed and tested.", "paper_title": "The max quasi-independent set problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000299081200008"}
