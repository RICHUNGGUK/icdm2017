Protein structure prediction is a challenging international issue. In this paper, we propose a new intelligent prediction system model, designed as a multi-layer compound pyramid model, for predicting secondary protein structure. The model comprises four independent intelligent interfaces and several knowledge discovery methods. The model penetrates throughout the domain knowledge, with the effective attributes chosen by Causal Cellular Automata. Furthermore, a high pure structure database is constructed for training. On the RS126 dataset, the overall state per-residue accuracy, Q (3), reached 83.99%, while on the CB513 dataset, Q (3) reached 85.58%. Meanwhile, on the CASP8 sequences, the results are superior to those produced by other methods, such as Psipred, Jpred, APSSP2 and BehairPred. These results confirm that our method has a strong generalization ability, and that it provides a model for the construction of other intelligent systems.", "paper_title": "A new intelligent prediction system model-the compound pyramid model", "paper_id": "WOS:000300774900021"}
