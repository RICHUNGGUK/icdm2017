The sampling plan parameters such as the sample size and the acceptance constant are determined to minimize the average sample number. Symmetric and asymmetric cases, in percent defectives due to two specification limits, are dealt with for specified combinations of acceptable quality level and limiting quality level. Tables are provided and examples are given to use proposed plans in practice.", "paper_title": "Developing a variables repetitive group sampling plan based on process capability index C (pk) with unknown mean and variance", "paper_id": "WOS:000323145700009"}
