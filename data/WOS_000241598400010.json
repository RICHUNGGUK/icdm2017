In this paper we present a comparison of several face representation methods from the point of view of their sensibility to illumination changes. The sensibility is measured in term of the overlap of distribution of normalized correlations for inter class and intra class image comparison. We compared a combination of differentiated image in the frequency domain and the performance of Fourier parameters to obtain an illumination insensitive representation. The result suggests, that better illumination invariance could be achieve in feature spaces developed for a differentiated image rather than using the original input image.", "paper_title": "A comparative study of face representations in the frequency domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400010"}
