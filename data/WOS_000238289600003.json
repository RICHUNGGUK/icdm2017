Analytical properties of the resulting subdivision scheme, such as convergence, smoothness, and stability, are studied. The stability and the compression properties of the associated multiresolution transform are demonstrated on several numerical experiments on images.", "paper_title": "Analysis of a new nonlinear subdivision scheme.
