We want to find a set of k edges in G, so that if we place k monitors on those edges to measure the flow along them, the total number of edges for which the flow can be uniquely determined is maximized. In this paper, we first show that the Flow Edge-Monitor Problem is NP-hard. Then we study an algorithm called sigma-Greedy that, in each step, places monitors on sigma edges for which the number of edges where the flow is determined is maximized. We show that the approximation ratio of 1-Greedy is 3 and that the approximation ratio of 2-Greedy is 2.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for Placing Monitors in a Flow Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000329093300001"}
