However, their estimation is difficult because the likelihood function does not have a closed-form expression. A characteristic function-based estimation method for non-Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-based stochastic volatility models is proposed. Explicit expressions of the characteristic functions for various cases of interest are derived. The asymptotic properties of the estimators are analyzed and their small-sample performance is evaluated by means of a simulation experiment. Finally, two real-data applications show that the superposition of two Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes gives a good approximation to the dependence structure of the process. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
