This architecture mainly consists of sensor nodes deployed prior to a disaster and central nodes that can query sensor nodes. Central nodes are stored nearby the emergency operation centers and airports before a disaster. Following a disaster rescue teams are assigned one mobile central node and guided to a region based on the data in the SENDROM database. This paper explains the SENDROM architecture as well as our new task and data dissemination, localization of a detected person, and end-to-end reliable event transfer schemes introduced for SENDROM. Then it evaluates the performance of these schemes analytically and through simulation.", "paper_title": "SENDROM: Sensor networks for disaster relief operations management", "paper_id": "WOS:000246186400012"}
