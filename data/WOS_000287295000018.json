The unburnt version requires the pancakes to be sorted by their sizes at the end, while in the burnt version they additionally need to be oriented burnt-side down. We are interested in the largest value of the number of flips needed to sort a stack of n pancakes, both in the unburnt version (f (n)) and in the burnt version (g (n)). We present exact values of f (n) up to n = 19 and of g (n) up to n = 17 and disprove a conjecture of Cohen and Blum by showing that the burnt stack -I-15 is not the hardest to sort for n = 15. We also show that sorting a random stack of n unburnt pancakes can be done with at most 17n/12 + O(1) flips on average. The average number of flips of the optimal algorithm for sorting stacks of n burnt pancakes is shown to be between n + Omega(n/log n) and 7n/4 + O(1) and we conjecture that it is n + Theta(n/log n). Finally we show that sorting the stack -I-n needs at least left perpendicular(3n + 3)/2right perpendicular flips, which slightly increases the lower bound on g (n). This bound together with the upper bound for sorting -I-n found by Heydari and Sudborough in 1997 [10] gives the exact number of flips to sort it for n equivalent to 3(mod 4) and n >= 15.
