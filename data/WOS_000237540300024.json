In this paper, we propose an adaptive and scalable resource Ad/D technique for MANETs. Based on a variable zone size, it combines push-based Ad/D with a pull-based Ad/D that uses a modified bordercasting resolution protocol. The scheme avoids redundant flooding and reduces system overhead by piggybacking resource information on the routing-layer packet, and adapts locally to changing conditions, such as mobility and popularity levels, in a MANET. Simulation results verify that our scheme can track a changing network environment while reducing the resource Ad/D network overheads, thereby saving resources, decreasing latency and being scalable to large MANETs.", "paper_title": "An adaptive and scalable resource advertisement and discovery strategy for mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300024"}
