However, digitization increases the exposure of the media to digital dropout error, thus presenting a significant degradation in perceptual quality of the converted video sequences. A numbers of mechanisms were investigated in the past to make these converted media more robust against digital dropout errors. Nevertheless, these techniques achieved little success, forcing manual quality check to assure standard quality. This paper presents an automatic solution to this problem based on discriminant DCT coefficients. Here, the idea is to build a block classification model by learning discriminant DCT coefficients first and utilize these coefficients along with an weighted neighborhood sampling strategy to formulate discriminant block descriptor so that within-class difference of the block features is minimized and between-class difference is maximized. This spatial detection is free from motion computation; thus performs accurately in presence of pathological motion (PM) and fast moving objects. Finally, the proposed method is compared against the existing methods to demonstrate improved detection accuracy using real degraded video archives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
