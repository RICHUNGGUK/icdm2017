To get convenience in data transference among grid nodes, we propose an n-way relation-reduction algorithm that reduces the relation tuples before the execution of join operation. A new method is developed that can accurately estimate the cardinalities of the join results in each step. The experiments and analytical results depict the effectiveness of the proposed multiple join algorithm for minimizing the total amount of data transmission, parallel and efficient joining of the data to improve query responses in data grid.", "paper_title": "Multiple join processing in data grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000075"}
