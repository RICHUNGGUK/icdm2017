The BSIM-CMG (common-multigate) model is developed to simulate double-, triple-, and all-around-gate FinFETs and it is selected as the world's first industry-standard compact model for the FinFET. The BSIM-IMG (independent-multigate) model is developed for independent double-gate, ultrathin body (UTB) transistors, capturing the dynamic threshold voltage adjustment with back gate bias. Starting from long-channel devices, the basic models are first obtained using a Poisson-carrier transport approach. The basic models agree with the results of numerical two-dimensional device simulators. The real-device effects then augment the basic models. All the important real-device effects, such as short channel effects (SCEs), quantum mechanical confinement effects, mobility degradation, and parasitics are included in the models. BSIM-CMG and BSIM-IMG have been validated with hardware silicon-based data from multiple technologies. The developed models also meet the stringent quality assurance tests expected of production level models.", "paper_title": "BSIM - SPICE Models Enable FinFET and UTB IC Designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000209652700015"}
