These interfaces use synchronizer circuits, which guard against metastability failures but introduce latency in processing the asynchronous input. We propose a speculative method that hides synchronization latency by overlapping it with computation cycles. We verify the correctness of our approach through a field programmable gate array implementation and apply it to a number of synthesized benchmarks. Synthesis results reveal that our approach achieves average savings of 135% and 204% in area costs and nearly 100% in power costs compared to two similar speculative techniques.", "paper_title": "Eliminating Synchronization Latency Using Sequenced Latching", "paper_id": "WOS:000330216600020"}
