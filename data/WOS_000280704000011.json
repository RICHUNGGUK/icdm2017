The users are charged for the services provided, but are also promised that certain Quality-of-Service (QoS) criteria will be met. Failure to satisfy those QoS undertakings incurs pre-specified penalties. In order to maximize the revenue obtained, the service provider must employ intelligent dynamic policies dealing with server allocation and job admission decisions. A number of such policies are surveyed.", "paper_title": "Management of Server Farms for Performance and Profit", "paper_id": "WOS:000280704000011"}
