A framework for in silico unambiguous analysis of phylogenetic trees, based on information contained in tree's topology, together with its branches length, is proposed. The resulting, translated tree has all nodes labeled, with no constraints on nodes' degree, and the subsequent finding of evolutionary pathways from the QPF-translated tree is robust and straightforward. Main features of the method are: small demands on computational time, and the ability to analyze phylogenies obtained prior to the proposed QPF analysis by any traditional tree-building technique.
