It is a challenging problem to find the local co-location patterns. A novel method was presented to find local co-location patterns in an event sequence. The local co-location patterns were found by using an effective multi-layer index in a given time window (win) and local neighbor domain set. The experiment was done to prove algorithm effective and feasible.", "paper_title": "Research of local co-location pattern in spatial event sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000068"}
