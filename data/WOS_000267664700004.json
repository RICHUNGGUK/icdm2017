Requirements engineers involved in the design of such service systems must actively work together with interaction designers and service managers to better integrate customer service experience and technology components, requiring unifying methods and tools within the emerging field of service science management and engineering. This paper proposes the service experience blueprint (SEB), a multidisciplinary method for the design of technology enabled multi-channel service systems and illustrates its application in two examples of redesign of banking services that involved an extensive study with more than 4,000 bank customers. The SEB method is based on concepts and tools from RE and interaction design, such as goal-oriented analysis and conceptual modeling, but also uses methods developed in the service and marketing fields, such as service blueprinting. SEB brings marketing research methods to the requirements process, as they can provide a useful contribution for the elicitation of customer experience requirements in service environments. By bringing together goal-oriented modeling and use case modeling from requirements engineering, with service blueprinting from service design, the SEB method contributes to creating a shared understanding and a unifying language to better support the design of new technology enabled multi-channel service systems, where technology and service issues are deeply intertwined.", "paper_title": "Requirements engineering for multi-channel services: the SEB method and its application to a multi-channel bank", "paper_id": "WOS:000267664700004"}
