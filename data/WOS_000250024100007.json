Although c-learning environments are popular, there is minimal research on instructors' and learners' attitudes toward these kinds of learning environments. The purpose of this study is to explore instructors' and learners' attitudes toward e-learning usage. Accordingly, 30 instructors and 168 college students are asked to answer two different questionnaires for investigating their perceptions. After statistical analysis, the results demonstrate that instructors have very positive perceptions toward using e-learning as a teaching assisted tool. Furthermore, behavioral intention to use e-learning is influenced by perceived usefulness and self-efficacy. Regarding to learners' attitudes, self-paced, teacher-led, and multimedia instruction are major factors to affect learners' attitudes toward e-learning as an effective learning tool. Based on the findings.. this research proposes guidelines for developing e-learning environments. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
