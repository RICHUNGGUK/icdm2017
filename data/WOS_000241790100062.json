Several new sufficient conditions for the networks with delay converging towards a limit cycle with length at most 2 are obtained. Also, several conditions for the networks with delay converging towards a limit cycle with length 2 are investigated. All results established here extend the previous results on the convergence of both discrete Hopfield neural networks without delay and with delay in parallel updating mode.", "paper_title": "Convergence study of discrete neural networks with delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100062"}
