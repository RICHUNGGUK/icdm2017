The ability of robotic environmental perception and dexterous manipulation will be significantly improved after these tactile sequences are correctly classified. Therefore, tactile sequences are separated into series of subgroups, and a method based on linear dynamical system (LDS) is used to extract features. Since these LDSs lie in non-Euclidean space, the Martin distance, which is a measurement different from Euclidean distance, is applied to calculate the distance between two LDSs, and the K-Medoid algorithm is used for clustering. The codebook is obtained after clustering and is used to represent time sequences to get a Bag-of-System (BoS). Then the BoS and labels are sent to Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to train a classifier. Finally, three databases, KTH-7, KTH-10 and TSH-8 are used to evaluate our algorithm.", "paper_title": "Linear dynamic system method for tactile object classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000346238500014"}
