Molecular-level insights into how the osmolyte affects protein folding are of significance for the rational design of small molecular additives for enhancing or hindering the folding of proteins. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of the facilitation and inhibition effects of trehalose on protein folding, molecular dynamics (MD) Simulation of a beta-hairpin peptide (Trp-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Glu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Glu-Pro-Glu-Pro-Asp) in different trehalose concentrations (0-0.26 mol/L) is performed using an all-atom model. It is found that at a proper trehalose concentration (0.065 mol/L), the peptide folds faster than that in water, but it cannot fold to the beta-hairpin at higher trehalose concentrations. Free energy landscape analysis indicates the presence of three intermediate states in both pure water and in 0.065 mol/L trehalose, but the potential energy barriers in the folding pathway decrease greatly in 0.065 mol/L trehalose, so the peptide folding is facilitated. Moreover, at this trehalose concentration, there is a favorable balance between the peptide backbone hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and the peptide-trehalose H-bonds, leading to the stabilization of the folded peptide. At higher trehalose concentrations, however, trehalose molecules cluster in the peptide region and interact with the peptide via many H-bonds that prevent the peptide from folding to its native structure, The energy landscape analysis indicates that the potential energy barriers increase so greatly that the peptide cannot overcome it, getting trapped in a local free energy basin. The work reported herein has elucidated the molecular mechanism of the peptide folding in the presence of trehalose. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
