Our techniques are based on rebound attacks. We assume that the S-boxes have a good differential property and the linear transformation has an optimal branch number. Under this assumption, we firstly describe known-key distinguishers on the type-1, -2, and -3 generalized Feistel schemes up to 21, 13 and 8 rounds, respectively. Then, we use the distinguishers to make several attacks on hash functions where Merkle-Damgard domain extender is used and the compression function is constructed with Matyas-Meyer-Oseas or Miyaguchi-Preneel hash modes from generalized Feistel schemes. Collision attacks are made for 11 rounds of type-1 Feistel scheme. Near collision attacks are made for 13 rounds of type-1 Feistel scheme and 9 rounds of type-2 Feistel scheme. Half collision attacks are made for 15 rounds of type-1 Feistel scheme, 9 rounds of type-2 Feistel scheme, and 5 rounds of type-3 Feistel scheme.", "paper_title": "Known-Key Attacks on Generalized Feistel Schemes with SP Round Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000309043100014"}
