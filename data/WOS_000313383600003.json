In particular, the framework addresses combined (dependent) vector attacks and synchronization/localization issues. The framework identifies the cyber-physical features that must be protected according to the prevailing security policy. Also, the framework can be used for formal proofs of the security of cyber-physical systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
