This minimization problem is a very difficult one and solutions have been proposed only for up to seven variables. The processing time for some symmetric functions of seven variables is of the order of weeks. The proposed algorithm is a hybrid one (OpenMP, MPI) and a speed-up of more than nine could be achieved, for a cluster of three nodes with four cores each.", "paper_title": "A PARALLEL ALGORITHM FOR MINIMIZING ESOP EXPRESSIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000331282500015"}
