In techniques, time and frequency information is extracted by wavelet packet transform (WPT) and the node energy of the WPT coefficients is selected as the feature of the EMG signals. Then a novel feature selection method based on a depth recursive search algorithm is developed so that the high-dimensional features can be reduced by a supervised feature reduction algorithm. Consequently, the support vector machine (SVM) is adopted to give the recognition result. In the experiment, a real-time EMG pattern recognition system is developed to control a virtual hand with EMG signals from antebrachium. The experimental results show both the high accuracy and better real-time performance of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
