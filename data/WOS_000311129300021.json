It is shown that the Hopf bifurcation occurs as the bifurcation parameter, the mean delay, passes a critical value where a family of periodic solutions emanate from the equilibrium. By applying the frequency domain approach and analyzing the associated characteristic equation, the existence of the bifurcation critical point of the mean delay is determined. The direction and the stability of bifurcating periodic solutions are determined by the Nyquist criterion and the graphical Hopf bifurcation theorem. Numerical simulation results supporting the theoretical analysis are also given. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
