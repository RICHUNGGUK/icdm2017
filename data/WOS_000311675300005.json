Such problems arise in many applications in operations research and mathematical finance. We give sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions and the absence of a duality gap. Our proof uses extended dynamic programming equations, whose validity is established under new relaxed conditions that generalize certain no-arbitrage conditions from mathematical finance.", "paper_title": "Stochastic programs without duality gaps", "paper_id": "WOS:000311675300005"}
