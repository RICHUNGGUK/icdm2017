Both operating rooms and places in the recovery room are assumed to be multifunctional, and the objectives are to maximise the utilisation of the operating rooms, to minimise the overtime cost in the operating theatre, and to minimise the unexpected idle time between surgical cases. This weekly operating theatre planning and scheduling problem is solved in two phases. First, the planning problem is solved to give the date of surgery for each patient, allowing for the availability of operating rooms and surgeons. Then a daily scheduling problem is devised to determine the sequence of operations in each operating room in each day. taking into account the availability of recovery beds. The planning problem is described as a set-partitioning integer-programming model and is solved by a column-generation-based heuristic (CGBH) procedure. The daily scheduling problem, based on the results obtained in the planning phase, is treated as a two-stage hybrid flow-shop problem and solved by a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA). Our results are compared with several actual surgery schedules in a Belgian university hospital, where time blocks have been assigned to either specific Surgeons or specialities several months in advance. According to the comparison results. surgery schedules obtained by the proposed method have less idle time between surgical cases, much higher utilisation of operating rooms and produce less overtime.
