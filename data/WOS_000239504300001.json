This type of representation involves two types of uncertainty called conflict (or randomness) and non-specificity, respectively. The imprecise Dirichlet model (IDM) allows us to carry out inference about the probability distribution of a categorical variable obtaining a set of a special type of credal set (probability intervals). In this paper, we shall present tools for obtaining the uncertainty functions on probability intervals obtained with the IDM, which can enable these functions in any application of this model to be calculated.", "paper_title": "Uncertainty measures on probability intervals from the imprecise Dirichlet model", "paper_id": "WOS:000239504300001"}
