Given the importance of this activity in medicinal chemistry it is of interest to develop a theoretical method for its prediction. The selection of the descriptors from a pool containing more than a thousand geometrical, topological, quantum-mechanical and electronic types of descriptors was performed using a new advanced version of the Enhanced Replacement Method (ERM). The best QSAR linear model was constructed using 52 molecular structures not previously used in this type of quantitative structure-property study, and showed good predictive attributes. The model analysis suggested that the activity depends on the atomic van der Waals volumes and on the atomic electronegativity: and that the conformation of the molecule does not present a relevant role in the activity.
