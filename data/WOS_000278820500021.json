The mathematical model used in this work is the generalized system of Navier Stokes equations. The right hand side of this system is defined by the power-law model. The finite volume method combined with artificial compressibility method is used for numerical simulations of generalized Newtonian fluids flow. Numerical solution is divided into two parts. steady state and unsteady. Steady state solution is achieved for t -> infinity using steady boundary conditions and followed by steady residual behaviour. For unsteady solution high artificial compressibility coefficient beta(2) is considered. An artificial compressibility method with a pulsation of the pressure in the outlet boundary is used.
