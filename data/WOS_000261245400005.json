Maker and Breaker take turns ill choosing previously unoccupied edges of the complete graph K-N. Maker's aim is to claim a copy of a given target graph G while Breaker's aim is to prevent Maker from doing so. In this paper we show that if G is a d-degenerate graph on n vertices and N > d(11)2(2d+9) n, then Maker can claim a copy of G in at most d(11)2(2d+7) n rounds. We also discuss a lower bound on the number of rounds Milker needs to win, and the gap between these bounds.", "paper_title": "Winning Fast in Sparse Graph Construction Games", "paper_id": "WOS:000261245400005"}
