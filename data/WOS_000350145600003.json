Our approach is based on a hybrid method that combines a repulsion force approach with a continuous intersection handling to guarantee that no penetration occurs. Moreover, boundary conditions for the tangential component of the fluid's velocity are implemented to model the different slip conditions. The proposed method is particularly useful for dynamic surfaces, like cloth and thin shells. In addition, we demonstrate how standard fluid surface reconstruction algorithms can be modified to prevent the calculated surface from intersecting close objects. For both the two-way coupling and the surface reconstruction, we take into account that the fluid can wet the cloth. We have implemented our approach for the bidirectional interaction between liquid simulations based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and standard mesh-based cloth simulation systems.", "paper_title": "Boundary Handling at Cloth-Fluid Contact", "paper_id": "WOS:000350145600003"}
