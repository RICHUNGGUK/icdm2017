However, various researches are studied in traditional databases that impose strict restrictions, and relatively little work has been carried out in modeling and operating fuzzy spatiotemporal data in XML. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model fuzzy spatiotemporal data based on XML. On the basis of the model, we investigate how to represent fuzzy spatiotemporal data in XML documents and extend the XML schema so that it is possible to describe fuzzy spatiotemporal data and capture the structural information of fuzzy spatiotemporal XML documents. Furthermore, we give algorithms for fuzzy operations, containing node operations and topological relationship operations. Finally, we apply our model in meteorological events.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Spatiotemporal Data Modeling and Operations in XML", "paper_id": "WOS:000352306300004"}
