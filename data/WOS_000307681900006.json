Most of these models are based on the classical Newton's method with second-order convergence, whose iterative convergence speed is slow for large-scale realtime applications. An improved parameter re-estimation algorithm is introduced for such parametric hidden semi-Markov model in this paper. The proposed approach is based on forward and backward algorithm. It applies an iterative method with eighth-order convergence to improve the performance of the model. The numerical examples validate the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
