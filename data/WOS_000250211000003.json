We take advantage of both skeleton-based and example-based approaches in order to provide an intuitive way for artists to edit mesh poses. Our system automatically extracts the skeletons of the remaining example models once the skeleton of a reference mesh is constructed. In our editing system the desired skeleton can be easily and naturally posed using an inverse kinematics (IK) algorithm incorporated with searching the optimal weights in the defined skeleton space of examples meshes. Eventually, the desired shape with detailed deformation can be constructed by blending the example meshes. Experimental results show that the proposed system provides an easy and intuitive control on mesh pose-editing.
