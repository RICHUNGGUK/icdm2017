As cutting proceeds arbitrarily, it results in many possible cases of topological changes that make the design of generic cutting algorithms a tedious bookkeeping task. This paper presents an interactive cutting simulation approach based on mass-spring system. By the analogy of digital design, a systematic method is proposed to trace and manage the topology changes during interactive cutting. The dynamics of deformable objects and the cutting-induced deformation are simulated by the force propagation among the mass-points. In the meantime. adaptive mesh refinements by three processes-redistribution, remeshing and relaxation-are carried out in the process of interactive topology modification. The proposed method is scalable by controlling the extent of localized simulation. It is suitable for cutting simulation in virtual Surgery and applications involving the Cutting of soft deformable objects. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
