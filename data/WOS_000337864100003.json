Subject to certain conditions, we associate to each of these problems an intrinsic system degree which becomes in worst case of order (n d)(O(n)) and which measures the intrinsic complexity of the task under consideration. We design non-uniform deterministic or uniform probabilistic algorithms of intrinsic, quasi-polynomial complexity which solve these problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
