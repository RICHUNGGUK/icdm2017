Parameter-dependent Lypaunov functionals are employed to obtain sufficient conditions that guarantee the robust global exponential stability of the equilibrium point of the considered neural network. The derived stability criteria are expressed in terms of a set of relaxed linear matrix inequalities, which can be easily tested by using commercially available software. Two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Relaxed stability conditions for delayed recurrent neural networks with polytopic uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000243806000008"}
