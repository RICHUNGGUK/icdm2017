The method relies on a nonlinear space reduction technique for constructing semantic embeddings of multilingual document collections. In the proposed method, an independent embedding is constructed for each language in the multilingual collection and the similarities among the resulting semantic representations are used for cross-language document retrieval. Two variants of the proposed method are implemented and compared with a standard cross-language information retrieval technique. It is shown that the proposed method outperforms the conventional one.", "paper_title": "CROSS-LANGUAGE DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL BY USING NONLINEAR SEMANTIC MAPPING", "paper_id": "WOS:000325512300002"}
