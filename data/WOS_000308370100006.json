In addition to pinpointing the complexity of left-r.e. Martin-Lof, computably, Schnorr, and Kurtz random sets, weakly 1-generics and their complementary classes, we find that there exist characterizations of the third and fourth levels of the arithmetic hierarchy purely in terms of these notions. More generally, there exists an equivalence between arithmetic complexity and existence of numberings for classes of left-r.e. sets with shift-persistent elements. While some classes (such as Martin-Lof randoms and Kurtz nonrandoms) have left-r.e. numberings, there is no canonical, or acceptable, left-r.e. numbering for any class of left-r.e. randoms. Finally, we note some fundamental differences between left-r.e. numberings for sets and reals.", "paper_title": "Arithmetic Complexity via Effective Names for Random Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000308370100006"}
