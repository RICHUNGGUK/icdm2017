The objective is to determine a schedule that minimizes the makespan. We present an adaptation of the Climbing Depth-bounded Discrepancy Search (CDDS) method based on Johnson's rule and on dedicated lower bounds for the two-stage hybrid flow shop problem. We report the results of extensive computational experiments, which show that the proposed adaptation of the CDDS method solves instances in restrained CPU time and with high quality of makespan.
