Since DNA microarray experiments provide us with huge amount of gene expression data and only a few of genes are related to tumor, gene selection algorithms should be emphatically explored to extract those informative genes related tumor from gene expression data. So we propose a novel feature selection approach to further improve the SVM-based classification performance of gene expression data, which projects high dimensional data onto lower dimensional feature space. We examine a set of gene expression data that include sets of tumor and normal clinical samples by means of SVMs classifier. Experiments show that SVM has a superior performance in classification of gene expression data as long as the selected features can represent the principal components of all gene expression samples.", "paper_title": "SVM-based tumor classification with gene expression data", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200094"}
