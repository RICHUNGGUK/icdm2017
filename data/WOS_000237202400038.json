Having obtained the connected objects according to the selected connectivity pattern, the gravity centers are calculated in several larger objects as the reference points for watermark embedding. Based on these reference points and the center of the whole image, several sectors are formed, and the same version watermarks are embedded into these sectors. Thanks to the very stable gravity center of the connected objects, watermark detection is synchronized successfully. Simulation results show that our scheme can survive under both local and global geometrical distortions.", "paper_title": "Connectivity-based image watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000237202400038"}
