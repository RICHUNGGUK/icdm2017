A lower bound is derived based on source entropy maximization over a family of discrete nonuniform distributions with equally spaced mass points. A closed form for the maxentropic discrete input distribution is provided. Compared to previously reported bounds, the derived lower bound is tight at both low and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In addition, a closed-form upper bound is derived based on signal space geometry via a sphere packing argument. The proposed bound is tight at low SNRs and incurs a small gap to the channel capacity at high SNRs. The derived bounds asymptotically describe the optical intensity channel capacity at low SNRs, where a majority of such links operate.", "paper_title": "Capacity Bounds for Wireless Optical Intensity Channels With Gaussian Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000284419900013"}
