The multihop communication offers increased coverage for such services but also makes them more vulnerable to insider (or Byzantine) attacks coming from compromised nodes that behave arbitrarily to disrupt the network. In this work, we identify vulnerabilities of on-demand multicast routing protocols for multihop wireless networks and discuss the challenges encountered in designing mechanisms to defend against them. We propose BSMR, a novel secure multicast routing protocol designed to withstand insider attacks from colluding adversaries. Our protocol is a software-based solution and does not require additional or specialized hardware. We present simulation results that demonstrate that BSMR effectively mitigates the identified attacks.", "paper_title": "BSMR: Byzantine-Resilient Secure Multicast Routing in Multihop Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000263395700002"}
