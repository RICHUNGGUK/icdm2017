The present work is an extension of the 3D-NSCBC method proposed by Yoo et al. and Lodato et al. in order to account for multi-component reactive flows with detailed chemistry and complex transport. A new approach is proposed for the outflow boundary conditions which enables clean exit of non-normal flows, and the specific treatment of all kinds of edges and corners is carefully addressed. The proposed methodology is successfully validated on various challenging multi-component reactive flow configurations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
