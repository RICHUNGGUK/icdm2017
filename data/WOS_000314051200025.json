Five-fold twinned structure has been found in the final configuration of the nanoparticle. Furthermore, detailed formation process has been visualized and carefully discussed. During the formation of five-fold twinned structure, two main stages have been identified, including i) liquid-solid phase transition at solidification point, in which the main part of the five-fold twinned structure formed, and ii) structural relaxation, in which twinning boundaries and five-fold axis were transformed to eliminate the dislocation between two adjacent five-fold twins.", "paper_title": "Structural evolution of five-fold twins during the solidification of Fe-5601 nanoparticle: a molecular dynamics simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000314051200025"}
