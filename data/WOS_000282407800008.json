In the present work, a concept model population analysis (MPA) is developed. Briefly, MPA could be considered as a general framework for developing new methods by statistically analyzing some interesting parameters (regression coefficients, prediction errors, etc.) of a number of sub-models. New methods are expected to be developed by making full use of the interesting parameter in a novel manner. In this work, the elements of MPA are first considered and described. Then, the applications for variable selection and model assessment are emphasized with the help of MPA.
