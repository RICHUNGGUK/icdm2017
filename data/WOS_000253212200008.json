The method is applicable in any workspace dimension and is not restricted in the number and configuration of the locations where the random field is simulated; in particular, it does not require these locations to be regularly spaced. On the basis of the central limit and Berry-Esseen theorems, an upper bound is derived for the Kolmogorov distance between the distributions of generalized increments of the simulated random fields and the normal distribution.", "paper_title": "A spectral approach to simulating intrinsic random fields with power and spline generalized covariances", "paper_id": "WOS:000253212200008"}
