The approach allows us to enlarge the family of refinements (i.e. specification morphisms)of the category Spec - the category of first order theories (specifications) of multi-sorted algebras. We prove that the class of specification morphisms in the category Spec can be enriched by the class of all interpretations of theories from Spec in all definitional extensions of theories of multi-sorted algebras. It provides a guide for finding a path leading from a given specification to a specification which is a provably correct code in a programming language (like C + +, Lisp, Java).", "paper_title": "Category localization semantics for specification refinements", "paper_id": "WOS:000248606400015"}
