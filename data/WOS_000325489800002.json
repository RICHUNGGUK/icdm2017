Many localization approaches have been proposed based on anchor nodes, which are assumed to know their locations by manual placement or additional equipments such as global positioning system. However, none of these approaches can work properly under the adversarial scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme called two-step secure localization (TSSL) stand against many typical malicious attacks, e.g. wormhole attack and location spoofing attack. TSSL detects malicious nodes step by step. First, anchor nodes collaborate with each other to identify suspicious nodes by checking their coordinates, identities and time of sending information. Then, by using a modified mesh generation scheme, malicious nodes are isolated and the WSN is divided into areas with different trust grades. Finally, a novel localization algorithm based on the arrival time difference of localization information is adopted to calculate locations of unknown nodes. Simulation results show that the TSSL detects malicious nodes effectively and the localization algorithm accomplishes localization with high localization accuracy.", "paper_title": "A Two-Step Secure Localization for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000325489800002"}
