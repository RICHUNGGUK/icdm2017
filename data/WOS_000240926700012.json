The effect of variations in device parameters on the leakage components is also analyzed. U sing the developed models, digital circuits (logic gates and static random access memory cells) designed with different DG structures are also analyzed. The analysis shows that the use of (near mid-gap) metal gate and intrinsic body devices significantly reduces both the total leakage and its sensitivity to parametric variations in DG devices and circuits.", "paper_title": "Modeling and analysis of leakage currents in double-gate technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000240926700012"}
