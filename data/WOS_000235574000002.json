Both flavours of systems are related by an erasure function vertical bar.vertical bar that removes types from A-abstractions. Preservation of Equational Theory, which states the equational theories of both systems coincide through the erasure function, is a property of functional and normalizing PTSs. In this paper we establish that Preservation of Equational Theory fails for some non-normalizing PTSs, including the PTS with * : *. The gist of our argument is to exhibit a typable expression Y-H whose erasure vertical bar Y vertical bar is a fixpoint combinator, but which is not a fixpoint combinator itself.", "paper_title": "Remarks on the equational theory of non-normalizing pure type systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235574000002"}
