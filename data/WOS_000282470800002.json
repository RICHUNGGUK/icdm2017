The device can be used as a micro-scale force sensor or actuator using a feedback control scheme that regulates the interaction force between the probe tip and the sample. The mechanism is essentially a force balancing system consisting of a torsion bar and two variable gap parallel plate capacitors with a sharp probe attached to the moving plate of one of the capacitors. The capacitors are utilized to measure the air gap distance and act as electrostatic actuators to compensate the force applied to the sensor tip. Given that the system is nonlinear with respect to the control input, a nonlinear feedback linearization scheme coupled with a dynamic output feedback controller is developed and integrated with available measurement and computing hardware. The dynamic controller requires measurement of position information only and provides improved performance when compared to conventional controllers. Experimental studies are conducted for nanoindentation and imaging applications and performance of the controller is evaluated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
