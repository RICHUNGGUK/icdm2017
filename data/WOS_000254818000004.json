The concept of creation of 3D form profiles by simply projecting a set of 2D drawing on a physical model is utilised for generating 3D constraints and converting a single perspective image of the physical model captured by a web camera to a CAD surface model. This method has been implemented and tested in our prototype design desktop system. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
