However, most of the existing methods take a single type of features to build binary classifiers. In practice, these methods have limited ability in depicting malware characteristics and the binary classification suffers from inadequate sampling of benign samples and extremely imbalanced training samples when detecting malware. In this paper, we present a malware detection Framework based on ENsemble One-Class Learning, namely FENOC. It uses hybrid features at different semantic layers to ensure a comprehensive insight of the program to be analyzed. We construct the malware detector by a novel learning algorithm called Cost-sensitive Twin One-class Classifier (CosTOC), which uses a pair of one-class classifiers to describe malware and benign programs respectively. CosTOC is more flexible and robust in comparison to conventional binary classifiers when training samples are extremely imbalanced or the benign programs are inadequately sampled. Finally, random subspace method and clustering-based ensemble method are developed to enhance the generalization ability of CosTOC. Experimental results show that FENOC gives a comparative detection rate and a lower false positive rate than many other binary classiffication algorithms, especially when the detector are trained with imbalanced data, or evaluated in terms of false positive rate.", "paper_title": "An Ensemble Cost-Sensitive One-Class Learning Framework for Malware Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000357830200001"}
