All receivers overhear the same transmissions. Each receiver may already have some of the packets as side information, and requests another subset of the packets. This problem is known as the index coding problem and can be represented by a bipartite digraph. An integer linear program is developed that provides a lower bound on the minimum number of transmissions required for any coding algorithm. Conversely, its linear programming relaxation is shown to provide an upper bound that is achievable by a simple form of vector linear coding. Thus, the information theoretic optimum is bounded by the integrality gap between the integer program and its linear relaxation. In the special case, when the digraph has a planar structure, the integrality gap is shown to be zero, so that exact optimality is achieved. Finally, for nonplanar problems, an enhanced integer program is constructed that provides a smaller integrality gap. The dual of this problem corresponds to a more sophisticated partial clique coding strategy that time-shares between maximum distance separable codes. This paper illuminates the relationship between index coding, duality, and integrality gaps between integer programs and their linear relaxations.", "paper_title": "Duality Codes and the Integrality Gap Bound for Index Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000344524100036"}
