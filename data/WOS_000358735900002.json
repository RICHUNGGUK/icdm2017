In particular, the paper delineates exactly when and how a structurally persistent net may be constructed, by crystallising, out of a general region-theoretic approach, a minimised set of simplified systems of linear inequalities. This extends previous results where reversibility, instead of liveness, played an important role.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of Live and Bounded Persistent Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000358735900002"}
