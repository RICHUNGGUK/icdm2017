In this paper, an adaptive amoeba algorithm is combined with the Lagrangian relaxation algorithm to solve the CSP problem. The proposed method is divided into two steps: (1) the adaptive amoeba algorithm is modified to solve the shortest path problem (SPP) in a directed network; (2) the modified adaptive amoeba algorithm is combined with the Lagrangian relaxation method to solve the CSP problem. In addition, the evolving processes of the adaptive amoeba model have been detailed in the paper. Two examples are used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can deal with the CSP problem effectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
