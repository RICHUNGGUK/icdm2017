On the one hand, this leads to a robust classifier where efficient learning with fuzzy labeled or partially contradictory data is possible. On the other hand, the integration of labeling into the location of prototypes in a SOM leads to a visualization of those parts of the data relevant for the classification.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy labeled self-organizing map with label-adjusted prototypes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241011900005"}
