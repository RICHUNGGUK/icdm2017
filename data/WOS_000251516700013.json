We show that a language L subset of (0 + 1)* is regular if and only if 1L (i. e., with a supplementary prefix of 1) is generated by a bounded SN P system. This result does not hold when the prefix is replaced by a suffix. For example, 0* 1 cannot be generated by a bounded SN P system.", "paper_title": "Characterizing regular languages by spiking neural P systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000251516700013"}
