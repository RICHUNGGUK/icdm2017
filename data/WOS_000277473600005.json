These can be interpreted as correlation inequalities at those points where the polynomial is known to count the number of independent sets, bases or spanning sets of the matroid. Our proofs also introduce an idea of rank dominating bijections in matroids, which are then used to obtain some simple extensions of the submodular property of matroid ranks.", "paper_title": "Some Inequalities for Whitney-Tutte Polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000277473600005"}
