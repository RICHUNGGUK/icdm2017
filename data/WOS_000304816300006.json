By exploiting the highly parallel nature of the problem and making efficient use of the available hardware, our simulator exhibits a significant speedup over its CPU-based analog. We apply our framework to a specific experimental simulation: the computation of trapping probabilities associated with micron-sized silica beads in optical trapping workbenches. When evaluating large numbers of trajectories (4096), we see approximately a 356 times speedup of the GPU-based simulator over its CPU-based counterpart.
