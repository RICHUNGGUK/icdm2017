Their work is motivated by the fact that the orthogonality constraints in the singular value decomposition (SVD) make the low-rank singular vectors of audio with distinct local difference be the same. Thus, the available hash function based on SVD of MFCCs cannot achieve satisfactory discrimination. Although the non-negative constraints of NMF result in the basis that captures the local feature of the audio, thereby significantly reducing misclassification. Experimental results over large audio databases demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves better performances, in terms of perceptual robustness and discrimination, than the available SVD-MFCCs-based hash function.", "paper_title": "Audio hash function based on non-negative matrix factorisation of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients", "paper_id": "WOS:000295122600003"}
