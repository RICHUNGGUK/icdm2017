However, research demonstrates while RTS/CST mechanism can only partly overcome hidden node problem, and performance of the network throughput decreases as well. This study aimed at the performance of basic access mechanism and virtual carrier sensing mechanism in different wireless environments. Effect of various parameters on transmission performance of IEEE 802.11 protocol is evaluated. Nimerical results reveal that RTS/CTS mechanism can only achieve significant performance improvement in multi-rate wireless environments.", "paper_title": "Is RTS/CTS Mechanism Effective for WLANs?", "paper_id": "WOS:000285732400008"}
