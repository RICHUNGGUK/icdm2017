It enables to estimate the power usage of a machine under any load at runtime. By clustering applications we extract groups of programs having similar characteristics. This allows us to create more specialized and accurate power usage models. By using decision trees it is possible to automatically select an appropriate model to current system load. Training and test sets of programs were used to test the estimates. The presented models are accurate within an error of 4% as verified on servers from different vendors, including the latest pre-production one. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
