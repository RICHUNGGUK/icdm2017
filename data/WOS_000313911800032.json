The write bandwidth is severely restricted in PCM devices, which harms application performance. Indeed, as we show, it is more important to reduce PCM write traffic than to reduce PCM read latency for application performance. To reduce the number of PCM writes, we propose a DRAM cache organization that employs compression. A new delta compression technique for modified data is used to achieve a large compression ratio. Our approach can selectively and predictively apply compression to improve its efficiency and performance. Our approach is designed to facilitate adoption in existing main memory compression frameworks. We describe an instance of how to incorporate delta compression in IBM's MXT memory compression architecture when used for DRAM cache in a hybrid main memory. For fourteen representative memory-intensive workloads, on average, our delta compression technique reduces the number of PCM writes by 54.3%, and improves IPC performance by 24.4%.", "paper_title": "Delta-Compressed Caching for Overcoming the Write Bandwidth Limitation of Hybrid Main Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000313911800032"}
