This construction gives a new class of quaternary LCZ sequence sets. Furthermore, we observe a generalization of the LCZ sequence sets in Kim et al.

The obtained LCZ sequence sets are optimal with respect to the Tang, Fan and Matsufuji bound.", "paper_title": "A new class of quaternary LCZ sequence sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000299330400006"}
