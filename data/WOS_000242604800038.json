The derived quality test functions are enhanced in three different ways to derive better quality test sets. One enhancement restricts fault sensitization along critical subcircuits whose paths have long delays under a fixed-delay model. Another manipulates the functions to generate compact test sets. The last one enriches the test set with additional test vectors so that transition faults are tested through several activation and propagation paths without path enumeration. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of deriving such enhanced test functions.", "paper_title": "Functions for quality transition-fault tests and their applications in test-set enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000242604800038"}
