We can hide up to three full-size embedded images inside a cover image while maintaining the quality of the composite image. The embedded images retain easily recognizable when extracted. The embedded images can be extracted fairly completely even when lossy compression or cropping is applied to the composite image. The proposed method does not require the original cover image to extract the embedded image.", "paper_title": "A robust image hiding method using wavelet technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000234908900009"}
