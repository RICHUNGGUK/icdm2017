Potential lowest energy conformations were determined in vacuo by systematically varying the torsional angles of the Tyr(1)-Pro(2) (omega(1)) and Pro(2)-Trp(3)/Phe(3) (omega(2)) as tuning parameters in AM1 calculations. These initial models were then exposed to aqueous conditions via molecular dynamics simulations. In aqueous solution, the simulations suggest that endomorphin conformers strongly favor the trans/trans pair of the omega(1)/omega(2) amide bonds. From two-dimensional probability distributions of the ring-to-ring distances with respect to the pharmacophoric angles for EMs, a selectivity range of mu(1) is ca. 8.3 similar to 10.5 for endomorphin-2 and selectivity range of mu(2) is ca. 10.5 similar to 13.0 for endomorphin-1 were determined. Four-component mu-pharmacophore models are proposed for EMs and are compared to the previously published delta- and kappa-pharmacophore models.", "paper_title": "Four-component pharmacophore model for endomorphins toward mu opioid receptor subtypes", "paper_id": "WOS:000299769700039"}
