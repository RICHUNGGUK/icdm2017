United with two symmetrical transfer elevators, double-warehouse consists of two parallel warehouses. Within each warehouse, the polynomial based paths are subject to constraints such as motion boundaries, kinematics constraints, obstacle-avoidance, limited resource of elevators and smoothness. We formulate the shortest path planning problems as one time-varying nonlinear programming problem (TNLPP) while restricted to the above constraints, and apply the multi-phase strategy to reduce their difficulty. We present the new variant algorithms of PSO named constriction factor and random perturb PSO (Con-Per-PSO) and the simulating annealing PSO (SA-PSO) to achieve the solution. Numerical simulations verify that, our approach can fulfill multiple mobile robots path planning problems under double-warehouse successfully. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
