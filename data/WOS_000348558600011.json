The incidence rate of the infection is given by Crowley-Martin functional response. Two types of distributed time delays have been incorporated into the model to describe the time needed for infection of uninfected cell and virus replication. Using the method of Lyapunov functional, we have established that the global stability of the model is completely determined by two threshold numbers, the basic reproduction number R-0 and the humoral immunity reproduction number R-1. We have proven that if R-0 <= 1 then the uninfected steady state is globally asymptotically stable (GAS), if R-1 <= 1 < R-0, then the infected steady state without immune response is GAS, and if R-1 > 1, then the infected steady state with humoral immunity is GAS.", "paper_title": "Mathematical analysis of a humoral immunity virus infection model with Crowley-Martin functional response and distributed delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000348558600011"}
