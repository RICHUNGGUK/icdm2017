This paper aims to investigate the analysis of free-textual clinical medical diagnosis documents with ICD-9 codes using state-of-the-art techniques from text and visual mining fields. In this paper, ViSOM and SOM approaches inspire several analyses of clinical diagnosis records with ICD-9 codes. ViSOM and SOM are also used to obtain interesting patterns that have not been discovered with traditional, nonvisual approaches. Furthermore, we addressed three principles that can be used to help clinical doctors analyze diagnosis records effectively using the ViSOM and SOM approaches. The experiments were conducted using real diagnosis rccords and show that ViSOM and SOM are helpful for organizational decision-making activities.", "paper_title": "USING TEXT AND VISUAL MINING TO ANALYZE CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS RECORDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000311976300004"}
