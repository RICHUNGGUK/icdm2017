These are also the goals of product lines (a family of related programs) and metaprogramming (programming as computation). We show that the confluence of MDE, product lines, and metaprogramming exposes a multilevel paradigm of program development, and further, we can use object-oriented design techniques to represent programs, the metaprograms that produced these programs, and the meta-metaprograms that produced these metaprograms, recursively. The paradigm is based on a small number of simple and well-known ideas, scales to the synthesis of applications of substantial size, and helps clarify concepts of MDE.", "paper_title": "Multilevel models in model-driven engineering, product lines, and metaprogramming", "paper_id": "WOS:000240030400008"}
