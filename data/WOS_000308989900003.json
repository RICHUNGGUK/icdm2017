The instruments were lent to three electronic musicians/composers for a duration of four weeks. Free exploration periods and a compositional task evaluated using semi-structured show and tell sessions revealed that the context of use had a major influence on how the instruments were experienced by the test persons. Central issues revolved around the learning/adoption process, and around the importance of playability, explorability, and connectivity.", "paper_title": "Longitudinal Evaluation of the Integration of Digital Musical Instruments into Existing Compositional Work Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000308989900003"}
