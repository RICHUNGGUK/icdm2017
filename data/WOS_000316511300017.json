First, structure and motion variables of the robot are addressed. Two operational modes, non-pure translational and coupled mixed-type are considered. Two inverse kinematics solutions, an analytical and a numerical, for the two operational modes are presented. The direct kinematics of the robot is also solved utilizing a new geometrical approach. It is shown, unlike most parallel robots, the direct kinematics problem of this robot has a unique solution. Next, analytical expressions for the velocity and acceleration relations are derived in invariant form. Auxiliary vectors are introduced to eliminate passive velocity and acceleration vectors. The three types of conventional singularities are analyzed. The notion of non-pure rotational and non-pure translational Jacobian matrices is introduced. The non-pure rotational and non-pure translational Jacobian matrices are combined to form the Jacobian of constraint matrix which is then used to obtain the constraint singularity. Finally, two methods, a discretization method and one based on direct kinematics are presented and robot non-pure translation and coupled mixed-type reachable workspaces are obtained. The influence of tool length on workspace is also studied. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
