The calculations were performed for a second-order correlation function and noise reduction factor (NRF), which were selected as measures of non-classicality of the field states. NRF measurement schemes were found to be less advantageous. Overall system temperature at which non-classical effects are still observable has been estimated as about 10 K. The priority of the main complicating factors for the quantum-optical measurements in the terahertz range has been determined. Thus, the most important parameter is the temperature of the system, after that come the absorption losses at terahertz frequencies, and the parametric conversion efficiency has the lowest impact. Increasing the pump radiation power has been found to be inefficient for \"noise\" suppression in this case. The calculations performed were based on lithium niobate dispersion properties due to its outstanding nonlinear optical properties and because it is frequently used for optical-to-terahertz frequency conversion.", "paper_title": "Generation of optical-terahertz biphoton pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion", "paper_id": "WOS:000351136900024"}
