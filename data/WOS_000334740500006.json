LISP improves a network's scalability, flexibility, and traffic engineering, enabling mobility with limited overhead. As for any new technology, implementation and deployment are essential to gather and master the real benefits that it provides. In this article, we present the first complete open source implementation of the LISP control plane. Our implementation is deployed in the worldwide LISP Beta Network and the French LISP-Lab testbed, and includes the key standardized control plane features. Our control plane software is the companion of the existing OpenLISP data-plane implementation, allowing the deployment of a fully functional open source LISP network compatible with any implementation respecting the standards.", "paper_title": "The OpenLISP Control Plane Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000334740500006"}
