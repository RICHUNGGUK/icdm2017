The decoding performance and noise behavior of three front-end schemes are evaluated and compared. Arising from a multiple-branch configuration, the concept of inconsistency in the decoder (thermometer code) is presented and used to optimize decoding performance. The experimentally validated methodology considers both optically amplified long-haul and short-reach applications.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Low-Bit Soft-Decision Error Correction in Optical Front Ends", "paper_id": "WOS:000361204300006"}
