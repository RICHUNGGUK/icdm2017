In such propagation-harsh conditions, the main metrics of interest are path reliability plus sufficient throughput (or minimal delay) in order to support time-critical and delay-sensitive applications in addition to classic, delay-tolerant data applications. Certain recently proposed, pragmatic, autonomous-cooperation path-establishment mechanisms are examined thoroughly via analysis and simulation in order to assess their performance in comparison to more traditional solutions, under various parametric settings. Various related trade-offs are also identified.", "paper_title": "Robust Routing Under Shadow-Fading in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000364500200004"}
