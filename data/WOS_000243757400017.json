In this paper we discuss solutions to the problem that medical teachers and students do not use modern computer-assisted instruction systems in medical education as much as expected by their developers. Methods: As an example for a modern problem-based CAI system we introduce the CAMPUS shell system for case-based training in medicine. Results. CAMPUS has received several awards and positive evaluation results. Nevertheless, the usage of such systems in courses and for self-study could be increased. Conclusions. Curricular integration of CAI as well as further improvements on existing CAI systems to increase the usage in medical education is essential.", "paper_title": "Challenges and perspectives of computer-assisted instruction in medical education - Lessons learned from seven years of experience with the CAMPUS system", "paper_id": "WOS:000243757400017"}
