By employing general parametric solutions to a type of so-called high-order Sylvester matrix equations, complete parametric control approaches for high-order linear systems are presented. The proposed approaches give simple complete parametric expressions for the feedback gains and the closed-loop eigenvector matrices, and produce all the design degrees of freedom. Furthermore, important special cases are particularly treated. Based on the proposed parametric design approaches, a parametric method for the gain-scheduling controller design of a linear time-varying system is proposed and the design of a BTT missile autopilot is carried out. The simulation results show that the method is superior to the traditional one in sense of either global stability or system performance.", "paper_title": "Parametric control systems design with applications in missile control", "paper_id": "WOS:000272033000022"}
