An approach based upon design of experiments was employed to. nd the best processing windows for each phase of coil coating processes. Besides, the experimental trends of operative parameters were also sought. Special attention was paid to the influence of leading process parameters on the performance of the starting surface as well as on the aesthetic aspect and some functional properties of the polymeric coatings. Finally, some useful aspects concerning the best way to lead the process were also discussed in detail.", "paper_title": "Surface preparation and coating of metal coils by using a fully integrated manufacturing system", "paper_id": "WOS:000248333700005"}
