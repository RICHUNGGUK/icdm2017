Successful VEs require complete information transparency and suitable resource sharing among coworkers across enterprises. Hence, this investigation proposes a formal flexible integration solution, named the formal VE access control (VEAC) model, based on the role-based AC model, to integrate and share distributed resources owned by VE members. The formal VEAC model comprises a fundamental VEAC model, a project AC policy (PACP) language model, and a model construction methodology. The fundamental VEAC model manages VE resources and the resources of participating enterprises, in which various project relationships are presented to facilitate different degrees of resource sharing across projects and enterprise boundaries, and cooperative modes among VE roles are presented to enable collaboration among coworkers in a VE. This PACP language model features object-subject-action-condition AC policies that jointly determine user access authorizations. In addition, the methodology supplies a systematic method to identify fundamental elements of the VEAC model and to establish assignments between elements and relations.", "paper_title": "A formal virtual enterprise access control model", "paper_id": "WOS:000257020200008"}
