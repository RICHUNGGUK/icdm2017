System failures may occur either due to transient faults in the mobile device or due to wireless link errors. When a failure occurs, the device may request the retransmission of the packet after a recovery period. In such a case, the power consumption will be further increased. Steady state analysis is presented, and decomposition results are discussed. Energy and performance metrics are obtained, and used to provide useful numerical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
