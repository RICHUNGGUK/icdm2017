In essence, computations modulo a well-chosen prime number p are used to obtain the exact information needed to guide floating point computations. In this paper, we detail the symbolic part of our algorithm. First of all, we study modular reduction of Puiseux series and give a good reduction criterion for ensuring that the information required by the numerical part is preserved. To establish our results, we introduce a simple modification of classical Newton polygons, that we call \"generic Newton polygons\", which turns out to be very convenient. Finally, we estimate the size of good primes obtained with deterministic and probabilistic strategies. Some of these results were announced without proof at ISSAC'08. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
