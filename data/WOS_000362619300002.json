To solve these problems, subtopic mining has been studied, which returns a ranked list of possible subtopics according to their relevance, popularity, and diversity. This paper proposes a novel method to mine subtopics using simple patterns and a hierarchical structure of subtopic candidates. First, relevant and various phrases are extracted as subtopic candidates using simple patterns based on noun phrases and alternative partial-queries. Second, a hierarchical structure of the subtopic candidates is constructed using sets of relevant documents from a web document collection. Finally, the subtopic candidates are ranked considering a balance between popularity and diversity using this structure. In experiments, our proposed methods outperformed the baselines and even an external resource based method at high-ranked subtopics, which shows that our methods can be effective and useful in various search scenarios like result diversification.
