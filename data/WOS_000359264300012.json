The existing work on rendezvous implicitly assumes that each cognitive user is equipped with one radio (i.e., one wireless transceiver). As the cost of wireless transceivers is dropping, this feature can be exploited to significantly improve the rendezvous performance at low cost. In this study, we investigate the rendezvous problem in CRNs where cognitive users are equipped with multiple radios and different users may have different numbers of radios. We first study how the existing rendezvous algorithms can be generalized to use multiple radios for faster rendezvous. We then propose a new rendezvous algorithm, called role-based parallel sequence (RPS), which specifically exploits multiple radios for more efficient rendezvous. Our basic idea is to let the cognitive users stay in a specific channel in one dedicated radio and hop on the available channels with parallel sequences in the remaining general radios. We prove that our algorithm provides guaranteed rendezvous (i.e., rendezvous can be completed within a finite time) and derive the upper bounds on the maximum time-to-rendezvous (TTR) and the expected TTR. The simulation results show that i) multiple radios can cost-effectively improve the rendezvous performance, and ii) the proposed RPS algorithm performs better than the ones generalized from the existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "Multiple Radios for Fast Rendezvous in Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000359264300012"}
