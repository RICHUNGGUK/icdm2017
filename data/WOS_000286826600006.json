Information on a series of variables was extracted after conducting a review of 1,043 articles on KM, published in various peer-reviewed journals between 1974-2008. The findings suggest that a combination of positivist, empirical, conceptual/descriptive, and multi-method approaches have been predominantly used in the area. Organizational as well as systems and environmental context-based KM research were found to be the most widely published topics within the KM domain. Further, the authors identified literature gaps that require more exploration and conceptual refinement in the context of knowledge management research.", "paper_title": "Research Trends in Knowledge Management: Analyzing the Past and Predicting the Future", "paper_id": "WOS:000286826600006"}
