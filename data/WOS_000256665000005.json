The result builds upon the characterization of minimal rank facets for claw-free graphs by Galluccio and Sassano (J. Combinatorial Theory 69:1-38, 2005) and upon the introduction of a superclass of circulant graphs that are called clique-circulants. The new class of graphs is invetigated in depth. We characterize which clique-circulants C are facet producing, i.e. are such that Sigma upsilon epsilon V(C) chi(upsilon) <= alpha(C) is a facet of STAB(C), thus extending a result of Trotter (Discrete Math. 12:373-388, 1975) for circulants. We show that a simple clique family inequality (Oriolo, Discrete Appl. Math. 132(2):185-201, 2004) may be associated with each clique-circulant C subset of G, when G is fuzzy circular interval. We show that these inequalities provide all the rank facets of STAB(G), if G is a fuzzy circular interval graph. Moreover we conjecture that, in this case, they also provide all the non-rank facets of STAB(G) and offer evidences for this conjecture.", "paper_title": "Clique-circulants and the stable set polytope of fuzzy circular interval graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000256665000005"}
