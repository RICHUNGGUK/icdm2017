In the current paper we consider higher-order psi-calculi through a technically surprisingly simple extension of the framework, and show how an arbitrary psi-calculus can be lifted to its higher-order counterpart in a canonical way. We illustrate this with examples and establish an algebraic theory of higher-order psi-calculi. The formal results are obtained by extending our proof repositories in Isabelle/Nominal.", "paper_title": "Higher-order psi-calculi", "paper_id": "WOS:000343643500003"}
