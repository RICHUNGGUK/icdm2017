Design/methodology/approach This work is based oil a recently proposed flexibility-based component modes synthesis (CMS) approach which was shown to he very efficient for solving large eigenvalue problems. The model reduction approach is based oil partionning via the localized Lagrange multipliers method, which makes it very appropriate late to handle coupled problems. Findings In particular, it is demonstrated in this paper how the utilised model reduction method and efficielltly coupled to a full finite element model. The performance of the method is investigated on numerical examples of plate and 3D problems. Originality/value. The proposed, flexibility-based CMS approach call be used as a very efficient tool for complex engineering structures under dynamic load where these mode superposition method applies. The efficiency of the computations is brought about by the model reduction.", "paper_title": "Partitioning based reduced order modelling approach for transient analyses of large structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000264968100004"}
