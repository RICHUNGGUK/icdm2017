In this paper, a characterization of maximal curves with Frobenius dimension equal to 3 is provided. Our main tool is the Natural Embedding Theorem for maximal curves. As an application, maximal curves with Frobenius dimension 3 defined over the fields with 16 and 25 elements are completely classified.", "paper_title": "On maximal curves with Frobenius dimension 3", "paper_id": "WOS:000270169500003"}
