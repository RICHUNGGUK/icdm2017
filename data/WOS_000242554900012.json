In a pipeline FFT, data is continuously streaming and must, hence, be scaled without stalling the dataflow. We propose a hybrid floating-point scheme with tailored exponent datapath, and a co-optimized architecture between hybrid floating point and block floating point (BFP) to reduce memory requirements for 2-D signal processing. The presented co-optimization generates a higher signal-to-quantization-noise ratio and requires less memory than for instance convergent BFP. A 2048-point pipeline FFT has been fabricated in a standard-CMOS process from AMI Semiconductor (Lenart and Owall, 2003), and a field-programmable gate array prototype integrating a 2-D FFT core in a larger design shows that the architecture is suitable for image reconstruction in digital holographic imaging.", "paper_title": "Architectures for dynamic data scaling in 2/4/8K pipeline FFT cores", "paper_id": "WOS:000242554900012"}
