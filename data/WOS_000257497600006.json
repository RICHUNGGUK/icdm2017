Linear conjecture is then satisfied if the comparison system is identical to the system itself. Practical Borne-Gentina stability criterion, applied to continuous systems, generalizes the use of Kotelyanski lemma for non linear systems and defines large classes of processes for which linear Aizerman conjecture is satisfied. The stability approach is applied for multimodel control systems and for TSK fuzzy models when Benrejeb arrow form characteristic matrix is used.", "paper_title": "On the representation and the stability study of large scale systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257497600006"}
