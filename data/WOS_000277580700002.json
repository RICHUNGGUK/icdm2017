This paper describes an implementation model which relies on shared responsibility between local sites and an external three-pronged support infrastructure consisting of: (1) a national technical expertise center, (2) an implementer's community, and (3) a developer's community. This model was used to implement an open-source EHR in three Ugandan HIV-clinics. Pre-post time motion study at one site revealed that Primary Care Providers spent a third less time in direct and indirect care of patients (p<0.001) and 40% more time on personal activities (p=0.09) after EHRs implementation. Time spent by previously enrolled patients with non-clinician staff fell by half (p=0.004) and with pharmacy by 63% (p<0.001). Surveyed providers were highly satisfied with the EHRs and its support infrastructure. This model offers a viable approach for broadly implementing EHRs in resource-limited settings.", "paper_title": "Evaluating a scalable model for implementing electronic health records in resource-limited settings", "paper_id": "WOS:000277580700002"}
