The robot team is composed of identical robots with mutually exclusive, but neighboring workspaces. The products are fed in at one end of the band, move through each workspace sequentially until being picked up and are collected at the other end-if not picked up interim. Each robot has the same task-that is picking up and packaging as many products as possible. We propose an approach based on noncooperative game theory where each robot uses local observations of the conveyor band and their neighbors' actions in order to decide on its actions. The developed algorithm has been implemented and tested in a simulated manufacturing environment using Webots. Results obtained from the simulations are analyzed using a variety of statistical performance measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
