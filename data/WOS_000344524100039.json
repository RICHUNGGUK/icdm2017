In this frame, we prove that the l(2)-prediction error and l(1)-risk of the lasso, and the Dantzig selector are optimal up to an explicit multiplicative constant. Thus, we can estimate a high-dimensional target vector with an error term similar to the one obtained in a situation where one knows the support of the largest coordinates in advance. Moreover, we show that these design matrices have an explicit restricted eigenvalue. Precisely, they satisfy the restricted eigenvalue assumption and compatibility condition with an explicit constant. Eventually, we capitalize on the recent construction of unbalanced expander graphs due to Guruswami, Umans, and Vadhan, to provide a deterministic polynomial time construction of these design matrices.", "paper_title": "Optimal Designs for Lasso and Dantzig Selector Using Expander Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000344524100039"}
