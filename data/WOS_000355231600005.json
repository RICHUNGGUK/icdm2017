Organizations need to build an environment not resistant to new environments by enhancing applications of the existing built ICT technologies for focusing on various utilizations of SNS and integrating with the existing enterprise systems within the organizations to use them. Accordingly, there is a need to develop the ICT use index and the ICT use development level for objectively diagnosing enterprises' ICT use state to integrate with SNS services. However, the studies so far have focused on only understanding enterprises' introduction effects of ICT technologies or fragmentary status of ICT use and external use of SNS. In addition, there are insufficient studies on the business processes that could show results of applying ICT technologies which are bases to be integrated with SNS. Therefore, this study would like to analyze characteristics and performance by organizations' ICT use levels so that SNS services could be applied in earnest from various perspectives based on the organizations' characteristics.", "paper_title": "ICT use level and performance evaluation on the social network environment: Korea case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000355231600005"}
