While it was believed up to now that quantification over actions is a characteristic feature of Reiter's solution, we here show that for a reasonably large subset of Reiter's basic action theories one can do without. We do so by recasting restricted basic action theories in a propositional modal logic, viz. dynamic epistemic logic with public announcements and public assignments.", "paper_title": "From Situation Calculus to Dynamic Epistemic Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000289165700004"}
