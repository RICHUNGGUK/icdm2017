The defect is embedded in a conductive non-magnetic plate and the measured data are the impedance variation of an air-cored probe coil scanning above the top of the plate. Design/methodology/approach - The inverse problem of defect characterization is solved by an iterative global optimization process. The strategy of the iterations is the kriging-based expected improvement (EI) global optimization algorithm. The forward problem is solved numerically, using a volume integral approach. Findings - The proposed method seems to be efficient in the light of the presented numerical results. Further investigation and comparison to other methods are still needed. Originality/value - This is believed to be the first time when the El algorithm has been used to solve an inverse problem related to the ECT.", "paper_title": "Characterization of a 3D defect using the expected improvement algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000269323700007"}
