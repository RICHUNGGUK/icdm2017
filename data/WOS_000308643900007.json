Symbols are placed at specific locations on a map, and their areas are scaled to become proportional to the magnitudes of the data points they represent. We focus specifically on creating physically realizable drawings of symbols-opaque disks, in our case-by maximizing two quality metrics: the total and the minimum length of their visible borders. As these two maximization problems have been proven to be NP-hard, we provide integer programming formulations for their solution, along with decomposition techniques designed to decrease the size of input instances. Our computational experiments, which use real-life data sets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide, for the first time, a number of optimal solutions to previously studied instances of this problem.", "paper_title": "Generating optimal drawings of physically realizable symbol maps with integer programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000308643900007"}
