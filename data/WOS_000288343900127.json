In this paper, we propose and apply a two-stage methodology to an industrial survey data set to investigate relations among the key factors in a supply chain model. Precisely, we use the PC-algorithm to discover the connectivity relation among the factors of interest in the supply chain model. Critical factors in the model are then identified, and we then utilize the neural network to quantify the relative importance of some of the factors in predicting the critical factors. An advantage of our proposed method is that it frees up the researcher from making subjective decisions in his or her analysis, for example, from the needs of specifying plausible initial path models required in a structural equation modeling analysis (which is usually used in business and management research) and of selecting factors for the subsequent predictive modeling. We envision that the analysis results can aid a decision maker in optimizing the system performance by suggesting to the decision maker which ones of the factors are the important ones that he or she should devote more resources and efforts on.
