Therefore a new intelligent controller to prevent the surge phenomenon to prolong the life cycle of modern turbo charged automobiles is proposed in this paper. In order to do so, the surge boundary for a particular turbo charger in a specific automobile must be determined first. A new systematic way without performing a real experiment to find the surge boundary is therefore proposed in this paper. The modeling of the turbo charged system is first discussed with Moore-Greitzer model with the new finding of determining the Helmholtz frequencies on the compressor load curves (CLCs) on the compressor map diagram. By substituting the real physical parameters of SAAB NG 900 into the modeling equation, the manufacturer's surge boundary and real surge boundary for all turbo charged automobiles can be accurately verified. These new results are immediately adopted in this paper to design an intelligent surge controller to minimize the risk of surge phenomenon in a turbo charger automobile. This new intelligent surge controller has the capability to maintain a certain pressure to bypass the surge boundary with minimum pressure release. Excellent real-time experimental results have been obtained to validate that our new approach is very effective. This will have decent applications in modern turbo charged intelligent automobiles.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation of Intelligent Surge Controller for Modern Turbo Charged Automobiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000338826200010"}
