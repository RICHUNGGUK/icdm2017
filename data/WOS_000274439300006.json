Investing in such systems can be inefficient for small and medium corporations, since the vast majority of management tasks performed are routine tasks, while personnel specialization requirements and costs are high. At the same time, the open Source community has not yet produced a reliable and complete system and network management solution. Even though there are open Source initiatives specializing in specific fields of remote management, such as network management, there has been no integrated open source solution yet. This paper introduces the Open Source Remote Systems Management (OpenRSM) platform. OpenRSM is all integrated remote management system created by integrating individual specialized open source management initiatives and significantly augmenting them to support additional functionality, so that a complete lightweight system and network management solution is produced. The system implemented facilitates daily management by providing an efficient, simple and adaptable environment for the majority of management operations.
