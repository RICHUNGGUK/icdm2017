It is assumed that the setup cost and the average holding cost are characterized as fuzzy variables and the elapsed time until shift is a random fuzzy variable. As a function of these parameters, the average total cost is also a random fuzzy variable, and the unimodality of its expected value is studied. To obtain the optimal run length and the minimum average cost, simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm based on random fuzzy simulation is provided. Random fuzzy EMQ models with fuzzy deterioration, fuzzy linear deterioration and fuzzy exponential deterioration are presented, respectively. These models can be solved by the proposed algorithm. Numerical examples are presented in the end. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
