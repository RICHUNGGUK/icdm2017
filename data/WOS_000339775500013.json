The standard level set method can capture the interface smoothly and gives accurate normal vectors but suffers from an excessive amount of mass gain/loss. The conservative level set method exhibits excellent mass conservation properties but the results are usually contaminated by inaccurate interface normal vectors. To address this problem, an improved conservative level set method is proposed to capture the interface smoothly with excellent mass conservation properties. The improvement of the method lies in that the surface normal is computed from a signed distance function which is also advected and re-initialized in the flow fields instead of using the Heaviside function. The proposed method is implemented by an implicit two-step Taylor-Galerkin approximation together with the fractional step algorithm within the finite element context. The approach is validated with well-known benchmark problems, including the long term advection of a circle, rotation of a slotted disk, stretching of a circular, dam-break flow and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability problem. The results from the proposed method show good agreement with existing experimental and numerical published results and are found to be highly reliable and accurate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
