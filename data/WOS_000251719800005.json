This algorithm is based on a direct contrast modi. cation method with an optimal function, obtained by using the mean squared error as a criterion. Computer simulated images containing objects similar to those observed in the phantom are built to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Noise reduction results obtained on both simulated and real phantom images show that the developed method may be considered as a good preprocessing step from the point of view of automating phantom film evaluation by means of image processing.", "paper_title": "Enhancement of mammographic phantom features by noise reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000251719800005"}
