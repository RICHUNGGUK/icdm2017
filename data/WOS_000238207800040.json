However, malicious users can exploit the correlation among the data and infer sensitive information from a series of seemingly innocuous data access. In this paper, we proposed a detection system that utilizes both the user's current query and past query log to determine if the current query answer can infer sensitive information. This detection system is being extended to the cases of multiple collaborative users based on the query history of all the users and their collaborative levels for specific sensitive information.", "paper_title": "Database security protection via inference detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800040"}
