Past work has not fully addressed the unique challenges that arise from scaling. This paper presents a novel end-to-end system solution to some of these challenges. The system is built on the prescription-based context-driven activity classification methodology. First, we show that by refining the definition of context, and introducing the concept of scenarios, a prescription model can provide personalized activity monitoring. Second, through a flexible architecture constructed from interface models, we demonstrate the concept of a context-driven classifier. Context classification is achieved through a classification committee approach, and activity classification follows by means of context specific activity models. Then, the architecture is implemented in an end-to-end system featuring an Android application running on a mobile device, and a number of classifiers as core classification components. Finally, we use a series of experimental field evaluations to confirm the expected benefits of the proposed system in terms of classification accuracy, rate, and sensor operating life.", "paper_title": "Context-driven, Prescription-Based Personal Activity Classification: Methodology, Architecture, and End-to-End Implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000336050400034"}
