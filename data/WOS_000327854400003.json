This paper proposes an extensional MapReduce Task Scheduling algorithm for Deadline constraints in Hadoop platform: MTSD. It allows user specify a job's deadline and tries to make the job be finished before the deadline. Through measuring the node's computing capacity, a node classification algorithm is proposed in MTSD. This algorithm classifies the nodes into several levels in heterogeneous clusters. Under this algorithm, we firstly illuminate a novel data distribution model which distributes data according to the node's capacity level respectively. The experiments show that the node classification algorithm can improved data locality observably to compare with default scheduler and it also can improve other scheduler's locality. Secondly, we calculate the task's average completion time which is based on the node level. It improves the precision of task's remaining time evaluation. Finally, MTSD provides a mechanism to decide which job's task should be scheduled by calculating the Map and Reduce task slot requirements.", "paper_title": "A MapReduce task scheduling algorithm for deadline constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000327854400003"}
