The results show that honeybees regulate their flight speed by keeping the velocity of the image of the environment in their eye constant. The results also show that honeybees use visual information from the ground to control their height above the ground. The findings of this study reveal that the mechanisms of flight speed and height control in the honeybee are perfectly adapted for extracting information from a complex visual environment using simple sensors and computations. Consequently, the techniques of visual guidance that are reported here suggest insect-inspired strategies for the control of aircraft flight.", "paper_title": "Visual control of flight speed and height in the honeybee", "paper_id": "WOS:000242125300004"}
