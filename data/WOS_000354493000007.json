The proposed authoring tool package, Sobot studio is accessible to both developers and end-users of Sobot content. The Sobot studio allows them to easily create interactive software robot message with programming features. It encourages openness to everyone, user participation, and common ownership of emotional Sobot content based on web 2.0 paradigm. The authored Sobots can connect with and move to any device such as PCs, mobile phones, PDAs, or web portal sites at anytime. The experimental results verify that the emotional pet-type Sobots can easily transfer among heterogeneous devices through the network based on the ubiquitous paradigm.", "paper_title": "Software robot authoring tools for sharing intelligence among users and content providers", "paper_id": "WOS:000354493000007"}
