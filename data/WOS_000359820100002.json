We characterize exactly what can be proved in the is an element of = 0 case with currently known methods and prove the conjecture of Williams that c = 2 cos(pi/ 7) is optimal for this. For time- space trade-offs and lower bounds on satisfiability, we give a theoretical and computational analysis of the alternation trading proofs for 0 < is an element of < 1.", "paper_title": "LIMITS ON ALTERNATION TRADING PROOFS FOR TIME-SPACE LOWER BOUNDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000359820100002"}
