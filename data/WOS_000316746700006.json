A systematic, quantitative analysis is the first step in ensuring that multi-tiered Web applications meet their high availability expectations. This paper proposes a hierarchical, model-based methodology to assess the availability of multi-tiered Web applications. The hierarchical approach partitions the analysis into three levels, which allows a systematic consideration of several factors that are relevant to application availability without encountering the issues of model complexity and intractability. We illustrate the approach via experimentation using the TPC-W benchmark. We also demonstrate how the approach could be used to guide resource provisioning decisions.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical availability analysis of multi-tiered Web applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000316746700006"}
