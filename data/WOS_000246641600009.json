However, most of the existing algorithms focus only on the extraction of line positions, ignoring line thickness. This paper presents a novel wide line detector using an isotropic nonlinear filter. Unlike most existing edge and line detectors which use directional derivatives, our proposed wide line detector applies a nonlinear filter to extract a line completely without any derivative. The detector is based on the isotropic responses via circular masks. A general scheme for the analysis of the robustness of the proposed wide line detector is introduced and the dynamic selection of parameters is developed. In addition, this paper investigates the relationship between the size of circular masks and the width of detected lines. A sequence of tests has been conducted on a variety of image samples and our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Detecting wide lines using isotropic nonlinear filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000246641600009"}
