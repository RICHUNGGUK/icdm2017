We show that this feedback gain synthesis task can be cast as a combined static state estimation and linear feedback control problem. Our framework allows us to analyze and determine the relationship between optic flow measurements and actuator commands, which greatly simplifies the implementation of biologically inspired control architectures on terrestrial and aerial robotic platforms.", "paper_title": "Control theoretic interpretation of directional motion preferences in optic flow processing interneurons", "paper_id": "WOS:000284507700002"}
