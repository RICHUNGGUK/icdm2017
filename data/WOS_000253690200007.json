These wireless mesh networks, however, may be deployed by different authorities without any coordination a priori, and hence it is possible that they overlap partially or even entirely in service area, resulting in contention of radio resources among them. In this paper, we investigate the artifacts that result from the uncoordinated deployment of wireless mesh networks. We use a network optimization approach to model the problem as resource sharing among nodes belonging to one or different networks. Based on the proposed LP formulation, we then conduct simulations to characterize the performance of overlaying wireless mesh networks, with the goal to provide perspectives for addressing the problems. We find that in a system with multiple overlaying wireless mesh networks, if no form of inter-domain coordination is present, individual mesh networks could suffer from capacity degradation due to increased network contention. One solution toward addressing the performance degradation is to \"interwork\" these wireless mesh networks by allowing inter-domain traffic relay through provisioning of \"bridge\" nodes. However, if such bridge nodes are chosen arbitrarily, the problems of throughput sub-optimality and unfairness may arise. We profile the impact of bridge node selection and show the importance in controlling network unfairness for wireless mesh network interworking. We conclude that mesh network interworking is a promising direction to address the artifacts due to uncoordinated deployment of wireless mesh networks if it is supplemented with appropriate mechanisms.
