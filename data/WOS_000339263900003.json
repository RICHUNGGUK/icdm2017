Computational results using Iris, Glass, Wine, and Breast Cancer benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed AIS-based clustering algorithm is more accurate than some particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based clustering algorithms. In addition, the model evaluation results using a daily transaction database provided by a cyberstore also show that the proposed AISK algorithm is superior to PSO-based clustering algorithms.", "paper_title": "INTEGRATION OF ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEM AND K-MEANS ALGORITHM FOR CUSTOMER CLUSTERING", "paper_id": "WOS:000339263900003"}
