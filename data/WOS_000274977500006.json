The system consists of two active components and one warm standby. The time-to-failure and time-to-repair of the components are assumed to follow an exponential and a general distribution respectively. The coverage factors for an active-component failure and for a standby-component failure are assumed to be the same. We construct a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of availability for such repairable system. Based on this interval estimation and testing hypothesis are performed. To implement the estimator, simulation inference for the system availability, we adopt two repair-time distributions, namely, lognormal and Weibull and three types of Weibull distributions characterized by their shape parameters are considered. Finally, all simulation results are displayed in appropriate tables and curves for highlighting the performance of the statistical inference procedures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
