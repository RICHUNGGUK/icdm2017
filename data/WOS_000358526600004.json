In general, a document can be represented as a hierarchy of sections and subsections with corresponding headings and subheadings. We developed two machine learning models: heading extraction model and hierarchy extraction model. Heading extraction was formulated as a classification problem whereas a tree-based learning approach was employed in hierarchy extraction. For this purpose, we developed an incremental learning algorithm based on support vector machines and perceptrons. The models were evaluated in detail with respect to the performance of the heading and hierarchy extraction tasks. For comparison, a baseline rule-based approach was used that relies on heuristics and HTML document object model tree processing. The machine learning approach, which is a fully automatic approach, outperformed the rule-based approach. We also analyzed the effect of document structuring on automatic summarization in the context of Web search. The results of the task-based evaluation on TREC queries showed that structured summaries are superior to unstructured summaries both in terms of accuracy and user ratings, and enable the users to determine the relevancy of search results more accurately than search engine snippets.", "paper_title": "A tree-based learning approach for document structure analysis and its application to web search", "paper_id": "WOS:000358526600004"}
