In recent years, attention has been focused oil intelligent systems which have shown great promise in supporting quality control. However. only a small number of the currently used systems are reported to be operating effectively because they are designed to maintain it quality level within the specified process, rather than to focus oil cooperation within the production workflow. This paper proposes all intelligent system with a newly designed algorithm and the universal process data exchange standard to overcome the challenges of demanding customers who seek high-quality and low-cost products. The intelligent quality management system is equipped with the \"distributed process mining\" feature to provide all levels of employees with the ability to understand the relationships between processes. especially when any aspect of the process is going to degrade or fail. An example of generalized fuzzy association rules are applied in manufacturing sector to demonstrate how the proposed iterative process mining algorithm finds the relationships between distributed process parameters and the presence of quality problems.
