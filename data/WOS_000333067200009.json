A reference web architecture called ACOTA (Automatic Collaborative Tagging) is also described in order to show the recommendation capabilities of this approach with the aim to assist users when multilingual resource tagging is required. Finally a quantitative research in the context of corporate knowledge management is also presented to evaluate and assess the goodness and accuracy of the methodology to minimize the effort of multilingual document categorization.", "paper_title": "ACOTA: A MULTILINGUAL AND SEMI-AUTOMATIC COLLABORATIVE TAGGING WEB-BASED APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000333067200009"}
