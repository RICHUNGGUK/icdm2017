In this paper, we show that, under certain conditions, the Two-Dimensional Fractional Fourier Transform (2D-FRFT) possesses this attractive property through mathematical analysis and extensive computer simulations. Based on this property, we propose a novel digital image watermarking method which combines 2D chirp signal with the addition and rotation invariant properties of 2D-FRFT in order to improve robustness and security of digital image watermark in 2D-FRFT domain. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust against numerous watermarking attacks including rotation geometrical transform, JPEG compression, crop, median filtering, histogram equalization, salt & pepper noise, Gaussian lowpass filter, shift, dithering and Gaussian noise, and secures against unauthorized information copying and redistribution.", "paper_title": "Rotation Invariance in 2D-FRFT with Application to Digital Image Watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000320002600005"}
