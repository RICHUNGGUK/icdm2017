To help address this issue, we developed nested Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (nEASE). nEASE complements traditional gene ontology enrichment approaches by determining statistically enriched gene ontology subterms within a list of genes based on co-annotation. Here, we overview an open-source software version of the nEASE algorithm. nEASE can be used either stand-alone or as part of a pathway discovery pipeline.
