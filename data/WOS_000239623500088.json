In RB-RBAC, seniority levels of rules are also introduced to express domination relationship among rules. Hence, relations among attribute expressions may be quite complex and security officers may perform incorrect or unintended assignments if they are not aware of such relations behind authorization rules. We proposed a formalization of RB-RBAC by description logic. A seniority relation determination method is developed based on description logic reasoning services. This method can find out seniority relations efficiently even for rules without identical syntax structures.", "paper_title": "Using description logic to determine seniority among RB-RBAC authorization rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500088"}
