This paper considers a generic logic-level architecture of end-around-carry adder, which is extensively used in floating-point arithmetic. The architecture is component-based and parameterized for easy customization. The design architecture is formalized and verified in the mechanical theorem prover Coq. The scalable proof provides necessary underpinnings for verifying customized and new implementations.", "paper_title": "Scalable Verification of a Generic End-Around-Carry Adder for Floating-Point Units by Coq", "paper_id": "WOS:000348228400014"}
