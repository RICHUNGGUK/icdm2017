To date, various approaches have been proposed to correlate security alerts, including the adoption of attack graphs to clarify their causal relationship. However, there still lacks an efficient and operational method to generate attack graphs tailored to alert causal correlation. In this paper, we propose a kind of \"one-step worst\" attack graph which can be built in polynomial time using an intuitive object-oriented method. Based on the graph, a principle is given out to correlate security alerts into scenarios. To prove its feasibility, we implemented a prototype system which can efficiently divide real-time alert streams into plausible attack scenarios. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
