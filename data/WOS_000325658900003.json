However, traditional client-server based mobile service models are not able to meet the increasing demands from mobile users in terms of services diversity, user experience, security and privacy, and so on. Cloud computing enables mobile devices to offload complex operations of mobile applications, which are infeasible on mobile devices alone. In this article, we provide a comprehensive study to lay out existing mobile cloud computing service models and key achievements, and present a new user-centric mobile cloud computing service model to advance existing mobile cloud computing research.", "paper_title": "Mobile Cloud Computing Service Models: A User-Centric Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000325658900003"}
