In particular, following a literature search specific cellular automata models that have been developed to simulate traffic are selected for this study. The values of the saturation flow as these are produced via model simulations with the modification of appropriate relevant model parameters including maximum desired speed and probability are defined through specific statistical values. The most significant parameters and their respective values considering saturation flow as well as the pattern of this dependency are determined.", "paper_title": "Cellular Automata Saturation Flow Considering Inherent Model Properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000329378500013"}
