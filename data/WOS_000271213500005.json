The integration of MRAM in FPGA instead of SRAM is one of the most promising solutions to overcome this issue, because its non-volatility and high write/read speed allow to power down completely the logic blocks in \"idle\" states in the FPGA circuit. MRAM-based FPGA promises as well as some advanced reconfiguration methods such as runtime reconfiguration and multicontext configuration. However, the conventional MRAM technology based on field-induced magnetic switching (FIMS) writing approach consumes very high power, large circuit surface and produces high disturbance between memory cells. These drawbacks prevent FIMS-MRAM's further development in memory and logic circuit. Spin transfer torque (STT)-based MRAM is then evaluated to address these issues, some design techniques and novel computing architecture for FPGA logic circuits based on STT-MRAM technology are presented in this article. By using STMicroelectronics CMOS 90nm technology and a STT-MTJ spice model, some chip characteristic results as the programming latency and power have been calculated and simulated to demonstrate the expected performance of STT-MRAM based FPGA logic circuits.", "paper_title": "Spin Transfer Torque (STT)-MRAM-Based Runtime Reconfiguration FPGA Circuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000271213500005"}
