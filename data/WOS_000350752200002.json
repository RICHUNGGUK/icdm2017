The presented approach is based on VRKit, a software tool that allows to build pre-configured bootable virtual router images with the desired characteristics. Design decisions are described, and some usage examples are presented, showing how the tool can be used for research on virtual routing, facilitating performance comparison of various virtual router implementations.
