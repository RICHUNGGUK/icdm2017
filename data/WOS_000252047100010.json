For the choice of the optimal architecture of the neural network, we experiment with a \"top-down\" pruning technique as well as two \"bottom-up\" strategies that start with simple models and gradually complicate the architecture if data indicate so. We adopt methods that base model selection on statistical hypothesis testing and information criteria and we compare their performance to a simple heuristic pruning technique. In the first set of experiments, neural network models are employed to fit the entire options surface and in the second they are used as parts of a hybrid intelligence scheme that combines a neural network model with theoretical option-pricing hints.", "paper_title": "A comparison of neural network model selection strategies for the pricing of S&P 500 stock index options", "paper_id": "WOS:000252047100010"}
