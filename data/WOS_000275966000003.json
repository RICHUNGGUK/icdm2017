This numerical solver is a Lagrange-Remap, scheme that aims at controlling the numerical diffusion of the interface between both fluids. This method does not involve any interface reconstruction procedure. The solver is equipped with built-in stability and consistency properties and is conservative with respect to mass, momentum, total energy and partial masses. This numerical scheme works with a very broad range of equations of state, including tabulated laws. Properties that ensure a good treatment of the Riemann invariants across the interface are proven. As a consequence, the numerical method does not create spurious pressure oscillations at the interface. We show one-dimensional and two-dimensional classic numerical tests. The results are compared with the approximate solutions obtained with the classic upwind Lagrange-Remap approach, and with experimental and previously published results of a reference test case.
