Our structure is simple to implement, easy to use, and allows for arbitrary, user-defined 3-cells such as prisms and hexahedra, while remaining very efficient in memory usage compared to previous work. Its time complexity for commonly-used incidence and adjacency queries such as vertex and dart one-rings is analyzed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
