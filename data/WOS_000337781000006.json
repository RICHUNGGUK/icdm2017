However, most research conducted in this area fails to examine what these individuals believe about organizational security efforts. To help bridge this gap, this study assesses the mindset of insiders regarding their relationship with information security efforts and compares it against the mindset of information security professionals. Interviews were conducted with 22 ordinary insiders and 11 information security professionals, an effort that provides insight into how insiders gauge the efficacy of recommended responses to information security threats. Several key differences between insiders' and professionals' security mindsets are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
