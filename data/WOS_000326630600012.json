The determination of fuzzy measures is the most difficult part in problem solving. Signed efficiency measure, which is a special kind of fuzzy measure with the best representation ability but the highest complexity, is even harder to determine. Some methodologies have been developed for solving this problem such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and genetic algorithms (GAs). However, none of the existing methods can outperform the others with unique advantages. Thus, there is a strong need to develop a new technique for learning distinct signed efficiency measures from data. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a new learning paradigm for training single hidden layer feed-forward networks (SLFNs) with randomly chosen input weights and analytically determined output weights. In this paper, we propose an ELM based algorithm for signed efficiency measure determination. Experimental comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both time and accuracy.", "paper_title": "EXTREME LEARNING MACHINE FOR DETERMINING SIGNED EFFICIENCY MEASURE FROM DATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000326630600012"}
