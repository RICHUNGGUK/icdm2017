One is the conjugate product and the other is the Sylvester-conjugate sum. Then some important properties for these operators are proved. Based on these derived results, we propose a unified approach to solving a general class of Sylvester-polynomial-conjugate matrix equations, which include the Yakubovich-conjugate matrix equation as a special case. The complete solution of the Sylvester-polynomial-conjugate matrix equation is obtained in terms of the Sylvester-conjugate sum, and such a proposed solution can provide all the degrees of freedom with an arbitrarily chosen parameter matrix.
