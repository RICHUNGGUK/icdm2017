In this paper, a probabilistic challenge-response scheme is proposed to prove that users' files are available and stored in a specified cloud server. In our scheme, common cloud infrastructure with some reasonable limits, such as rational economic security model, semi-collusion security model and response time bound, are exploited to resist the collusion of cloud servers. These limits guarantee that a malicious cloud service provider could not conduct a t-round communication in a limited time. The security and performance analysis demonstrate that our scheme provides strong incentives against an economically rational cloud service provider from re-outsourcing its clients' data to some other cloud providers.
