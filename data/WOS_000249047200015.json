Actually, Y characterizes the strongly 6-separating objects of a family S-u of digital surfaces defined by means of continuous analogues. The family Su consists of all objects whose continuous analogue is a surface in some homogeneous (26,6)-connected digital space as defined in the approach to Digital Topology introduced in [R. Ayala, E. Dominguez, A.R. Frances, A. Quintero, Weak Lighting Functions and Strong 26-surfaces. Theoretical Computer Science 283 (2002) 29-66.]. Therefore, Y is the largest possible set of surfaces in Z3 in that setting. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
