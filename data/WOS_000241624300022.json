Usage-based Web personalization is widely applied today. But most Web personalization systems based on usage require much recourse such as time and memory and are not too reasonable. In this paper we describe an approach to psychology-based Web personalization taking into account the full spectrum of Web mining techniques and activities. Our approach is described by the architecture shown in Figure 1, which heavily uses data mining techniques, thus making the personalization process both automatic and dynamic, and hence up-to-date. Artificial psychology techniques are used to support more effective and more precise transaction clustering.", "paper_title": "Web personalization based on artificial psychology", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624300022"}
