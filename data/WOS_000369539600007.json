Besides traditional L2/L3 devices, middleboxes are widely deployed in data centers and perform many important functions, e.g., the intrusion detection and firewall. Middleboxes are equipped with multiple kinds of resources, such as CPU and memory. Data flows undergoing different functions have heterogeneous processing time requirements on diverse resources. Researchers are in a dilemma as to how to provide fair service for flows and efficiently utilize those scarce resources. To address this problem, we propose a novel packet scheduling method, active time fairness queuing (ATFQ), for multi-resource environments. Prior packet scheduling methods usually focus on pursuing the fairness among flows, resulting in enormous waste of those scarce resources. ATFQ overcomes this essentially by redefining the fairness and can maximize the resource utilization with the guarantee of fairness. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of ATFQ. The evaluation results demonstrate that flows get better service in many aspects under ATFQ. Meanwhile, the resource utilization rises up by about 10% than the traditional DRFQ, which is one of the mainstream involved methods.", "paper_title": "ATFQ: A Fair and Efficient Packet Scheduling Method in Multi-Resource Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000369539600007"}
