Two witness proximity graphs are said to be mutual when, given two sets of points A and B, A is the vertex set of the first graph and the witness set of the second one, while B is the witness set of the first graph and the vertex set of the second one. We show that in the union of two mutual witness Delaunay graphs, there are always at least [n-2/2] edges, where n = vertical bar A vertical bar + vertical bar B vertical bar, which is tight in the worst case. We also show that if two mutual witness Delaunay graphs are complete, then the sets A and B are circularly separable; if two mutual witness Gabriel graphs are complete, then the sets A and B are linearly separable; but two mutual witness rectangle graphs might be complete, with A and B not linearly separable.
