The implemented ADPLL has two operation modes which are frequency acquisition mode and phase acquisition mode. In frequency acquisition mode, the ADPLL achieves a fast frequency locking via the proposed feed-forward compensation algorithm. In phase acquisition mode, the ADPLL achieves a finer phase locking. To verify the proposed algorithm and architecture, the ADPLL design is implemented by SMIC 0.18-mu m 1P6M CMOS technology. The core size of the ADPLL is 582.2 mu m * 343 mu m. The frequency range of the ADPLL is from 4 to 416 MHz. The measurement results show that the ADPLL can achieve a frequency locking in two reference cycles when locking to 376 MHz. The corresponding power consumption is 11.394 mW.", "paper_title": "A Fast Locking All-Digital Phase-Locked Loop via Feed-Forward Compensation Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000289905400012"}
