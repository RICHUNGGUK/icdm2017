To deliver high-quality images in the presence of single or multiple mu bump, ADC, or TSV failures, we propose to interleave the connections from pixels to ADCs and recover the corrupted data in the ISPs. Key design parameters, such as the interleaving stride and the grouping ratio are determined by analyzing the employed error correction algorithm. Architectural simulation results demonstrate that the error tolerance scheme enhances the effective yield of an exemplar 3-D imager from 44% to 97%.", "paper_title": "Low-Cost Error Tolerance Scheme for 3-D CMOS Imagers", "paper_id": "WOS:000315639900007"}
