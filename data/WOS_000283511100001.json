The existing literature on multimodal fusion research is presented through several classifications based on the fusion methodology and the level of fusion (feature, decision, and hybrid). The fusion methods are described from the perspective of the basic concept, advantages, weaknesses, and their usage in various analysis tasks as reported in the literature. Moreover, several distinctive issues that influence a multimodal fusion process such as, the use of correlation and independence, confidence level, contextual information, synchronization between different modalities, and the optimal modality selection are also highlighted. Finally, we present the open issues for further research in the area of multimodal fusion.", "paper_title": "Multimodal fusion for multimedia analysis: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000283511100001"}
