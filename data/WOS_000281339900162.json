This paper utilizes linguistic values to evaluate the performance of qualitative criteria and proposes using appropriate shapes of fuzzy numbers to evaluate the performance of quantitative criteria for each problem with respect to its particular conditions. In addition, a process to determine the weights of criteria using fuzzy numbers, which considers their competition to gain greater weights and their influence on each other is described. A new fuzzy methodology is proposed to solve such a problem that utilizes parametric form of fuzzy numbers. The case study of diversion of water into Lake Urmia watershed, which is defined using triangular, trapezoidal, and bell-shape fuzzy numbers demonstrates the utility of the proposed method.
