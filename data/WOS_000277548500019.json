The key idea is to use Laplacian texture images to represent geometric texture details, which in turn facilitate simple and effective geometry texture synthesis and enable flexible geometry texture editing. Given a sample model and a target model, we first select a patch from the sample model and extract the geometric texture details. Next, we construct a Laplacian texture image for the extracted texture and synthesize the Laplacian texture image to the target model using an image texture synthesis technique on surface. Finally, we reconstruct the textured target model with adjusted Laplacian coordinates. Compared to the existing methods, our method is easy-to-implement and produces results of high quality. Furthermore, it performs flexible control on the appearance of the textured target model through operations on the Laplacian texture image.", "paper_title": "Geometry Texture Synthesis Based on Laplacian Texture Image", "paper_id": "WOS:000277548500019"}
