We also show that for any Boolean function f represented by a formula in F, the deterministic query complexity of f is only quadratically larger than the quantum query complexity of f. Thus, the paper gives further evidence for the conjecture that there is an only quadratic gap for all functions.", "paper_title": "Lower Bounds on Quantum Query Complexity for Read-Once Formulas with XOR and MUX Operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000274537600011"}
