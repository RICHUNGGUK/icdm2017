Field merge is perfect to de-interlace the film mode video sequence in which repeated fields or even/odd fields from the same film frame are contained. In this paper, inter-field difference is compared with a threshold, and repetition pattern of the result is utilized to determine the film mode. The threshold is set variable by tracking the local minimum difference of previous and subsequent fields. Film modes with repeated fields are identified using frame difference pattern. The 2-2 film mode is decided if forward and backward field differences jaggedly swing in opposite direction. Other film modes with fields from the same film frame are recognized by the combination of frame difference and forward field difference patterns. In this way, correct field merge is guaranteed after knowing which adjacent fields are decomposed from the same film frame. Experimental results show that various film modes in television systems, animations, camcorders and particularly interlaced network video can be correctly recognized by proposed method.", "paper_title": "A threshold-adaptive film mode detection method in video de-interlacing", "paper_id": "WOS:000344744200013"}
