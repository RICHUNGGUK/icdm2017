The paper focuses on gradual changes in topological relationships caused by continuous transformations of the regions (specifically, translations). Using a series of experiments, the conceptualisation and perception of conceptual neighborhoods is investigated. In particular, the role of conceptual neighborhoods in characterising motion events is scrutinised. The experiments employ a grouping paradigm and a custom-made tool for presenting animated icons. The analysis examines whether paths through a conceptual neighborhood graph sufficiently characterise the conceptualisation of the movement of two regions. The results of the experiments show that changes in topological relations - as detailed by paths through a conceptual neighborhood graph - are not sufficient to characterise the cognitive conceptualisation of moving regions. The similarity ratings show clear effects of perceptually and conceptually induced groupings such as identity (which region is moving), reference (whether a larger or a smaller region is moving), and dynamics (whether both regions are moving at the same time).", "paper_title": "Identifying factors of geographic event conceptualisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000253737600004"}
