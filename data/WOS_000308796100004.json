As a side effect, our architecture inherently supports authentication and mobility of the entities involved in the communication. Moreover, it is designed to be agnostic to any underlying network infrastructure and can be used to enhance them with reduced penalty, which makes it a perfect component to take its features to existing networks without defining a brand new transport layer. We also show the successful verification of the protocol security and demonstrate its feasibility and scalability showing its behavior when instantiated on top of two different architectures.", "paper_title": "A Novel Identity-based Network Architecture for Next Generation Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000308796100004"}
