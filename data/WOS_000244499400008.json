A sliding-mode control (SMC) approach is used to enforce the algebraic constraints of the DAEs. Time delays associated with network communication give rise to a sliding-control problem with sensor time delays. A new approach is presented that decouples this problem into two independent problems. Using this property, a mixed H-infinity optimization approach is applied to minimize errors. The results are applied to solve the problem of the optimal bandwidth allocation between the processors under the constraint of limited communication bandwidth. Experimental results for a distributed simulation application on a TDMA network demonstrate the validity of the approach.", "paper_title": "Distributed simulation of differential algebraic systems using optimal sliding-mode control", "paper_id": "WOS:000244499400008"}
