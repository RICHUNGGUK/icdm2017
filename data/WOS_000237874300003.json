The FluorMOD project was launched in 2002 by the European Space Agency (ESA) to advance the science of vegetation fluorescence simulation through the development and integration of leaf and canopy fluorescence models based on physical methods. The design of airborne or space missions dedicated to the measurement of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence using remote-sensing instruments require physical methods for quantitative feasibility analysis and sensor specification studies. The FluorMODgui model developed as part of this project is designed to simulate the effects of chlorophyll fluorescence at leaf and canopy levels using atmospheric inputs, running the leaf model, FluorMODleaf, and the canopy model, FluorSAIL, independently, through a coupling scheme, and by a multiple iteration protocol to simulate changes in the viewing geometry and atmospheric characteristics. Inputs for the FluorMODleaf model are the number of leaf layers, chlorophyll a + b content, water equivalent thickness, dry matter content, fluorescence quantum efficiency, temperature, species type, and stoichiometry. Inputs for the FluorSAIL canopy model are a MODTRAN-46-parameter spectra or measured direct horizontal irradiance and diffuse irradiance spectra, a soil reflectance spectrum, leaf reflectance & transmittance spectra and a excitation-fluorescence response matrix in upward and downward directions (all from FluorMODleaf), 2 PAR-dependent coefficients for the fluorescence response to light level, relative azimuth angle and viewing zenith angle, canopy leaf area index, leaf inclination distribution function, and a hot spot parameter. Outputs available in the 400-1000 nm spectral range from the graphical user interface, FluorMODgui, are the leaf spectral reflectance and transmittance, and the canopy reflectance, with and without fluorescence effects. In addition, solar and sky irradiance on the ground, radiance with and without fluorescence on the ground, and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances for bare soil and surroundings same as target are also produced.
