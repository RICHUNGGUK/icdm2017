Taking full advantage of such data has attracted a growing amount of research interest from both academia and industry. However, efficient processing of top-k queries in RDF data is still a new topic. Most existing approaches ignore top-k queries, or only provide a limited number of ranking functions. In this paper, we provide an effective and efficient processing algorithm for top-k queries that consists of a novel tree-style index MS-tree and MS-tree-based filtering and pattern-matching functions. Firstly, candidate entities in RDF data were efficiently ranked and filtered through an MS-tree-based topdown method. Then, query structure patterns are matched in RDF data through graphic exploration. In order to handle more complex scoring functions, a dynamic variable selecting optimization is employed to accelerate the threshold decrease. We evaluate our solutions with both synthetic and real-world datasets. The experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
