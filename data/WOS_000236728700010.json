Design/methodology/approach - The system dynamics model for an isolated foundation and solution technique for obtaining system response under impact loads is introduced. A design optimization problem is formulated to minimize the maximum impact force transmissibility under design constraints, using stiffness and damping coefficients of the isolator, mass of the foundation block and support area of soil as design variables. A dedicated simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is applied to solve the optimization problem. Findings - Viscous spring isolator mounting system, if properly designed, can considerably reduce shock and vibration transmission and the size of the foundation. The optimization leads to a mounting system with superior impact and vibration isolation capability over conventional designs. Sensitivity study and design optimization on a typical 3-ton forging hammer has demonstrated the advantages of the new design method. Research limitations/implications - To further improve the accuracy of the design optimization, a more detailed system dynamics model might be introduced. Practical implications - The work leads to a better design method for viscous spring isolator foundation systems. Originality/value - This study forms the foundation for further research on design optimization of viscous spring isolator foundation systems, and contributes to the application of SA optimization technique to engineering design.", "paper_title": "Design optimization of low impact transmission foundation for forging hammers", "paper_id": "WOS:000236728700010"}
