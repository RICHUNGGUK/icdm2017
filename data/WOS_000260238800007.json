There is a trade-off between clients' access time and throughput for update mobile transactions in on-demand data dissemination environments. Data scheduling at the fixed server can allow more transactions to commit while retaining the access time for each transaction. In this paper, we present a data scheduling scheme for both read only and update mobile transactions in pull-based broadcasting environments. Rather than consider access time, which is well studied elsewhere in [1, 2, 3], our concern is to examine the probability that a mobile transaction is able to avoid conflict and commit. Specifically, a set of formulas giving an analysis of this probability is examined Furthermore, a report of a simulation study for validating these formulas is also provided.", "paper_title": "Modelling Concurrent Mobile Transactions Execution in Broadcasting Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000260238800007"}
