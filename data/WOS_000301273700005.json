The characteristic features of this scheme are the uniform convergence with respect to the anisotropy parameter 0 < epsilon << 1, the applicability (on cartesian grids) to cases of non-uniform and non-aligned anisotropy fields b and the simple extension to the case of a non-constant anisotropy intensity 1/epsilon. The mathematical approach and the numerical scheme are different from those presented in the previous work [P. Degond, F. Deluzet, A. Lozinski, J. Narski, C. Negulescu, Duality-based asymptotic-preserving method for highly anisotropic diffusion equations, Communications in Mathematical Sciences 10 (1) (2012) 1-31] and its considerable advantages are pointed out.
