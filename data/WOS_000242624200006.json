Its main feature is that the scale of the extracted map can be variable through its domain, while each entity maintains consistent combinatorial relations with the rest of entities represented in the map. The model is based on a set of operators, called updates, which modify the level of detail in a small portion of a map. The set of updates is partially ordered, and can therefore be represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph, which defines our multi-scale structure. An algorithm to extract a map at the required resolution is proposed, and a lower bound for the number of different maps which can be extracted from the model is given. The model supports map data processing operations (e.g., querying), as well as progressive and selective transmission of maps over a network.", "paper_title": "Multi-VMap: A multi-scale model for vector maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000242624200006"}
