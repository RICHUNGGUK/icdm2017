To verify the performance of the wavelet analysis in the treatment of odor patterns, we compare two widely used artificial nose classifiers, multi-layer perceptron neural network and time delay neural network in the analysis of signals generated by eight conducting polymer sensors exposed to gases derived from the petroliferous industry.
