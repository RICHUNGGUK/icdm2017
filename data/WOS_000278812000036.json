The information tends to spread evenly among these coefficients. As a consequence, Kashin's representations have a great power for reduction of errors in their coefficients, including coefficient losses and distortions.", "paper_title": "Uncertainty Principles and Vector Quantization", "paper_id": "WOS:000278812000036"}
