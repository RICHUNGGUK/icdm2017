In this brief, we present decomposition algorithms to develop novel systolic structures for digit-level Gaussian normal basis multiplication over GF(2(m)). The proposed architectures are suitable for high-performance applications, which require fast computations in finite fields with high throughputs. We also present the results of our application-specific integrated circuit synthesis using a 65-nm standard-cell library to benchmark the effectiveness of the proposed systolic architectures. The presented architectures for multiplication can result in more efficient and high-performance VLSI systems.", "paper_title": "Systolic Gaussian Normal Basis Multiplier Architectures Suitable for High-Performance Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000364208100041"}
