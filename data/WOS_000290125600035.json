They showed that although the indistinguishability in the BBM model is induced from that in the conventional model, its reduction is far from tight in general, and this brings a serious key length problem. In this paper, we discuss PKE schemes in which the IND-CCA security in the BBM model can be obtained tightly from the IND-CCA security. We call such PKE schemes IND-CCA secure in the BBM model with invariant security reductions (briefly, SR-invariant IND-CCABB\" secure). These schemes never suffer from the underlying key length problem in the BBM model. We present three instances of an SR-invariant IND-CCA' secure PKE scheme: the first is based on the Fujisaki-Okamoto PKE scheme [7], the second is based on the Bellare-Rogaway PKE scheme [3], and the last is based on the Cramer-Shoup PKE scheme [5].", "paper_title": "Public-Key Encryptions with Invariant Security Reductions in the Multi-User Setting", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125600035"}
