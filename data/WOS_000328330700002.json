With the increasing complexity of embedded systems, these tools are particularly relevant in embedded systems design. In this paper, we present our evaluation of a broad selection of recent HLS tools in terms of capabilities, usability and quality of results. Even though HLS tools are still lacking some maturity, they are constantly improving and the industry is now starting to adopt them into their design flows.", "paper_title": "An overview of today's high-level synthesis tools", "paper_id": "WOS:000328330700002"}
