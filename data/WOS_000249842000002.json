This architecture decodes one coefficient per cycle based on the proposed word-level decoding algorithm. This algorithm eliminates state variable memories by decoding all bit-planes in parallel. The proposed column-switching scan order overcomes intra bit-plane dependency and inter bit-plane dependency to enable parallel processing. Implementation results show that the proposed architecture is capable of decoding 54 MSamples/s at 54 MHz, which can support HDTV 720p (1280 x 720, 4:2:2) decoding at 30 frames/s.", "paper_title": "Word-level parallel architecture of JPEG 2000 embedded block coding decoder", "paper_id": "WOS:000249842000002"}
