Intermediate nodes leverage on the broadcast nature of wireless medium access to perform inter-session network coding among different flows. This problem is challenging due to the interaction among nodes, and has been addressed so far only in the saturated mode where all nodes always have packet to send, which results in infinite packet delay. In this paper, we provide a novel model based on multi-class queueing networks to investigate the problem in unsaturated mode. We devise a theoretical framework for computing maximum stable throughput of network coding for a slotted ALOHA-based random access system. Using our formulation, we compare the performance of network coding and traditional routing. Our results show that network coding leads to high throughput gain over traditional routing. We also define a new metric, network unbalance ratio (NUR), that indicates the unbalance status of the utilization factors at different nodes. We show that although the throughput gain of the network coding compared to the traditional routing decreases when the number of nodes tends to infinity, NUR of the former outperforms the latter. We carry out simulations to confirm our theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Maximum Stable Throughput of Network-Coded Multiple Broadcast Sessions for Wireless Tandem Random Access Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000339168800008"}
