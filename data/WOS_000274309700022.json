Among other things, this method allows an efficient computation of the minimum energy path (MEP) during the nucleation process. The MEP provides information about the size, shape and free energy barrier of the critical nucleus. To improve the efficiency of the string method, a special initialization process is proposed. Constraints from physical models are treated using two methods, a generalized coordinates method and a projection method. Strategies for choosing the computational domain and defining the nucleus boundary are also introduced. The validity of our approach is illustrated by two nontrivial examples from soft condensed matter physics, namely the nematic-isotropic transition of liquid crystals and the ordered-to-ordered phase transition of diblock copolymers.
