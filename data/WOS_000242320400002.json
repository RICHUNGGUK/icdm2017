To formulate Hindman's theorem [51 and the Central Sets Theorem we set up some notation. By P-f(omega) we denote the set of all finite nonempty subsets of omega = N boolean OR{0}. For a sequence < x(n)>(infinity)(n=0) in N we put FS(< x(n)>(infinity)(n=0)) :={Sigma(t alpha is an element of)x(t) :alpha is an element of P-f(omega)}A set A subset of N is called an IP-set if and only if there exists a sequence (Xn)'11=o in N such that FS((x,,)Io) s A. (These definitions make perfect sense in any semigroup (S,(.)) and we indeed plan to use them in this context. FS is an abbreviation of finite sums and will be replaced by FP if we use multiplicative notation for the semigroup operation.) Now Hindman's theorem states that in any finite partition of N one of the cells is an IP-set. K. Milliken and A. Taylor [7, 8] found a quite natural cornmon extension of the theorems of Hindman and Ramsey. For a sequence < x(n)>(infinity)(n=0) in N and k >= 1 put [FS(< x(n)>(infinity)(n=0))](<)(k) := {{Sigma(t is an element of alpha 1) x(t),(...), Sigma(t is an element of alpha k) x(t)} : alpha 1 <(...)< alpha(k) is an element of P-f(omega)} where we write alpha < beta for alpha, beta is an element of Pf (omega) if and only if max alpha < min beta. For an arbitrary set S let [S](k) be the set of all finite subsets of S consisting of exactly k elements. if [N](k) boolean OR(r)(i-1) A(i) then there exist i is an element of {1,2,...,r} and a sequence < x(n)>(infinity)(n=0) in N such that FS[< x(n)>(infinity)(n=0)](<)(k) subset of A(i).", "paper_title": "A multidimensional central sets theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000242320400002"}
