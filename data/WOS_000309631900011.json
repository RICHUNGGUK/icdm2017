A special class of T-spline surfaces is examined, which is characterized to have a global knot vector in one parameter direction and individual knot vectors from row to row in the other parameter direction. These T-spline surfaces are suitable for lofted surface interpolation or approximation. A skinning algorithm using these T-spline surfaces is proposed, which does not require the knot compatibility of sectional curves. The algorithm consists of three main steps: generating sectional curves by interpolating data points of each row by a B-spline curve; computing the control curves of a skinning surface that interpolates the sectional curves; and approximating each control curve by a B-spline curve with fewer knots, which results in a T-spline surface. Compared with conventional B-spline surface skinning, the proposed T-spline surface skinning has two advantages. First, the sectional curves and the control curves of a T-spline surface can be constructed independently. Second, the generated T-spline skinning surface usually has much fewer control points than a lofted B-spline surface that fits the data points with the same error bound. Experimental examples have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
