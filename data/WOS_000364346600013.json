This paper provides a comprehensive survey of theoretical developments and various applications of fuzzy membrane computing, and sketches future research lines. The theoretical developments are reviewed from the aspects of uncertainty processing in P systems, fuzzification of P systems and fuzzy knowledge representation and reasoning. The applications of fuzzy membrane computing are mainly focused on fuzzy knowledge representation and fault diagnosis. An overview of different types of fuzzy P systems, differences between spiking neural P systems and fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems and newly obtained results on these P systems are presented.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Membrane Computing: Theory and Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000364346600013"}
