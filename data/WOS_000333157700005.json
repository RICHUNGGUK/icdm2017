Considering this scenario, an improved joint subcarrier and bit allocation scheme for cognitive user with primary users' cooperation (PU Coop) in CRN is proposed. In this scheme, the optimization problem is formulated to minimize the average interference power level at the PU receiver via PU Coop, which guarantees a higher primary signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) while maintaining the secondary user total rate constraint. The joint optimal scheme is separated into subcarrier allocation and bit assignment in each subcarrier via arith-metric geo-metric (AM-GM) inequality with asymptotical optimization solution. Moreover, the joint subcarrier and bit optimization scheme, which is evaluated by the available SU subcarriers and the allocated bits, is analyzed in the proposed PU Coop model. The performance of cognitive spectral efficiency and the average interference power level are investigated. Numerical analysis indicates that the SU's spectral efficiency increases significantly compared with the PU non-cooperation scenario. Moreover, the interference power level decreases dramatically for the proposed scheme compared with the traditional Hughes-Hartogs bit allocation scheme.", "paper_title": "Joint Subcarrier and Bit Allocation for Secondary User with Primary Users' Cooperation", "paper_id": "WOS:000333157700005"}
