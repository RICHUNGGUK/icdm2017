After relaxing the indicator function in GMM, flexible spatial regularization can be adopted and efficient segmentation can be achieved. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, the global, local intensity information and the spatial smoothness are integrated into a new model, and it can work well on images with inhomogeneous intensity and noise. Compared to classical GMM, numerical experiments have demonstrated that our algorithm can achieve promising segmentation performance for images degraded by intensity inhomogeneity and noise.", "paper_title": "Image Segmentation Using a Local GMM in a Variational Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000318795800001"}
