Design/methodology/approach - The incorporation of SIBC into the FDTD method is described for the general case. The excitation of a field problem by a field pattern and the transition from the field solution to a circuit representation by SPs is discussed. Findings - SPs obtained by FDTD with SIBC are validated with semi-analytic solutions and compared with results obtained by different numerical methods. Results of a microstrip, with a discontinuity considering losses are presented demonstrating the capability of the present method. Originality/value - The comparison of numerical results obtained by different methods demonstrates the capability of the present method to extract SPs from PCBs very efficiently.", "paper_title": "Extraction of circuit parameters from PCB by FDTD and SIBC", "paper_id": "WOS:000269323700025"}
