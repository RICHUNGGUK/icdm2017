The advantages of this architecture are its simplicity and scalability, while its main drawback is the possible out-of-sequence reception of packets belonging to the same flow. Several solutions have been proposed to overcome this problem; among the most promising are the Uniform Frame Spreading (UFS) and the Full Ordered Frames First (FOFF) algorithms. In this paper, we present a new algorithm called Padded Frames (PF), which eliminates the packet reordering problem, achieves 100% throughput, and improves the delay performance of previously known algorithms.", "paper_title": "Padded Frames: A Novel Algorithm for Stable Scheduling in Load-Balanced Switches", "paper_id": "WOS:000260463100017"}
