The approach is based on factorizing the latent space (feature space) into a shared component and a data-specific component with the dimensionality of these components (spaces) inferred via a beta-Bernoulli process. The proposed approach is demonstrated by jointly analyzing gene expression/copy number variations and gene expression/methylation data for ovarian cancer patients, showing that the proposed model can potentially uncover key drivers related to cancer.", "paper_title": "Bayesian joint analysis of heterogeneous genomics data", "paper_id": "WOS:000336530000005"}
