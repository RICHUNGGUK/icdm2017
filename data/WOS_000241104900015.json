We define a new class of tree patterns for unordered 0-1 data and consider the problem of discovering frequently occurring members of this pattern class. Intuitively, a tree T occurs in a row u of the data, if the attributes of T that occur in u form a subtree of T containing the root. We show that this definition has advantageous properties: only shallow trees have a significant probability of occurring in random data, and the definition allows a simple levelwise algorithm for mining all frequently occurring trees. We demonstrate with empirical results that the method is feasible and that it discovers interesting trees in real data.", "paper_title": "Finding trees from unordered 0-1 data", "paper_id": "WOS:000241104900015"}
