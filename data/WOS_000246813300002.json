We deal with the specification of the inheritance relationship since Kenzo is an object-oriented system, written in CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System. We show how the order-sorted algebraic specification formalism can be adapted, through the \"inheritance as coercion\" metaphor, in order to model the simple inheritance between structures in Kenzo.", "paper_title": "Modeling inheritance as coercion in the Kenzo system", "paper_id": "WOS:000246813300002"}
