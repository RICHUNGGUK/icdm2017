It is shown that we can find for each countable family of stochastic relations on Polish spaces a family of relations defined on a hyperfinite set that is infinitely close. This is applied to Kripke models for a simple modal logic in the tradition of Larsen and Skou. It follows that we can find for each Kripke model a hyperfinite one which is infinitely close.", "paper_title": "Hyperfinite approximations to labeled Markov transition systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239425400012"}
