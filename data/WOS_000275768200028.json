As a pre-requisite, the system should be enabled to recognize the spokesperson, who is speaking to it However, in the realistic scene, the noise from the complex environment may cause some difficulties for the system to realize this function By imitating the performance of human, we try to use the eyes of the robot to solve the problem In this research, we propose a new spokesperson detection method based on image processing The system might find and identified all the possible spokesperson around it, by detecting and recognizing the faces in the video form the cameras on the robot It might also find out the spokesperson who is speaking to it, by judging the mouth action of possible spokesperson Using eye cameras and an omni-directional camera, we tried to realize the system and some experiments were conducted to verify the new method", "paper_title": "SPOKESPERSON DETECTION METHOD FOR AUTONOMOUS ROBOT IN COMPLEX COMMUNICATION ENVIRONMENT, BASED ON IMAGE PROCESSING", "paper_id": "WOS:000275768200028"}
