However, Al-Sultan did not consider the quality cost for the product within the specification limits, pointed out that the non-conforming items in the sample of accepted lot is replaced or eliminated from the lot, and proposed an integrated model with production and quality. In this study, the author considers the problem of quality loss for the modified Al-Sultan's model with k machines in a serial production system based on a single sampling rectifying inspection plan. Taguchi's symmetric quadratic quality loss function is applied in evaluating the product quality. Then, the author further proposes a modified and integrated economic manufacturing quantity (EMQ) model based on the application of the modified Al-Sultan's model for obtaining the maximum expected total profit of product per unit of time. The numerical results show that the price of an accepted products sold has the most important effect on both the process means and the expected total profit per unit of time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
