The main challenge encountered in industry as well as in academia is to develop secure products, prove their security correctness, measure their resilience to attacks, and check if vulnerabilities exist. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art related to security specification, verification, and quantification for software and systems that are modeled by using UML or SysML language. The reviewed work fall into the field of secure software and systems engineering that aims at fulfilling the security as an afterthought in the development of secure systems.", "paper_title": "Specification, verification, and quantification of security in model-based systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000356943700003"}
