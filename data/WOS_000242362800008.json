A laboratory experiment was conducted to address these questions. Using a 2x2 factorial design, the analysis indicates that polarization is a function of the interaction of medium and task. However, satisfaction with the process and outcomes is dependent on only the medium of communication. The findings reported in this study have significance for developers, users and researchers of collaborative systems and for researchers interested in group dynamics.", "paper_title": "Polarization and dissatisfaction in group settings", "paper_id": "WOS:000242362800008"}
