The resource allocation problem is modeled as a noncooperative game, in which each user equipment is self-interested and wants to maximize its own EE. Given the SE requirement and maximum transmission power constraints, a distributed energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm is proposed by exploiting the properties of the nonlinear fractional programming. The relationships between the EE and SE tradeoff of the proposed algorithm and system parameters are analyzed and verified through computer simulations.", "paper_title": "Energy Efficiency and Spectral Efficiency Tradeoff in Device-to-Device (D2D) Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681600010"}
