Input factors arc explored via a D-optimal design with 15 runs and used as training data in the neural network. In order to verify the fitness of the model, three more runs arc added as test data. Latin hypercube sampling and error back-propagation algorithm are used to build the model. Latin hypercube sampling is used to generate initial weights and biases of the network. The thickness of cellgap is measured at five points: one at the center and four at the edges. The average thickness is used as cellgap thickness, and the uniformity is obtained by comparing the thickness at the center and edge points. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
