Lattice codes are first used to transform the G-IFC into a discrete input-output noiseless channel, and subsequently algebraic codes are developed to achieve good rates over this new alphabet. In this context, a quantity called efficiency is introduced which reflects the effectiveness of the algebraic coding strategy. This paper first addresses the problem of finding high-efficiency algebraic codes. A combination of these codes with Construction-A lattices is then used to achieve nontrivial rates for the original G-IFC.", "paper_title": "Achievable Rates for K-User Gaussian Interference Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000305575000021"}
