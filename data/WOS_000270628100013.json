Each of them presents a different viewpoint of the same information systems engineering process. However, there are no existing correspondences between them. We propose a method to build unified, fitted and multi-viewpoint process metamodels for information systems engineering. Our method is based on a process domain metamodel that contains the main concepts of information systems engineering process field. This process domain metamodel helps selecting the needed metamodel concepts for a particular situational context. Our method is also based on patterns to refine the process metamodel. The process metamodel can then be instantiated according to the organisation's needs. The resulting method is represented as a pattern system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
