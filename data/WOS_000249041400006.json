There are two cases, where the assignments to leaves are independently distributed (ID) and correlated distributed (CD). In the ID case, we prove that the distributional probability p belongs to [root 7-13, root 5-1/2], and rho is a strictly increasing function on rounds 3 2 k epsilon [1, infinity). In the CD case, we propose a reverse assigning technique (RAT) to form two particular sets of assignments, 1-set and 0-set, then show that the E-1-distribution (namely, a particular distribution on the assignments of I-set such that all the deterministic algorithms have the same complexity) is the unique eigen-distribution for T-2(k) in the global distribution. 2 (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
