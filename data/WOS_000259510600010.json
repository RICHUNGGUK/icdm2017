Design/methodology/approach - By assuming isotropic conditions, the hot aluminum material is described as a non-linear Newtonian fluid material. Semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations algorithm is used to calculate the physical fields, and the dynamic viscosity is updated then. Volume of fluid method and moving grid method are also used for unsteady flow to catch the free surface of the material and the moving bound. Findings - FVM model in this paper is an accurate and efficient method for the numerical simulation of aluminum profile extrusion processes. Compared with finite element method software, FVM model is both memory and CPU efficient. Practical implications - Provide theoretical reference for sound extrusion process and die designs, which are the key factors to produce desirable products in industrial production. Originality/value - The paper finds an efficient way to introduce the FVM in computational fluid dynamics field into the simulation of the steady and unsteady aluminum alloy profile extrusion processes. It provides a reference for people who are interested in FVM and extrusion processes.", "paper_title": "Numerical simulation of steady and unsteady aluminum profile extrusion processes using finite volume method", "paper_id": "WOS:000259510600010"}
