Nowadays, energy-aware and green communication protocols are important research topics, specially when deploying wireless mobile networks. This article introduces a fast automatic methodology to search for energy-efficient OLSR configurations by using a parallel evolutionary algorithm. The experimental analysis demonstrates that significant improvements over the standard configuration can be attained in terms of power consumption, with no noteworthy loss in the QoS.", "paper_title": "Fast energy-aware OLSR routing in VANETs by means of a parallel evolutionary algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000322775400010"}
