Such processes model opinion/disease spreading or fault propagation and have been studied under names such as irreversible threshold/majority processes in a large variety of contexts. Our contributions concern computational aspects related to the minimum cardinality irr(f) (G) of sets of vertices with initial label 1 such that during the process on G all vertices eventually change their label to 1. Such sets are known as irreversible conversion sets, dynamic irreversible monopolies, or catastrophic fault patterns. Answering a question posed by Dreyer and Roberts [P.A. Dreyer Jr., F.S. Roberts, Irreversible k-threshold processes: graph-theoretical threshold models of the spread of disease and of opinion, Discrete Appl. Math. 157 (2009) 1615-1627], we prove a hardness result for irr(f) (G) where f (upsilon) = 2 for every upsilon is an element of V (G). Furthermore, we describe a general reduction principle for irr(f) (G), which leads to efficient algorithms for graphs with simply structured blocks such as trees and chordal graphs.
