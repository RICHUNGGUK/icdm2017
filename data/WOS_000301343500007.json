However, the application of SFN is still restricted by a large amount of feedback. Therefore, we propose a multicast resource allocation scheme based on limited feedback to maximize the total rate while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) requirement of real-time services. In this scheme, we design a user feedback control algorithm to effectively reduce feedback load. The algorithm determines to which base stations the users should report channel state information. We then formulate a joint subcarrier and power allocation issue and find that it has high complexity. Hence, we first distribute subcarriers under the assumption of equal power and develop a proportional allocation strategy to achieve a tradeoff between fairness and QoS. Next, an iterative water-filling power allocation is proposed to fully utilize the limited power. To further decrease complexity, a power iterative scheme is introduced. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves system performance while reducing 68% of the feedback overhead. In addition, the power iterative strategy is suitable in practice due to low complexity.", "paper_title": "Resource allocation algorithm with limited feedback for multicast single frequency networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000301343500007"}
