The novelty of this work is twofold. At first, we propose a count sort algorithm for integers that needs no synchronization at its last step and thus, offers superior performance. At second, this work contributes ad hoc techniques for optimizing the performance of the algorithm on Compute Unified Device Architecture-enabled graphics processing units.
