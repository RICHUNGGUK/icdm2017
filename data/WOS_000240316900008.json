We study the case that M is a circulant and k = 2(2t) for some positive integer t. New structural results are obtained. Based on these results, we make a complete computer search for all circulant weighing matrices of order 16.", "paper_title": "Circulant weighing matrices of weight 2(2t) supercript stop", "paper_id": "WOS:000240316900008"}
