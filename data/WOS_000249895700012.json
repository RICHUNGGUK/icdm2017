The velocity field and temperature distribution of the gas and particles are analysed during the heat transfer process. The simulation shows that the change of gas velocity with the distance from immersed surface is consistent with the variation of bed voidage, and is used to validate approximately dimensional analysing result that the gas velocity between immersed surface and particles is 4.6U(mf)/epsilon(mf). The effects of particle size and particle residence time on the thermal penetration depth and the heat-transfer coefficients are also discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. and Civil-Comp Ltd.
