Both sensor-to-controller (S-C) and controller-to-actuator (C-A) random network-induced delays are considered. Two independent Markov chains are used to model the S-C and C-A random delays. The resulting closed-loop system is a jump linear time-delay system induced by two Markov chains. Sufficient conditions for existence of H (2)/H (a) controller are established by free-weighting matrix and stochastic Lyapunov functions. A simulation example illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "H (2)/H (a) control of networked control system with random time delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000297709400016"}
