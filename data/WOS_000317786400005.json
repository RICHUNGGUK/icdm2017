With the effect of self-feedback connection and non-linear delay connection weight, the new algorithm can contain more powerful chaotic dynamics to search the solution domain globally in the beginning searching period. By analyzing the dynamic characteristic and the influence of cooling schedule in simulated annealing, a flexible parameter tuning strategy being able to promote chaotic dynamics convergence quickly is introduced into our algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the new algorithm in two difficult combinatorial optimization problems, i.e., a traveling salesman problem and a maximum clique problem.", "paper_title": "Dynamic characteristic of a multiple chaotic neural network and its application", "paper_id": "WOS:000317786400005"}
