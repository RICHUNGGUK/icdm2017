The model combines a Network Utility Maximization for rate control based on end-to-end queueing delays, with a Markovian Traffic Equilibrium for routing based on total expected delays. We prove the existence of a unique equilibrium state which is characterized as the solution of an unconstrained strictly convex program. A distributed algorithm for solving this optimization problem is proposed, with a brief discussion of how it could be implemented by adapting the current Internet protocols.", "paper_title": "Network congestion control with Markovian multipath routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000342158300009"}
