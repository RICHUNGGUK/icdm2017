A new updating method based on component mode synthesis (CMS) was proposed to improve the efficiency of FE model updating of large-scale structures. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated by updating the FE model of a scaled bridge model with measured modal parameters.", "paper_title": "UPDATING THE FINITE ELEMENT MODEL OF LARGE-SCALED STRUCTURES USING COMPONENT MODE SYNTHESIS TECHNIQUE", "paper_id": "WOS:000316644600002"}
