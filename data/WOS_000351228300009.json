It gives a unified simple proof that the endpoints of complementary pivoting paths have opposite sign. A special case are the Nash equilibria of a bimatrix game at the ends of Lemke-Howson paths, which have opposite index. For Euler complexes or \"oiks\", an orientation is defined which extends the known concept of oriented abstract simplicial manifolds. Ordered \"room partitions\" for a family of oriented oiks come in pairs of opposite sign. For an oriented oik of even dimension, this sign property holds also for unordered room partitions. In the case of a two-dimensional oik, these are perfect matchings of an Euler graph, with the sign as defined for Pfaffian orientations of graphs. A near-linear time algorithm is given for the following problem: given a graph with an Eulerian orientation with a perfect matching, find another perfect matching of opposite sign. In contrast, the complementary pivoting algorithm for this problem may be exponential.", "paper_title": "Oriented Euler complexes and signed perfect matchings", "paper_id": "WOS:000351228300009"}
