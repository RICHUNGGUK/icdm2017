We show that a generic feedback AGC mechanism, incorporating a nonlinear synaptic interaction into the feedback loop of a neural network, can enhance and emphasize important image attributes, such as curvature, size, depth, convexity/concavity and more, similar to its role in the adjustment of photoreceptors and retinal network sensitivity over the extremely high dynamic range of environmental light intensities, while enhancing the contrast. We further propose that visual illusions, well established by psychophysical experiments, are a by-product of the multidimensional AGC. This hypothesis is supported by simulations implementing AGC, which reproduce psychophysical data regarding size contrast effects known as the Ebbinghaus illusion, and depth contrast effects. Processing of curvature by an AGC network illustrates that it is an important mechanism of image structure pre-emphasis, which thereby enhances saliency. It is argued that the generic neural network of AGC constitutes a universal, parsimonious, unified mechanism of neurobiological automatic contrast sensitivity control. This mechanism/model can account for a wide range of physiological and psychophysical phenomena, such as visual illusions and contour completion, in cases of occlusion, by a basic neural network. Likewise, and as important, biologically motivated AGC provides attractive new means for the development of intelligent computer vision systems.", "paper_title": "Multidimensional gain control in image representation and processing in vision", "paper_id": "WOS:000351517700003"}
