In this article, we target out-of-vocabulary words in short text messages and propose a method for identifying and normalizing lexical variants. Our method uses a classifier to detect lexical variants, and generates correction candidates based on morphophonemic similarity. Both word similarity and context are then exploited to select the most probable correction candidate for the word. The proposed method doesn't require any annotations, and achieves state-of-the-art performance over an SMS corpus and a novel dataset based on Twitter.", "paper_title": "Lexical Normalization for Social Media Text", "paper_id": "WOS:000321962000005"}
