Bacteria Foraging Algorithm (BFA), as reported by electrical engineers, is the most robust and efficient algorithm in comparison with other presently available algorithms for global optimization of multi-objective, multi-parameter design problems. The objective of this article is to apply this new optimization technique, BFA, in the design of Yagi-Uda array for multi-objective design parameters. We optimize length and spacing for 6 and 15 elements array to achieve higher directivity, pertinent input impedance, minimum 3-dB beam width, and maximum front to back ratio both in the E and H planes of the array. At first, we develop a Method of Moments code in MATLAB environment for the Yagi-Uda array structure for obtaining the above design parameters and then coupled with the BFA for the evaluation of the optimized design parameters. Detail simulation results are included to confirm the design criteria. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
