To our knowledge, this task has not been previously solved with spiking neural networks. Input to the network was drawn from the state of the acrobot, and output was torque, either directly applied to the actuated joint, or via the switching of an LQR controller designed for balance. The neural network's weights were tuned using a (mu + lambda)-evolution strategy without recombination, and neurons' parameters, were chosen to roughly approximate biological neurons.", "paper_title": "A small spiking neural network with LQR control applied to the acrobot", "paper_id": "WOS:000264550900006"}
