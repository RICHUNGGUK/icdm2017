We define modal relational algebras and give the seminaive evaluation algorithm, the top-down evaluation algorithm, and the magic-set transformation for MDatalog queries. The results of this paper like soundness and completeness of the top-down evaluation algorithm or correctness of the magic-set transformation are proved for the multimodal logics of belief K DI4(s)5, KDI45, KD4(s)5(s), KD45((m)), KD4I(g)5(a), and the class of serial context-free grammar logics. We also show that MDatalog has PTIME data complexity in the logics KDI4(s)5, KDI45, KD4(s)5(s), and KD45((m)).", "paper_title": "Foundations of modal deductive Databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000250383000006"}
