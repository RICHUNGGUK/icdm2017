The proposed offset cancellation is achieved by body-voltage adjustment using a low-power simple analog control feedback circuit without any additional capacitive loading at the comparator output or complicated digital calibration scheme. The accuracy of the proposed technique is higher than its digital calibration counterparts due to its analog nature. Simulation results in a 1.8 V 0.18 mu m CMOS technology show that using the proposed technique the standard deviation of the comparator offset is significantly reduced from 36.2 to 7.1 mV operating at 1 GHz with only 32 mu W of power dissipation in the offset cancellation circuit.", "paper_title": "An offset cancellation technique for comparators using body-voltage trimming", "paper_id": "WOS:000310639400003"}
