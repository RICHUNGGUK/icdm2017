It is assumed that the system switches among an infinite set of uniformly controllable linear systems, and that the switching signals are not observable, but the switching duration has a lower bound. It will be shown that by combining on-line adaptive estimation and control in the controller design, a feedback control law can be constructed which makes the switched linear system globally stable.", "paper_title": "Stabilization of switched linear systems with bounded disturbances and unobservable switchings", "paper_id": "WOS:000250557500005"}
