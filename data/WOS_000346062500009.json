By studying the equivalent conditions of fuzzy fantastic filter and fuzzy normal filter of BL-algebras, the relation between these two filters are revealed. Two open problems of BL-algebras, i.e.,\"Under what suitable condition a normal filter becomes a fantastic filter? \" and \" Under what suitable condition extension property for normal filter holds? (Extension property for a normal filter)\", are solved accordingly.", "paper_title": "Solutions to Open Problems on Fuzzy Filters of BL-algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000346062500009"}
