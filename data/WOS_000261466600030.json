The implementations of security protocols do not accurately follow the standards and this causes many malfunctions and security flaws. In this paper we will analyze the different approaches followed by the scientific community to evaluate security protocols implementations, and will also analyze the special characteristics of security protocols, in order to deduce which are the key points for such an evaluation, how they can be evaluated and also if existing evaluation techniques can be used.
