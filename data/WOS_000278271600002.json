We also find the asymptotic number of prime 2-orientations (no separating quadrangle) and prime 3-orientations (no separating triangle). The estimates we find are of the form c . n(-alpha)gamma(n), for suitable constants c, alpha, gamma with alpha = 4 for 2-orientations and alpha = 5 for 3-orientations. The proofs are based on singularity analysis of D-finite generating functions, using the Fuchsian theory of complex linear differential equations.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic enumeration of orientations", "paper_id": "WOS:000278271600002"}
