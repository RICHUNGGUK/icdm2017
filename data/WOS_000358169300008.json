These networks, however, do not only have to comply with increasing data rates, but they should also meet the societal green agenda. As the access part consumes a major fraction of the energy consumption in today's fiber-to-the-home-based telecommunication networks, the energy efficiency of NGOA networks should be an important design parameter. In this paper, we present a detailed evaluation of the energy consumption in different NGOA technologies. Furthermore, we analyze the effects of (1) introducing low power modes (e.g., sleep and doze modes) in the various NGOA technologies and (2) using optimal split ratios adjusted to the traffic demands so that the energy consumption is optimized for the desired quality of service level.", "paper_title": "How sleep modes and traffic demands affect the energy efficiency in optical access networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000358169300008"}
