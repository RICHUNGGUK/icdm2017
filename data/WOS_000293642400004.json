In order to apply the wavelet Galerkin scheme the molecular surface needs to be represented as a parametric surface consisting of smooth four-sided patches. We develop an algorithm which decomposes a solvent excluded surface into a set of globally continuous four-sided NURBS patches. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and scope of the present approach.", "paper_title": "Wavelet BEM on molecular surfaces: solvent excluded surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000293642400004"}
