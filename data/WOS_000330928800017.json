Participants were juniors majoring in multimedia design and taking the course Analysis on Digital Game Industry at a university. They were randomly selected and assigned to an experimental group with 43 students or to a control group with 45 students. Students in the experimental group created their personal e-portfolios by using blogs, whereas students in the control group did not. The experiment lasted nine weeks, and took 3 h per week. The study results showed that the experimental group had significantly higher knowledge amassment after using e-portfolios than before. The experimental group had significantly better knowledge amassment than the control group did. This indicated that the effects of blog-based portfolios on knowledge amassment was significantly positive. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
