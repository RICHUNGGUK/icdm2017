It is believed that this effect is due to the foveation filtering. Current techniques to simulate the foveation filtering in computer graphics are either slow or suffer from artifacts and limitations. In this paper, we present a new approach of foveation filtering based on the Mipmap Pyramid of the current view by considering the relationship between the Gaussian kernel and Mipmap level. Due to the nonlinear Mipmap interpolation under the Bilateral Filtering scheme, we are able to simulate the foveation filtering more naturally and efficiently than in previous work. Moreover, a detail enhancement method based on the Cornsweet illusion is proposed to augment the gazing effect. We demonstrate our new approach with a variety of examples and provide comparisons with recent approaches.", "paper_title": "Real-time foveation filtering using nonlinear Mipmap interpolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000278135800052"}
