The proposed bias correction is applied to the weighted least squares estimator proposed by Stute [28] [W. Stute: Consistent estimation under random censorship when covariables are present. J. Multivariate Anal. 45 (1993), 89-103.], and it is based on model-based bootstrap resampling techniques that also allow us to work with censored data. Our bias-corrected estimator proposal is evaluated and its behavior assessed in simulation studies concluding that both the bias and the mean square error are reduced with the new proposal.", "paper_title": "BIAS CORRECTION ON CENSORED LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION MODELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000312568700015"}
