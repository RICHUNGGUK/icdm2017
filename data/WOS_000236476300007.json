The proposed architecture includes distributed news video preprocessing (NVP) server and visualized querying/browsing (VQB) server. The distributed NVP server receives the news video story from news video web (NVW) server and generates the story abstract, i.e., key frames and key sentences. These story abstract are then combined with the news script of a news story, then sent to the VQB server for news video querying and browsing. The VQB server performs semantic clustering using news script to categorize all the news video stories, it also provides a visualized interface displaying the story abstract so that users can fast grasp the main idea of a news story. The superiority of the proposed system has been demonstrated \"sing news video obtained from NVW servers of EraNews, ETtoday and Formosa TV stations in Taiwan.", "paper_title": "Efficient news video querying and browsing based on distributed news video servers", "paper_id": "WOS:000236476300007"}
