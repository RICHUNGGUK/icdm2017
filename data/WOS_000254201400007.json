Isotopism is an important generalisation of isomorphism, and is studied by mathematicians in domains such as loop theory. This extension was not straightforward, and we had to solve two major technical problems, namely, generating and verifying isotopy invariants. Concentrating on the domain of loop theory, we have developed three novel techniques for generating isotopic invariants, by using the notion of universal identities and by using constructions based on subblocks. In addition, given the complexity of the theorems that verify that a conjunction of the invariants form an isotopy class, we have developed ways of simplifying the problem of proving these theorems. Our techniques employ an interplay of computer algebra, model generation, theorem proving, and satisfiability-solving methods. To demonstrate the power of the approach, we generate isotopic classification theorems for loops of size 6 and 7, which extend the previously known enumeration results. This work was previously beyond the capabilities of automated reasoning techniques.", "paper_title": "Automatic construction and verification of isotopy invariants", "paper_id": "WOS:000254201400007"}
