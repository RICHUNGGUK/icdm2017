Based on the statistical property of the noise, a quadratic penalty function technique is utilized in order to obtain a strictly convex model under a mild condition, which guarantees the uniqueness of the solution and the stabilization of the algorithm. For solving the new convex variational model, a primal-dual algorithm is proposed, and its convergence is studied. The paper ends with a report on numerical tests for the simultaneous deblurring and denoising of images subject to multiplicative noise. A comparison with other methods is provided as well.", "paper_title": "A Convex Variational Model for Restoring Blurred Images with Multiplicative Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000326072200017"}
