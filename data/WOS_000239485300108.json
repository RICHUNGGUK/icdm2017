In this paper, an effort has been made to effectively remove noises and reduce the dynamics of the multifibre RSNA signals to a simpler form. For this purpose, an improved cluster method combined with the wavelet-transform-based denoising approach is proposed. The outcomes of the present work show that wavelet denoising approach is a useful toot for analyzing multifibre RSNA in rats. Furthermore, compared to the original algorithm of the cluster method, the improved one reduces some aspects of bias.", "paper_title": "Analysis of multifibre renal sympathetic nerve recordings", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300108"}
