These relationships, derived from the coevolution of genes, provide valuable information in the detection of biological network organization from the local to the system level, in the inference of protein functions and in the identification of functional orthologs. To run the computation, users need to provide the GI IDs of the genes of interest.", "paper_title": "Detecting biological network organization and functional gene orthologs", "paper_id": "WOS:000295680600025"}
