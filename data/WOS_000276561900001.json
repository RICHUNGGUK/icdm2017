Even though decisions are made autonomously and locally, partners should act in a concerted way. For approaching the two main conflicting goals of a high service level and low overall costs throughout the network, there is a need for a specific coordination media for managing the intentions and interactions of the partners. Starting from the design principles, the authors describe a logistics platform that provides a complex service for communicating and evaluating all relevant information that may influence the operation of supply channels. A particular interest is in coordinating a focal supply network that produces customised mass products. The implementation technologies of the system are outlined together with the first lessons of the deployed application.", "paper_title": "Planning in concert: A logistics platform for production networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000276561900001"}
