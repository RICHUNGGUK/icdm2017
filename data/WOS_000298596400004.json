We present some problems arising in consumer theory when deviations are determined by the presence of large traders (monopolies, oligopolies) and/or public goods, and/or uncertainty about possible states of nature on which agents are asymmetrically informed. In all of these cases, considering fuzzy cooperative behavior within a coalition of agents provides cooperative solutions to restore classical results.
