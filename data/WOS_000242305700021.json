It is the weighted sum of within-class variance and intensity contrast between the object and background. Theoretical bounds of the weight are given for the uniformly distributed background and object, followed by the procedure to estimate the weight from prior knowledge. Tests against two real and two synthetic images show that small objects can be extracted successfully irrespective of the complexity of background and difference in class sizes.
