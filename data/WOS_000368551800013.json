One-, two-, and three-stage designs are covered as well as allocations for stratified sampling and probability proportional to size sampling. Sample allocations can be computed that minimize the variance of an estimator subject to a budget constraint or that minimize cost subject to a precision constraint. The package also contains some specialized functions for estimating variance components and design effects. Several finite populations are included that are useful for classroom instruction.", "paper_title": "PracTools: Computations for Design of Finite Population Samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000368551800013"}
