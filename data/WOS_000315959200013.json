To the best of our knowledge, there exists no retrieval-guaranteed location-aware information brokerage scheme with a bounded data retrieval path length and bounded replication and retrieval message overhead costs available for use in 3D wireless ad hoc networks to date. In this paper, we propose a novel location-aware information brokerage scheme, termed LAIB, where the network area is divided into cube grids, and data are replicated and retrieved in the hashed geographic location in each grid designated by the producer and the consumer, respectively. In LAIB, a polylogarithmic number of grids are designated by the producer and by the consumer, and at least one grid, whose distance from the grid of the consumer is smaller than the distance from the grid of the consumer to the grid of the producer, is designated by both the producer and the consumer. Simulations show that, as the network area is divided into a moderate number of grids, LAIB has good performance in term of retrieval latency stretch while ensuring moderate replication memory, replication message, and retrieval message overhead costs.", "paper_title": "Retrieval-Guaranteed Location-Aware Information Brokerage Scheme in 3D Wireless Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000315959200013"}
