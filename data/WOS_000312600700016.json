As linear-sized spectral sparsifiers of complete graphs are expanders, our sparsifiers of arbitrary graphs can be viewed as generalizations of expander graphs. In particular, we prove that for every d > 1 and every undirected, weighted graph G = (V, E, w) on n vertices, there exists a weighted graph H = (V, F, (w) over bar) with at most [d(n -1)] edges such that for every x epsilon R-V, x(T)L(G)x <= x(T)L(H)x <= (d+1+2 root d)/(d+1-2 root d) . x(T)L(G)x, where L-G and L-H are the Laplacian matrices of G and H, respectively. Thus, H approximates G spectrally at least as well as a Ramanujan expander with dn/2 edges approximates the complete graph. We give an elementary deterministic polynomial time algorithm for constructing H.", "paper_title": "TWICE-RAMANUJAN SPARSIFIERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000312600700016"}
