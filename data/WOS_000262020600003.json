Design/methodology/approach - A more accurate method of pressure calculation for closed hydrostatic guideways is introduced. Then, a multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) model is formulated for design of a tool head system, which minimizes the highest pocket pressure under some constraints from machining accuracy and vibration resistance requirements as well as constraints from ballscrew design specifications. Finally, a metamodel-based design space alternation (DSA) strategy is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Findings - The results show that the maximum pocket pressure in a tool head system can be reduced over 47 percent with a proper design while all the constraints are satisfied. As a consequence, the tool head system can safely work under the maximum output pressure of oil supply system. Originality/value - This paper introduces a more accurate method of pressure calculation for multi-pocket closed hydrostatic guideways, develops a metamodel-based MDO model for the tool head system, and proposes a DSA strategy to solve the MDO problem.", "paper_title": "Multidisciplinary design optimization of tool head for heavy duty CNC vertical turning mill", "paper_id": "WOS:000262020600003"}
