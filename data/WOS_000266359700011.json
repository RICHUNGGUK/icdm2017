An attack-resistant and efficient localization scheme is developed, which extends the scheme proposed in [1]. The method offers strong defense against not only distance reduction attacks but also distance enlargement attacks. Furthermore, our method does not employ any device-dependent variables, hence yields more accurate localization. An attack-driven model is also specified using Petri net. It provides a formal method for the verification of our scheme when considering distance enlargement attacks. The state analysis shows that the potential insecure states are unreachable, implying that the model can offer strong defense against these attacks. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the Petri net has been introduced to validate security scheme for wireless sensor networks in the literature.", "paper_title": "Design and Verification of Enhanced Secure Localization Scheme in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000266359700011"}
