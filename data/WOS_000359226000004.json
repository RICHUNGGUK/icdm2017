The proposed approach is based on the framework of the so-called Logical Analysis of Data ( LAD), but enriched with information obtained from statistical considerations on the data. A number of discrete optimization problems are solved in the different steps of the procedure, but their computational demand can be controlled. The accuracy of the proposed approach is compared to that of the standard LAD algorithm, of support vector machines and of label propagation algorithm on publicly available datasets of the UCI repository. Encouraging results are obtained and discussed.", "paper_title": "Effective Classification Using a Small Training Set Based on Discretization and Statistical Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000359226000004"}
