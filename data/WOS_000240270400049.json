These are extracted fully automatically from Norwegian online newspapers. Describing the complete process, we provide an entirely disclosed method for media monitoring and news summarization. For keyword extraction, a reference corpus serves as background about average language use, which is contrasted with the cur-rent day's word frequencies. Having detected the most prominent keywords of a day, we introduce several ways of grouping and displaying them in intuitive ways. A discussion about possible applications concludes. Up to now, the service is available for Norwegian and German. As only some shallow language-specific processing is needed, it can easily be set up for other languages.", "paper_title": "Ord i Dag: Mining Norwegian daily newswire", "paper_id": "WOS:000240270400049"}
