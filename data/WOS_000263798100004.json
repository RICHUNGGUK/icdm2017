We begin with a formal characterization of lexical systems as simple directed graphs, solely made up of nodes corresponding to lexical entities and links. To illustrate our approach, we present data borrowed from a lexical system that has been generated from the French DiCo database. We later explain how the compilation of the original dictionary-like database into a net-like one has been made possible. Finally, we discuss the potential of the proposed lexical structure for designing multilingual lexical resources.", "paper_title": "Lexical systems: graph models of natural language lexicons", "paper_id": "WOS:000263798100004"}
