The objective is to minimize the maximum weighted earliness-tardiness and due-date costs. We present an algorithm to solve this problem. Our algorithm makes use of bottleneck jobs and priority queues, and has a computational complexity of O(n(4) log n). This complexity is a significant improvement of the existing algorithm in the literature. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
