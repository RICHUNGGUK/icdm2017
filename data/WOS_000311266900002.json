Design/methodology/approach - Starting from the dynamic and correlated supplier risks of large-scale and complex equipment, a two-dimension frame to analyze these risks is established. A maximum entropy model is also built to research the probability distribution of the risks; then, K-T conditions are proved to solve the model. A real case is also studied in the last part of the paper. Findings - The results are convincing in order to analyze the supplier risk dynamically of large-scale and complex equipment development project, a two-dimension analysis frame is established and a maximum entropy model is worked out. The case study shows that they are valuable. Practical implications - The two-dimension frame gives a new viewpoint for risk management, but also the maximum entropy model supplies a valuable method for risk management. Originality/value - The paper succeeds in creating a dynamic analysis frame to study risks and building a new method to research the disciplines of the dynamic risks.", "paper_title": "Dynamic suppliers' risk management of large-scale and complex equipment development", "paper_id": "WOS:000311266900002"}
