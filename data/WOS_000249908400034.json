By employing the theory of coincidence degree and using Halanay-type inequality technique we give some sufficient conditions ensuring the existence and globally exponential stability of periodic solutions for the discrete-time bidirectional neural networks. An example with the numerical simulations is provided to show the correctness of our analysis. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
