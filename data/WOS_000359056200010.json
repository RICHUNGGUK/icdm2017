Design/methodology/approach - This study adopts a deductive approach to conceptualization, starting from one given, a priori concept. Findings - This paper develops a constellation of concepts which offer mutual clarification for each other. Having defined data by drawing on its existing denotations, it defines \"information\" as the combined product of data and meaning, and \"document\" as the combined product of information and media; it defines \"knowledge\" as one type of meaning and \" work\" as one type of information. It shows that the mission of the library and information profession is to ensure maximum discoverability and accessibility of information, and that LIS is structured into two fields correspondingly, each consisting of three tiers of knowledge: philosophical foundations, theories, and technologies. Practical implications - The redefinition of basic LIS concepts may have practical implications for LIS curriculum design and for the cultivation of professional identity among LIS students in the all-encompassing I-Schools. Originality/value - This study has formed a coherent conceptual framework for LIS and has clarified the hitherto rather confusing relationship between data, information, and knowledge, and the rather nebulous structure of LIS problems; it sheds some light on the source of conflicts between the subjective and objective conceptualization of information and questions the prevailing understanding of work as ideas or meanings.", "paper_title": "Back to the fundamentals again A redefinition of information and associated LIS concepts following a deductive approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000359056200010"}
