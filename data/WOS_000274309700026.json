Exact integrodifferential boundary conditions for finite chains and half-spaces are obtained by means of Green's functions for initial value problems. Truncating the resulting integrals in time, we obtain absorbing boundary conditions. Numerical tests illustrate the ability of these conditions to suppress reflections. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
