We use RGB color images with a regular arrangement RGB channels into spatio-chromatic space, and ICA performs decorrelation of these signals. We show that spatio-chromatic components of images contain spatial information and color information, and that ICA spatio-chromatic analysis is able to help the reconstruction of images. We propose an efficient noise reduction method for color images based on the observation. In the proposed method, the image is first transformed to spatio-chromatic ICA domain and then the noise components are removed by soft thresholding (Shrinkage). Experimental results show that the denoised images based spatio-chromatic ICA domain shrinkage are dramatically improved in comparison to that with conventional filtering.", "paper_title": "A spatio-chromatic ICA based noise reduction in color images", "paper_id": "WOS:000254028000015"}
