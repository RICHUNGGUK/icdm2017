Some Visual Basic for Applications programs were developed to generate the co-word matrix, compute the E-index value of keywords as well as the density and centrality of thematic clusters. Callon's clustering method was also used to generate keywords clusters. Then, co-word analysis method and strategic diagrams were utilized to detect the main research themes as well as explore the development situation and status of these research themes. Furthermore, author-themes coupling network was mapped with the help of Netdraw in order to detect the relationship between core authors and research themes of OA as well as the core authors' influence on these themes. Based on this, some conclusions were got in the end.", "paper_title": "Study on themes and authors' influence of open access in China", "paper_id": "WOS:000343609900016"}
