This paper presents an Area-based Collaborative Sleeping protocol (ACOS) that can control the degree of coverage for diverse applications. The ACOS protocol, based on the net sensing area of a sensor, controls the mode of sensors to maximize the coverage, minimize the energy consumption, and to extend the lifetime of the sensor network. The net sensing area of a sensor is the area of the region exclusively covered by the sensor itself. We study the parameter tuning in ACOS to guide to configure the network for diverse applications. The simulation shows that our protocol has better coverage of the surveillance area while waking fewer sensors than other sleeping protocols. It extends the lifetime of sensor networks significantly.", "paper_title": "An area-based collaborative sleeping protocol for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000040"}
