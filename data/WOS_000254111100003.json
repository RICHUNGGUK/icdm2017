We present an efficient dynamic sensor self-organizing algorithm that clusters sensors into groups without requiring a centralized control. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the performance improvement as well as the communication reduction for the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Dynamic sensor self-organization for distributive moving target tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000254111100003"}
