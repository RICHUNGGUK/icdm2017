Rather than tuning the eigenstructure of the subdivision matrix, we improve shape by adding a point and enriching the refinement rules. Adding a guiding point can also yield a polar bi-2 subdivision algorithm. Both the augmented and the polar bi-2 subdivision are complemented by a new Primal Bi-2 Subdivision scheme. All surfaces are C-1 and can be combined. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.
