The goal-driven model used is an extension of the goal model KAOS and the model checker engine is the UPPAAL tool. The goal model specifies the properties that the system must satisfy and how they should be verified by using the model checker engine. In order to illustrate this approach, we apply these techniques to a basic Internet purchase process.", "paper_title": "Analysis and verification of time requirements applied to the Web Services composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241442400012"}
