In this paper, we investigate the Minimum Latency Multi-Regional Query Scheduling (ML-MRQS) problem in wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), which aims to generate a scheduling plan with minimum latency under a more practical query model called Multi-Regional Query (MRQ). An MRQ targets at interested data from multiple regions of a WSN, where each region is a subarea. Because the ML-MRQS problem is NP-hard, we propose a heuristic scheduling algorithm Multi-Regional Query Scheduling Algorithm (MRQSA) to solve this problem. Theoretical analysis shows that the latency of MRQSA is upper bounded by 23A+B+C for an MRQ with m query regions R1,R2,...,Rm, where A=maxi=1mDileft is the maximum latency for non-overlapped regions, B=maxi=1m{(23Di+5+21)ki} is the maximum latency for overlapped regions, and C=Sigma i=1mHi+5-m+17 is the accumulated latency for data transmission from the accessing nodes to the sink. Simulation results show that MRQSA reduces latency by 42.7% to 51.63% with respect to different number of query regions, network density, region size, and interference/transmission range compared with C-DCQS, while guaranteeing energy efficiency.
