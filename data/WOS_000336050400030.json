However, the general case of limited training samples, as well as different feature representations typically makes this problem challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple kernel-learning framework to combine multimodal features for AD classification, which is scalable and easy to implement. Contrary to the usual way of solving the problem in the dual, we look at the optimization from a new perspective. By conducting Fourier transform on the Gaussian kernel, we explicitly compute the mapping function, which leads to a more straightforward solution of the problem in the primal. Furthermore, we impose the mixed L-21 norm constraint on the kernel weights, known as the group lasso regularization, to enforce group sparsity among different feature modalities. This actually acts as a role of feature modality selection, while at the same time exploiting complementary information among different kernels. Therefore, it is able to extract the most discriminative features for classification. Experiments on the ADNI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Multiple Kernel Learning in the Primal for Multimodal Alzheimer's Disease Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000336050400030"}
