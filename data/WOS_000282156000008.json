Comparison of performance between one-and two-dimensional filters are made in studying propagation problems and actual viscous flow problems. In this preliminary work, the focus is kept solely on developing central filters with its real transfer function. Many applications related to Navier-Stokes equation have been shown to demonstrate that these two-dimensional filters help in numerical stabilization: control aliasing and control over spurious upstream propagating disturbances. Furthermore, its potential for large eddy simulation (LES) is suggested by band-limiting the solution via filters in post-processing mode. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
