Phase I developed a genetic simulated annealing k-means algorithm (GSKA) integrating genetic algorithm (CA), simulated annealing algorithm (SA) and k-means algorithm, and suppliers were clustered using this algorithm according to the characteristics for customer needs including multiple dimensions product cost, product quality and manufacturing time. In phase 2, a multi-criterion optimization mathematical model on supply partnership characterizing quality, cost and time was constructed based on the clusters from phase 1, and then the proposed Genetic Simulated Annealing Algorithm (GSA) was used to solve the optimization model to find the optimum supplier combinations. To prove the efficiency of the proposed model, a case study concerned with notebook computers was introduced in this study. According to the analysis results, the GSK A produced in phase 1 proved to be superior to k-means model and genetic k-means algorithm (GKA) model, while the multi-objective optimization model GSA proposed in phase 2 still proved better than GA. Moreover, by selecting suppliers after cluster analysis, unwanted candidate suppliers could be effectively eliminated, and the resulting supplier combination could still meet customer needs.", "paper_title": "A TWO-PHASE HYBRID APPROACH TO SUPPLIER SELECTION THROUGH CLUSTER ANALYSIS WITH MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281745700019"}
