In this paper, we investigate the use of cooperative communications for Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning in resource-constrained wireless sensor networks, and propose MRL-CC, a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based multi-hop mesh Cooperative Communication mechanism. In MRL-CC, a multi-hop mesh cooperative structure is constructed for reliable data disseminations. The cooperative mechanism that defines cooperative partner assignments, and coding and transmission schemes, is implemented using a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. We compare the network performance of MRL-CC with MMCC, a Multi-hop Mesh structure based Cooperative Communication scheme, and investigate the impacts of network traffic load, interference, and sensor node's mobility on the network performance. Simulation results show that MRL-CC performs well in terms of a number of QoS metrics, and fits well in large-scale networks and highly dynamic environments.", "paper_title": "MRL-CC: a novel cooperative communication protocol for QoS provisioning in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000282482800005"}
