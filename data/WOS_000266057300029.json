We define strong unforgeability of group signature schemes and explain why the strong unforgeability of a group signature scheme is necessary. This relatively new security concept was not considered when Bellare-Micciancio-Warinschi established their security model, what we call the BMW security model, of group signature schemes. We show that a scheme proposed at Eurocrypt'06 that was proven secure in the BMW security model is not strongly unforgeable. We also present a method to convert this scheme into a strongly unforgeable group signature scheme preserving the security in the BMW security model. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
