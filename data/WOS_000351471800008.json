Due to the large distance requirement the associated tensor products could be applied only over sufficiently large fields. Then Meir (SICOMP 2009) used this result to present a combinatorial construction of locally testable codes with largest known rate. As a consequence, this construction was obtained over sufficiently large fields. In this paper we improve the result of Ben-Sasson and Sudan and show that for any linear codes the associated tensor products are locally testable. Consequently, the construction of Meir can be taken over any field, including the binary field. Moreover, a combination of our result with the result of Spielman (IEEE IT, 1996) implies a construction of linear codes (over any field) that combine the following properties: have constant rate and constant relative distance; have blocklength n and are testable with n(E) queries, for any constant E>0; linear time encodable and linear-time decodable from a constant fraction of errors. Furthermore, a combination of our result with the result of Guruswami et al. (STOC 2009) implies a similar corollary for list-decodable codes. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
