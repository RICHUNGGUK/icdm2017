The proposed locality preserving hallucination (LPH) algorithm combines locality preserving projection (LPP) and radial basis function (RBF) regression together to hallucinate the global high-resolution face. Furthermore, in order to compensate the inferred global face with detailed inartificial facial features, the neighbor reconstruction based face residue hallucination is used. Compared with existing approaches, the proposed LPH algorithm can generate global face more similar to the ground truth face efficiently, moreover, the patch structure and search strategy carefully designed for the neighbor reconstruction algorithm greatly reduce the computational complexity without diminishing the quality of high-resolution face detail. The details of synthetic high-resolution face are further improved by a global linear smoother. Experiments indicate that our approach can synthesize distinct high-resolution faces with various facial appearances such as facial expressions, eyeglasses efficiently.
