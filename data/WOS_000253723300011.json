However, it is not clear whether these accompanying rotations are primarily due to passive (discs, ligaments and facet joints) or active (muscles) spinal anatomy. The aim of this study was to use a finite element (FE) model of the lumbar spine to predict three-dimensional coupled rotations between the lumbar vertebrae, due to passive spinal structures alone. The FE model was subjected to physiologically observed whole lumbar spine rotations about in vivo centres of rotation. Model predictions were validated by comparison of intra-discal pressures and primary rotations with in vivo measurements and these showed close agreement. Predicted coupled rotations matched in vivo measurements for all primary motions except lateral bending. We suggest that coupled rotations accompanying primary motions in the sagittal (flexion/extension) and transverse (axial rotation) planes are primarily due to passive spinal structures. For lateral bending the muscles most likely play a key role in the coupled rotation of the spine.", "paper_title": "Are coupled rotations in the lumbar spine largely due to the osseo-ligamentous anatomy?
