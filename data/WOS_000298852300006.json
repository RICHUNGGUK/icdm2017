We give a certifying algorithm deciding triconnectivity of Hamiltonian graphs with linear running time (this assumes that the cycle is given as part of the input). If the input graph is triconnected, the algorithm constructs an easily checkable proof for this fact. If the input graph is not triconnected, the algorithm returns a separation pair.", "paper_title": "An O(n plus m) Certifying Triconnnectivity Algorithm for Hamiltonian Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000298852300006"}
