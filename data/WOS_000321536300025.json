MUTP formulated under instantaneous, statistical and imperfect channel state information assumptions at the RSs and BS for UL and DL respectively is based on singular value decomposition and, further at the RSs for DL is based on minimum mean square error principle. Specifically, we investigate the performance of the considered system in the context of weak and dominant MUI at the RSs in UL and dominant IRI at the mobile stations in DL. Our simulation studies show that MUTP aided system achieves better bit error rate than multiuser detection based system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
