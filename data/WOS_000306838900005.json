However, new data is written out-of-place due to the characteristics of ash memory, which is diverse from traditional magnetic media. Out-of-place update results in the wear-leveling issue over ash memory for erasing blocks to reclaim invalid pages. This paper proposed a dynamic wear (DW)-leveling design without substantially increasing overhead and without modifying Flash Translation Layer (FTL) for huge-capacity ash storage systems with cache, which is based on segmentation threshold and Least Recently Used (LRU). Experimental results show that our design levels the wear of different physical blocks, reduces extra page coping and block erasing, and improves the read/write performance. Additionally, different thresholds impacting wear leveling are also discussed.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT DYNAMIC WEAR LEVELING FOR HUGE-CAPACITY FLASH STORAGE SYSTEMS WITH CACHE", "paper_id": "WOS:000306838900005"}
