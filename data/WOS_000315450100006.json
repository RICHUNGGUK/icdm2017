This study uses composite femur-implant physical models to investigate the ability of modal analysis to detect changes at the interface between the implant and bone simulating those that occur during osseointegration. Using electromagnetic shaker excitation, differences were detected in the resonant frequencies and mode shapes of the model when the implant fit in the bone was altered to simulate the two interface cases considered: firm and loose fixation. The study showed that it is beneficial to examine higher resonant frequencies and their mode shapes (rather than the fundamental frequency only) when assessing fixation. The influence of the model boundary conditions on the modal parameters was also demonstrated. Further work is required to more accurately model the mechanical changes occurring at the bone-implant interface in vivo, as well as further refinement of the model boundary conditions to appropriately represent the in vivo conditions. Nevertheless, the ability to detect changes in the model dynamic properties demonstrates the potential of modal analysis in this application and warrants further investigation.", "paper_title": "Ability of modal analysis to detect osseointegration of implants in transfemoral amputees: a physical model study", "paper_id": "WOS:000315450100006"}
