In this study, we further propose a novel AHP-group decision making (GDM) model in a local context (a unique criterion), based on the individual selection of the numerical scale and prioritization method. The resolution framework of the AHP-GDM with the individual numerical scale and prioritization method is first proposed. Then, based on linguistic Euclidean distance (LED) and linguistic minimum violations (LMV), the novel consensus measure is defined so that the consensus degree among decision makers who use different numerical scales and prioritization methods can be analyzed. Next, a consensus reaching model is proposed to help decision makers improve the consensus degree. In this consensus reaching model, the LED-based and LMV-based consensus rules are proposed and used. Finally, a new individual consistency index and its properties are proposed for the use of the individual numerical scale and prioritization method in the AHP-GDM. Simulation experiments and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "Consensus Building in a Local Context for the AHP-GDM With the Individual Numerical Scale and Prioritization Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000352279600009"}
