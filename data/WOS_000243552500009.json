A new delay-dependent sufficient condition for the existence of guaranteed cost controller and an upper bound of the cost function are presented by a new stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. The state feedback problem for such system is formulated as a convex optimization over a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be very efficiently solved by interior-point methods. As examples to verify the proposed method, two plants in the networked setup are considered. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.", "paper_title": "Guaranteed cost control of networked control systems with time-delays and packet losses", "paper_id": "WOS:000243552500009"}
