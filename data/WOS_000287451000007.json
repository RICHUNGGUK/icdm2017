There are a number of problems that render this task complex. Breast MRI segmentation based on the differential enhancement of image intensities can assist the clinician to detect suspicious regions. In this paper, we propose an effective segmentation method for breast contrast-enhanced MRI (ce-MRI). The segmentation method is developed based on standard fuzzy clustering techniques proposed by Bezedek. By minimizing the proposed effective objective function, this paper obtains an effective way of predicting membership grades for objects and new method to update centers. Experiments will be done with a synthetic image to show how effectively the new proposed effective fuzzy c-means (FCM) works in obtaining clusters. To show the performance of proposed FCM, this work compares the results with results of standard FCM algorithm on same synthetic image. Then the proposed method was applied to segment the clinical ce-MR images with the help of computer programing language and results have been shown visually.", "paper_title": "Effective fuzzy clustering techniques for segmentation of breast MRI", "paper_id": "WOS:000287451000007"}
