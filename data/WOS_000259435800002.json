This paper presents a pre-runtime scheduling method for hard real-time systems considering DVS, overheads as well as inter-task relations. The proposed method adopts a formal model based on time Petri nets in order to find a feasible schedule that satisfies timing and energy constraints. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
