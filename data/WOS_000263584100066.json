In this paper, we propose an efficient feature selection method for high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra obtained from time-course experiments. Our proposed approach combines linear-mixed effects (LME) models with a multiple testing procedure based on a false discovery rate. The proposed LME approach is illustrated using NMR spectra with 574 metabolite features obtained for an experiment to examine metabolic changes in response to sulfur amino acid intake. The experimental results showed that classification models constructed with the features selected by the proposed approach resulted in lower rates of misclassification than those models with full features. Furthermore, we compared the LME approach with the two-sample t-test approach that oversimplifies the time-course factor. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
