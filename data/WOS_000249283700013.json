Computer solutions to this optimization problem are presented for small numbers of twins, triplets and quartets. The configurations obtained can be characterized as perfect matchings in the contact graph of the unconstrained problem (k = 2), compounds of equilateral triangles (k = 3), or compounds of regular tetrahedra (k = 4).", "paper_title": "Recent results in constrained packing of equal circles on a sphere", "paper_id": "WOS:000249283700013"}
