We show the correctness of the protocol and show that the protocol terminates in O(n(4)) time starting from any arbitrary initial state. The protocol can elect either a leaf node or a non leaf node (starting from the same initial state) depending on the behavior of the daemon. The protocol generalizes the result in [1] and at the same time is much simpler and terminates in polynomial number of moves.", "paper_title": "Self-stabilizing anonymous leader election in a tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000237139600006"}
