When decoded iteratively, the constructed irregular LDPC codes exhibit a relatively low error floor in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region and are subject to relatively few undetected errors. The LDPC codes constructed based on the proposed scheme remain efficiently encodable.", "paper_title": "Construction of irregular LDPC codes by quasi-cyclic extension", "paper_id": "WOS:000245306000015"}
