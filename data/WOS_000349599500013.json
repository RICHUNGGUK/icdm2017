The proposed method prevents the spurious propagation of under-resolved reaction fronts by introducing a front propagation form of the chemical reaction term. The front propagation formulation adopts a regularized Delta function to discretely preserve the total reaction rates on computational grids. By introducing the regularized Delta function that reproduces the physical mechanism of front propagation, the present method allows for the simulation of reaction fronts with variable thicknesses on under-resolved grids. Applications to isothermal reaction fronts, laminar premixed flames, and large eddy simulation of turbulent premixed flames are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
