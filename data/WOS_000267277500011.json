Published solutions view WSS as an \"image-processing\"/\"computer vision\" problem where emphasis is placed on analyzing the given input (natural sketch) using various heuristics. This paper proposes a new WSS method based on robust tools from graph theory, solid modeling and Euclidean geometry. Focus is placed on producing a minimal wireframe sketch that corresponds to a topologically correct polyhedron. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
