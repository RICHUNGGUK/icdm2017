Rev. Lett. 95 (2005) 150501]. We show that the optimal phase shift is pi/3.61, which replaces the pi/3 phase shift in fixed-point quantum search algorithm. The pi/3.61-phase algorithm can be achieved in O(root N/M) with the success probability of at least 94.11%, which offsets disadvantage that the success probability of getting correct results usually decreases with the increase of marked items when original Grover quantum search algorithm is applied to search an unordered database. In the meantime, this work also indicates that Grover quantum search algorithm is considerably robust to certain kinds of perturbations and is robust against modest noise in the initialization procedure.", "paper_title": "PHASE MATCHING IN FIXED-POINT QUANTUM SEARCH ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000270041800009"}
