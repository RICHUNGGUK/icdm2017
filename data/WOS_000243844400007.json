A mathematical model for evaluating the expectation of the margin of votes to be received from such voters by either candidate as a result of the election campaigns of all the competing candidates is proposed. On the basis of this model, finding the estimation under consideration is reducible to finding the minimum of the maximin function of the difference of two bilinear functions with one and the same first vector argument whose second vector arguments belong to a polyhedron of connected variables (strategies of the candidates), and this minimum is sought on another polyhedron.
