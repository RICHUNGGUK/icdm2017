The currently known hardware metering approaches, however, are subject to alternations due to device aging, since they employ unstable manifestational IC properties. We, on the other hand, have developed the first robust hardware metering approach by using physical-level gate proprieties for ID generation. By using effective channel length, which is resilient to aging, and threshold voltage, which is essentially independent across gates and suitable for calculating the uniqueness of the IDs, we overcome the limitations of the existing approaches. Also, despite the increase in threshold voltage that occurs with aging, the original threshold voltage value can be extracted through intentional IC aging. Our ID generation procedure first employs two types of side channels, namely switching power and leakage power, to extract metering results for each gate. Next, we show that localized delay measurements alone are sufficient for accurate characterization of large sets of gates. Finally, by using threshold voltage for ID creation, we are able to obtain low probabilities of coincidence between legitimate and pirated ICs. The application of the approach to a set of benchmarks quantitatively establishes the effectiveness of the new hardware metering approach.", "paper_title": "Quantitative Intellectual Property Protection Using Physical-Level Characterization", "paper_id": "WOS:000327278100002"}
