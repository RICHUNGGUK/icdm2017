The primary premises of elastography are that speckle kinematics reproduces underlying tissue kinematics and that tissue motion can be inferred from speckle tracking. This implicitly assumes that speckle pattern is a material property that can be tracked with respect to time and space. It is then convenient to express the motion of such a material property in terms of total derivative, also known as optical flow (OF) equations. Aims-The present paper introduces a new iterative OF-based elastography (OFBE) method devoted to B-mode data. The first OFBE iteration computes axial and lateral displacement fields. Such displacement fields are used for data rigid registration, prior to the second OFBE iteration which computes the 2-D strain tensor. Methods-The OFBE method was validated in the common carotid artery of rat hypertension models. The effect of aging on carotid stiffness was investigated in female recombinant inbred rats (RI-17, (n = 2) in the first experiment. The outcomes of low/high-salt diets were examined in young male Dahl salt-sensitive rats (SS, n = 6; SM12, n = 6; SM9, n = 6) in the second experiment. Results-Good concordance was observed between left and right carotid axial strain measurements with 11.4% relative error, whereas 4.6% relative error occurred between diastolic and systolic axial strain measurements. Old (80 and 85 weeks) RI-17 carotids were determined to be twice as stiff with 5.70 +/- 0.97% (strain +/- std) as young carotids (30 and 34 weeks) with 13.26 +/- 2.73%, p < 0.001. Carotid axial strain measurement also indicated that salt diets had a significant impact on SS (p = 0.008) and SM12 (p < 0.001) but not on SM9 (p = 0.881) rats.", "paper_title": "Optical-Flow-Based B-Mode Elastography: Application in the Hypertensive Rat Carotid", "paper_id": "WOS:000274211700030"}
