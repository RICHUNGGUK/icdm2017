Based on this algorithm, one can obtain a finite number of optimal direction vectors, which are x-free and therefore enable us (Liu et al., Preprint, 2011) to compute the projection depth and most of its associated estimators of dimension pa parts per thousand yen2, including Stahel-Donoho location and scatter estimators, projection trimmed mean, projection depth contours and median, etc. Both real and simulated examples are also provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Computing projection depth and its associated estimators", "paper_id": "WOS:000329246300004"}
