These changes could be related to the optimization objective, the problem instance, or involve problem constraints. In most cases, they are seen as an ordered sequence of sub-problems or environments that must be solved during a certain time interval. The usual approaches tend to solve each sub-problem when a change happens, dealing always with one single environment at each time instant. In this paper, we propose a multi-environmental cooperative model for parallel meta-heuristics to tackle dynamic optimization problems. It consists in dealing with different environments at the same time, using different algorithms that exchange information coming from these environments. A parallel multi-swarm approach is presented for solving the Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on a well-known set of benchmarks, and compared with other meta-heuristics from the literature. Experimental results show that our multi-environmental approach outperforms conventional meta-heuristics on this problem.", "paper_title": "Multi-environmental cooperative parallel metaheuristics for solving dynamic optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000315162400015"}
