Rate limit algorithm with max-min fairness is an effective countermeasure to defeat flooding-style DDoS attacks under the assumption that attackers are more aggressive than legitimate users. However, under a \"meek\" DDoS attack where such an assumption is no longer valid, it will fail to protect legitimate traffic effectively. In order to improve the survival ratio of legitimate packets, an IP traceback based rate limit algorithm is proposed. Simulation results show that it could not only mitigate the DDoS attack effect, but also improve the throughput of legitimate traffic even under a meek attack.", "paper_title": "A novel rate limit algorithm against meek DDoS attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800045"}
