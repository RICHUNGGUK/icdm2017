A new modeling method is proposed to show the effect of distribution probability of the time delay. When the distribution probability of the time delay is known a prior, the common discrete time delay systems can be equivalently transferred as a discrete time delay systems with stochastic parameter matrices. Based on the model and using Lyapunov functional method and stochastic analysis theory, some mean-square stability criteria are derived in terms of linear matrix inequality technique. As a special case, the asymptotic stability criteria for the common discrete time delay systems can be deduced from the mean-square stability criteria. Numerical examples show that, when the variation probability of the time delay can also be observed, the allowable upper bound for the time delay may be much larger than those obtained for the case where only the variation range of the time delay can be known.", "paper_title": "STABILITY ANALYSIS OF DISCRETE SYSTEMS WITH STOCHASTIC DELAY AND ITS APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000269395000025"}
