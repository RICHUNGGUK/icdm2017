Using these characterizations, the connections between BCI-implicative ideals and other ideals in BCI/BCK-algebras are investigated. Additionally, the extension property of BCI-implicative ideals is established. Finally, the implicative BCI-algebras are completely described using BCI-implicative ideals. The above work generalizes the corresponding results in BCK-algebras. Published by Elsevier Inc.", "paper_title": "BCI-implicative ideals of BCI-algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000250016200012"}
