The sharing of research resources and the integration of knowledge are absolutely imperative for future development in both experimental and computational neuroscience fields. On the other hand, content management systems (CMS) have become widespread for constructing and managing WWW portal sites. In this study, in order to construct an effective resource-managing environment in the laboratory, we develop two database modules based on CMS, which can provide data integration and sharing capabilities for bibliographical resources and archived data files. We show the effectiveness of these modules in the biological and neuroscience fields by applying them in our laboratory-based work. Furthermore, similar applications can be made in the construction of Internet portal sites, because of considerations for security. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
