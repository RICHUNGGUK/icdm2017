In this paper, we propose the Web service based open multimedia conferencing services on Internet, and also introduce how to implement multimedia conferencing communication services based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Especially, mainly focus on the multimedia conferencing Web Service communication model, the design of multimedia conferencing call control state machine, the design of signal flows for multimedia conferencing communication services and Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) based multimedia conferencing communication services orchestration, and also we implement the multimedia conference system and also have a performance measurement. Finally, we give the conclusion and future work.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation for Multimedia Conferencing Communication Services and Orchestration on Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000298061100003"}
