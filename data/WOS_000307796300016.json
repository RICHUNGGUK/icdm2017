In this paper, we analyze a reputation mechanism that objectively maintains accurate reputation evaluation of selfish agent-based Web services. In the proposed framework, web services are ranked using their reputation as a result of provided feedback reflecting consumers' satisfaction. However, selfish web services may alter their public reputation level by managing to get fake feedback. We investigate the payoffs of different scenarios by focusing on the issues that discourage web services to act maliciously. We also analyze the details of the proposed mechanism by discussing simulation and empirical results that fully depict the system parameters and show the feasibility of the proposed approach.
