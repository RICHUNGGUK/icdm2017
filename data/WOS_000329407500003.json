How to deal with emergency in supply chain arouses managers' and researchers' attention in recent years. In order to improve the effect of supply disruption risk management under this situation, this paper builds the supply disruption Emergency Management Model of supply chain from the angle of risk management and discusses whether the decision-making mechanism of the case-based reasoning can bring the better effect for supply disruption by using computational experiment. The results mainly show that the mechanism of risk assessment, risk identification, risk control and risk evaluation based on the case-based reasoning can effectively deal with supply disruption risk, and bring more profit and better service level for the members of supply chain.", "paper_title": "A study of emergency management of supply chain under supply disruption", "paper_id": "WOS:000329407500003"}
