In Wang Chenwei's work, a 2-user scenario required both source and relay to access the global channel state information (CSI). This paper shows a new method of interference alignment improves the degrees of freedom (DoF) prominently for the 3-user MIMO interference channel with instantaneous relay. This new method is focused on the relay node that completes the alignment interference neutralization so the global CSI is obtained only once and the pressure on the base station can be mitigated. In addition, the 3-user MIMO interference channels with instantaneous relay can achieve 2M DoF when source and destination have Mantennas, respectively. This method shows 33% improvement over the conventional method using interference alignment which obtains 3M / 2 DoF.", "paper_title": "Degrees of Freedom of 3-user MIMO Interference Channels with Instantaneous Relay Using Interference Alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000358994900004"}
