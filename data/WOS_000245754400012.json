Employee training is a frequently used method for promoting the working capabilities for better human resources. Employee training programs cultivate personnel capabilities for enterprise operation. The training effect can be dramatically enhanced if curriculum is well designed and arranged. However, arranging curriculum is a difficult and lengthy task which enterprises traditionally devote a large amount of human and material resources to. We improved the process by proposing an optimal curriculum arrangement model in maintenance personnel training programs, and utilizing genetic algorithms as solution procedures. An adaptive computer aided training system for maintenance representative training was also developed to facilitate personnel training for machine tool industry. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
