Although some research about it is available, most of them are based on G&M code that has inherent drawbacks such as vendor-specific nature, incomplete data, irreversible data conversions and lack of accuracy. These limitations hinder the development of a truthful simulation system; they are dependent on specific platform and have bad interoperability, which limits their use. Therefore, there is a requirement for high-level data model to be developed and utilised that can assist with accurate simulation for machining processes. In addition, there is also a need to take account of computer heterogeneous environment and online service. To solve these issues, this article proposes service-oriented, cross-platform and high-level machining simulation solution that utilises high-level data such as standard for the exchange of product data and standard for the exchange of product data-compliant numerical control in order to produce an informative and truthful simulation and utilises the proposed browser/server-based model-view-controller-communication-data pattern, Java and Web service technology in order to produce platform-independent and service-oriented machining simulation. The outcome of the research provides a better informed simulation environment, makes the training for operators easier and promotes the development of networked manufacturing.", "paper_title": "Service-oriented, cross-platform and high-level machining simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000301920600005"}
