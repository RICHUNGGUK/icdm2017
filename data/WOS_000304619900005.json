But this requires an interactive authoring process to attach triggers to clickable objects, which is time-consuming because these objects can appear intermittently, move, and change shape. We facilitate authoring by combining a sketching interface with shot-based object tracking and trigger verification. Experiments involving professional video authors and non-specialist viewers suggest that this approach is an improvement on previous methods.", "paper_title": "Creating a clickable TV program by sketching and tracking freeform triggers", "paper_id": "WOS:000304619900005"}
