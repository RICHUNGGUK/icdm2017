The van der Waals attraction is considered to be the force between particles. Simulations are performed for various fluid forces acting on particles and various inter-particle forces. It is found that the ratio of the fluid force to the maximum inter-particle force, Y, is a key factor in dispersion, and the aggregate of non-Brownian particles is dispersed when Y is over 0.001. The Peclet number, which is the ratio of the diffusion rate due to shear flow to that due to the Brownian motion, is also considered. By comparing the calculated result of the dispersion of Brownian particles with that of non-Brownian particles, it is found that the Brownian motion impedes dispersion and the effect of the Brownian motion is remarkable when the Peclet number is under 10(5).
