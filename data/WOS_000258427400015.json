This problem aims at designing robust adaptive controller for all parameter uncertainties and time delay of MIMO system with backstepping method. This studied system consists of some subsystems which are cascade MIMO uncertain systems, and the time delays of these subsystems are unknown. In each step, the control scheme is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI's). With the output of FLS, a robust adaptive controller is given using backstepping and LMI method. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate our theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Robust adaptive control of time delay uncertain systems with FLS", "paper_id": "WOS:000258427400015"}
