It is very important to represent discrete structures compactly and to execute efficiently tasks such as equivalency/validity checking, analysis of models, and optimization. Recently, BDDs (Binary Decision Diagrams) and ZDDs (Zero-suppressed BDDs) have attracted a great deal of attention, because they efficiently represent and manipulate large-scale combinational logic data, which are the basic discrete structures in various fields of application. Although a quarter of a century has passed since Bryant's first idea, there are still a lot of interesting and exciting research topics related to BDD and ZDD. BDD/ZDD is based on in-memory data processing techniques, and it enjoys the advantage of using random access memory. Recent commodity PCs are equipped with gigabytes of main memory, and we can now solve large-scale problems which used to be impossible due to memory shortage. Thus, especially since 2000, the scope of BDD/ZDD methods has increased. This survey paper describes the history of, and recent research activity pertaining to, techniques related to BDD and ZDD.", "paper_title": "Techniques of BDD/ZDD: Brief History and Recent Activity", "paper_id": "WOS:000321468100001"}
