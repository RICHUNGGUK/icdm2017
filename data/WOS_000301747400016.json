The algorithm uses an alternating minimization framework to optimize the cluster membership and kernel coefficients as a nonconvex problem. In the proposed algorithm, the problem to optimize the cluster membership and the problem to optimize the kernel coefficients are all based on the same Rayleigh quotient objective; therefore the proposed algorithm converges locally. OKKC has a simpler procedure and lower complexity than other algorithms proposed in the literature. Simulated and real-life data fusion applications are experimentally studied, and the results validate that the proposed algorithm has comparable performance, moreover, it is more efficient on large-scale data sets.
