For the un weighted case and k fixed an O(n(2)log n) time algorithm is presented. For the weighted case a thorough study of the relevant structure of the multiplicatively weighted order-k-Voronoi diagram leads to the design of an O(kn(3)+ n(3)log n) time algorithm for finding an optimal solution to the anti-t-centrum problem for every t = 1,..., k, simultaneously.
