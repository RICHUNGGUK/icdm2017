The results show that providers and clients are more similar than different with regard to desired skills. Client firms emphasize technical skills for new hires more than providers do despite saying that these are the skills they would outsource to providers. The results have implications for organizations' recruiting and retention, for individuals' career development, and for educational programs.", "paper_title": "The Information Technology Workforce: A Comparison of Critical Skills of Clients and Service Providers", "paper_id": "WOS:000302015400002"}
