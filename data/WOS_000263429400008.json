It is assumed that the objective function costs are not precisely known. This uncertainty is modeled by specifying a finite set of fuzzy scenarios. Under every fuzzy scenario the costs,ire given as fuzzy intervals. Possibility theory is then applied to chose a solution in such a problem and mixed integer linear programming models are proposed to compute this Solution. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
