To design high-quality timetable in fuzzy environment, the purpose of this paper is to study train re-scheduling problem under the fuzzy environment, in which the fuzzy coefficients of the constraint resources have the fuzzy boundaries. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the improved fuzzy linear programming, the train re-scheduling model is constructed. Aiming at dealing with the fuzzy characteristics of the constraint coefficients value range boundaries, the description method of this kind of objective function is proposed and the solving approach is presented. The model has more adaptability to model a common train re-scheduling problem, in which some resources of the constraints are uncertain and have the characteristics of fuzziness and the boundaries of the resources are fuzzy. Findings - Two numerical examples are carried out and it shows that the model proposed in this paper can describe the train re-scheduling problem precisely, dealing with the fuzzy boundaries of the fuzzy coefficients of the constraint resources. And the algorithm present is suitable to solve the problem. The approach proposed in this paper can be a reference for developers of railway dispatching system. Originality/value - It is the first time to study train re-scheduling problem under the fuzzy environment, in which the fuzzy coefficients of the constraint resources have the fuzzy boundaries.", "paper_title": "Train re-scheduling based on an improved fuzzy linear programming model", "paper_id": "WOS:000366638800004"}
