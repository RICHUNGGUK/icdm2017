This volume-of-fluid model without reconstruction consists only of conservation laws, hence, it call be solved very efficiently. The model contains a high-accuracy compressive water surface discretization and turbulence; it is solved with a linear multi-grid technique and defect correction. Results show that the model is accurate and the solver gives fast convergence.
