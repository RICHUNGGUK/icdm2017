Some CAD tools based on a nonphysical interpretation of Pelgrom's distance term result in excessive computationally expensive algorithms, which become nonviable even for circuits with a reduced number of transistors. Furthermore, some researchers are reporting new variations on the original nonphysically interpreted algorithms, which may render false results. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the physical interpretation of the distance term of Pelgrom et al. and indicate how to model it efficiently in prospective CAD tools.", "paper_title": "On an efficient CAD implementation of the distance term in Pelgrom's mismatch model", "paper_id": "WOS:000248235900015"}
