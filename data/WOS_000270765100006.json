The utilization of AMC in downlink (DL) requires the channel information of each user on DL to properly select the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) level. However, under a practical OFDMA system environment, it is unsuitable to feedback all the channel information over the whole frequency resources due to the limited uplink bandwidth. In this paper, to optimize the performance of the AMC system and to reduce the uplink feedback requirement, we propose a flexible block-wise loading (FBL) algorithm combined with a novel channel quality information (CQI) feedback scheme requiring less number of CQI feedback bits, which is suitable for the general OFDMA system with AMC. The proposed FBL algorithm dynamically allocates groups of sub-carriers to each user in DL based oil the channel quality information encapsulated in a newly defined feedback signal format. As a result, the sector throughput and outage performance is improved due to the flexibility oil the sub-channel allocation and increased accuracy on the CQI feedback information by the proposed FBL algorithm.
