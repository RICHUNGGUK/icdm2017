For multifaceted domains which are not of tensor product type, it is difficult to directly generalize the usual approach of transfinite interpolation which blends opposite faces and which then substracts that by a mixed term. Therefore, we suggest a short formula which uses topologic entities of the convex domain. Our formula uses some projection operator onto the faces of the polytope. Both representations (V-setting and H-setting) of a polytope are used. We show also that the transfinite interpolation is stable under affine transformations. As a supplement to the theoretical demonstrations, we show some interesting practical illustrations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
