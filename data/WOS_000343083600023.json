Clustering of water molecules in superimposed protein structures, obtained by X-ray crystallography at high resolution, is an established method to identify consensus water molecules in all known protein structures of the same family. PyWATER is an easy-to-use PyMOL plug-in and identifies conserved water molecules in the protein structure of interest. PyWATER can be installed via the user interface of PyMOL. No programming or command-line knowledge is required for its use.", "paper_title": "PyWATER: a PyMOL plug-in to find conserved water molecules in proteins by clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000343083600023"}
