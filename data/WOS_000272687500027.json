Then, the upper- and low errors are introduced to solve the inconsistent decision-making case. Following that, the weight model for each uncertain preference is proposed, respectively. Findings - The aggregation approach based on minimal group deviation errors is suggested in order to obtain the utmost consistent opinion In addition, the consistency judgment level and consistency extent are defined owing to the aggregation result Research limitations/implications - The calculation scale is large, if many decision makers will attend group decision-making process. Practical implications A very useful approach for aggregation of the different preference in group decision-making case. Originality/value - Because of differences in knowledge structure, judgment level, and individual preference, decision makers express their judgment preferences via differently structured decision-making processes. Owing to the complexity and uncertainty of decision-making problems and the fuzziness of human thought, it is unrealistic to depict complex problems in the certain preference style For decision-making preference structures, group decision-making aggregation approaches include the aggregation on the same kind of preference structure and the different kinds of preference structures. The study on the aggregation of the same kind of preference structure has received a deal of attention, but study into the aggregation of the different kinds of uncertainty preference structures is still a new field.", "paper_title": "Research on four kinds of uncertain preference information aggregation approach in group decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000272687500027"}
