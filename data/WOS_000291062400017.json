It considers a collection of finite mixture models combined with a false discovery rate (FDR) criterion to find statistically significant regions. This leads to a more reliable assessment of differential binding sites based on a statistical approach. In addition to ChIP-seq, DIME is also applicable to data from other high-throughput platforms.", "paper_title": "DIME: R-package for identifying differential ChIP-seq based on an ensemble of mixture models", "paper_id": "WOS:000291062400017"}
