The motions of the equally spaced rib-stiffeners are handled by considering their tensional, bending vibrations and torsional movements. The response of the sandwich is determined by employing the Fourier transform technique and considering the periodical nature of the structure, which is numerically solved by truncating two infinite sets of simultaneous equations insofar as the solution converges. The far field radiated sound pressure is examined relative to that of an unstiffened panel with useful conclusions deduced. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
