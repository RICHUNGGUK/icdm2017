A language is said to be strongly prime decomposable if any way of factorizing the language yields a prime decomposition in a finite number of steps. We give a characterization of the strongly prime decomposable regular languages and using the characterization we show that every regular language over a unary alphabet has a prime decomposition. We show that there exist co-context-free languages that do not have prime decompositions.", "paper_title": "Prime decompositions of regular languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454100014"}
