The proposed arithmetic components consist of a translation stage, an inverted end-around-carry carry-save-adder tree and an enhanced diminished-1 modulo 2(n) + 1 adder. Qualitative and quantitative results indicate that the proposed architectures result in significantly faster and in several cases smaller circuits than the previously proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
