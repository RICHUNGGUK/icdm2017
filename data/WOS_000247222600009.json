Their main advantages are the speed and, given a reasonably good initial input, the high quality of the reconstructed surfaces. Nevertheless, their deterministic nature may hinder them from effectively handling incomplete data with noise and outliers. An ensemble is a statistical technique which can improve the performance of deterministic algorithms by putting them into a statistics based probabilistic setting. In this paper, we study the suitability of ensembles in normal and surface reconstruction. We experimented with a widely used normal reconstruction technique [Hoppe H, DeRose T, Duchamp T, McDonald J, Stuetzle W. Surface reconstruction from unorganized points. Computer Graphics 1992;71-8] and Multi-level Partitions of Unity implicits for surface reconstruction [Ohtake Y, Belyaev A, Alexa M, Turk G, Seidel H-P Multi-level partition of unity implicits. ACM Transactions on Graphics 2003;22(3):463-70], showing that normal and surface ensembles can successfully be combined to handle noisy point sets. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
