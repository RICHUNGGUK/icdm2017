It is able to run whole experimental designs, and compute and display the associative values of elemental and compound stimuli simultaneously, as well as use extra configural cues in generating compound values; it also permits change of the US parameters across phases. The simulator produces both numerical and graphical outputs, and includes a functionality to export the results to a data processor spreadsheet. It is user-friendly, and built with a graphical interface designed to allow neuroscience researchers to input the data in their own \"language\". It is a cross-platform simulator, so it does not require any special equipment, operative system or support program, and does not need installation. The \"R&W Simulator\" (version 3.0) is available free. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
