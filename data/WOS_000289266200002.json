We investigated a large set of audio features for this task. The features were chosen to represent four different content-dependent similarity categories: the envelope, the timbre, note-onsets and the pitch. The features were subjected to two processing stages. First, a feature subset was selected by evaluating the alignment performance of each individual feature. Second, the selected features were combined and subjected to an automatic weighting algorithm. A new method for the objective evaluation of audio-to-audio alignment systems is proposed that enables the use of arbitrary kinds of music as ground truth data. We evaluated our algorithm by this method as well as on a data set of real recordings of solo piano music. The results showed that the feature weighting algorithm could improve the alignment accuracies compared to the results of the individual features.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of Features for Audio-to-Audio Alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000289266200002"}
