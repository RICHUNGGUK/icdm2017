This paper proposes a simple yet reasonably accurate analytical performance model to predict message communication latency in tori networks. This model requires a running time of O(1) which is the fastest model yet reported in the literature. Extensive simulations reveal that the new performance model maintains a reasonable accuracy when the network operates under different traffic conditions. The model is then used to perform an extensive investigation into the performance merits of n-D tori using adaptive routing and virtual channels. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
