The study borrows marketing wisdom to information systems space to quantify how the website cues (products availability, website ease of use and visual appeal) affect personality traits (instant gratification, normative evaluation and impulsiveness) to urge the impulse purchase online. Structural equation modeling technologies are employed to evaluate the research model based on a survey questionnaire. The results show that personality factors of instant gratification, normative evaluation and impulsiveness are key determinants of urge to buy impulsively, while perceived website cues of visual appeal, website ease of use and product availability are important precursors. Through combining marketing and IS wisdom, a number of new insights are offered which enrich our understanding on the determinants of online impulse purchase decision as well as on how a proper IS design alters consumer shopping experience to engender more online impulse purchase.
