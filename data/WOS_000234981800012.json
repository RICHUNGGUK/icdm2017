The method works on color images: after having localized the face and the facial features, it determines 24 facial fiducial points, and characterizes them applying a bank of Gabor filters which extract the peculiar texture around them (jets). Recognition is realized measuring the similarity between the different jets. The system is inspired by the elastic bunch graph method, while it does no assumption on the scale, pose, and the background. Comparison with standard algorithms is presented and discussed.
