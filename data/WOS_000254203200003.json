This paper provides a theory for embodied communicative feedback, describing the different dimensions and features involved. It also provides a corpus analysis part, describing a first data coding and analysis method geared to find the features postulated by the theory. The corpus analysis part describes different methods and statistical procedures and discusses their applicability and the possible insights gained with these methods.", "paper_title": "The analysis of embodied communicative feedback in multimodal corpora: a prerequisite for behavior simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000254203200003"}
