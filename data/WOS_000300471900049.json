We explore the flexible handling of color disparity, spatial relation and the reliability of matching pixels in support windows. Building upon these key ingredients, a robust stereo matching algorithm using local plane fitting by Confidence-based Support Window (CSW) is presented. For each CSW, only these pixels with high confidence are employed to estimate optimal disparity plane. Considering that RANSAC has shown to be robust in suppressing the disturbance resulting from outliers, we employ it to solve local plane fitting problem. Compared with the state of the art local methods in the computer vision community, our approach achieves the better performance and time efficiency on the Middlebury benchmark.", "paper_title": "Stereo Matching Using Local Plane Fitting in Confidence-Based Support Window", "paper_id": "WOS:000300471900049"}
