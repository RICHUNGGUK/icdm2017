In particular, we show Omega(n log n) time lower bounds for separability by means of strips, wedges, wedges with apices on a given line, fixed-slopes double wedges, and triangles, which match the complexity of the existing algorithms, and therefore prove their optimality.", "paper_title": "Some lower bounds on geometric separability problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000236068200001"}
