This paper describes how such multimodal conversational Companions can be implemented to support their owners in various pervasive and mobile settings. We present concrete system architectures, virtual, physical and mobile multimodal interfaces, and interaction management techniques for such Companions. In particular how knowledge representation and separation of low-level interaction modelling from high-level reasoning at the domain level makes it possible to implement distributed, but still coherent, interaction with Companions. The distribution is enabled by using a dialogue plan to communicate information from domain level planner to dialogue management and from there to a separate mobile interface. The model enables each part of the system to handle the same information from its own perspective without containing overlapping logic, and makes it possible to separate task-specific and conversational dialogue management from each other. In addition to technical descriptions, results from the first evaluations of the Companions interfaces are presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
