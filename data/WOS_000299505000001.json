An enclosing tree is a tree which totally covers a voxel-based object, the vertices of the enclosing tree correspond to the vertices of the enclosing surface of the analyzed voxel-based object. An enclosing tree is represented by a chain of base-five digit strings suitably combined by means of parentheses. The enclosing-tree notation is invariant under rotation and translation. Furthermore, using this notation it is possible to obtain the mirror image of any voxel-based object with ease. The enclosing-tree notation preserves the shape of voxel-based objects, allowing us to know some of their topological and geometrical properties. Also, the proposed enclosing-tree notation is a good tool for storing of voxel-based objects.", "paper_title": "Enclosing trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000299505000001"}
