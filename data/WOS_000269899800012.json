In this paper, GMA ismodified to improve its real-time performance and to provide it with a potential ability of obstacle detection. First, a selection window is designed based on the dominant-ellipse-principle to limit the probability distribution area of each measurement point, therefore avoiding the calculation on the cells outside the dominant ellipse. Second, a clustering approach is proposed in order to distinguish objects efficiently and decrease the operation area of one laser scan. Third, a virtual point vector is introduced to further reduce the computational load of the mean square error matrix. The modified GMA is experimented on a tracked mobile robot, and its improved performance is shown in comparison to the original GMA.", "paper_title": "A new real-time algorithm for off-road terrain estimation using laser data", "paper_id": "WOS:000269899800012"}
