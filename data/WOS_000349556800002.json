In addition, we show that a low-rank decomposition of the kernel matrix defined on the input training data can be exploited in order to determine an appropriate ELM space for input data mapping. The ELM space determined from this process can be subsequently used for network training using the original ELM formulation. Experimental results denote that the adoption of the low-rank decomposition-based ELM space determination leads to enhanced performance, when compared to the standard choice, i.e., random input weights generation.
