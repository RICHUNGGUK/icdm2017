This subject is addressed from the standpoint of different interrelated resource allocation mechanisms operating in multi-cell scenarios in order to exploit frequency and multi-user diversity: ICI coordination/avoidance and adaptive subcarrier and power allocation. Even though these methods can be applied in a stand-alone way, a significant performance improvement is achieved if they are jointly designed and operate in a combined basis. Several alternatives for mixed frequency and power ICI coordination schemes are proposed in this paper. Connected with a proper power mask-based design, the potential gain of a flexible frequency sectorization solution, halfway between fractional/soft frequency reuse and pure frequency sectorization, is explored. The main objective is to outperform fractional/soft frequency reuse offering an attractive trade-off between cell-edge user data rates and average cell throughput. Proposals concerning ICI coordination/avoidance have been evaluated in combination with several heuristic adaptive subcarrier and power allocation algorithms.
