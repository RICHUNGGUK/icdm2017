With the advent of new generation of mobile access devices such as smartphone and tablet PC, we address this for ubiquitous collaboration-the capability of multiple users to link together with disparate access devices in anytime and in anywhere. The implementation and experiments of mobile applications for ubiquitous collaboration were challenge since cell phone (also referred to feature phone) prior to smartphone had high network latency and low computing performance. However, even though mobile device technologies and wireless networking are becoming more advanced with time, the research on the impact of ubiquitous collaboration is still immature. This paper extends our prior work with interactive multimedia services-whiteboard application on 3G and Wi-Fi Android platform based mobile devices, based on MVC (Model View Controller) architecture for ubiquitous collaboration. Then, we present interaction and usability study with multiple users using (wire, wireless) small-sized devices (smartphones), mid-sized devices (tablet PCs), and large-sized device (desktops) to show how disparate access devices and networking have an effect on software design of shared applications in ubiquitous collaboration system.", "paper_title": "An interactive pervasive whiteboard based on MVC architecture for ubiquitous collaboration", "paper_id": "WOS:000350572900003"}
