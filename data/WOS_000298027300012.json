As a consequence, these consistency algorithms can be used as a pre-processing procedure in soft Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) defined over a larger class of semirings, such as those obtained from the Cartesian product of two (or more) semirings. One important instance of this class of semirings is adopted for multi-objective CSPs. First, we show how a semiring can be transformed into a novel one where the + operator is instantiated with the least common divisor (LCD) between the elements of the original semiring. The LCD value corresponds to the amount we can \"safely move\" from the binary constraint to the unary one in the arc consistency algorithm. We then propose a local arc consistency algorithm which takes advantage of this LCD operator. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
