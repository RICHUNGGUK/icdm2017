Linearly parameterized neural networks are used to adaptively approximate the unknown interconnections and fault functions, based on local state information, as well as communicated information from other subsystems. The exchange of state information between subsystems is based on a coordinated communication scheme. The stability of the distributed fault tolerant control scheme is established through a rigorous Lyapunov analysis.", "paper_title": "A Coordinated Communication Scheme for Distributed Fault Tolerant Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000312839600041"}
