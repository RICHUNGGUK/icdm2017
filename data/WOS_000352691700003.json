In heterogeneous networks, energy saving is vital for a sustainable network development, which can be achieved through using various spectrum allocation schemes. It is significant that energy-efficient(EE) spectrum allocation should consider large-scale user behavior, which characterizes the macro BSs that guarantee traffic requirements in non-hotspot regions and the micro BSs that guarantee traffic requirements in hotspot regions. This paper presents four bandwidth allocation schemes for the (a) orthogonal, (b) shared, (c) shared/orthogonal frequency band allocation (SOFA) and (d) shared/orthogonal frequency band allocation under micro BSs transmit power change (SOFA-MPC), where the large-scale user behavior is taken into account. Then we give closed-form formulas of bandwidth allocation schemes which establish the quantitative relationship between the large-scale user behavior and bandwidth allocation strategy. Both theoretical and simulation results show that SOFA scheme is effective in guaranteeing both the demands of the large-scale user behavior and keeping low power consumption than orthogonal allocation scheme and shared scheme. SOFA-MPC scheme has a close relation with the large-scale user behavior too. We give the variation range of transmit power variation bias theta in all circumstances. Simulation and analytical results show that the SOFA-MPC EE is higher than the SOFA EE within the limits of theta.", "paper_title": "Energy Efficient Bandwidth Allocation in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352691700003"}
