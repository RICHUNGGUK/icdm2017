We analyze the global existence of periodic solutions and conclude some of their properties such as being bounded. Furthermore, we construct an appropriate Lyapunov function which implies the global asymptotically stability. To illustrate our theoretical results, numerical simulations are presented.", "paper_title": "Global stability analysis and existence of periodic solutions in an eight-neuron BAM neural network model with delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000340435700034"}
