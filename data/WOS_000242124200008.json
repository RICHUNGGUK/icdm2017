There is an approach to PCFG induction that-is based on parameter estimation. Following this approach, we apply the variational Bayes to PCFGs. The variational Bayes (VB) is an approximation of Bayesian learning. It has been empirically shown that VB is less likely to cause overfitting. Moreover, the free energy of VB has been successfully used in model selection. Our algorithm can be seen as a generalization of PCFG induction algorithms proposed before. In the experiments, we empirically show that induced grammars achieve better parsing results than those of other PCFG induction algorithms. Based on the better parsing results, we give examples of recursive grammatical structures found by the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Variational Bayesian grammar induction for natural language", "paper_id": "WOS:000242124200008"}
