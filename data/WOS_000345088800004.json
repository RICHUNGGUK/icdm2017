In order to reduce the probability of frame skips, a frame skip avoidance scheme based on the analysis of coding modes is proposed. A measure named normalized mode affection factor (NMAF) is proposed so as to analyze the affection of each coding mode on the quality and bit rate of videos. Based on the NMAF, a frame skip avoidance scheme is designed considering the buffer fullness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme could reduce the number of skipped frames greatly; meanwhile the rate distortion performance could also be improved a lot. Compared with JVT-W042, an average 0.45 dB PSNR could be achieved at the same coding bit rate and the average number of skipped frames could be reduced as 11.44 for all the tested video sequences.", "paper_title": "Coding modes-based frame skip avoidance scheme for low bit rate video coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000345088800004"}
