This year, we participated in the bilingual task (English-French and English-Portuguese) and the multilingual task (English, French, Italian, German, Dutch, Finish and Swedish). We introduced the method of combined passages for the bilingual task. Futhermore we have applied the method of logic forms in the same task. For the multilingual task we had a joint participation with the University of Alicante and University of Jaen. We want to emphasize the good score achieved in the bilingual task improving around 45% in terms of average precision.", "paper_title": "Bilingual and multilingual experiments with the IR-n system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000008"}
