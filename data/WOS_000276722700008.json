First, an initial core for each cluster is obtained, and then a tree-like structure is constructed by sequentially absorbing data points into the existing cores according to the KNN linkage score. The CG-KNN can deal with arbitrary cluster shapes via the KNN linkage strategy. On the other hand, it allows the membership of a previously assigned training pattern to be changed to a more suitable cluster. This is supposed to enhance the robustness. Experimental results on four UCI real data benchmarks and Leukemia data sets indicate that the proposed CG-KNN algorithm outperforms several popular clustering algorithms, such as Fuzzy C-means (FCM) (Xu and Wunsch IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks 16:645-678, 2005), Hierarchical Clustering (HC) (Xu and Wunsch IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks 16:645-678, 2005), Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) (Golub et al.
