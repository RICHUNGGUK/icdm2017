With power control, sensor nodes have the ability to adjust transmitting power. While existing works studied the problem assuming a uniform power assignment or allowing unlimited power levels, we investigate the problem with a more realistic power assignment model where the maximum power level is bounded. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work formally proved the NPhardness, though many researchers have been asstiming that this fact holds true. In this paper, we provide a solid proof for this result.", "paper_title": "BROADCAST SCHEDULING PROBLEM IN SINR MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000340461700005"}
