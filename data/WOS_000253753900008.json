Let p denote the standard projection from Rk+m onto R-m. We prove that for any q > 0, the sum of the first q Betti numbers of pi(S) is bounded by (k+ m)(O(ql)). We also present an algorithm for computing the first q Betti numbers of pi(S), whose complexity is (k + m)(2O(ql)). For fixed q and l, both the bounds are polynomial in k + m.", "paper_title": "On projections of semi-algebraic sets defined by few quadratic inequalities", "paper_id": "WOS:000253753900008"}
