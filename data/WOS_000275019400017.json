In this note we consider single-machine due-window assignment and scheduling with job-dependent aging effects and deteriorating maintenance. The objective is to find jointly the optimal time to perform maintenance, the optimal location and size of the due-window, and the optimal job sequence to minimize the total earliness, tardiness, and due-window related costs. We show that the problem can be optimally solved in O(n(4)) time. We also show that a special case of-the problem can be optimally solved by a lower order algorithm. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
