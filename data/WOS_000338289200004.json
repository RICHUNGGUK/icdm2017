P is said to be Z- homeomorphic to the rational polyhedron Q subset of R-m if there is a piecewise linear homeomorphism. of eta onto eta(-1) such that each linear piece of. and.- 1 has integer coefficients. When n = m, Z- homeomorphism amounts to continuous Gn- equidissectability, where Gn = GL( n, Z) Z(n) is the affine group over the integers, i. e., the group of all affinities on Rn that leave the lattice Zn invariant. Gn yields a geometry on the set of rational polyhedra. For each d = 0, 1, 2,..., we define a rational measure.d on the set of rational polyhedra, and show that any two Z- homeomorphic rational polyhedra P. Rn and Q. Rm satisfy.d( P) =.d( Q)..n( P) coincides with the n- dimensional Lebesgue measure of P. If 0 dim P = d < n then.d( P) > 0. For rational d- simplexes T lying in the same d- dimensional affine subspace of Rn,.d( T) is proportional to the d- dimensional Hausdorff measure of T. We characterize.d among all unimodular invariant valuations.", "paper_title": "Invariant Measure Under the Affine Group Over Z", "paper_id": "WOS:000338289200004"}
