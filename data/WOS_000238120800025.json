The signalling protocol handles the requests of connections for end-to-end QoS paths between heterogeneous domains. The proposed approach is based on the use of the minimum information needed and on performance figures existing for each domain. It defines the end-to-end QoS path only as a set of inter-domain requirements between border routers; then in particular, this means that all internal domain paths have no implementation constraints and so may be implemented in the most efficient way by all domain providers and their different technology. The architecture shows how to build the sequence of the needed path equipments and of the ingress and egress routers to construct the end-to-end admission-controlled path.", "paper_title": "Signalling concepts in heterogeneous IP multi-domains networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238120800025"}
