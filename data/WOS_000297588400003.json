We also participated in 2009 with a system developed in the agent-oriented programming language Jason which is an extension of AgentSpeak. We used the implementation from 2009 as a foundation and therefore much of the work done this year was on improving that implementation. We present a description which includes design and analysis of the system as well as the main features of our agent team strategy. In addition we discuss the technologies used to develop this system as well as our future goals in the area.", "paper_title": "Improving multi-agent systems using Jason", "paper_id": "WOS:000297588400003"}
