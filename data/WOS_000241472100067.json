We introduce a new stochastic neural model, working out for a specific class of constraints, which is able to choose adaptively its weights in order to find solutions into a proper subspace (feasible region) of the search space. We show its asymptotic convergence properties and give evidence of its ability to find hight quality solution on benchmark and randomly generated instances of a specific problem.", "paper_title": "A discrete adaptive stochastic neural model for constrained optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100067"}
