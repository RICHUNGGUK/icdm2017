When we consider an asynchronous multi-party network with open communications and an adversary that can adaptively corrupt as many parties as it wishes, we present a new approach to solve the problem of concurrent deniable authentication within the framework of universally composable (UC) security. We formulate a definition of an ideal functionality for deniable authentication. Our constructions rely on a modification of the verifiably smooth projective hashing (VSPH) with projection key function by trapdoor commitment. Our protocols are forward deniable and UC security against adaptive adversaries in the common reference string model. A new approach implies that security is preserved under concurrent composition of an unbounded number of protocol executions; it implies non-malleability with respect to arbitrary protocols and more. The novelty of our schemes is the use of witness indistinguishable protocols and the security is based on the decisional composite residuosity (DCR) assumption. This new approach is practically relevant as it leads to more efficient protocols and security reductions.", "paper_title": "A new approach for UC security concurrent deniable authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000254405900002"}
