In each, sound was generated inside a box with a horn, by means such as a wheel scraping on a string, controlled by a crank and one or more levers. The original instruments were all destroyed during the Second World War. This paper describes reconstructions using digital controllers attached to a lever and crank and sound generated by a physical modelling paradigm to mimic the original construction of wheel, string, box and horn. This allows for a kind of 'preservation' of the original instruments whereby their original enactive properties are recreated.", "paper_title": "An Enactive Approach to the Preservation of Musical Instruments Reconstructing Russolo's Intonarumori", "paper_id": "WOS:000274674600003"}
