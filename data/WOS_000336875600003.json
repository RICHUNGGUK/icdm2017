In this study, we extended our analysis to explore multi-targeted molecules from this set of compounds. Thus, 26 ligands are screened at the binding sites of 229 proteins from 5 main enzyme family classes using molecular docking algorithms. Derived docking scores are compared with reported results of ligands at carbonic anhydrase I and II isoenzymes. Results showed potency of multi-targeted drugs of a few compounds from investigated ligand set. These promising ligands are then tested in silico for their cardiotoxicity risks. Results of this work can be used to improve the desired effects of these compounds by molecular engineering studies. In addition these results may lead to further investigation of studied molecules by medicinal chemists to explore different therapeutic aims. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
