However, the rational design of drugs with a desired polypharmacology profile is still a challenging task, especially when these targets are distantly related or unrelated. In this work, we present a computational approach aimed at the identification of suitable target combinations for multitarget drug design within an ensemble of biologically relevant proteins. The target selection relies on the analysis of activity annotations present in molecular databases and on ligand-based virtual screening. A few target combinations were also inspected with structure-based methods to demonstrate that the identified dual-activity compounds are able to bind target combinations characterized by remote binding site similarities. Our approach was applied to the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) interactome, which contains several targets of key importance in cancer. Promising target combinations were identified, providing a basis for the computational design of compounds with dual activity. The approach may be used on any ensemble of proteins of interest for which known inhibitors are available.", "paper_title": "Computational Polypharmacology Analysis of the Heat Shock Protein 90 Interactome", "paper_id": "WOS:000351652900019"}
