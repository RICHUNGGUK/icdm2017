Considering binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation, we analyze and propose a statistical model based on the Nakagami distribution for the interference terms involved in the received signals. The precision of our model is compared with the common Gaussian approximation and validated through simulation results. A closed-form BER expression is derived as a function of the number of transmit antennas for arbitrary E-b/N-0.", "paper_title": "BER Analysis for Equal Gain Transmission in Downlink Multiuser MIMO Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000377546900020"}
