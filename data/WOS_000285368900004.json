Even if reflected wave transient voltages have received considerable investigation for IGBT voltage source inverters, the modeling and simulation of these voltage transients still require precise modeling. Moreover, another consequence of the IGBT fast rise time, which is the resulting high frequency DM current, has not been previously examined in detail for these systems. This paper presents fully developed mathematical formulas for both pulse voltages and their resulting DM currents at any point along the inverter-to-motor cable. Using the developed formulas, an appropriate tool has been built, using SimPowerSystems (SPS) and Simulink of Mat lab software, to predict the high frequency over-voltages and their associated DM currents all along the feeding cable. This tool has then been applied to an industrial 5 kV A PWM drive prototype using a 4-wire shielded long cable. Some simulation results and experimental validations are included.
