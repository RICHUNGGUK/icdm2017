In this paper, we propose the use of both EMG and ECG signals for the detection of sleep bruxism. Data have been acquired from 21 healthy volunteers and 21 sleep bruxers. The masseter surface EMGs were detected with bipolar concentric electrodes and the ECG with monopolar electrodes located on the clavicular regions. Recordings were made at the subjects' homes during sleeping. Bruxism episodes were automatically detected as characterized by masseter EMG amplitude greater than 10% of the maximum and heart rate increasing by more than 25% with respect to baseline within 1 s before the increase in EMG amplitude above the 10% threshold. Furthermore, the subjects were classified as bruxers and nonbruxers by a neural network. The number of bruxism episodes per night was 24.6 +/- 8.4 for bruxers and 4.3 +/- 4.5 for controls (P < 0.0001). The classification error between bruxers and nonbruxers was 1% which was substantially lower than when using EMG only for the classification. These results show that the proposed system, based on the joint analysis of EMG and ECG, can provide support for the clinical diagnosis of bruxism.", "paper_title": "Use of Electromyographic and Electrocardiographic Signals to Detect Sleep Bruxism Episodes in a Natural Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000327394200003"}
