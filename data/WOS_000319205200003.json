Because several data packets can be transmitted simultaneously through the network, an efficient routing strategy must be used in order to avoid congestion delays. In this paper, ant colony algorithms were used to find and optimize routes in a mesh-based NoC, where several randomly generated applications have been mapped. The routing optimization is driven by the minimization of total latency in packets transmission between tasks. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the ant colony inspired routing by comparing it with general purpose algorithms for deadlock free routing. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
