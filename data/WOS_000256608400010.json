It provides measures for five different concurrency properties. The aim of the model is to provide insight into concurrency bottlenecks in an application. and to provide global direction when performing implementation-independent concurrency optimization. The model focuses on task-level concurrency. A concurrency optimization method and a prototype implementation of a supporting analysis tool have been. developed. We use the model and tool to optimize the concurrency in a number of multimedia applications. The results show that the concurrency model allows target-architecture-independent concurrency optimization. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
