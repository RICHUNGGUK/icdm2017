Security policies impose the use of several mechanisms that protect the information as it moves from a network to another. However, when it comes to confidentiality (achieved through encryption techniques), we find that the special characteristics of block cipher modes force us to employ \"all-or-nothing\" approaches. In this paper, we present a novel solution for this problem that faces performance and security problems using concepts taken from partial encryption and parallel encryption modes.
