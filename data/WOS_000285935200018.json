Emphasis is placed on influencing factors in computational FSI, and their role and clinical implications are discussed in terms of the wall shear stress (WSS). The key factors are: (1) arterial and aneurysm geometries, (2) wall structure modeling, (3) blood pressure, (4) outflow conditions and (5) inflow conditions. Among these, we find the impact of the arterial and aneurysm geometries to be the most significant. Blood pressure also has a significant impact on the WSS distribution; a hypothetical hypertensive blood pressure condition could help estimate the rupture risk for an aneurysm. We find the other three factors to be minor compared with the arterial and aneurysm geometries and blood pressure, although the level of influence could be unique to the middle cerebral artery aneurysms that we have been focusing on in our studies.
