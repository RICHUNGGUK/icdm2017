We first review a particular agent implementation given by an abstract machine, and then identify the extensions required in order to accommodate the main attributes of consciousness. This amounts to form unconscious processor coalitions that result in the creation of contexts. These extensions can be formulated within a reified virtual machine encompassing a representation of the original machine as well as an additional introspective component. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
