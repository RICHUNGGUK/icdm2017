Although this transformation is obtained during the computation in a P system, we consider it as a goal per se, as a pre-computation phase, when the system itself is built. In this framework, several important problems appear: the edit-distance between configurations (with respect to a given set of editing rules), normal forms, the reachability of configurations, or the existence of single configurations from which a given family of configurations can be constructed, only to mention a few. We investigate here some of these questions; the paper is mainly devoted to formulating problems in the new framework, to calling attention to the possible extensions and the usefulness of the present approach.", "paper_title": "Editing configurations of P systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000252980000003"}
