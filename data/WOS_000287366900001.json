We show that no matter what the initial deviation is, the algorithm converges to the target state with certainty for phase shifts between 0 and pi/2, and to the target state with the success probabilities of at least 80% and at least 66% for phase shifts between pi/2 and arccos(-1/4) and between arccos(-1/4) and 2 pi/3, respectively, while the algorithm does not converge for phase shifts between 2 pi/3 and pi.", "paper_title": "FIXED-POINT SEARCH WITH TWO ARBITRARY EQUAL PHASE SHIFTS FOR ANY NUMBER OF ITERATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287366900001"}
