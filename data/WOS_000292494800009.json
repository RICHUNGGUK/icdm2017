In this price model, for the different parameters values of the intensity lambda, the lattice dimension d, the initial density theta, and the multivariate set (theta, lambda), we discuss and analyze the statistical behaviors of the price model. Moreover, we investigate the power-law distributions, the long-term memory of returns and the volatility clustering phenomena for the Chinese stock indices. The database is from the indices of Shanghai and Shenzhen in the 6-year period from July 2002 to June 2008. Further, the comparisons of the empirical research and the simulation data are given.
