One aspect is the bounding and non-bounding properties of generic degrees. Copestake proved that every 2-generic enumeration degree bounds a minimal pair and conjectured that there exists a l-generic degree that does not bound a minimal pair. In this paper we verify this longstanding conjecture by constructing such a degree using an infinite injury priority argument.", "paper_title": "Genericity and non-bounding in the enumeration degrees", "paper_id": "WOS:000252665100013"}
