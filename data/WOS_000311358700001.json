To take full advantage of switched capacitors, it is very important to achieve accurate capacitance ratios in the layout of the capacitor arrays, which are affected by systematic and random mismatches. A good capacitor placement should have a common-centroid structure with the highest possible degree of dispersion to mitigate mismatches. Several dummy units should be inserted to make the placement shape more square and compact. This paper proposes a simulated-annealing-based approach for mismatch-aware common-centroid placement under the above constraints. A pair-sequence representation is used to record a placement, and a couple of associated operations are developed to find better solutions. The experimental results show that the proposed placements achieve smaller oxide-gradient-induced mismatch and larger overall correlation coefficients (i.e., higher degree of dispersion) than those of previous works.", "paper_title": "Mismatch-Aware Common-Centroid Placement for Arbitrary-Ratio Capacitor Arrays Considering Dummy Capacitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000311358700001"}
