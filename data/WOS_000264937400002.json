We propose that arrays of phase Fresnel lenses (PFLs) are a favorable optical coupling technology to match with multi-zone ion traps. Both are scalable technologies based on conventional micro-fabrication techniques. The large numerical apertures (NAs) possible with PFLs can reduce the readout time for ion qubits. PFLs also provide good coherent ion-photon coupling by matching a large fraction of an ion's emission pattern to a single optical propagation mode (TEM(00)). To this end we have optically characterized a large numerical aperture phase Fresnel lens (NA=0.64) designed for use at 369.5 nm, the principal fluorescence detection transition for Yb(+) ions. A diffraction-limited spot w(0) = 350 +/- 15 nm (1/e(2) waist) with mode quality M(2) = 1.08 +/- 0.05 was measured with this PFL. torn this we estimate the minimum expected free space coherent ion-photon coupling to be 0.64%, which is twice the best previous experimental measurement using a conventional multi-element lens. We also evaluate two techniques for improving the entanglement fidelity between the ion state and photon polarization with large numerical aperture lenses.", "paper_title": "SCALABLE, EFFICIENT ION-PHOTON COUPLING WITH PHASE FRESNEL LENSES FOR LARGE-SCALE QUANTUM COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000264937400002"}
