The main focus is on novel combinatorial constructions in order to minimize the number of individual tests at the second stage of a two-stage disjunctive testing procedure. Building on recent work by Levenshtein (Discrete Math., 266:293-309, 2003) and Tonchev (J. Comb. Optim., 15:1-6, 2008), several new infinite classes of such combinatorial designs are presented.", "paper_title": "Efficient Two-Stage Group Testing Algorithms for Genetic Screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000323224200005"}
