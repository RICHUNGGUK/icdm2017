In traditional FMEA, the risk priorities of failure modes are determined by using risk priority numbers (RPNs), which can be obtained by multiplying the scores of risk factors like occurrence (O), severity (S), and detection (D). However, the crisp RPN method has been criticized to have several deficiencies. In this paper, linguistic variables, expressed in trapezoidal or triangular fuzzy numbers, are used to assess the ratings and weights for the risk factors O, S. and D. For selecting the most serious failure modes, the extended VIKOR method is used to determine risk priorities of the failure modes that have been identified. As a result, a fuzzy FMEA based on fuzzy set theory and VIKOR method is proposed for prioritization of failure modes, specifically intended to address some limitations of the traditional FMEA. A case study, which assesses the risk of general anesthesia process, is presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed model under fuzzy environment. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
