Our protocol utilizes a decoherence-free subspace in such a way that an optimal asymptotic transmission rate is achieved, while at the same time encoding and decoding operations can be efficiently implemented. The encoding and decoding circuit requires a number of elementary gates that scale linearly with the number of transmitted qudits, m. The logical depth of our encoding and decoding operations is constant and depends only on the channel in question. For channels described by an arbitrary discrete group G, i.e. with a discrete number, vertical bar G vertical bar, of possible noise operators, perfect transmission at a rate m/(m + r) is achieved with an overhead that scales at most as O(d(r)) where the number of auxiliary qudits, r, depends solely on the group in question. Moreover, this overhead is independent of the number of transmitted qudits, m. For certain groups, e.g. cyclic groups, we find that the overhead scales only linearly with the number of group elements vertical bar G vertical bar.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT QUANTUM COMMUNICATION UNDER COLLECTIVE NOISE", "paper_id": "WOS:000315304800009"}
