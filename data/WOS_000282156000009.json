Direct numerical simulations of atomization are exceedingly expensive computationally. Thus, the need to perform multiscale simulations. In the present study, we performed multiscale simulations of primary atomization using a Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) algorithm coupled with a two-way coupling Lagrangian particle-tracking model to simulate the motion and influence of the smallest droplets. Collisions between two particles are efficiently predicted using a spatial-hashing algorithm. The code is validated by comparing the numerical simulations for the motion of particles in several vortical structures with analytical solutions. We present simulations of the atomization of a liquid jet into droplets which are modeled as particles when away from the primary jet. We also present the probability density function of the droplets thus obtained and show the evolution of the PDF in space. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
