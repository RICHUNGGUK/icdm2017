In multicore systems, the locality of memory access stream is significantly reduced because of multiplexing of access streams from different running programs and hence, leakage energy-saving techniques such as decay cache, which rely on memory access locality, do not save a large amount of energy. The techniques based on way level allocation provide very coarse granularity and the techniques based on offline profiling become infeasible to use for large number of cores. We present a multicore cache energy saving technique using dynamic cache reconfiguration (MASTER) that uses online profiling to predict energy consumption of running programs at multiple LLC sizes. Using these estimates, suitable cache quotas are allocated to different programs using cache coloring scheme and the unused LLC space is turned off to save energy. Even for four core systems, the implementation overhead of MASTER is only 0.8% of L2 size. We evaluate MASTER using out-of-order simulations with multiprogrammed workloads from SPEC2006 and compare it with conventional cache leakage energy-saving techniques. The results show that MASTER gives the highest saving in energy and does not harm performance or cause unfairness. For two- and four-core simulations, the average savings in memory subsystem (which includes LLC and main memory) energy over shared baseline LLC are 15% and 11%, respectively. Also, the average values of weighted speedup and fair speedup are close to one (>= 0.98).", "paper_title": "MASTER: A Multicore Cache Energy-Saving Technique Using Dynamic Cache Reconfiguration", "paper_id": "WOS:000341564700001"}
