Both the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and its suppliers are moving toward quickly providing better products in shorter time by establishing the virtual enterprise. So, effective and efficient collaboration between them throughout the entire product and project lifecycle is becoming significantly important for the win-win situation. To address this need, a scenario for collaborative project management with supplier involvement is proposed in this article. What and how to collaborate with supplier are proposed as well. The system architecture, and the corresponding function, information, process collaboration methods are developed and implemented in this study. Indeed, it is hoped that the development of such a system for the collaboration of project lifecycle in virtual enterprise will lay the frontier basis for the further research of effective project management within virtual enterprise to pursue the most advanced competitiveness.", "paper_title": "Collaborative Project Management with Supplier Involvement", "paper_id": "WOS:000261868600003"}
