Existing research typically covers either simple or more complex architectures guided by either rule or corpus-based approaches. The goal is to combine the best properties of each type. This survey provides a detailed overview of the modification of the standard rule-based architecture to include statistical knowledge, the introduction of rules in corpus-based approaches, and the hybridization of approaches within this last single category. The principal aim here is to cover the leading research and progress in this field of MT and in several related applications. (C) 2014 The Authors.
