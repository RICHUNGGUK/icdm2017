In this paper, quaternary constant-amplitude codes (codes over Z(4)) of length 2(m) with error-correction capabilities are studied. These codes exist for every positive integer in, while binary constant-amplitude codes cannot exist if in is odd. Every word of such a code corresponds to a function from the binary m-tuples to Z(4) having 2 the bent property, i.e., its Fourier transform has magnitudes 2(m/2). Several constructions of such functions are presented, which are exploited in connection with algebraic codes over Z(4) (in particular quaternary Reed-Muller, Kerdock, and Delsarte-Goethals codes) to construct families of quaternary constant-amplitude codes. Mappings from binary to quaternary constant-amplitude codes are presented as well.", "paper_title": "Quaternary Constant-Amplitude Codes for Multicode CDMA", "paper_id": "WOS:000264632200032"}
