In particular, high strength concrete deep beams with various web opening configurations have been given little treatment. In view of this, a nonlinear layered finite element method (LFEM) for cracking and failure analysis of reinforced concrete structures is used to conduct a parametric study to investigate reinforced concrete deep beams various web opening behaviours. This paper initially presents comparisons of LFEM output with published test results to numerical techniques. The paper then focuses on a parametric study on the shear strengths of deep beams with varying web opening configurations such as opening sizes and locations. The results confirm that the current design methods are inadequate in predicting the maximum shear strength when web openings are present. A series of parametric study offers insight into the maximum shear strength of the deep beams being critically influenced by the size and location of web openings.", "paper_title": "Investigation into the behaviour of deep beam with web openings by finite element", "paper_id": "WOS:000311134300004"}
