Res. Lett. 6:287-291, 1999) Commutator key exchange protocol is based. We also apply this method to solve, in polynomial time, the computational problem underlying the Centralizer key exchange protocol, introduced by Shpilrain and Ushakov in (Contemp. Math. 418:161-167, 2006). This is the first provable polynomial-time cryptanalysis of the Commutator key exchange protocol, hitherto the most important key exchange protocol in the realm of noncommutative algebraic cryptography, and the first cryptanalysis (of any kind) of the Centralizer key exchange protocol. Unlike earlier cryptanalyses of the Commutator key exchange protocol, our cryptanalyses cannot be foiled by changing the distributions used in the protocol.", "paper_title": "Polynomial-Time Solutions of Computational Problems in Noncommutative-Algebraic Cryptography", "paper_id": "WOS:000358935100006"}
