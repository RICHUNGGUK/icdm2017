By connection network adjustment among systolic array processing element (PE), the input/output data are jumping in the systolic array for multiplication operation requirements. Various 2-D systolic array topologies, such as square topology and hexagonal topology, have been studied to construct appropriate systolic array configuration and realize high performance matrix multiplication. Based on traditional Kung-Leiserson systolic architecture, the proposed \"Jumping Systolic Array (JSA)\" algorithm can increase the matrix multiplication speed with less processing elements and few data registers attachment. New systolic arrays, such as square jumping array, redundant dummy latency jumping hexagonal array, and compact parallel flow jumping hexagonal array, are also proposed to improve the concurrent system operation efficiency. Experimental results prove that the JSA algorithm can realize fully concurrent operation and dominate other systolic architectures in the specific systolic array system characteristics, such as band width, matrix complexity, or expansion capability.", "paper_title": "The optimal architecture design of two-dimension matrix multiplication Jumping Systolic Array", "paper_id": "WOS:000255647700024"}
