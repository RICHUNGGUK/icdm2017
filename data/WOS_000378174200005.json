It can be employed in several phases of crystal structure determination and as it is only one step in a more complex process, it needs to be as fast as possible. This article begins with a short explanation of crystallography terms needed to understand the Le Bail fitting, then continues with the description of the Le Bail fitting method itself and basic principles on which it is based. Then the parallelization method is explained, starting with a more general process, followed by specifics of GPU accelerated computing including short part on optimization. Finally, achieved results are presented along with comparison to sequential implementation and alternative parallelization approaches.", "paper_title": "Utilization of GPU Acceleration in Le Bail Fitting Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000378174200005"}
