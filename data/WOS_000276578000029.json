We present a new network queue control algorithm and compare it with several network queue control algorithms in literature in terms of end-to-end performance metrics including packet delay, delay jitter and packet loss ratio. Our experiments show that an intermediate network node using our algorithm may deliver better end-to-end performance than others at the cost of reduced link utilization at the node.", "paper_title": "IMPROVING END-TO-END COMMUNICATION PERFORMANCE BY CONTROLLING BEHAVIOR OF INTERMEDIATE NETWORK NODE", "paper_id": "WOS:000276578000029"}
