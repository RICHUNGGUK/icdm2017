Different friction modelling and compensation schemes have been reviewed and neural network based hybrid compensation methods are proposed and experimentally tested on a direct drive servo mechanism. Inertial dynamics is assumed to be constant and a PD type control is deployed for the servo feedback without the motor's electrical dynamics. ANN based techniques resulted in good performance when compared with the experimentally obtained friction model and parametric adaptive models. Advantages and the implementation aspects of the proposed methods are also discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
