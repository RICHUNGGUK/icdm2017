The model represents a two-degree-of-freedom system with quadratic coupling subjected to a modulated sinusoidal excitation. Three types of critical points for the bifurcation response equations near the combination resonance in the presence of internal resonance are considered. these points are characterized by a double zero and two negative eigenvalues, a double zero and a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues, and two pairs of purely imaginary eigenvalues, respectively. For each case, the stability regions for the initial equilibrium solution and the critical bifurcation curves are obtained. The amplitude response curves with respect to detuning/damping parameters for critical bifurcation parameters are obtained for the first two types, and detailed analysed of the eigenvalues of the lineraized system for each parametric region are given. For the third type, with the aid of normal form theroy, the explicit expressions of the critical bifurcation curves leading to incipient and secondary bifurcations are obtained. Bifurcations leading to 2D, 3D tori and their stability conditions are also investigated. Some new dynamical behaviors are presented for this system. (C) 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
