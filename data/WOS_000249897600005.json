In the network, a number of fixed subscriber stations act as hopping transmission stations between base stations and far away subscribers, forming a cellular and ad hoc mobile network model. At the radio layer, TDD code division multiple access (CDMA) is selected as the radio interface due to high efficiency of frequency usage. In order to improve the system performance in terms of downlink capacity, we propose different time slot allocation schemes with the usage of fixed hopping stations, which can be selected by either random or distanced dependent schemes. Performance results obtained by computer simulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network to improve downlink system capacity.", "paper_title": "Downlink performance improvement of TDD CDMA cellular networks with time slot and fixed hopping station allocations", "paper_id": "WOS:000249897600005"}
