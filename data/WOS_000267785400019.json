With this in mind, we carried out an empirical study on an undergraduate degree course in Information Systems Management. The study consisted of the creation and broadcast of 13 podcasts, distributed over four months in which ninety distance students took part. The analysis follows the suggestions proposed in previous literature about the evaluation of technologies in a university learning environment. The findings, discussed within the framework of principles for good practice in higher education, suggest some interesting issues in distance courses, such as: (I) podcasting is a powerful tool as a complement to the traditional resources on a course, but not a substitute for them: (2) the characteristics of podcasting increase the impression of permanent contact between students and teachers, increasing students' motivation; (3) the use of podcasting allows for a diverse range of student skills and learning methods. Other secondary findings are discussed and some suggestions for future research are proposed at the end of this paper. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
