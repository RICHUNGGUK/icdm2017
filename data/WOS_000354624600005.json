By using VE, the impacts of re-configurability and new-process additions in the machine stops can be viewed down to the component level. On the other hand, discrete event simulation (DES) typically forecasts the system behaviour over a period of time to predict future performance. During pre-build stages of machines, DES analysis comes with uncertainties, as most of the parameters in the model are based on the assumptions. Therefore, it was aimed to use the validated and verified data, for example 'process time' of a machine component available from the VE-emulated systems, in the DES model. Thus, a systematic algorithm was proposed to integrate the VE tool data, with the DES. This article presents the development of a package known as 'virtual-driven discrete event simulation' (VDSim), used to establish an integration between the VE and DES domains. The success of this integration depends upon the quality of information and the compatibility of data flow between these independent domains. VDSim integration will help productivity planners and schedulers to get the best possible options for resource selection at stages even when the resource is not physically present.", "paper_title": "Integration approach to virtual-driven discrete event simulation for manufacturing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000354624600005"}
