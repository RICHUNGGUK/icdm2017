Through in house test the variation law of asphalt fumes with heating temperature and heating time. The result shows that with an increase of heating time, the yield of asphalt fumes appears increasing tendency. During the initial stage, the smoke yielding rate is fast; in later stage the variation slows down; and finally the variation becomes stable. With higher heating temperature, the yield of asphalt fumes is greater. Partial addictives are selected for smoke suppression effect test from flame retardant agent, plastic smoke suppression agent, physical adsorbent, polymer modified agent and aging resistant agent. SBS and nanometer calcium carbonate compound type modifying agent of better smoke suppression effects are selected for test and asphalt fumes is reduced around 29.0% in total.", "paper_title": "FUME SUPPRESSION AGENTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL-FRIENDLY ASPHALT PAVEMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000283468700020"}
