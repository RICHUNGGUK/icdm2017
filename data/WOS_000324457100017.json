A hypersingular boundary element (BEM) formulation is used to obtain the solution to the direct problem (elastic displacements, electric and magnetic potentials) and create the corresponding training sets. Furthermore, the noise sensitivity of the resulting approach is analyzed. Results show that the proposed tool can be successfully applied to identify the location, orientation and length of different crack configurations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
