Huang et al. [1] proposed an efficient multi-precision integer division algorithm, and experimentally showed that it is about three times faster than the most popular algorithms proposed by Knuth [2] and Smith [3]. This paper reports a bug in the algorithm of Huang et al. [1], and suggests the necessary corrections. The theoretical correctness proof of the proposed algorithm is also given. The resulting algorithm remains as fast as that of [1]. (C) 2013 Elsevier BM.
