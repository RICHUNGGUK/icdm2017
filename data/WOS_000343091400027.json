In this paper, a finite element model incorporating various electrode configurations was used to study the interaction between electrode size and electrode-to-cell distance in current focusing and VE stimulation paradigms. The electrode array unit comprises an active electrode, six flanking return electrodes and a distant monopolar return. A quasi-monopolar (QMP) fraction is defined as the proportion of current which can be preferentially returned through the distant return, in comparison with the more adjacent flanking electrodes. The simulation results indicate that current focusing and VE strategies can be optimized by tuning the QMP fraction. The QMP fraction is adjusted to optimize the electric field spread based on retinal ganglion cell (RGC) density in the degenerate retina, thereby offsetting the effect of inhomogeneous distribution of surviving RGCs and leading to a uniform stimulation paradigm across electrodes. Importantly, there is negligible difference in functional performance across electrode configurations for distances less than the electrode diameter, implying that the stimulation mode does not significantly affect activation threshold or activated retinal area for electrode diameters greater than the retinal thickness. Furthermore, the QMP fraction has a significant effect on VE performance, defined by activation threshold and activated retinal area, when threshold current is evenly divided between two adjacent active electrodes.
