The method is the non-parametric identification based on the concept of zero-crossings regarding the system responses. It involves an integral equation of the first kind, resulting in the lack of stability properties. The difficulty of instability is overcome by the stabilization technique. The workability of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical experiment consisting of a highly nonlinear system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
