More specifically, we first compute the Laplacian coordinates of the mesh vertices, then filter the Laplacian coordinates, and finally reconstruct the mesh from the filtered Laplacian coordinates by solving a linear least square system. The proposed detail editing method includes not only feature preserving smoothing but also enhancing. Furthermore, the proposed approach allows interactive editing of some user-specified frequencies and regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is much more versatile and faster than the existing methods.", "paper_title": "Versatile surface detail editing via Laplacian coordinates", "paper_id": "WOS:000289209800006"}
