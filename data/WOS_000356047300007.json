This complexity is increased with the use of many different tools for specific tasks during an analysis process. In this work various design and analysis models are linked throughout the design lifecycle, allowing them to be moved between packages in a way not currently available. Three technologies named Cellular Modeling, Virtual Topology and Equivalencing are combined to demonstrate how different finite element meshes generated on abstract analysis geometries can be linked to their original geometry. Cellular models allow interfaces between adjacent cells to be extracted and exploited to transfer analysis attributes such as mesh associativity or boundary conditions between equivalent model representations. Virtual Topology descriptions used for geometry clean-up operations are explicitly stored so they can be reused by downstream applications. Establishing the equivalence relationships between models enables analysts to utilize multiple packages for specialist tasks without worrying about compatibility issues or substantial rework.", "paper_title": "Using mesh-geometry relationships to transfer analysis models between CAE tools", "paper_id": "WOS:000356047300007"}
