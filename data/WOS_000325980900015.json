LDA determines an optimal discriminant space for linear data projection based on certain assumptions, e. g., on using normal distributions for each class and employing class representation by the mean class vectors. However, there might be other vectors that can represent each class, to increase class discrimination. In this brief, we propose an optimization scheme aiming at the optimal class representation, in terms of Fisher ratio maximization, for LDA-based data projection. Compared with the standard LDA approach, the proposed optimization scheme increases class discrimination in the reduced dimensionality space and achieves higher classification rates in publicly available data sets.", "paper_title": "On the Optimal Class Representation in Linear Discriminant Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000325980900015"}
