Benefiting from RFID and sensor network technology, common physical objects can be connected, and are able to be monitored and managed by a single system. Such a network brings a series of challenges for data storage and processing in a cloud platform. IoT data can be generated quite rapidly, the volume of data can be huge and the types of data can be various. In order to address these potential problems, this paper proposes a data storage framework not only enabling efficient storing of massive IoT data, but also integrating both structured and unstructured data. This data storage framework is able to combine and extend multiple databases and Hadoop to store and manage diverse types of data collected by sensors and RFID readers. In addition, some components are developed to extend the Hadoop to realize a distributed file repository, which is able to process massive unstructured files efficiently. A prototype system based on the proposed framework is also developed to illustrate the framework's effectiveness.", "paper_title": "An IoT-Oriented Data Storage Framework in Cloud Computing Platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800058"}
