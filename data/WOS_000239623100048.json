Results reviewed maintain particular reference to research that uses biologically inspired design principles and concepts, such as emergence and evolution, as a means of attaining cooperative behavior. The core of this article argues that even though emergent cooperative behavior derived within RoboCup (and the larger field of multi-robot systems) is still in its infancy, it holds considerable future potential, as a problem solver in domains where systems comprising many interacting components must cooperatively solve a global task.", "paper_title": "Emergent cooperation in RoboCup: A review", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623100048"}
