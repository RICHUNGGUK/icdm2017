Unlike the standard view of logics to reason about coalitionally rational action, the capacity of a set of agents to take a rational decision will be restricted to what we will call agreements, which can be seen as solution concepts to a dependence structure present in a certain game. The language will identify those agreements that act accordingly or disaccordingly with the desirable properties arbitrarily set up in the beginning, and will reveal, by logical reasoning, a variety of structural properties of this type of collective action.", "paper_title": "Forbidding undesirable agreements", "paper_id": "WOS:000350247700005"}
