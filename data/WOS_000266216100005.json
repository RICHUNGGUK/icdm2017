However, computing with T2 FSs can require undesirably large amount of computations since it involves numerous embedded T2 FSs. To reduce the complexity, interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2 FSs) can be used, since the secondary memberships are all equal to one [21]. In this paper, three novel interval type-2 fuzzy membership function (IT2 FMF) generation methods are proposed. The methods are based on heuristics, histograms, and interval type-2 fuzzy C-means. The performance of the methods is evaluated by applying them to back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs). Experimental results for several data sets are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed membership assignments. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
