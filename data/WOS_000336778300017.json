The developed hazard assessment methodology consists of different consolidated techniques for the (a) identification of spatial susceptibility, i.e. potential landslide sources in previous unfailed slopes, (b) estimation of the probability of cover thickness involvement in initial landsliding, (c) evaluation of temporal probability and (d) numerical modeling of potential landslides. In this study, the SCIDDICA Cellular Automata landslide model has been considered and applied to the northern sector of Mount Pendolo (Sorrento Peninsula), which was affected by several landslides in historical time. Model calibration has been performed by considering past events of similar scale and type. Results of these simulations were satisfactory as proven by the comparison between real and simulated reference events. Several possible source areas have been hypothesized and a potential future landslide scenario has been simulated by using SCIDDICA. By associating to each simulation a spatial, magnitude and temporal probability, a landslide invasion hazard scenario was mapped. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
