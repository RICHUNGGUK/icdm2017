In wireless multi-hop networks the perimeter is a concept extremely hard to identify, thus, it is much more effective to enforce control on the nodes that will route more traffic. But traffic filtering and traffic analysis are costly activities for the limited resources of mesh nodes, so a trade-off must be reached limiting the number of nodes that enforce them. This work shows how, using the OLSR protocol, the centrality of groups of nodes with reference to traffic can be estimated with high accuracy independently of the network topology or size. We also show how this approach greatly limits the impact of an attack to the network using a number of firewalls that is only a fraction of the available nodes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
