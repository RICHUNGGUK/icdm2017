Watermarking technology has been widely used in multimedia copyright protection with good progress in development. However, each watermarking scheme has its advantages and disadvantages against various attacks, and the optimal resistance against all attacks has not been achieved. Therefore, this paper aimed to find the optimal watermarking scheme using grey-relational analysis. The experimental results showed that a relatively better watermarking scheme could be selected based on the various requirements of watermarking.", "paper_title": "APPLICATION OF GREY-RELATIONAL ANALYSIS TO FIND THE MOST SUITABLE WATERMARKING SCHEME", "paper_id": "WOS:000294797500021"}
