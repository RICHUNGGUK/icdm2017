Information-Centric Networking (ICN) technologies are the natural candidates to efficiently distribute popular content to users. However, the strategic incentives in exploiting ICN, for both users and ISPs, are much less understood to date. In this article we highlight strategic incentives for ICN overlay adoption in OTT services, that is, we discus how OTTs shall shape their prices to motivate ICN overlay usages.", "paper_title": "On the Incentives and Incremental Deployments of ICN Technologies for OTT Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000338714000004"}
