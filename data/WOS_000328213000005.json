This paper describes the process of the creation of a reference speech corpus and its distribution to potential users, as it was done in the case of the Slovene corpus GOS. The corpus structure and fieldwork experiences with recording, labelling system, and two levels of transcription (pronunciation-based and standardized) are described, as well as the main characteristics of the corpus interface (web concordancer) and the availability of the original corpus files.", "paper_title": "Compilation, transcription and usage of a reference speech corpus: the case of the Slovene corpus GOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000328213000005"}
