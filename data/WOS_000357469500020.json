One major shortage of classical SOM learning algorithm is the necessity of predefined map topology. Furthermore, hierarchical relationships among data are also difficult to be found. Several approaches have been devised to conquer these deficiencies. In this work, we propose a novel SOM learning algorithm which incorporates several text mining techniques in expanding the map both laterally and hierarchically. On training a set of text documents, the proposed algorithm will first cluster them using classical SOM algorithm. We then identify the topics of each cluster. These topics are then used to evaluate the criteria on expanding the map. The major characteristic of the proposed approach is to combine the learning process with text mining process and makes it suitable for automatic organization of text documents. We applied the algorithm on the Reuters-21578 dataset in text clustering and categorization tasks. Our method outperforms two comparing models in hierarchy quality according to users' evaluation. It also receives better F1-scores than two other models in text categorization task. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
