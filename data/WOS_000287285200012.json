Application of (G'/G)-expansion method to travelling-wave solutions of three nonlinear evolution equation. Comput Fluids 2010;39:1957-63], the (G'/G)-expansion method was used to find travelling-wave solutions to three nonlinear evolution equations that arise in the mathematical modelling of fluids. The author claimed that the method delivers more general forms of solution than other methods. In this note we point out that not only is this claim false but that the delivered solutions are cumbersome and misleading. The extended tanh-function expansion method, for example, is not only entirely equivalent to the (G'/G)-expansion method but is more efficient and user-friendly, and delivers solutions in a compact and elegant form.
