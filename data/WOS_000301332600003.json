Here, the feasible protection access architectures for the tree- and ring-based PONs are studied and discussed. Furthermore, different scenarios of fault locations, such as in the feeder fiber and distribution fiber, are also studied in the optical distributed networks.", "paper_title": "Self-protected time-division-multiplexed passive access networks in tree and ring topology architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000301332600003"}
