Due to the growth of the BGP routing tables in the Internet, the support of multihoming with IPv6 must allow route aggregation to preserve the scalability of the Internet routing system. After several years of development, the IETF and the research community propose drastic changes in how site multihoming shall be achieved in IPv6. Those changes will potentially affect the fundamental multihoming mechanism, as well as intradomain routing, traffic engineering, and even the behavior of hosts within the multihomed site. This paper presents the required functionalities and the constraints imposed to the solutions to the IPv6 multihoming problem. It surveys the main multihoming approaches that have been proposed to the IETF over the period 2000-2005. It proposes a taxonomy, and compares the solutions according to their mechanisms, benefits, and drawbacks. This survey also outlines the major steps that have led to a new multihoming architecture for IPv6.", "paper_title": "THE PATHS TOWARD IPV6 MULTIHOMING", "paper_id": "WOS:000208213300003"}
