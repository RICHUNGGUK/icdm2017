This paper proposes an effective solution for TIR by combining shape description and feature matching. We first present an effective shape description method which includes two shape descriptors. Second, we propose an effective feature matching strategy to compute the dissimilarity value between the feature vectors extracted from images. Finally, we combine the shape description method and the feature matching strategy to realize our solution. We conduct a large number of experiments on a standard image set to evaluate our solution and the existing solutions. By comparison of their experimental results, we can see that the proposed solution outperforms existing solutions for the widely used performance metrics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
