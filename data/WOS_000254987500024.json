Cauchy-Born (CB) kinematics, which accounts for the shifts of the crystal basis, is used in continuum regions to relate atomic motions to continuum deformation gradients. To avoid failures of the CB kinematics, QC is augmented with a phonon stability analysis that detects lattice period extensions and identifies the minimum required periodic cell size. This augmented approach is referred to as Cascading Cauchy-Born kinematics. The method is analyzed for both first- and second-order phase transformations, and demonstrated numerically on a one-dimensional test problem.", "paper_title": "A multilattice quasicontinuum for phase transforming materials: Cascading Cauchy Born kinematics", "paper_id": "WOS:000254987500024"}
