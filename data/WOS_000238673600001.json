We introduce an alternative definition of average degree, which better separates different lattices. These measures are compared on a class of lattices and are analysed using a Markov chain describing a random walk on the lattice. Using the new measure, we conjecture the order of both the critical probabilities for bond percolation and the connective constants for self-avoiding walks on these lattices.", "paper_title": "On measures of average degree for lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000238673600001"}
