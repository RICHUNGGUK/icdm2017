Since the problem appears to be particularly hard for general-purpose solvers, we develop a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) and refine it with three alternative Path Relinking procedures. For comparison purposes, we also develop a Tabu Search algorithm with a self-adapting tabu tenure. The experimental results show that GRASP performs better than Tabu Search and that Path Relinking significantly contributes to its effectiveness. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
