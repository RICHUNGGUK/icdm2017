The far-field grid preserves almost every computational advantage of uniform grids including cache coherency, regular subdivisions for parallelization, simple data layout, the existence of efficient numerical discretizations and algorithms for solving partial differential equations, etc. This allows fluid simulations to cover large domains that are often infeasible to enclose with sufficient resolution using a uniform grid, while still effectively capturing fine scale details in regions of interest using dynamic adaptivity.", "paper_title": "A New Grid Structure for Domain Extension", "paper_id": "WOS:000321840100032"}
