A deployment of traditional security policies for enforcing confidentiality of Cloud users' data would lead to a conflict with the availability of the Cloud's software services: confidentiality of data would be assured but Cloud services would not be available for every user of a Cloud. This state-of-the-art contribution shows the analogy of the confidentiality of external data processing by Cloud services with mechanisms known and applied in privacy. Sustainability in Cloud is a matter of privacy, which in Cloud is called \"isolation\".", "paper_title": "Isolation in Cloud Computing and Privacy-Enhancing Technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000290801400004"}
