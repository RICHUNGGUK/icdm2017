This quantum perceptron network utilizing quantum phase adequately has the computing power that the conventional perceptron is unable to realize. Through case, performance analysis and simulation,a quantum perceptron with only one neuron can realize XOR function unrealizable with a classical perception having a neuron. Simple network structure can achieve comparatively complicated network function,which will throw heavy influence on the field of artificial intelligence and control engineering.", "paper_title": "Quantum perceptron network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100068"}
