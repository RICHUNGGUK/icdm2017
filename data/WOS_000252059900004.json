Both network-induced delay and packet dropout are addressed. The controller design method is presented based on a delay-dependent approach, and the robust H. controller gain matrices are obtain by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Moreover, a general Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is used, and some slack matrices, which bring much flexibility in solving LMIs, are introduced during the proof. Simulation results show the validity of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "T-S fuzzy-model-based robust H-infinity design for networked control systems with uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000252059900004"}
