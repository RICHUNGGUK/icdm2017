Device-independent quantum key distribution was proposed to design a real-life secure quantum key distribution system with imperfect and untrusted quantum devices. In this paper, we analyzed the security of BB84 protocol in a device-independent scenario based on the entanglement distillation method. Since most of the reported loopholes are in receivers of quantum key distribution systems, we focus on condition that the transmitter of the system is perfectly coincident with the requirement of the BB84 protocol, while the receiver can be controlled by eavesdropper. Finally, the lower bound of the final secret-key rate was proposed and we explained why the secure-key rate is similar to the well-known result for the original entanglement distillation protocol.", "paper_title": "A STUDY OF BB84 PROTOCOL IN A DEVICE-INDEPENDENT SCENARIO: FROM THE VIEW OF ENTANGLEMENT DISTILLATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000324004400005"}
