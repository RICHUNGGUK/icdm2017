Among the configurations considered are trapping and stopping sets. These sets represent subsets of variable nodes in the Tanner graph of a code that play an important role in determining the height and point of onset of the error-floor in its performance curve. The techniques used for deriving the spectra include large deviations theory and statistical methods for enumerating binary matrices with prescribed row and column sums. These techniques can also be applied in a setting that involves more general structural entities such as subcodes and/or minimal codewords, that are known to characterize other important properties of soft-decision decoders of linear block codes.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic spectra of trapping sets in regular and irregular LDPC code ensembles", "paper_id": "WOS:000243317600003"}
