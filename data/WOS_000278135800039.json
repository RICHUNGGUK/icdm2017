Positional and tangential continuities are highly required in designing and manufacturing. We propose a method for filling n-sided regions with untrimmed triangular Coons B-spline patches, preserving G (1) continuity exactly. The algorithm first computes a central point, a central normal, the central, and the corner derivative vectors. Then the region is split into n triangular areas by connecting the central point to each corner of the boundary. These inner curves and all cross-boundary derivatives are computed fulfilling G (1) compatibility conditions. And finally, the triangular patches are generated in the Coons B-spline form, one boundary of which is regressed to the central vertex. Neither positional nor tangential error is introduced by this method. And only one degree elevation is needed.", "paper_title": "Filling n-sided regions with G (1) triangular Coons B-spline patches", "paper_id": "WOS:000278135800039"}
