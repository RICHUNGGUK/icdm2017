Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system is used for modeling, and dynamic parallel distributed compensation (DPDC) technique is employed in the controller design. Solutions to the problems are derived in terms of a family of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and uncertainties are directly considered in the conditions that determine the controller. Effectiveness of the proposed design technique is illustrated by simulation for an inverted pendulum system.
