Just like classical splines, quantum splines admit a canonical basis with compact support: the quantum B-splines. These quantum B-splines are the q-analogues of classical B-splines. Here quantum B-spline bases and quantum B-spline curves are investigated, using a new variant of the blossom: the q (quantum)-blossom. The q-blossom of a degree d polynomial is the unique symmetric, multiaffine function in d variables that reduces to the polynomial along the q-diagonal. By applying the q-blossom, algorithms and identities for quantum B-spline bases and quantum B-spline curves are developed, including quantum variants of the de Boor algorithms for recursive evaluation and quantum differentiation, knot insertion procedures for converting from quantum B-spline to piecewise quantum B,zier form, and a quantum variant of Marsden's identity.", "paper_title": "Quantum B-splines", "paper_id": "WOS:000316076800009"}
