With the channel state information (CSI) of co-channel interferers (CCIs), this algorithm can be used in flat fading and frequency selective channels to suppress CCIs. Compared with the optimal transceiver of MIMO maximal ratio combining (MRC) systems, results of simulation show that this scheme improves the uplink transmission performance significantly.", "paper_title": "MIMO-OC Scheme to Suppress Co-channel Interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000279250100029"}
