The more likelihood a preference value is, the bigger the weight is, and vice versa. The proposed model is further extended to the situation where the preference value is an interval number by introducing a new method for interval number comparison. An example of energy technology evaluation is provided to demonstrate that the proposed approach is reasonable and simple.", "paper_title": "A Model to Determine OWA Weights and Its Application in Energy Technology Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000353982300002"}
