It was shown that an image fusion technique based on wavelet decomposition seems to be a better trade-off between spectral and spatial information in a single image. This paper presents a novel image fusion scheme that is based on wavelet transform and fuzzy logic. The two source images are first decomposed using the discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). Then different rules are used for different components in the fusion procedure. Local average energy is utilized as the fusion parameter for the low frequency component first; then membership degree of wavelet transform coefficient is used as the fusion parameter for the high frequency parts; finally, the fused image is obtained by taking inverse wavelet transform from the combined coefficients. The proposed fusion approach is shown to be effective using some remote sensing test images.", "paper_title": "A novel image fusion approach based on wavelet transform and fuzzy logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000243552500004"}
