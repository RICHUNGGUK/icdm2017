The experimental data set consists of vibration signals recorded by four accelerometers on a mechanical device including rolling element bearings: the signals were collected both with all faultless bearings and after substituting one faultless bearing with an artificially damaged one. Four defects and, for one of them, three severity levels are considered. Classification accuracy higher than 99% was achieved in all the experiments performed on the vibration signals represented in the frequency domain, thus proving the high sensitivity of our method to different types of defects and to different degrees of fault severity. The degree of robustness of our method to noise is also assessed by analyzing how the classification performance varies with the signal-to-noise ratio and using statistical classifiers and neural networks.", "paper_title": "Robust Diagnosis of Rolling Element Bearings Based on Classification Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000326113700044"}
