The relationship between the pulse width modulation (PWM) of a signal's duty cycle and control law was determined experimentally, and a mathematical model of the whole system established. Owing to unknown disturbances and unmodeled dynamics, there are considerable uncertain nonlinearities and parametric uncertainties in this pneumatic system. A modified direct adaptive robust controller (DARC) was constructed to cope with these issues. The controller employs a gradient type adaptation law based on discontinuous projection mapping to guarantee that estimated unknown model parameters stay within a known bounded region, and uses a deterministic robust control strategy to weaken the effects of unmodeled dynamics, disturbances, and parameter estimation errors. By using discontinuous projection mapping, the parameter adaptation law and the robust control law can be synthesized separately. A recursive backstepping technology is applied to account for unmatched model uncertainties. Kalman filters were designed separately to estimate the motion states and the derivative of the intermediate control law in synthesizing the deterministic robust control law. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.", "paper_title": "A modified direct adaptive robust motion trajectory tracking controller of a pneumatic system", "paper_id": "WOS:000343904600009"}
