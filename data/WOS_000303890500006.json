Designing efficient WMNs has become a major task for networks operators. Over the last few years, a plethora of studies has been carried out to improve the efficiency of wireless networks. However, only a few studies are related to WMNs design and are mainly concerned with protocol design and routing metrics optimization. In this paper, we survey different aspects of WMNs design and examine various methods that have been proposed either to improve the performance of an already deployed network or to improve its performance by a careful planning of its deployment.", "paper_title": "Wireless Mesh Networks Design - A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000303890500006"}
