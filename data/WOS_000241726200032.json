Therefore, this system can be considered a self-medication assistant tool. In a nutshell, this web application validates drug consumptions of a given patient, based on patient information stored in an electronic health care record, with a drug and symptom knowledge base. The efficiency and accuracy of the knowledge base inferences depend on the quality, quantity and recency of the drug instances. A practical source for these information are databases. Thus we developed a data integration solution which enables the mapping of relational databases to a Description Logics knowledge base.", "paper_title": "Data integration targeting a drug related knowledge base", "paper_id": "WOS:000241726200032"}
