However, in literature, only an algebraic interpretation was presented for the relation between the image of the absolute conic and sphere images. In this paper, we propose two geometric interpretations of this relation and two novel camera calibration methods using sphere images are derived from these geometric interpretations.", "paper_title": "Geometric interpretations of the relation between the image of the absolute conic and sphere images", "paper_id": "WOS:000241195700012"}
