Modelling introduces further choices as to levels of mathematical description. The resulting possibilities are difficult to explore rapidly, hampering the integration of modelling and experiment. We have developed Proteus, a web-based, context-specific tool for building compartmentalized, ordinary differential equation ( ODE) models. It is inspired by the idea of a molecular 'toolkit' for Ca2+ signalling. Toolkits in Proteus are context-independent representations of biological systems as sets of components, which may correspond to mechanisms of differing levels of complexity. Users pick and choose components from a toolkit and, for each component, pick and choose from different mechanisms, each of which describes a different instantiation of the component's mechanism. Proteus combines these choices into a system of ODEs, which may then be downloaded in SBML ( Systems Biology Markup Language), Matlab or Fortran format and independently analyzed. Toolkits, components and mechanisms are user-constructible, either de novo or by cannibalizing existing models, including all those in the Biomodels database. A wide variety of context-specific models may thereby be rapidly built, modified and explored.", "paper_title": "Proteus: a web-based, context-specific modelling tool for molecular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000303338200018"}
