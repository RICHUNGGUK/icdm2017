One common technique to improve the execution efficiency is to add redundant constraints, which are constraints logically implied by others in the problem model. However, some redundant constraints are propagation redundant and hence do not contribute additional propagation information to the constraint solver. Redundant constraints arise naturally in the process of redundant modeling where two models of the same problem are connected and combined through channeling constraints. In this paper, we give general theorems for proving propagation redundancy of one constraint with respect to channeling constraints and constraints in the other model. We illustrate, on problems from CSPlib (http: //www. csplib. org), how detecting and removing propagation redundant constraints in redundant modeling can speed up search by several order of magnitudes.", "paper_title": "Removing propagation redundant constraints in redundant modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000249658400005"}
