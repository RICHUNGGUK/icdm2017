However, these users may have difficulties in selecting and installing Assistive Software in their devices for managing smart environments. This paper addresses the requirements of these kinds of systems and their design in the context of interoperability architectures. Our solution follows a semantic approach, for which ontologies are a key. The paper also presents an implementation of our design proposal, i.e., a real and usable system which is evaluated according to a set of functional and non-functional requirements here proposed.
