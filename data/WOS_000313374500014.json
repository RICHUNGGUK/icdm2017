Toward this end, we propose a new automatic way to integrate a background subtraction (BGS) and an alpha matting technique via a heuristic seeds selection scheme. Specifically, our method can be divided into three main steps. First, we use a, novel BGS method as attention mechanisms, generating many possible foreground pixels by tuning it for low false-positives and false-negatives as much as possible. Second, a connected components algorithm is used to give the bounding boxes of the labeled foreground pixels. Finally, matting of the object associated to a given bounding box is performed using a heuristic seeds selection scheme. This matting task is guided by top-down knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
