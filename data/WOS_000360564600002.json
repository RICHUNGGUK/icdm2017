Clearly, these image repositories need to be managed, and tools for effectively and efficiently searching image databases are highly sought after, especially on mobile devices where more and more images are being stored. In this paper, we present an image browsing system for interactive exploration of image collections on mobile devices. Images are arranged so that visually similar images are grouped together while large image repositories become accessible through a hierarchical, browsable tree structure, arranged on a hexagonal lattice. The developed system provides an intuitive and fast interface for navigating through image databases using a variety of touch gestures.", "paper_title": "Interactive browsing of image collections on mobile devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000360564600002"}
