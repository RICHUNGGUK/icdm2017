Among the proposed algorithms, those based on graph centrality measures demonstrate a high performance gain. In this paper, we propose a new graph theoretic approach for automatically identifying and evaluating subgoals. Moreover, we propose a method for providing some useful prior knowledge for corresponding policy of developed skills based on two graph centrality measures, namely node connection graph stability and co-betweenness centrality. Investigating some benchmark problems, we show that the proposed approach improves the learning performance of the agent significantly.", "paper_title": "Automatic skill acquisition in reinforcement learning using graph centrality measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000300110900007"}
