The structure of this process is then compared with Robert Darnton's communications circuit in order to propose a new model for the publication. As the publication process has a profound impact on the teaching and practice of collection development and reader studies in LIS, the discipline must be aware of any changes to the publication process. Design/methodology/approach - Using the case study approach, this research examines the cultural product, Fifty Shades of Grey (FSOG). Evidence included fanfiction and self-published manuscripts, reader reception of these texts, and a timeline of how the texts developed. Findings - Evidence gathered from the case study illustrate a variety of players and infrastructure present in the development and trajectory of FSOG. Throughout the entire development of the cultural product, readers were found to be active agents in the publication process promoting strong connections between reader and author. Findings focus on the themes of textual development and their publicity. Originality/value - Proposes a new model for the publication process that includes fanfiction and self-publishing.", "paper_title": "Beyond traditional publishing models An examination of the relationships between authors, readers, and publishers", "paper_id": "WOS:000355922100011"}
