We argue that MaaS should support not only the conventional state monitoring capabilities, such as instantaneous violation detection, periodical state monitoring, and single tenant monitoring, but also performance-enhanced functionalities that can optimize on monitoring cost, scalability, and the effectiveness of monitoring service consolidation and isolation. In this paper, we present three enhanced MaaS capabilities and show that window-based state monitoring is not only more resilient to noises and outliers, but also saves considerable communication cost. Similarly, violation-likelihood-based state monitoring can dynamically adjust monitoring intensity based on the likelihood of detecting important events, leading to significant gain in monitoring service consolidation. Finally, multitenancy support in state monitoring allows multiple cloud users to enjoy MaaS with improved performance and efficiency at more affordable cost. We perform extensive experiments in an emulated cloud environment with real-world system and network traces. The experimental results suggest that our MaaS framework achieves significant lower monitoring cost, higher scalability, and better multitenancy performance.", "paper_title": "Enhanced Monitoring-as-a-Service for Effective Cloud Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000322453200003"}
