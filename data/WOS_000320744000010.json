Compatibility and equilibrium between the partitions is ensured at the level of the parent structure, where the dual super-elements handle the two-way communication of interface displacements/forces/stiffness and other analysis-specific entities. The proposed approach can be applied relatively easily to existing monolithic finite element analysis programs, and it offers more freedom to the user with regard to defining partitions, load balancing and isolating parts of the structure of specific interest. Several examples are used in the paper to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach. (C) 2012 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
