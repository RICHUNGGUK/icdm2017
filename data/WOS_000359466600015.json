In 2011, Sakumoto, Shirai and Hiwatari presented two new zero-knowledge identification protocols based exclusively on the MQ problem. The 3-pass identification protocol of Sakumoto et al. has impersonation probability 2/3. In this paper, we propose an improvement that reduces the impersonation probability to 1/2. The result is a protocol that reduces the total computation time, the total communication needed and requires a smaller number of rounds for the same security level. We also present a new extension that achieves an additional communication reduction with the use of some smaller hash commitments, but maintaining the same security level.", "paper_title": "Improved Identification Protocol Based on the MQ Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466600015"}
