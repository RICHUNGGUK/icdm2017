The spatial information is the joint gray level values of the pixel to be segmented and its neighboring pixels that are based on the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The new method was obtained by extending the one-dimensional (1D) cross-entropy thresholding method to a two-dimensional (2D) one in the GLCM. Firstly, the 2D local cross-entropy is defined at the local quadrants of the GLCM. Then, the 2D local cross-entropy is used to perform the optimal threshold selection by minimizing. Results from segmenting the real-world images demonstrate that the new method is capable of achieving better results when compared with 1D cross-entropy and other classical GLCM based thresholding methods.
