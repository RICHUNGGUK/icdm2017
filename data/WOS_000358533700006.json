These solutions achieve very successful results for general mood changes, e.g., changing the appearance of an image from sunny to overcast. However, such methods have a hard time creating new image content, such as leaves on a bare tree. Texture transfer, on the other hand, can synthesize such content but tends to destroy image structure. We propose the first algorithm that unifies color and texture transfer, outperforming both by leveraging their respective strengths. A key novelty in our approach resides in teasing apart appearance changes that can be modeled simply as changes in color versus those that require new image content to be generated. Our method starts with an analysis phase which evaluates the success of color transfer by comparing the exemplar with the source. This analysis then drives a selective, iterative texture transfer algorithm that simultaneously predicts the success of color transfer on the target and synthesizes new content where needed. We demonstrate our unified algorithm by transferring large temporal changes between photographs, such as change of season - e.g., leaves on bare trees or piles of snow on a street - and flooding.", "paper_title": "Unifying Color and Texture Transfer for Predictive Appearance Manipulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000358533700006"}
