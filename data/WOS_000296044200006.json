Fingerprint features are rationalized as dependent Bernoulli variables and conditional distributions of Tanimoto similarity values of database compounds given a reference molecule are assessed. The conditional correlated Bernoulli model is utilized in the context of virtual screening to estimate the position of a compound obtaining a certain similarity value in a database ranking. Through the generation of receiver operating characteristic curves from cumulative distribution functions of conditional similarity values for known active and random database compounds, one can predict how successful a fingerprint search might be. The comparison of curves for different fingerprints makes it possible to identify fingerprints that are most likely to identify new active molecules in a database search given a set of known reference molecules.", "paper_title": "Introduction of the Conditional Correlated Bernoulli Model of Similarity Value Distributions and its Application to the Prospective Prediction of Fingerprint Search Performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000296044200006"}
