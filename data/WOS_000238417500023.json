However, current service matching algorithms operate on service advertisements, which don't contain enough information to select a service instance that the consumer can immediately interact with. In this paper, we propose a precise matching algorithm, based on WS-Agreement and OWL-S, to deal with this challenge. We show how to combine WS-Agreement with OWLS to obtain an agreement-style service description, and how the degree of match between two descriptions of this style is calculated(1).", "paper_title": "Precise matching of semantic Web Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500023"}
