Technological Innovations have created new forms of electronic data which are more vulnerable to theft or loss when compared to traditional data storage. Moreover, the recent advances in internet technologies have exacerbated the risk of security threats. The Internet brings a whole new set of challenges in terms of data protection. Considering the complexities of modern technological advancements and its impact on data security, this study examines the Irish laws and EU directives for privacy and data security, its effectiveness in managing large scale data breaches and limitations. This paper also simulates attack scenarios that can be done by anonymous users in a complex cyberspace environment and explains how a digital evidence related to the attack scenario can be tracked down.", "paper_title": "Cyberspace Challenges and Law Limitations", "paper_id": "WOS:000360696500037"}
