The velocity field is modeled continuously using B-splines and the spatiotemporal transform is constrained to be diffeomorphic. Images before scan conversion are used to improve the accuracy of the estimation. The similarity measure includes a model of the speckle pattern distribution of B-mode images. It also penalizes the disagreement between tissue Doppler velocities and the estimated velocity field. Registration accuracy is evaluated and compared to other alternatives using a realistic synthetic dataset, obtaining mean displacement errors of about 1 mm. Finally, the method is demonstrated on data acquired from six volunteers, both at rest and during exercise. Robustness is tested against low image quality and fast heart rates during exercise. Results show that our method provides a robust motion estimate in these situations.", "paper_title": "Improved Myocardial Motion Estimation Combining Tissue Doppler and B-Mode Echocardiographic Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000344589200003"}
