This paper proposes several advanced techniques to improve the Hamming weight-based SCCA (HW-SCCA) on the block cipher PRESENT. The new techniques utilize non-linear equations and an iterative scheme to extract more information from leakage. The new attacks need only 2(8.95) chosen plaintexts to recover 72 key bits of PRESENT-80 and 2(9.78) chosen plaintexts to recover 121 key bits of PRESENT-128. To the best of our knowledge, these are the most efficient SCCAs on PRESENT-80/128. To show the feasibility of the proposed techniques, real attacks have been conducted on PRESENT on an 8-bit microcontroller, which are the first SCCAs on PRESENT on a real device. The proposed HW-SCCA can successfully break PRESENT implementations even if they have some countermeasures such as random delay and masking.
