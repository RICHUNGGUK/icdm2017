The various analyses have employed to address research discipline of Management Information Systems (MIS). Since ISF is a forum for not only academic researchers but also industrial experts, it is worth to shed light on distinctive research features of ISF. I created a keyword classification scheme, incorporating new research topics into Barki's information systems keyword classification scheme. This research describes the disciplines of 318 papers in 14 issues published on ISF until 2012 by 796 scholars, examining word frequency and keyword co-occurrence.", "paper_title": "Information systems frontiers: Keyword analysis and classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000349963200016"}
