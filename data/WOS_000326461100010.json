With the development of machine learning algorithms for activity classification, dataset is significantly important for algorithms testing and validation. Collection of real data is a challenging process due to involved budget, human resources, and annotation cost that's why mostly researchers prefer to utilize existing datasets for evaluation purposes. However, openly available smart home datasets indicate variation in terms of performed activities, deployed sensors, and environment settings. Unfortunately, the analysis of existing datasets characteristic is a bottleneck for researchers while selecting datasets of their intent. In this paper, we develop a Framework for Smart Homes Dataset Analysis (FSHDA) to reflect their diverse dimensions in predefined format. It analyzes a list of data dimensions that covers the variations in time, activities, sensors, and inhabitants. For validation, we examine the effects of proposed data dimension on state-of-the-art activity recognition techniques. The results show that dataset dimensions highly affect the classifiers' individual activity label assignments and their overall performances. The outcome of our study is helpful for upcoming researchers to develop a better understanding about the smart home datasets characteristics with classifier's performance.", "paper_title": "Analysis and effects of smart home dataset characteristics for daily life activity recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000326461100010"}
