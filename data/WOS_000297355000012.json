The segmentation of prostate lesions from TRUS images is very challenging due to issues, such as poor contrast, low SNRs, and irregular shape variations. To address these issues, a novel approach is employed to segment the lesions from the surrounding prostate, where region merging is performed via a region-merging likelihood function based on regional statistics, as well as Fisher-Tippett statistics. Experimental results using TRUS prostate images demonstrate that the proposed Fisher-Tippett region-merging approach achieves more accurate segmentation of prostate lesions when compared to other segmentation methods.", "paper_title": "Fisher-Tippett Region-Merging Approach to Transrectal Ultrasound Prostate Lesion Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000297355000012"}
