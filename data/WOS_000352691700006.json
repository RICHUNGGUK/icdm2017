However, due to the limited energy capacity, relay nodes that run out of battery may cause disconnected path and result in failure of end-to-end data transmission in WSN-based IoT. Therefore, besides saving energy in itself, each sensor involved in the multi-hop transmission activity also needs a feasible strategy to select the relay nodes by leveraging their residual energy and multi-hop IoT network connectivity. In this paper, we first analyze energy consumption model and data relay model in WSN-based IoT, and then propose the concept of \"equivalent node\" to select relay node for optimal data transmission and energy conservation. A probabilistic dissemination algorithm, called ENS_PD, is designed to choose the optimal energy strategy and prolong the lifetime of whole network. Extensive simulation and real testbed results show that our models and algorithms can minimize energy consumption while guarantee the quality of communication in WSN-based IoT in comparison with other methods.", "paper_title": "Optimal Energy Strategy for Node Selection and Data Relay in WSN-based IoT", "paper_id": "WOS:000352691700006"}
