The underlying CO2DE concept is the mask metaphor. This concept uses a versioning mechanism for collaborative graphic editing in which changes on the artifact can be created independently from the overall work, and in which different viewpoints can be identified and discussed. Studies conducted with the tool demonstrate that CO2DE allows the use of different editing strategies as a resource to provide participants with awareness of the discussion flow and of different viewpoints concerning the artifacts.", "paper_title": "Supporting multiple viewpoints in collaborative graphical editing", "paper_id": "WOS:000243769100004"}
