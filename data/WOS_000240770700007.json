The span of an L(h, k)-labelling is the difference between the largest and the smallest assigned frequency. The goal of the problem is to find out an L(h, k)-labelling with minimum span. The L(h, k)-labelling problem has been intensively studied following many approaches and restricted to many special cases, concerning both the values of h and k and the considered classes of graphs. This paper reviews the results from previous by published literature, looking at the problem with a graph algorithmic approach.", "paper_title": "The L(h, k)-labelling problem: A survey and annotated bibliography", "paper_id": "WOS:000240770700007"}
