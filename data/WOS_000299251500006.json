Let V p be constructed by taking every vertex in V independently with probability p. Let X be the number of edges in E that are contained in V p. We give a condition that guarantees the concentration of X within a small interval around its mean. The applicability of this result is demonstrated by deriving new sub-Gaussian tail bounds for the number of copies of small complete and complete bipartite graphs in the binomial random graph.
