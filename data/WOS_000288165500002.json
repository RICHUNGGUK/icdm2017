An automatic gain control transimpedance amplifier (TIA) and linear post amplifiers are used to maintain a high linearity with multilevel modulation. Using multilevel signaling and large-diameter integrated photodiodes make the presented optical receiver suitable for small-bandwidth high-attenuation large-core PMMA step index plastic optical fiber. A measured sensitivity of -31 dBm (BER = 10(-9)) at 250 Mb/s is presented for a binary signal. A data rate of 500 Mb/s and a sensitivity of -25 dBm (BER = 10(-9)) are achieved with four-level pulse amplitude modulation (4-PAM). An error-free transmission over 40 m PMMA step index plastic optical fiber was achieved at 500 Mb/s using 4-PAM signaling with the presented multilevel optical receiver.", "paper_title": "An integrated optical receiver for multilevel data communication over large core step index plastic optical fiber", "paper_id": "WOS:000288165500002"}
