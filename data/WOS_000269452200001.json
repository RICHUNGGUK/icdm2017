Each type has four ports: Y, X and two Z ports. The first type is the Floating Second Generation Current Conveyor (FCCII) and includes both CCII+ and CCII- as special cases. The second type is the Floating Inverting Second Generation Current Conveyor (FICCII) and includes both ICCII+ and ICCII- as special cases. The Nodal Admittance Matrix (NAM) stamp for the Nullator-Pathological Current Mirror is derived. Examples are given together with a CMOS circuit realizing both the FCCII and FICCII.", "paper_title": "ON THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW FLOATING CURRENT CONVEYORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000269452200001"}
