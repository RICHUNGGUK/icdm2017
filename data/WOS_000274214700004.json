We also devised a special scheme that avoids per-user reservation signaling overhead in order to meet scalability requirements needed for next generation multi-access networks. The first proposal, Distributed Call Admission Control with Aggregate Resource Reservation (VR), uses mobility prediction based on mobile positioning system location information and takes into account the expected bandwidth to be used by calls handing off to and from neighboring cells within a configurable estimation time window. In Conjunction, a novel concept called virtual reservation has been devised to prevent per-user reservation Our second proposal, Local Call Admission Control and Time Series-based Resource Reservation, takes into account the expected bandwidth to be used by calls handed off from neighboring cells based only oil local information stored into the current cell a user is seeking admission to. To this end, we suggest the use of two time series-based models for predicting handoff load: the Trigg and Leach (TL), which is in adaptive exponential smoothing technique, and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) that uses the Box and Jenkins methodology. It is worth to emphasize that the use of bandwidth prediction based oil ARIMA technique still exist for wireless networks. The novelty of our approach is to build in adaptive framework based on ARIMA technique that takes into account the measured handoff dropping probability in order to tuning the prediction time window size so increasing the prediction accuracy. the proposed schemes are compared through simulations with the fixed guard channel (GC) and other optimized dynamic reservation-based proposals present in the literature. The results Show that Our schemes Outperform many others and that the simpler local proposal based oil TL can grant nearly similar levels of handoff dropping probability as compared to those from more the complex distributed approach.", "paper_title": "Approaches to resource reservation for migrating real-time sessions in future mobile wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000274214700004"}
