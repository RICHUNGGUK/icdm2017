Our model clusters vertices with similar motion-related behaviors. To find these similarities, for each frame of an animated mesh sequence, vertices' motion properties are analyzed and clustered using a Gestalt approach. Each cluster is analyzed as a single unit and representative vertices of each cluster are used to extract the motion-saliency values of each group. We evaluate our method by performing an eye-tracker-based user study in which we analyze observers' reactions to vertices with high and low saliencies. The experiment results verify that our proposed model correctly detects the regions of interest in each frame of an animated mesh. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
