Design/methodology/approach - The research model was tested with data from 219 of PCHome's online shopping customers using a web survey. PLS (partial least squares) was used to analyze the measurement and structural models. Findings - Data collected from 219 valid respondents provided support for all but one hypotheses (with a p-value of less than 0.05). The unsupported hypothesis regards the relationship between service quality and satisfaction (H4). The study shows that trust, net benefits, and satisfaction are significant positive predictors of customers' repurchase intentions toward online shopping. Information quality, system quality, trust, and net benefits, are significant determinants of customer satisfaction. Besides, online trust is built through distributive, procedural, and interactional justice. Overall, the research model accounted for 79 percent of the variance of repurchase intention. Originality/value - An endeavor to extend the updated IS success model in terms of the peculiar nature of e-commerce is needed. The study complements the updated IS success model with justice trust perspectives, considering them a more comprehensive measure of online shopping satisfaction and repurchase intention in an e-commerce context.", "paper_title": "Understanding customers' satisfaction and repurchase intentions An integration of IS success model, trust, and justice", "paper_id": "WOS:000295751600005"}
