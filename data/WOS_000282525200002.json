It is important to determine accurate spectrum utilization of the primary system in a cognitive radio environment. In order to define the spectrum utilization state, many CR systems use what is known as the quiet period (QP) method. However, even when using a QP, interference can occur. This causes reduced system throughput and contrary to the basic condition of cognitive radio. In order to reduce the interference time, a frequency-hopping algorithm is proposed here. Additionally, to complement the loss of throughput in the FH, a HMM-based channel prediction algorithm and a channel allocation algorithm is proposed. Simulations were conducted while varying several parameters. The findings show that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional channel allocation algorithms.", "paper_title": "HMM-based Adaptive Frequency-Hopping Cognitive Radio System to Reduce Interference Time and to Improve Throughput", "paper_id": "WOS:000282525200002"}
