In this paper, we take the shortest distance computation as a case to investigate the technique issues in outsourcing graph operations. We first propose a parameter-free, edge-based 2-HOP delegation security model (shorten as 2-HOP delegation model), which can greatly reduce the chances of the structural pattern attack and the graph reconstruction attack. We then transform the original graph into a link graph kept locally and a set of outsourced graphs . Our objectives include (i) ensuring each outsourced graph meeting the requirement of 2-HOP delegation model, (ii) making shortest distance queries be answered using and , (iii) minimizing the space cost of . We devise a greedy method to produce and , which can exactly answer shortest distance queries. We also develop an efficient transformation method to support approximate shortest distance answering under a given average additive error bound. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.", "paper_title": "Outsourcing shortest distance computing with privacy protection", "paper_id": "WOS:000321914500006"}
