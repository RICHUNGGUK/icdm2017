Due to the high-investment costs involved in the development of high-efficient and high-flexible automated storage systems, performance estimation of the systems is both practically and theoretically important. The authors suggest a new method to estimate the travel time of a recently emerging version of AS/RSs, the multi-shuttle systems. The proposal is based on an industrial standard established by the Federation Europeenne de la Manutention (F.E.M.). In order to estimate travel times, the authors conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to determine coordinates of two additional representative points which are not given by F.E.M. Then they conduct a new Monte Carlo simulation to compare the results obtained by the method they proposed with those of previous methods and models developed in scientific literature based on Bozer and White formulations. Several real industrial applications demonstrate the validity of proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
