In this paper, a new approach to image feature matching is proposed, in which the integrated feature is defined and combined with the SUSAN method for image detection and tracking. Firstly the edge detection employs the SUSAN (Small Univalue Segment Assimilating Nucleus) method at low level image processing. Then, feature matching is conducted with the newly defined an integrated feature, consisting of seven invariant moments of Hu and Normalized Moment of Inertia (NMI) in combination with intensity and configuration information. The feature detection with the SUSAN method locates precisely and is insensitive to local noise. The seven invariant moments and NMI of images have features of translation invariability, rotation invariability and scale invariability. Therefore, the matching algorithm of image integrated features is good for images with somewhat intensity variety, geometry aberration and noise. The matching results can achieve target recognition and tracking. The experimental results also show that the algorithm is efficient.", "paper_title": "Image detection based on SUSAN method and integrated feature matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000254028000016"}
