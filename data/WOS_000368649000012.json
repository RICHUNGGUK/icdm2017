Input current ripple is reduced by employing two boost circuits at the input, which makes this converter appropriate for fuel cell application. Current stress on switches is reduced because of the resonance in switches, and also, as a result of zero voltage switching in switches, switching losses will be reduced in this proposed converter. In the output, the reverse recovery problem of diodes is alleviated by zero current switching, so there is no need for fast diodes anymore. The reduction of losses improves the efficiency, and in a wide range of load, efficiency is high. Experimental results on a 1-kW prototype are provided to validate the proposed concept.", "paper_title": "Analysis and design of an interleaved current-fed high step-up quasi-resonant DC-DC converter for fuel cell applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000368649000012"}
