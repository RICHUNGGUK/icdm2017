The average measured core power on a 0.13-mu m CMOS using a 100-kHz clock and a core voltage of 0.75 V is 692 nW. The core area is 21 000 mu m(2) and the latency is 356 cycles. This design further challenges the low-resource end of the design space and is the first reported submicrowatt design for the AES; it has significant power-latency-area performance improvements over the previous state-of-the-art application-specific IC (ASIC) implementations.", "paper_title": "692-nW Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) on a 0.13-mu m CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000284546000012"}
