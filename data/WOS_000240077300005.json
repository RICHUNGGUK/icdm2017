In the absence of centralized coordination, we use the classical method of imposing appropriate taxes (tolls) on the edges of the network. We significantly generalize previous work [20,13,9] by allowing user demands to be elastic. In this setting the demand of a user is not fixed a priori but it is a function of the routing cost experienced, a most natural assumption in traffic and data networks.", "paper_title": "Edge pricing of multicommodity networks for selfish users with elastic demands", "paper_id": "WOS:000240077300005"}
