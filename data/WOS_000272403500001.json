Our method uses a logistic regression model to combine mappings proposed by a set of classifiers (up to 17 in our implementation). The method is formally described and evaluated by means of two implementations for semiautomatically building Spanish and Thai WordNets using Princeton's WordNet for English and conventional English-Spanish and English-Thai bilingual dictionaries.
