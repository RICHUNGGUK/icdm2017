In this article, we generalize the structure of labels, and the underlying term structure, in order to keep track of exponential information too. We first define two-labelled calculi with explicit substitutions and resource management, where labels are in close correspondence with paths in call-by-value and call-by-name translations of the lambda-calculus into Linear Logic proof nets, respectively. We observe a tight relationship between labels and the dynamics of substitutions; this will then guide us through the design of a third calculus that combines the advantages of the previous two, where labels fully reflect the dynamics of substitutions.", "paper_title": "Labelled calculi of resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000337066700005"}
