Numerically tracing the homotopy path gives a non-interior point homotopy method for solving the VIP. Numerical tests are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A globally convergent non-interior point homotopy method for solving variational inequalities", "paper_id": "WOS:000299552900003"}
