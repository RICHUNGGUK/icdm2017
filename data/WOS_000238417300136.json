However, in realistic cases, the planning problem is far from trivial. Such issue is more serious when services are embraced in grid environments, which are usually resource-conscious. We propose a planning techniques for the automated composition of grid services described in OWL-S process models. The technique allows for the synthesis of plans that encode compositions of grid services with the usual programming constructs. We apply this technique in our DDGrid project and do some preliminary experimental evaluations.", "paper_title": "Automatic services composition in the grid environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300136"}
