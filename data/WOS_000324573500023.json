Multiphase transmission schemes are proposed for both channels which possess novel ingredients, namely, multiphase partial interference nulling, distributed interference management via user scheduling, and distributed higher order symbol generation. The achieved degree-of-freedom (DoF) values are greater than the best previously known DoFs for both channels with delayed CSI at the transmitters.", "paper_title": "On the Degrees of Freedom of K-User SISO Interference and X Channels With Delayed CSIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000324573500023"}
