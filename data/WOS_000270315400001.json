This duality theory is based on the concept of the dual space M of a digital net. In this paper we extend the duality theory from (finite) digital nets to (infinite) digital sequences. The analogue of the dual space is now a chain of dual spaces for which a certain projection of M(m+1) is a subspace of As an example of the use of dual space chains, we show how a well-known construction of digital sequences by Niederreiter and Xing can be achieved in a simpler manner by using our duality theory for digital sequences.
