The proposed system architecture enables the use of a combination of diagnostic methods from heterogeneous knowledge sources. The process ontology and the process agents are designed based on the structure of the process system, while the diagnostic agents implement the applied diagnostic methods. A specific completeness coordinator agent is implemented to coordinate the diagnostic agents based on different methods. The system is demonstrated on a case study for diagnosis of faults in a granulation process based on HAZOP and FMEA analysis.", "paper_title": "Multiagent realization of prediction-based diagnosis and loss prevention", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623800010"}
