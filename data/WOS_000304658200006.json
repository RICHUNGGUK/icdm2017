Especially, very low power consumption modulation method is required for the short range communication systems such as the medical implantable communication devices or capsule endoscope, and so on. For the higher data rate, we like to combine the OFDM system into the QAPM since the OFDM system has higher bandwidth efficiency than a single-carrier system. In this paper, we like to propose a QAPM (Quadrature amplitude position modulation) method combined with the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Next, we analyze the performance of three low-power-consumption modulation schemes: the phase shift position modulation (PSPM), phase silence shift keying (PSSK), and QAPM using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system in the multi-path channel. These schemes have lower bandwidth efficiency and the higher power efficiency than the existing phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes. It can be shown that they can achieve greater power efficiency because every modulation symbol has a zero-envelope period as in pulse-position modulation (PPM) techniques. Finally, we compare the performances of the PSPM, PSSK, and QAPM modulation combined with the OFDM system with regard to bit error rate performance and throughput.", "paper_title": "Multicarrier-Based QAPM Modulation System for the Low Power Consumption and High Data Rates", "paper_id": "WOS:000304658200006"}
