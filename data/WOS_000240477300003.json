A nominal CAD model from a component designer is different from its corresponding worn one and therefore cannot be directly used for tool path generation for build up and machining repair processes. This is the main reason that most repair process used for complex geometry parts, such as gas turbine blades, is currently carried out manually and is called the \"Black Art\". This paper proposes a defects-free model-based repair strategy to generate correct tool paths for build up process and machining process adaptive to each worn component through the reverse engineering application. Based on 3D scanning data, a polygonal modelling approach is introduced in this paper to rapidly restore worn parts for direct use of welding, machining and inspection processes. With this nominal model, this paper presents the procedure to accurately define and extract repair error, repair volume and repair patch geometry for the tool path generation, which is adaptive to each individual part. The tool paths are transferred to a CNC machine for the repairing trials. Further research work is performed on repair geometry extraction algorithm and repair module development within the reverse engineering environment. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
