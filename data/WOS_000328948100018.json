The proposed algorithm considers slice (i.e., a row of macroblocks (MBs)) errors and uses DP (Dynamic Programming) optimization technique to estimate the lost MVs in a global manner, differing from the traditional Boundary Matching Algorithm (BMA) and others that recover MVs independently for individual MBs in an erroneous slice. We also propose an iterative DP process based on 8 x 8 pixels blocks to resolve finer motions (for 8 x 8, 8 x 16, and 16 x 8 pixels blocks) that will aid in the enhancement of reconstruction quality. Experiment results show that our algorithm outperforms the well-known BMA by up to 7.28 dB and the DMVE and another prior work by Qian et al. by up to 1.0 dB at a packet loss rate of 15%. Subjective evaluation shows that our algorithm is especially promising in preserving line/curve features and motion details.", "paper_title": "Motion Vector Recovery for Video Error Concealment by Using Iterative Dynamic-Programming Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000328948100018"}
