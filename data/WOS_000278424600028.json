By a proposed transformation, parameter b is considered into confidence interval of v-SVC model. Then this paper proposes a new v-support vector classifier machine (Nv-SVC). To seek the optimal parameter of Nv-SVC, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. The results of application in fault diagnosis of car assembly line show the hybrid diagnosis model based on Nv-SVC and PSO is effective and feasible, the comparison between the method proposed in this paper and other ones is also given, which proves this method is equivalent to standard v-SVC.
