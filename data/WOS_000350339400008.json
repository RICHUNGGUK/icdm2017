Shan and H. Chen, Phys. Rev. E 47, 1815 (1993)]. Two-dimensional (2D) single bubble motions were simulated, considering the buoyancy effect for which the topology of the bubble was characterized by the nondimensional Eotvos (Eo), and Morton (M) numbers. In this study, a new approach based on the \"effective buoyancy\" was adopted and proven to be consistent with the expected bubble shape deformation. This approach expands the range of effective density differences between the bubble and the liquid that can be simulated. Based on the balance of forces acting on the bubble, it can deform from spherical to ellipsoidal shape with skirts appearing at high Eo number. A benchmark computational case for qualitative and quantitative validation was performed using COMSOL Multiphysics based on the level set method. Simulations were conducted for 1 <= Eo <= 100 and 3 x 10(-6) <= M <= 2: 73 x 10(-3). Interfacial tension was checked through simulations without gravity, where Laplace's law was satisfied. Finally, quantitative analyses based on the terminal rise velocity and the degree of circularity was performed for various Eo and M values. Our results were compared with both the theoretical shape regimes given in literature and available simulation results.", "paper_title": "Lattice Boltzmann simulation of rising bubble dynamics using an effective buoyancy method", "paper_id": "WOS:000350339400008"}
