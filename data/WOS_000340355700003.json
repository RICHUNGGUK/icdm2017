The software can graphically represent the allocation of transmission cost to network users. Thanks to its graphical user interface, the software is very friendly for the students. Moreover, this article presents an educational example that helps students understand all the calculations that are involved in transmission pricing. The software and the example-driven presentation have been proven very efficient in the education of students at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece. In conclusion, the work presented in this article advances the use of computer application in the education of transmission pricing.
