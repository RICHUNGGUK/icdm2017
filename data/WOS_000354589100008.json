Satisfying a set of imperative constrains and optimizing a set of objectives, the reader deployment is the primary problem for the most challenging RFID network planning (RNP), and needs to be reasonably solved to operate the large-scale RFID systems in an optimal fashion. By taking the coverage, signal interference and load balance as the optimization objectives and deducing the objective ranges, the reader deployment is conducted as a problem of multi-objectives combination optimization. And then, by introducing the Metropolis rule of Simulated Annealing Algorithm, an improved Particle Swarm Algorithm is proposed (SA-PSO) to solve this problem, which can restrict the position change of original and new particles in the iteration process and accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm. The simulation results show that the addressed SA-PSO algorithm is superior to the compared algorithms in coverage optimization, and the whole system performance can be enhanced by optimizing the signal interference and load balance among the deployed readers.
