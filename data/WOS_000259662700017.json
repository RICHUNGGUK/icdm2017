However, the techniques for acquiring OMs still need to be improved if high-quality and efficient OMs are desired. In this paper, we present a method for calibrating a motorized object rig to facilitate the acquisition of OMs. We first apply the CPC kinematic model to formulate the 3D configuration of the device, and then propose a method to estimate the parameters of the CPC model of the device. Furthermore, a visual tool is provided for users to adjust the controllable axes of the rig according to the estimated results. After this calibration, more accurate camera parameters can be obtained and then be used for different purposes. In this work, we use the parameters to reconstruct, from an OM, the 3D model of the 3D object, and then adjust the OM according to the center of the 3D model so that a high-quality OM can be obtained for rendering.", "paper_title": "Calibration of motorized object rig and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000259662700017"}
