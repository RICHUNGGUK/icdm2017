The standard PSO is extended by employing a comprehensive learning strategy, different particle updating approaches, and a feasibility-based rule method. The experiment results show the algorithm located the global optima in all tested problems, and even found a better solution than those previously reported in the literature. In some cases, it outperforms other methods in terms of both solution accuracy and computational cost.", "paper_title": "Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer for Constrained Mixed-Variable Optimization Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000285930800013"}
