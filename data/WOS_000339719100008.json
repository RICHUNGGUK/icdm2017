Using a variational approximation, this approach has been successfully applied to simulated data from model neurons. Here, we use this method to analyze a population of real neurons recorded in a slice preparation of the zebra finch forebrain nucleus HVC. Our results demonstrate that using only 1,500 ms of voltage recorded while injecting a complex current waveform, we can estimate the values of 12 state variables and 72 parameters in a dynamical model, such that the model accurately predicts the responses of the neuron to novel injected currents. A less complex model produced consistently worse predictions, indicating that the additional currents contribute significantly to the dynamics of these neurons. Preliminary results indicate some differences in the channel complement of the models for different classes of HVC neurons, which accords with expectations from the biology. Whereas the model for each cell is incomplete (representing only the somatic compartment, and likely to be missing classes of channels that the real neurons possess), our approach opens the possibility to investigate in modeling the plausibility of additional classes of channels the cell might possess, thus improving the models over time. These results provide an important foundational basis for building biologically realistic network models, such as the one in HVC that contributes to the process of song production and developmental vocal learning in songbirds.", "paper_title": "Estimating parameters and predicting membrane voltages with conductance-based neuron models", "paper_id": "WOS:000339719100008"}
