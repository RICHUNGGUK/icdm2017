In this work, we tackle the problem at the example of d-branch SP-type UFNs with contracting MDS diffusion (dCUFN-SP). Under some restrictions on the contracting MDS matrices over multiple rounds, we prove lower bounds on the number of differentially active S-boxes for dCUFN-SP with is an element of {3, 4} and on the number of linearly active S-boxes for dCUFN-SP with d >= 3. As opposed to SPNs and BFNs, the number of differentially active S-boxes for such constructions does not directly translate to an upper bound on the probability of differential trails. So we provide a thorough analysis of single-round differentials that yields an upper bound on the probability of a differential trail. It is also shown that the efficiency level of dCUFN-SP is comparable to that of BFNs and SPNs with respect to differential and linear cryptanalysis.", "paper_title": "On unbalanced Feistel networks with contracting MDS diffusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000288452200003"}
