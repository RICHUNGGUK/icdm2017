It has been a well-known open problem in parameterized computation and complexity whether the DFVS problem is fixed-parameter tractable, that is, whether the problem can be solved in time f (k)n(O(1)) for some function f. In this article, we develop new algorithmic techniques that result in an algorithm with running time 4(k)k!nO(1) for the DFVS problem. Therefore, we resolve this open problem.", "paper_title": "A Fixed-Parameter Algorithm for the Directed Feedback Vertex Set Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000260916000002"}
