The present study employs computational fluid dynamics to investigate the importance of applying a realistic LVAD profile when evaluating assisted aortic flow fields and subsequently compares a number of potential anastomosis locations in a patient-specific aortic geometry. The outflow profile of the Berlin Heart INCOR (R) device was provided by Berlin Heart GmbH (Berlin, Germany) and the cannula was attached at a number of locations on the aorta. Simulations were conducted to compare a flat profile against the real LVAD profile. The results illustrate the importance of applying an LVAD profile. It not only affects the magnitude and distribution of oscillatory shear index, but also the distribution of flow to the great arteries. The ascending aorta was identified as the optimal location for the anastomosis.", "paper_title": "Importance of realistic LVAD profiles for assisted aortic simulations: evaluation of optimal outflow anastomosis locations", "paper_id": "WOS:000303560100010"}
