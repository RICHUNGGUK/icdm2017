Evolutionary algorithms are proven to be appropriate for such problems. In this paper, we propose an improved differential evolution algorithm that uses a mix of different mutation operators. In addition, the algorithm is empowered by a covariance adaptation matrix evolution strategy algorithm as a local search. To judge the performance of the algorithm, we have solved well-known benchmark as well as a variety of real-world optimization problems. The real-life problems were taken from different sources and disciplines. According to the results obtained, the algorithm shows a superior performance in comparison with other algorithms that also solved these problems.", "paper_title": "An Improved Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution Algorithm for Optimization Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000312839600009"}
