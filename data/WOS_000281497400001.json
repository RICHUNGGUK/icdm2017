Our approach follows techniques of sliding mode control and adaptive estimation law. The adaptive algorithm is constructed based on the sliding mode control to ensure perfect tracking and synchronization in presence of system uncertainty and external disturbance. Stability of the closed-loop system is proved using Lyapunov stability theory. Our theoretical findings are supported by simulation results. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
