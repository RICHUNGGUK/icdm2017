In this paper, we focus on the problem of optimal probabilistic epidemic forwarding with energy constraint. By introducing a continuous time model, we obtain the optimal static and dynamic policies for multi-messages forwarding. Extensive numerical results show that the optimal dynamic policy achieves higher transmission probability than the optimal static policy while the number of messages decreases the average transmission probability.", "paper_title": "Optimal Probabilistic Epidemic Forwarding for Energy Constrained Delay Tolerant Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000281343100024"}
