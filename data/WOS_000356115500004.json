This study combined a survey study and system dynamics (SD) simulation to demonstrate an organic KM performance evaluation approach. The survey study was conducted based on a sample of 143 construction contractors, and used structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques to develop a KM performance index for reviewing the key elements that underpin KM strategy. The SD simulation predicted the development of KM strategy configurations and the evolution of KM performance over time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
