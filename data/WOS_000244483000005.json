We analyze both the computational and the security aspects of the algorithms. The algorithms inherit the excellent generalization performance of AdaBoost. Experiments indicate that the algorithms are better than AdaBoost executed separately by the participants, and that, independently of the number of participants, they perform close to AdaBoost executed using the entire data set.", "paper_title": "Privacy-preserving boosting", "paper_id": "WOS:000244483000005"}
