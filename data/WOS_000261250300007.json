In this paper we provide an overview of the functionality, architecture, and implementation of the SPELL system. We also describe four phases of usability evaluation conducted with the system and summarize the main results of these user assessments. Finally, we discuss the most significant lessons learned in the development and evaluation of the system. The paper focuses on the technological aspects of the system and its evaluation for usability and robustness, rather than its pedagogical methodology.
