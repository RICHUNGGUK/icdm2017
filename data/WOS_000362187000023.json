While traditional methods rely on building deformation models on high resolution 3D meshes, our approach works directly on low resolution RGB-D sequences; this feature allows us to apply our algorithm to videos retrieved by widespread and standard low -resolution RGB-D sensors, such as Kinect. After preprocessing both RGB and depth image sequences, sparse features are learned from spatio-temporal local cuboids. Conditional Random Fields classifier is then employed for training and classification. The proposed system is fully-automatic and achieves superior results on three low-resolution datasets built from the 4D facial expression recognition dataset - BU-4DFE. Extensive evaluations of our approach and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
