The hydraulic simulation model of the network has 126 pipes, 112 nodes, 9 storage 1 operating valve and 17 pumps in 5 discrete pumping stations. The complex energy tariff tanks, structure changes with hours of the day and days of the year. For a dynamically rolling operational horizon of 24h ahead, the real-time, near-optimal control strategy is calculated by a software package that combines a genetic algorithm (GA) optimizer with an artificial neural network (ANN) predictor, the latter having replaced a conventional hydraulic simulation model to achieve the computational efficiency required for real-time use. This paper describes the Haifa-A hydraulic network, the ANN predictor, the GA optimizer and the demand- forecasting model that were used. Thereafter, it presents and analyses the results obtained for a full (simulated) year of operation in which an energy cost saving of some 25% was achieved in comparison to the corresponding cost of current practice. Conclusions are drawn regarding the achievement of aims and future prospects.", "paper_title": "Optimizing the operation of the Haifa-A water-distribution network", "paper_id": "WOS:000243505900006"}
