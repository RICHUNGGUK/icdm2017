From the theoretical point of view, the success of splitting is primarily determined by the splitting error. In this paper, a third-order accurate operator splitting scheme is introduced. Stability condition and its local splitting error are given. Finally, consistency analysis is presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
