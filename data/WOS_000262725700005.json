We have developed a method that automates the process of reconstructing these views, and we have built a tool, REQANALYST, that supports this method. This paper presents an investigation as to which extent requirements views can be automatically generated in order to monitor requirements in industrial practice. The paper focuses on monitoring the requirements in test categories and test cases. In order to retrieve the necessary data, an information retrieval technique, called Latent Semantic Indexing, was used. The method was applied in an industrial study. A number of requirements views were defined and experiments were carried out with different reconstruction settings for generating these views. Finally, we explored how these views can help the developers during the software development process.", "paper_title": "An industrial case study in reconstructing requirements views", "paper_id": "WOS:000262725700005"}
