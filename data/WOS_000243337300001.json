An integer linear programming formulation is proposed to minimize the global network cost, which is expressed in terms of port cost, fiber cost, and propagation delay cost. We assume a single-layer multigranularity optical cross-connect (MG-OXC) node with a variable number of incoming fibers and a fixed number of wavelengths per waveband. The results show that on our case-study networks WBS with joint end-to-end and subpath wavebanding guarantees a gain of up to 22% and 85% in port number and global network costs, respectively.
