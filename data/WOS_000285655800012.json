Current scenegraphs are clearly oriented toward the management of static scenarios instead of toward scenes with multiple dynamic elements guided by complex behaviors, as in the case of virtual actors, human or not. Applications that deal with the management of multiple actors require the development of specific methods that reduce not: only the number of polygons sent to graphics hardware but also the calculations involved in the management of multiple reference systems and the behavior of actors. In this paper we propose a culling method based on the use of different types of bounding spheres, which minimizes the number of calculations related to the behavior of actors and allows better use of the capacities of present-day graphics hardware. With the same aim in mind, we also propose a method for managing levels of detail which acts not only on a geometric level but also on skeletal and behavioral levels. These ideas can be implemented on top of traditional scenegraphs, resulting in significant improvements in computational costs. This improvement is analyzed, as well as the results obtained when managing scenes with thousands of virtual actors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Lid.
