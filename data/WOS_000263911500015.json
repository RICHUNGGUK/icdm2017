Here, the authors present a variety of approaches developed to overcome this problem. They introduce several unique aspects of P2P networks and discuss free riding's effects on P2P services. They categorize proposed solutions and describe each category's important features and implementation issues together with some sample solutions. They also discuss open issues, including common attacks and security considerations.", "paper_title": "Free Riding in Peer-to-Peer Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000263911500015"}
