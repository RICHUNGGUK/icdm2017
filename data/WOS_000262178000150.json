However, gathering sufficient samples for building a DSS often has significant costs in many cases. To solve this problem. a case study of a particular business decision-making procedure in which only small data sets are available is discussed. The learning accuracy for the modelin phase ill the DSS was improved using the mega-trend-diffusion technique, Which includes two learning tools: Back-propagation network and Bayesian network. The case study, a business diversification decision for all oil company. shows that the proposed technique contributes to increasing the prediction precision using very limited experience.
