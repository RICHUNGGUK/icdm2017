Based on the Normalized Min-Sum algorithm and the turbo-decoding message-passing (TDMP) algorithm, a dual line-scan scheduling is proposed to enable hardware reusing. Furthermore, we present the solution to the address conflict issue caused by the characteristic of the parity-check matrix defined by DVB-S2 LDPC codes. Based on SMIC 0.13 mu m standard CMOS process, the LDPC decoder has an area of 12.51 mm(2). The required operating frequency to meet the throughput requirement of 135 Mbps with maximum iteration number of 30 is 105 MHz. Compared with the latest published DVB-S2 LDPC decoder, the proposed decoder reduces area cost by 34%.", "paper_title": "A Cost-Efficient LDPC Decoder for DVB-S2 with the Solution to Address Conflict Issue", "paper_id": "WOS:000281343100004"}
