With an increasing demand for natural and cultural information, the lack of spatially explicit descriptions has become a major barrier to the management and analysis of these data using geographic information systems. In this paper, we propose a method to georeference descriptive data, using an uncertainty field model to represent the distribution of a locality based on two types of uncertainties: uncertainty of reference objects, and the uncertainty of spatial relationships. We propose probability distributions for each known form of these two types of uncertainties and present a probabilistic method to georeference localities based on the integration of different uncertainty sources.", "paper_title": "Georeferencing locality descriptions and computing associated uncertainty using a probabilistic approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000258591700003"}
