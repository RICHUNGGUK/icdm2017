These techniques offer features such as: learning from experience, handling noisy and incomplete data, helping with decision making, and predicting capabilities. In this paper, we present a multi-domain knowledge representation structure called Decisional DNA that can be implemented and shared for the exploitation of embedded knowledge in multiple technologies. Decisional DNA, as a knowledge representation structure, offers great possibilities on gathering explicit knowledge of formal decision events as well as a tool for decision making processes. Its applicability is shown in this paper when applied to different decisional technologies. The main advantages of using the Decisional DNA rely on: (i) versatility and dynamicity of the knowledge structure, (ii) storage of day-to-day explicit experience in a single structure, (iii) transportability and shareability of the knowledge, and (iv) predicting capabilities based on the collected experience. Thus, after analysis and results, we conclude that the Decisional DNA, as a unique multi-domain structure, can be applied and shared among multiple technologies while enhancing them with predicting capabilities and facilitating knowledge engineering processes inside decision making systems.
