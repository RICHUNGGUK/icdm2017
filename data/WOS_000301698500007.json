Let G be a family of planar graphs such that for each graph in the family vertical bar R vertical bar vertices are red and vertical bar B vertical bar vertices are blue. The set R boolean OR B is a universal point set for G if every graph G is an element of g has a straight-line planar drawing such that the blue vertices of G are mapped to the points of B and the red vertices of G are mapped to the points of R. In this paper we describe universal point sets for meaningful classes of 2-coloured trees and show applications of these results to the coloured simultaneous geometric embeddability problem.
