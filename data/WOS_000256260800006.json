This paper proposes a straightforward geometric statement of plane-based self-calibration, through the concept of metric rectification of images. A set of constraints is derived from a decomposition of metric rectification in terms of intrinsic parameters and planar scene orientation. These constraints are then solved using an optimization framework based on the minimization of a geometrically motivated cost function. The link with previous approaches is demonstrated and our method appears to be theoretically equivalent but conceptually simpler. Moreover, a solution dealing with radial distortion is introduced. Experimentally, the method is compared with plane-based calibration and very satisfactory results are obtained. Markerless self-calibration is demonstrated using an intensity-based estimation of the inter-image homographies. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
