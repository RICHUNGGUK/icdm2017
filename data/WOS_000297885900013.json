The extraction of rotational (vortices) or curl-free (sources or sinks) features of interest from these vector fields can be obtained from their Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition (HHD). However, the applications of existing HHD techniques are limited to flat, 2D domains. Here we demonstrate the extension of the HHD to vector fields defined over arbitrary surface manifolds. We propose a Riemannian variational formalism, and illustrate the proposed methodology with synthetic and empirical examples of optical-flow vector field decompositions obtained on a variety of surface objects.
