We give an explicit formula for the Castel nuovo-Mumford regularity of V, reg(V), in terms of the reduced Grobner basis of I(V) with respect to the reverse lexicographic order. As a consequence, we show that reg (V) <= deg V - 1, where deg V is the degree of V, and characterize when equality holds. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
