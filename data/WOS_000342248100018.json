In this paper, we propose a novel method to model spatial and temporal visual attention for videos respectively through learning from human gaze data. The spatial visual attention mainly predicts where viewers look in each video frame while the temporal visual attention measures which video frame is more likely to attract viewers' interest. Our underlying premise is that objects as well as their movements, instead of conventional contrast-related information, are major factors in dynamic scenes to drive visual attention. Firstly, the proposed models extract two types of bottom-up features derived from multi-scale object filter responses and spatiotemporal motion energy, respectively. Then, spatiotemporal gaze density and inter-observer gaze congruency are generated using a large collection of human-eye gaze data to form two training sets. Finally, prediction models of temporal visual attention and spatial visual attention are learned based on those two training sets and bottom-up features, respectively. Extensive evaluations on publicly available video benchmarks and applications in interestingness prediction of movie trailers demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed work.
