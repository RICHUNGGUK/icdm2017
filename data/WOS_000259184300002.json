Our design objective is to improve system bandwidth utilization while satisfying call level QoS requirements of various call classes. We develop a new threshold-based multiservice admission control scheme (DMS-AC) as a study base for bandwidth reallocation. When the traffic load brought by some specific classes under dynamic traffic conditions in a system exceeds the control range of DMS-AC, the QoS of some call classes may not be guaranteed. In such a situation, bandwidth reallocation process is activated and the admission control scheme will try to meet the QoS requirements under the adjusted bandwidth allocation. We explore the relationship between admission thresholds and bandwidth allocation by identifying certain constraints for verifying the feasibility of the adjusted bandwidth allocation. We conduct extensive simulation experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed bandwidth reallocation scheme. Numerical results show that when traffic pattern with certain bandwidth asymmetry between uplink and downlink changes, the system can reallocate the bandwidth on uplink and downlink adaptively. With the designed bandwidth reallocation scheme in conjunction with the distributed admission control scheme, the QoS requirements of various call classes can be guaranteed under dynamic traffic conditions, and in the meantime, the system bandwidth utilization is improved significantly.", "paper_title": "Bandwidth reallocation for bandwidth asymmetry wireless networks based on distributed multiservice admission control", "paper_id": "WOS:000259184300002"}
