Emerging applications of data gathering range from the environmental to the military. Architectural challenges are posed for designers such as computational power, energy consumption, energy sources, communication channels and sensing capabilities. This work presents the current state-of-the-art for wireless sensor nodes, investigating and analyzing these challenges. We discuss the characteristics and requirements for a'sensor node. A comprehensive comparative study of sensor node platforms, energy management techniques, off-the-shelf microcontrollers, battery types and radio devices is presented.", "paper_title": "Designing wireless sensor nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000239423500012"}
