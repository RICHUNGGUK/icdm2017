The introduction of a selection subset of features is mandatory due to the problems related to the high dimensionality data and the worse performance of MLPs with this high input dimensionality. Principal component analysis is used to reduce the input data dimensionality, selecting the physically important features in order to improve MLP performance. The use of a priori physical information over other methods in the chosen feature's phase has been tested and has appeared jointly with the MLP technique as a good alternative for this problem.
