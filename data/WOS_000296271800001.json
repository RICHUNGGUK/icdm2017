This would make simulation technology more affordable and accessible to a wide range of potential industrial users. To foster the more widespread use of manufacturing simulation technology through the reduction of data interoperability issues, the Core Manufacturing Simulation Data (CMSD) specification was created. CMSD is a standardised, computer-interpretable representation that allows for the efficient exchange of manufacturing shop floor-related data in a manner that it can be used in the creation and execution of manufacturing simulations. The work has being standardised under the auspices of the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO). CMSD defines an information model that describes the characteristics of and relationships between the core manufacturing entities that define shop floor operations. This enables greater integration and data exchange possibilities for manufacturing simulations and other manufacturing applications. This article presents an overview of CMSD, its motivation, structure, and content. Descriptions of case studies using CMSD to integrate real world manufacturing applications are also presented.", "paper_title": "Core Manufacturing Simulation Data - a manufacturing simulation integration standard: overview and case studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000296271800001"}
