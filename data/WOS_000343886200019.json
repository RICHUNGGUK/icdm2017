Significant research has been carried out to develop effective intelligence functions for the active storage devices. However, laborious and time-consuming efforts are usually required to set up a suitable experimental platform to evaluate each new intelligence function. Moreover, it is difficult to make such prototypes available to other researchers and users to gain valuable experience and feedback. To overcome these difficulties, we propose IOLab, a virtual machine (VM)-based platform for evaluating intelligence functions of active storage devices. The VM-based structure of IOLab enables the evaluation of new (and existing) intelligence functions for different types of OSes and active storage devices with little additional effort. IOLab also supports real-time execution of intelligence functions, providing users opportunities to experience latest intelligence functions without waiting for their deployment in commercial products. Using a set of interesting case studies, we demonstrate the utility of IOLab with negligible performance overhead except for the VM's virtualization overhead.", "paper_title": "Rapid Prototyping and Evaluation of Intelligence Functions of Active Storage Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000343886200019"}
