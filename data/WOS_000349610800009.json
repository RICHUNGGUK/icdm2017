Several researchers, all over the world, have so far attempted to solve the problems of recognition of power system transients, hybridizing transform-based techniques with popular computational intelligence based tools, for example, using wavelet transform and S-transform for feature extraction, followed by artificial neural networks (ANN) or fuzzy logic-based classifiers. The proposed method of hybridizing DTCWT-based feature extraction with ANN-based classification could efficiently detect several commonly occurring power quality (PQ) disturbance events. The PQ disturbance events considered include four different transient conditions, namely transients due to capacitor switching, transformer inrush currents, transients due to motor switching and transients due to short circuit faults. A detailed performance comparison with several contemporary, competing methods existing in the literatures for similar problems aptly demonstrates the suitability of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A dual-tree complex wavelet transform-based approach for recognition of power system transients", "paper_id": "WOS:000349610800009"}
