However, traditional localization techniques are dependent on hardware that is sometimes unavailable (e.g. GPS), or on sophisticated virtual localization calculus which have a costly overhead. Instead of actually localizing nodes in the physical two-dimensional Euclidean space, we use directly the raw distance to a set of anchors to produce multi-dimensional coordinates. We prove that the image of the physical two-dimensional Euclidean space is a two-dimensional surface, and we show how to adapt geographic routing strategies on this surface in a simple and efficient manner.
