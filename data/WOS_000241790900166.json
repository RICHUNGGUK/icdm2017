The problem of finding an optimal set of model parameters is numerical optimization problem constrained by stochastic character of HMM parameters. Constraint handling is carried out using three different ways and the results are compared to Baum-Welch algorithm (BW), commonly used for HMM training. The global searching PSO method is much less sensitive to local extremes and finds better solutions than the local BW algorithm, which often converges to local optima. The advantage of PSO approach was markedly evident, when longer training sequence was used.", "paper_title": "Constraints in particle swarm optimization of hidden Markov models", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900166"}
