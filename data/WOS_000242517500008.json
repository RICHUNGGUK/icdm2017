Measurements of continuous variables are always fuzzy to a certain degree. Therefore histograms and generalized classical statistical inference methods for univariate fuzzy data have to be considered. Moreover Bayesian inference methods in the situation of fuzzy a priori information and fuzzy data are discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
