A weakness of the latter is that it is not suitable for handling noisy images. We propose a Bayesian model to overcome these problems. We demonstrate that this Bayesian model indeed generalizes the original Mumford-Shah model, and we prove it has the same desirable properties as shown by Morel and Solimini.", "paper_title": "Mathematical analysis of an extended mumford-shah model for image segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000237209900004"}
