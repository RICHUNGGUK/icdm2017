These ideas were first introduced by Cooper, then Chen, Reed, Helleseth and Truong, and eventually by Orsini and Sala. We discuss here another way of putting the decoding problem into equations: the Newton identities. Although these identities have been extensively used for decoding, the work was done manually, to provide formulas for the coefficients of the locator polynomial. This was achieved by Reed, Chen, Truong and others in a long series of papers, for decoding quadratic residue codes, on a case-by-case basis. It is tempting to automate these computations, using elimination theory and Grobner bases. Thus, we study in this paper the properties of the system defined by the Newton identities, for decoding binary cyclic codes. This is done in two steps, first we prove some facts about the variety associated with this system, then we prove that the ideal itself contains relevant equations for decoding, which lead to formulas. Then we consider the so-called online Grobner basis decoding, where the work of computing a Grobner basis is done for each received word. It is much more efficient for practical purposes than preprocessing and substituting into the formulas. Finally, we conclude with some computational results, for codes of interesting length (about one hundred). (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
