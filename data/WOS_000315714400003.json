It is the key issue of developing line-cell conversion successfully. In this article, a multi-objective optimisation model is proposed to investigate two line-cell conversion performances: the total throughput time and the total labour hours. It is proved that the model is a non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-hard problem and its Pareto-optimal front is non-convex. Owing to the properties of cell formation and cell loading in line-cell conversions, an approach of combining local search into non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is proposed to obtain better non-dominated solutions. Several numerical simulation experiments are performed to show the utility and performance of our approach.", "paper_title": "Combining local search into non-dominated sorting for multi-objective line-cell conversion problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000315714400003"}
