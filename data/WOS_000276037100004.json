WiMAX, which is based on IEEE 802.16 and a network reference architecture defined by the WiMAX Forum, emerges as a potent proposal for building next-generation broadband wireless networks. This chapter is a comprehensive review of wireless MANs using WiMAX technologies, focusing in particular on multimedia service delivery over such networks. We start by summarizing recent trends in Internet traffic, which demonstrate the proliferation of multimedia services alongside the strong need for cost-efficient broadband access solutions, such as WiMAX. We then provide an overview of both fixed and mobile WiMAX, which includes a short introduction to the physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers of the IEEE 802.16 standard. We focus on the key architectural elements, including Quality of Service (QoS) support, and relate them with multimedia service delivery. To better illustrate the opportunities emerging in the broadband wireless access telecommunications segment, we also describe a set of reference WiMAX deployment scenarios. We then switch gears and present the advances in voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology presenting ITU-T standard codecs such as G.711, G.723.1, and G.729.1, open-source codecs such as Speex, as well as codecs employed in popular VoIP applications. Finally, this chapter presents a thorough empirical evaluation of multimedia service delivery over WiMAX. We measure multimedia service delivery performance over standards-conforming WiMAX testbeds in Finland and Portugal, and evaluate the benefits of voice sample aggregation and robust header compression (ROHC) in practice.", "paper_title": "Multimedia Services over Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000276037100004"}
