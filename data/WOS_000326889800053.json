Based on the dynamic model, a neural network-based controller is proposed that achieves the required tracking effectively. A feedforward neural network is employed to learn the existing unknown dynamics of robot system. The uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov approach. It is shown that the neural network can cope with the unknown nonlinearities through the adaptive learning process and requires no preliminary off learning. Finally, simulation study has been performed to evaluate the controller performance.", "paper_title": "Adaptive neural controller for space robot system with an attitude controlled base", "paper_id": "WOS:000326889800053"}
