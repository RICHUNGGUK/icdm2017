The proposed model is tested using data collected from 617 manufacturing firms. Supply chain coordination with both suppliers and customers is found to enhance supply chain performance, and the effect of coordination with customers is higher. There is an interactive relationship between the supply chain coordination on the supplier and customer sides, indicating that synergizing supply chain coordination with suppliers and with customers improves supply chain performance. Furthermore, information technology and relationship commitment influence supply chain coordination. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
