Firstly, a generic utility framework is proposed for the resource allocation problems, which combines subcarrier allocation, relay selection and power allocation. Then, mathematical decomposition techniques are utilized to find a practical method to decouple and resolve the problems due to their non-linear property. According to the decomposition procedure, a cross-layer optimization algorithm is proposed to achieve the optimal solution of these resource allocation problems, which has low computation complexity compared to the exhausting searching method. Furthermore, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Generic Utility Based Resource Allocation Optimization for Broadband Wireless Networks with Relays", "paper_id": "WOS:000340983100003"}
