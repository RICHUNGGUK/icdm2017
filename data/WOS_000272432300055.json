This problem is known to be NP-hard type in literature Several algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem We present a multi-objective ant colony system algorithm (MOACSA). which combines ant colony optimization approach and a local search strategy in order to solve this scheduling problem. The proposed algorithm is tested with well-known problems in literature Its solution performance was compared with the existing multi-objective heuristics. The Computational results show that proposed algorithm is more efficient and better than other methods compared (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
