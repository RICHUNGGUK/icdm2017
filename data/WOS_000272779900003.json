The membership of an element of a R-fuzzy set is represented as a rough set. This new extension facilitates the representation of an uncertain fuzzy membership with a rough approximation. Based on our definition of R-fuzzy sets and their operations, the relationships between R-fuzzy sets and other fuzzy sets are discussed and some examples are provided. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
