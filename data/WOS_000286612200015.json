A direct and time complexity preserving simulation is presented in [1]. All three types of processors (substitution, insertion, deletion) are essentially used in this simulation. In this note we prove that such a direct simulation between networks containing substitution nodes only still exists.", "paper_title": "FILTER POSITION IN NETWORKS OF SUBSTITUTION PROCESSORS DOES NOT MATTER", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612200015"}
