Since the most significant coefficients of the ridgelet transform (RT) can represent the most energetic direction of an image with straight edge, the image is first partitioned into small blocks and RT is applied for each block. Followed by the multiplicative rule, the watermark sequence is casting into local linear singularity coefficients within the highest energy direction of each block. Through analyzing the distribution of the texture in ridgelet coefficients of each block, the feature of luminance masking and texture masking is incorporated to adjust the watermark's embedding strength. Then the embedded watermark can be blindly detected by correlation detector. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a better tradeoff between the robustness and transparency.", "paper_title": "Embedding image watermarks into local linear singularity coefficients in ridgelet domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900014"}
