For this study, we exploit graph embedding for quantum circuit analysis. We study a logical mapping of qubits and gates of any Omega(log n)-depth quantum adder circuit for two n-qubit registers onto a practical architecture, which limits interaction distance to the nearest neighbors only and supports only one-and two-qubit logical gates. Unfortunately, on the chosen k-dimensional practical architecture, we prove that the depth lower bound of any exact quantumaddition circuits is no longer Omega(log n), but Omega((k)root n). This result, the first application of graph embedding to quantumcircuits and devices, provides a new tool for compiler development, emphasizes the impact of quantum computer architecture on performance, and acts as a cautionary note when evaluating the time performance of quantum algorithms.", "paper_title": "On the Effect of Quantum Interaction Distance on Quantum Addition Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000295977400002"}
