This paper will therefore explore such a design, and through which a heuristic extended Expectation-Maximization (X-EM) algorithm is presented accordingly. Unlike the EM algorithm [1], the X-EM algorithm is able to perform model selection by fading the redundant components out from a density mixture, meanwhile estimating the model parameters appropriately. The numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm.", "paper_title": "On weight design of maximum weighted likelihood and an extended EM algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000239814600010"}
