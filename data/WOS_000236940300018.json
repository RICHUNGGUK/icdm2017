We here model and verify a variant of the ZG protocol that includes a deadline (timestamp) for completion of the protocol, after which an agent can no longer initiate the recovery protocol with the TTP to get hold of the non-repudiation evidence. The verification itself is performed by the FDR model-checker.", "paper_title": "Towards verification of timed non-repudiation protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000236940300018"}
