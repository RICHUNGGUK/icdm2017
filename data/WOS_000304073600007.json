These techniques may be used for the estimation of rounded zeros or values below the detection limit in cases when the underlying data are compositional in nature. An algorithm based on iterative log-ratio regressions is developed by combining a particular family of isometric log-ratio transformations with censored regression. In the context of classical regression methods, the equivalence of the method based on additive and isometric log-ratio transformations is proved. This equivalence does not hold for robust regression. Based on Monte Carlo methods, simulations are performed to assess the performance of classical and robust methods. To illustrate the method, a case study involving geochemical data is conducted. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
