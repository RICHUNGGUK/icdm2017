If G has a cyclic edge-cut, then it is called cyclically separable. We call a cyclically separable graph super cyclically edge-connected, in short, super-lambda (c) , if the removal of any minimum cyclic edge-cut results in a component which is a shortest cycle. In Z. Zhang, B. Wang (Super cyclically edge-connected transitive graphs, J. Combin. Optim. 22:549-562, 2011), it is proved that a connected edge-transitive graph is super-lambda (c) if either G is cubic with girth at least 7 or G has minimum degree at least 4 and girth at least 6, and the authors also conjectured that a connected graph which is both vertex-transitive and edge-transitive is always super cyclically edge-connected. In this article, for a lambda (c) -optimal but not super-lambda (c) graph G, all possible lambda (c) -superatoms of G which have non-empty intersection with other lambda (c) -superatoms are determined. This is then used to give a complete classification of non-super-lambda (c) edge-transitive k(ka parts per thousand yen3)-regular graphs.", "paper_title": "Super-cyclically edge-connected regular graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000321062500012"}
