Focusing first on the structure of documents, we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best generative probabilistic model, in the absence of constraints. We further study the problem in the presence of integrity constraints, namely key, inclusion, and domain constraints. We study in this case two different kinds of generators. First, we consider a continuation-test generator that performs, while generating documents, tests of schema satisfiability; these tests prevent from generating a document violating the constraints but, as we will see, they are computationally expensive. We also study a restart generator that may generate an invalid document and, when this is the case, restarts and tries again. Finally, we consider the injection of data values into the structure, to obtain a full XML document. We study different approaches for generating these values.", "paper_title": "Optimal Probabilistic Generation of XML Documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000365792200002"}
