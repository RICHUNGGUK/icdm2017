Traditional network topology research methods by adapting tools of Ping or Traceroute were used to carry out the active end-to-end detection from the origin router nodes to destination router nodes. But sometimes, because some routers set the UDP/SNMP limitation, there are some router IP address could not be detected. In addition, AS operator can adopt router syslog configuration files to obtain link connection condition, but, these files have the update life-time, it is hard to obtain the information in real-time. So, we only obtained some incomplete topology information. Due to the IP network has some local information similarity, this article adopted the complex link prediction algorithm based on local information similarity algorithm and design a kind of improved method based on the IP network characters to realize the unknown links prediction. Through the experiment, the results expressed that, the prediction index of local information common neighbor algorithm index of AA, RA obtain the most good accuracy, and the improved Bayesian CN index combining the degree value index of AA can get more higher prediction accuracy about 0.97. This article confirmed the link prediction method based on local information similarity algorithm can be effectively applied in the IP network unknown link prediction.", "paper_title": "IP Network Topology Link Prediction Based on Improved Local Information Similarity Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000370262800014"}
