In such frameworks, the objects can migrate to remote hosts, along with their state and behavior, while the application is running. An innovative graph-based visualization is used to depict the physical and the logical connections in the distributed object network. Scalability is achieved by using a focus + context technique jointly with a user-steered clustering algorithm. In addition, an event synchronization model for mobile objects is presented. The system has been applied to visualizing several mobile object applications. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
