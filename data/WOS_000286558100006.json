This study integrates relational capital into the information systems continuance model in order to explain consumer participation in on-line communities. It also investigates the moderating effect on the participation process of two personal attributes on-line interaction propensity and ability to contribute to the community. Last, it analyzes the effect of on-line communities on consumer behavioral intentions to use the on-line community's products and to follow the community's advice. Data from 456 members of on-line travel communities reveal that integrating relational capital into the information systems continuance model effectively predicts consumer participation in these communities. The data also confirm the moderating effect of selected personal attributes for determining consumer participation. Finally, participation in on-line travel communities has a positive effect on consumer intention to use on-line community products, and trust in the community has a positive effect on intention to follow advice obtained from the community.", "paper_title": "Antecedents and Consequences of Consumer Participation in On-Line Communities: The Case of the Travel Sector", "paper_id": "WOS:000286558100006"}
