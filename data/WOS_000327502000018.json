Then, a three dimension (3D) continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) is constructed to derive the grade of service (GoS) performance metrics in the OSA-based CCNs. Through the 3D CTMC, both the non-hopping and hopping modes are investigated, respectively. Specifically, for a given primary user (PU) traffic, the range of achievable user equipment (UE) traffic is derived with guarantying the GoS of the UE. Moreover, we study the effective spectrum utilization and influence of imperfect spectrum sensing to the GoS performance, respectively. Furthermore, to verify the validity of the theoretical analysis, simulations are conducted. Finally, some open issues are discussed in this article.", "paper_title": "GRADE OF SERVICE OF OPPORTUNISTIC SPECTRUM ACCESS BASED COGNITIVE CELLULAR NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000327502000018"}
