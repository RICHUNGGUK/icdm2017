Important application examples are the fields of metabolomics and proteomics. Parametric time warping (PTW) has already shown to be very useful in these fields because of the highly restricted form of the warping functions, avoiding overfitting. Here, we describe a new formulation of PTW, working on peak-picked features rather than on complete profiles. Not only does this allow for a much more smooth integration in existing pipelines, it also speeds up the (already among the fastest) algorithm by orders of magnitude. Using two publicly available datasets we show the potential of the new approach. The first set is a LC-DAD dataset of grape samples, and the second an LC-MS dataset of apple extracts.", "paper_title": "Fast parametric time warping of peak lists", "paper_id": "WOS:000361757500022"}
