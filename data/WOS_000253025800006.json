Thus, the images can not be judged whether they are real or not visually. In order to detect fake images, this paper proposes a detection scheme, which, firstly, uses watermarks to locate the alteration, and then, uses support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier to make a binary decision on whether an image is fake or real. The experimental results also demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
