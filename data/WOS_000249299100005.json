C is said to be a w-identifiable parent property code (w-IPP code for short) if whenever d is a descendant of w (or fewer) codewords, one can always identify at least one of the parent codewords in C. In this paper, we give constructions for w-IPP codes of length w + 1. Furthermore, we show that F-w(w + 1, q), the maximum cardinality of a w-IPP q-ary code of length w + 1, satisfies |Gh(q)| = F-w(w + 1, q) = |Gh((q))| + 6, where Gh((q)) is a well-defined code graph. Finally, we give an efficient (O(q(w+1))) algorithm to find the values of F-w(w + 1,q).", "paper_title": "On optimal codes with w-identifiable parent property", "paper_id": "WOS:000249299100005"}
