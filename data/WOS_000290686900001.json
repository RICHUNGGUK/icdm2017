This experiment uses potassium iodide (KI) 31 wt% as refractive index matching material which makes the water phase invisible. As a result, the generated micro droplets, which are shown in the preceding paper (Uemura et al. in Europhys Lett 92:34004, 2010), cannot be visible in the present results, and therefore the droplets are positively confirmed to be made of water.", "paper_title": "Visualization of ripples on the surface of a rising bubble through an immiscible oil/water interface", "paper_id": "WOS:000290686900001"}
