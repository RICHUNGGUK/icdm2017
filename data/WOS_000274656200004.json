School laboratories form an extensive network equipped with computational systems and fast Internet connections. As this infrastructure is utilized at most 8 h per day and 5 days per week, it could be made available during its remaining idle time for computational purposes through the use of Grid technology. The structure and organization of the school laboratories and backbone network enables the CPU scavenging service, as an independent and additional service, which will not violate the operational rules and policies of the school network, while it will add additional resources to the current HellasGrid infrastructure with low adaptation cost.", "paper_title": "A Grid-enabled CPU Scavenging Architecture and a Case Study of its Use in the Greek School Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000274656200004"}
