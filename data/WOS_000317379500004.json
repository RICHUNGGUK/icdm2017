This semantics enables us to express that an agent sees to it that a condition obtains under a minimal chance of success. We first define the fragment of XSTIT where choice exertion is not collective. Then we add lower bounds for the probability of effects to the stit syntax, and define the semantics of the newly formed stit operator in terms of subjective probabilities concerning choice exertion of other agents. We show how the resulting probabilistic stit logic faithfully generalizes the non-probabilistic XSTIT fragment. In a second step we analyze the defined probabilistic stit logic by decomposing it into an XSTIT fragment and a purely epistemic fragment. The resulting epistemic logic for grades of believes is a weak modal logic with a neighborhood semantics combining probabilistic and modal logic theory. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
