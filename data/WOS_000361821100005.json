Nevertheless researchers in the field of computer games aim to find such solutions, which may range from tractable to intractable. From the perspective of computational complexity, this article illustrates that n x n Chinese chess is intractable. The article starts to introduce the notion of an EXPTIME-complete problem of computational complexity and give as an example the G(3) game. Then an n x n Chinese chess position (one rook and two queens) is constructed, which consists of three essential components, viz. Boolean controller, switch, and the crossing of clause-channel. The G(3) game is simulated on the position, and it is proved that G(3) is reducible to the n x n Chinese chess position in polynomial time. From this result it is implied that n x n Chinese chess is EXPTIME-complete.", "paper_title": "Research on the Computational Complexity of n x n Chinese Chess", "paper_id": "WOS:000361821100005"}
