This improves on a quadratic upper bound proved by Pach and Tth. The question is motivated by a sensor network problem, in which a region has to be monitored by sensors with limited battery life.", "paper_title": "Decomposition of Multiple Coverings into More Parts", "paper_id": "WOS:000280905600015"}
