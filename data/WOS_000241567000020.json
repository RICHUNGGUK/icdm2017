Two components are at the core of the approach. First, is an algorithm for optimal timing-driven fanin tree embedding; the algorithm is very general in that it can easily incorporate complex objective functions (e.g., placement costs) and can perform embedding on any graph-based target. Second, the replication tree is introduced, which allows to induce large fanin trees from a given circuit, which can then be optimized by the embedder. The authors have built an optimization engine around these two ideas and report promising results for the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) domain including clock period reductions of up to 36% compared with a timing-driven placement from versatile place and route (VPR) (Marquardt et al., 2000) and almost double the average improvement of local replication (Beraudo and Lillis, 2003). These results are achieved with modest area and runtime overhead. In addition, issues that arise due to reconvergence in the circuit specification are addressed. The authors build on the replication tree idea and enhance the timing-driven fanin tree embedding algorithm to optimize subcritical paths, yielding even better delay improvements.", "paper_title": "An approach to placement-coupled logic replication", "paper_id": "WOS:000241567000020"}
