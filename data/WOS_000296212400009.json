The parameter uncertainties are assumed to be norm-bounded, and the time delays are assumed to be time-varying. Based on the Lyapunov functional method, sufficient conditions ensuring the networks to be finite-time robustly stochastically stable are established. When there are no norm-bounded parameter uncertainties in the networks, a finite-time stochastic stability condition is also established. All the conditions are diffusion-dependent as well as delay-dependent. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
