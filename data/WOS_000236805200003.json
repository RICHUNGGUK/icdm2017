Every deterministic machine with a one-turn pushdown store can be simulated deterministically by one queue in O(n root n) time. Every Turing machine with several multidimensional tapes accepting with time bound t( n) can be simulated by two queues in O(t(n)log(2) t(n)) time. Every deterministic Turing machine with several linear tapes accepting with time bound t( n) can be simulated deterministically in time O(t(n) log t(n)) by a queue and a pushdown store. The first two results appear to be the first subquadratic simulations of other storage devices by one queue.", "paper_title": "Efficient simulations by queue machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000236805200003"}
