We propose an algorithm, called Proportional Slack Reserve (PSR), that produces an efficient schedule for such an environment. For every execution unit of a periodic job, the PSR algorithm reserves time which can be used for execution of aperiodic jobs. If reserved time is not available, the algorithm assigns a deadline to an aperiodic job for achieving better responsiveness of aperiodic jobs. The proposed algorithm can fully utilize processing power while meeting all deadlines of periodic jobs. It can also easily reclaim the time unused by the periodic job. We analytically show that for each aperiodic job, the response time in a PSR schedule is no longer than that in a TBS schedule, which is known to be efficient for servicing aperiodic jobs. We also present simulation results in which the response time of PSR is significantly improved over that of TBS, and moreover the performance of PSR compares favorably with TB(N) considering scheduling overhead.
