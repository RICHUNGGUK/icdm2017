We present a uniform method based on routes to find such monoids. Many classical operations from the theory of formal languages, such as catenation, bi-catenation, simple splicing, shuffle, literal shuffle, and insertion are shown to be just particular instances of the operation x(T).", "paper_title": "Routes and products of monoids", "paper_id": "WOS:000240746400019"}
