The nodes of a data tree have a label from a finite set and a data value from a possibly infinite set. It is shown that satisfiability for two-variable first-order logic is decidable if the tree structure can be accessed only through the child and the next sibling predicates and the access to data values is restricted to equality tests. From this main result, decidability of satisfiability and containment for a data-aware fragment of XPath and of the implication problem for unary key and inclusion constraints is concluded.", "paper_title": "Two-Variable Logic on Data Trees and XML Reasoning", "paper_id": "WOS:000266650300003"}
