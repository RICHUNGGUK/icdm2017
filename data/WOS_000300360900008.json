We implemented two parallel architectures based on the Xilinx Core Generator. The architectures use two or four smaller FFTs in parallel. Results show that time requirements are fulfill when combining Pipelined, Streaming input/output (I/O) architectures with Radix-2 and Radix-4 operations. For Virtex-4, we need four levels of parallelization, but for Virtex-5 only two. Both circuits were synthesized, placed and routed. We tested the circuits on the FPGA, defining test vectors and analyzing outputs signals with Chipscope.", "paper_title": "FPGA implementation and testing of a 128 FFT for a MB-OFDM receiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000300360900008"}
