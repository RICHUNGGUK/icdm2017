This turns out to be a generalization of the online bipartite matching problem. We introduce the notion of a trade-off revealing LP and use it to derive an optimal algorithm achieving a competitive ratio of 1 - 1/e for this problem.", "paper_title": "AdWords and generalized Online matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000250557900001"}
