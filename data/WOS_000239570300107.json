However, the energy constrained and limited computing resources of the sensor nodes present major challenges in gathering data. Since sensor nodes are densely deployed, redundant data may occur. While cluster-based data gathering is efficient at energy and bandwidth, it's difficult to cluster network efficiently. In this work, a new distributed clustering algorithm for ubiquitous sensor network is presented. Clustering is based on the distance between nodes and the number in a cluster for wireless sensor networks. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm balances the energy dissipation over the whole network thus increase the amount of data delivery to the sink.", "paper_title": "Energy-efficient clustering algorithm in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300107"}
