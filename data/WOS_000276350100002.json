Most conventional studies are focused on binary or discrete-valued transaction data, however the data in real-world applications usually consists of quantitative values. In the last years, many researches have proposed Genetic Algorithms for mining interesting association rules from quantitative data. In this paper, we present a study of three genetic association rules extraction methods to show their effectiveness for mining quantitative association rules. Experimental results over two real-world databases are showed.", "paper_title": "Analysis of the Effectiveness of the Genetic Algorithms based on Extraction of Association Rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000276350100002"}
