A challenge is to index a triple database efficiently. Most existing triple indexing techniques suffer from data duplication and the oversized index tree problem. We analyzed the drawbacks of existing triple indexing methods from the viewpoint of the consistency and effectiveness of a triple database. We also considered the issues that need to be addressed to build a triple index for the management of relational database (RDB)-based triple data. Tridex is a lightweight B+-tree index structure designed to facilitate efficient processing of RDB-based triple databases. Tridex is beneficial in reduced index tree size and less data redundancy. We conducted an experimental evaluation to demonstrate the superiority of Tridex compared to existing triple index structures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
