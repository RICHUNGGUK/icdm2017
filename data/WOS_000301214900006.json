In many practical situations, such a problem arises naturally when a set of dummy variables is used to represent a categorical factor and/or when a set of basis functions of a continuous variable is included in the predictor set. Complementary to these earlier works, the simultaneous and automatic factor selection is examined in quantile regression. To incorporate the factor information into regularized model fitting, the adaptive sup-norm regularized quantile regression is proposed, which penalizes the empirical check loss function by the sum of factor-wise adaptive sup-norm penalties. It is shown that the proposed method possesses the oracle property. A simulation study demonstrates that the proposed method is a more appropriate tool for factor selection than the adaptive lasso regularized quantile regression. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
