The exploitation of narrative data using natural language processing may help, although nesting, varying granularity, and repetition remain challenges. In a study of community-acquired pneumonia using electronic records, these issues led to poor classification. Limiting queries to accurate, complete records led to vastly reduced, possibly biased samples. We exploited knowledge latent in the electronic records to improve classification. A similarity metric was used to cluster cases. We defined discordance as the degree to which cases within a cluster give different answers for some query that addresses a classification task of interest. Cases with higher discordance are more likely to be incorrectly classified, and can be reviewed manually to adjust the classification, improve the query, or estimate the likely accuracy of the query. In a study of pneumonia-in which the ICD9-CM coding was found to be very poor-the discordance measure was statistically significantly correlated with classification correctness (.45; 95% CI .15-.62).
