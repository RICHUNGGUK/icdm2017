The main objects of study in this paper are self-dual cyclic codes over finite fields, i.e., the intersection of these two classes. We show that self-dual cyclic codes of length n over F(q) exist if and only if is even and q = 2(m) with m a positive integer. The enumeration of such codes is also investigated. When and q are even, there is always a trivial self-dual cyclic code with generator polynomial x n/2 +1. We, therefore, classify the existence of self-dual cyclic codes, for given n and q, into two cases: when only the trivial one exists and when two or more such codes exist. Given n and m, an easy criterion to determine which of these two cases occurs is given in terms of the prime factors of, for most. We also show that, over a fixed field, the latter case occurs more frequently as the length grows.", "paper_title": "On Self-Dual Cyclic Codes Over Finite Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000288459100026"}
