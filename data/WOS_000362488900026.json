The problem is generally boiled down to recovering correspondences of local invariant features, and the conventionally addressed by graph-based quadratic optimization approaches, which often suffer from high computational cost. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach by viewing the problem from a novel perspective. In particular, we consider each CVP as a common object in two images with a group of coherently deformed local regions. A geometric space with matrix Lie group structure is constructed by stacking up transformations estimated from initially appearance-matched local interest region pairs. This is followed by a mean shift clustering stage to group together those close transformations in the space. Joining regions associated with transformations of the same group together within each input image forms two large regions sharing similar geometric configuration, which naturally leads to a CVP. To account for the non-Euclidean nature of the matrix Lie group, mean shift vectors are derived in the corresponding Lie algebra vector space with a newly provided effective distance measure. Extensive experiments on single and multiple common object discovery tasks as well as near-duplicate image retrieval verify the robustness and efficiency of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Common Visual Pattern Discovery via Nonlinear Mean Shift Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000362488900026"}
