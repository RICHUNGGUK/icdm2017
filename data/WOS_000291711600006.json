The constraint-handling mechanism is based on the feasibility rules, with no additional penalty parameters and no requirement to be in the feasible region at all times. The average velocity of the swarm is proposed as a disturbance to expand the search range for each particle, designed to overcome the premature convergence. The values of different kinds of variables are firstly proposed to be achieved according to their respective flying velocities. The performance of MPSO is evaluated against real-world mixed-variable optimization problems, and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is simple, generic, easy-to-implement and be highly competitive compared with existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "A MODIFIED PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION WITH FEASIBILITY-BASED RULES FOR MIXED-VARIABLE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291711600006"}
