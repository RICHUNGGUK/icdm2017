We also show that surfaces with bounded doubling dimension can be embedded into low dimension with small additive error. Finally, we show that for points with polynomial motion, the radius of the smallest enclosing ball can be preserved under dimensionality reduction.", "paper_title": "EMBEDDINGS OF SURFACES, CURVES, AND MOVING POINTS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE", "paper_id": "WOS:000318353800002"}
