PSU achieves a high energy efficiency by employing a changeable pipeline depth and its working scheme is eligible for a fine control method. In this paper, we propose a dynamic method to study fine-grained program interval behaviors based on some easy-to-get runtime processor metrics. Using this method to determine the proper PSU configurations during the program execution, we are able to achieve an averaged 13.5% energy-delay-product (EDP) reduction for SPEC CPU2000 integer benchmarks, compared to the baseline processor. This value is only 0.14% larger than the theoretically idealized controlling. Our hardware synthesis result indicates that the proposed method can largely decrease the hardware overhead in both area and delay costs, as compared to a previous program study method which is based on working set signatures.", "paper_title": "A Fine-Grained Runtime Power/Performance Optimization Method for Processors with Adaptive Pipeline Depth", "paper_id": "WOS:000288024900010"}
