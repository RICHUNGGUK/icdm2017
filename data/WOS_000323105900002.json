For simple polygons (i.e., ), the geodesic diameter is determined by a pair of corners of a given polygon and can be computed in linear time, as shown by Hershberger and Suri. For general polygonal domains with , however, no algorithm for computing the geodesic diameter was known prior to this paper. In this paper, we present the first algorithms that compute the geodesic diameter of a given polygonal domain in worst-case time or . The main difficulty unlike the simple polygon case relies on the following observation revealed in this paper: two interior points can determine the geodesic diameter and in that case there exist at least five distinct shortest paths between the two.", "paper_title": "The Geodesic Diameter of Polygonal Domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000323105900002"}
