The learned metrics have the potential to perform better than the conventional Euclidean metric for classification. Moreover, in the case of heterogenous sensors, the learned multiple metrics can be quite different, which are adapted to each type of sensor. By learning the multiple metrics jointly within a single unified optimization framework, we can learn better metrics to fuse the multi-sensor data for a joint classification. Furthermore, we also exploit multi-metric learning in a kernel induced feature space to capture the non-linearity in the original feature space via kernel mapping. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
