As a result the potential of lime treatment or of a structured soil has not been fully exploited. This paper presents a new formulation to account for the effect of structure on the mechanical behaviour for structured soils. A constitutive model is proposed in the framework of the Modified Cam Clay model to describe the behaviour of lime treated soils. The new formulation introduces a limited number of additional parameters, all of which have a physical meaning and can be obtained from an isotropic compression test. Due to similarity in behaviour of lime treated soils and naturally structured soils, the formulation can be applied to both types of soil. It is shown that the proposed model can successfully reproduce the main features of both structured soils such as maximum rate of dilation at softening and degradation at yield. The model can be applied for any structured material regardless of the origin of cementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
