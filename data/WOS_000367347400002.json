The BilbyFs specification supports asynchronous writes, a feature that has been overlooked by several file system verification projects, and has been used to verify the correctness of BilbyFs's fsync () C implementation. It makes use of nondeterminism to be concise and is shallowly-embedded in higher-order logic.", "paper_title": "Specifying a Realistic File System", "paper_id": "WOS:000367347400002"}
