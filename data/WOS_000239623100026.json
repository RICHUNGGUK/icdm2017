Since rover wheels traction has a significant role in rover mobility, optimization is based on the minimization of traction at rover wheel-ground interfaces. The method of optimization chosen is Genetic Algorithm (GA) which is a directed random search technique along with the usual optimization based on directional derivatives. GA is a suitable and efficient method of optimization for nonlinear problems. The procedure is applied on a specific rough terrain rover called CEDRA-I Shrimp Rover. The present work resulted in design and manufacturing of the optimized rover called CEDRA-II Shrimp Rover.", "paper_title": "Design, dynamic analysis and optimization of a rover for rescue operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623100026"}
