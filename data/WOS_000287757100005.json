Thus far, WSNs have been constructed for specific applications. However, in the future, system operators may want an existing WSN to deploy simultaneous applications. Existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of applying mobile agents to enable simultaneous applications in WSNs. However, two problems make the present form of mobile agents impractical for applications involving cooperation and group migration by mobile agents. The first problem is the lack of a suitable architecture enabling cooperation and interaction between agents, and the second is the lack of an efficient way of achieving group migration by agents in WSNs. To address these problems, we propose an architecture organized by mobile agents that has specific functionalities and that enables group migration by multiple agents.", "paper_title": "Group Migration by Mobile Agents in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000287757100005"}
