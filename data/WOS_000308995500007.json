It is possible to apply it to the development of advanced classification methods, which integrate several machine learning techniques into a single proposal. A novel approach integrating instance selection, instance weighting, and feature weighting into the framework of a coevolutionary model is presented in this paper. We compare it with a wide range of evolutionary and nonevolutionary related methods, in order to show the benefits of the employment of coevolution to apply the techniques considered simultaneously. The results obtained, contrasted through nonparametric statistical tests, show that our proposal outperforms other methods in the comparison, thus becoming a suitable tool in the task of enhancing the nearest neighbor classifier.", "paper_title": "Integrating Instance Selection, Instance Weighting, and Feature Weighting for Nearest Neighbor Classifiers by Coevolutionary Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000308995500007"}
