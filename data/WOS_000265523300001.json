Results: An efficient and highly effective algorithm that largely removes the wave bias from tumor profiles by regressing the tumor profile data on data of profiles from the clinical genetics practice. Results are illustrated on two independent datasets. The algorithm is shown to be robust against the presence of true copy number aberrations. Moreover, the smoothed profiles are able to recapitulate the aberration location and signal for simulated tumor profiles.", "paper_title": "Smoothing waves in array CGH tumor profiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000265523300001"}
