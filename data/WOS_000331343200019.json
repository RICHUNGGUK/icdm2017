This behaviour is the well-known Gibbs phenomenon. Recently, the inverse polynomial reconstruction method (IPRM) has been successfully implemented to reconstruct piecewise smooth functions by reducing the effects of the Gibbs phenomenon for Fourier series. This paper addresses the 2-D fractional Fourier series (FrFS) using the same approach used with the 1-D fractional Fourier series and finds that the Gibbs phenomenon will be observed in 1-D and 2-D fractional Fourier series expansions for functions at a jump discontinuity. The existing IPRM for resolution of the Gibbs phenomenon for 1-D and 2-D FrFS appears to be the same as that used for Fourier series. The proof of convergence provides theoretical basis for both 1-D and 2-D IPRM to remove Gibbs phenomenon. Several numerical examples are investigated. The results indicate that the IPRM method completely eliminates the Gibbs phenomenon and gives exact reconstruction results.", "paper_title": "Resolution of the Gibbs Phenomenon for Fractional Fourier Series", "paper_id": "WOS:000331343200019"}
