Extracting higher level information from the raw sensory data captured by the devices and representing this data as machine-interpretable or human-understandable information has several interesting applications. Deriving raw data into higher level information representations demands mechanisms to find, extract, and characterize meaningful abstractions from the raw data. This meaningful abstractions then have to be presented in a human and/or machine-understandable representation. However, the heterogeneity of the data originated from different sensor devices and application scenarios such as e-health, environmental monitoring, and smart home applications, and the dynamic nature of sensor data make it difficult to apply only one particular information processing technique to the underlying data. A considerable amount of methods from machine-learning, the semantic web, as well as pattern and data mining have been used to abstract from sensor observations to information representations. This paper provides a survey of the requirements and solutions and describes challenges in the area of information abstraction and presents an efficient workflow to extract meaningful information from raw sensor data based on the current state-of-the-art in this area. This paper also identifies research directions at the edge of information abstraction for sensor data. To ease the understanding of the abstraction workflow process, we introduce a software toolkit that implements the introduced techniques and motivates to apply them on various data sets.", "paper_title": "A Practical Evaluation of Information Processing and Abstraction Techniques for the Internet of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000373098600009"}
