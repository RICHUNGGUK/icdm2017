As a side effect, higher performance inevitably leads to power density increase, eventually resulting in thermal problems. In order to alleviate the thermal problems, off-the-shelf mobile devices rely on dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS)-based dynamic thermal management (DTM) schemes. Unfortunately, in the DVFS-based DTM schemes, an excessive number of DTM operations worsen not only performance but also power efficiency. In this paper, we propose a temperature-aware DVFS scheme for Android-based mobile devices to optimize power or performance depending on the option. We evaluate our scheme in the off-the-shelf mobile device. Our evaluation results show that our scheme saves energy consumptionby 12.7%, on average, when we use the power optimizing option. Our scheme also enhances the performance by 6.3%, on average, by using the performance optimizing scheme, still reducing the energy consumption by 6.7%.", "paper_title": "Stabilizing CPU Frequency and Voltage for Temperature-Aware DVFS in Mobile Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000346572100025"}
