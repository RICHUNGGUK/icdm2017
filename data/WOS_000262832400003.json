This paper identifies graphical properties which can ensure unique localizability, and further sets of properties which can ensure not only unique localizability but also provide guarantees on the associated computational complexity, which can even be linear in the number of sensors on occasions. Sensor networks with minimal connectedness properties in which sensor transmit powers can be increased to increase the sensing radius lend themselves to the acquiring of the needed graphical properties. Results are presented for networks in both two and three dimensions.", "paper_title": "Graphical properties of easily localizable sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262832400003"}
