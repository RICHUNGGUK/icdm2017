Questionnaire outcomes are quite imprecise and seldom objective. Quantitative measurements (EMG recordings, electrogoniometers, motion analysis systems) mostly prevent subjects from moving freely while working at the VDT. The paper presents an automatic tool for the monitoring of activity at VDTs, using a quantitative, objective approach. The suitability of the proposed tool was fully tested in the laboratory, both in terms of functionalities, accuracy of the tool, and acceptance by the subjects involved. The outcomes show that the tool allows for a detailed analysis of VDT activities and may be used to improve VDT-related risk analysis with high accuracy and good acceptance by workers.
