However, DEA does not provide more information about the efficient DMUs. This research proposes a methodology to determine one common set of weights for the performance indices of only DEA efficient DMUs. Then, these DMUs are ranked according to the efficiency score weighted by the common set of weights. For the decision maker, this ranking is based on the optimization of the group's efficiency.
