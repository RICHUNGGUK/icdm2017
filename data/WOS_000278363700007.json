We start with a simple proof of a result from Vereshchagin (Theor. Comput. Sci. 271(1-2):59-67, 2002) saying that lim sup (n) C(x|n) (here C(x|n) is conditional (plain) Kolmogorov complexity of x when n is known) equals C (0')(x), the plain Kolmogorov complexity with 0'-oracle. Then we use the same argument to prove similar results for prefix complexity, a priori probability on binary tree and measure of effectively open sets, and also to improve results of Muchnik (Theory Probab. Appl. 32:513-514, 1987) about limit frequencies. As a by-product, we get a criterion of 0' Martin-Lof randomness (called also 2-randomness) proved in Miller (J. Symb. Log. 69(2):555-584, 2004): a sequence omega is 2-random if and only if there exists c such that any prefix x of omega is a prefix of some string y such that C(y)a parts per thousand yen|y|-c. (In the 1960ies this property was suggested in Kolmogorov, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory IT-14(5):662-664, 1968, as one of possible randomness definitions; its equivalence to 2-randomness was shown in Miller, J. Symb. Log. 69(2):555-584, 2004.) Miller (J. Symb. Log. 69(2):555-584, 2004) and Nies et al. (J. Symb. Log. 70(2):515-535, 2005) proved another 2-randomness criterion: omega is 2-random if and only if C(x)a parts per thousand yen|x|-c for some c and infinitely many prefixes x of omega. We show that the low-basis theorem can be used to get alternative proofs of our results on Kolmogorov complexity and to improve the result about effectively open sets; this stronger version implies the 2-randomness criterion mentioned in the previous sentence.", "paper_title": "Limit Complexities Revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000278363700007"}
