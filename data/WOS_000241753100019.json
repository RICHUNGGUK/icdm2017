Adjusting the slant is very important for recognition of characters and face verification since slanted passport images can bring various unwanted effects to the recognition of individual codes and faces. The angle adjustment can be conducted by using the slant of the straight and horizontal line that connects the center of thickness between left and right parts of the string. Extracting passport codes is done by Sobel operator, horizontal smearing, and 8-neighbornood contour tracking algorithm. The proposed RBF network is applied to the middle layer of RBF network by using the fuzzy logic connection operator and proposing the enhanced fuzzy ART algorithm that dynamically controls the vigilance parameter. After several tests using a forged passport and the passport with slanted images, the proposed method was proven to be effective in recognizing passport codes and verifying facial images.", "paper_title": "A passport recognition and face verification using enhanced fuzzy neural network and PCA algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100019"}
