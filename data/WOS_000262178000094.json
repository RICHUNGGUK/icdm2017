The main idea behind the approach presented here is that a domain ontology is not only useful as a learning instrument but it can also be employed to assess Students' skills. For it, each student is prompted to express his/her beliefs by building her/his own discipline-related ontology and then it is compared to a reference one. The analysis of students' mistakes allows to propose them personalized recommendations and to improve the course materials in general. In this work, we present a Semantic Web technologies-based multi-agent system that allows to automatically control students' acquired knowledge in e-learning frameworks. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
