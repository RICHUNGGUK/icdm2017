We establish, for usual classes of well partial orders, the equivalence between the existence of order reflections (non-monotonic order embeddings) and the simulations with respect to coverability languages. We show that the non-existence of order reflections can be proved by the computation of order types. This allows us to extend the current classification of WSTS, in particular solving some open problems, and to unify the existing proofs.
