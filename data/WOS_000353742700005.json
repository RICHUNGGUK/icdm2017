We observe that computing the Gromov hyperbolicity from a fixed base-point reduces to a (max,min) matrix product. Hence, using the (max,min) matrix product algorithm by Duan and Pettie, the fixed base-point hyperbolicity can be determined in O(n(2.69)) time. It follows that the Gromov hyperbolicity can be computed in O(n(3.69)) time, and a 2-approximation can be found in O(n(2.69)) time. We also give a (2 log(2)n)-approximation algorithm that runs in O(n(2)) time, based on a tree-metric embedding by Gromov. We also show that hyperbolicity at a fixed base-point cannot be computed in O(n(2.05)) time, unless there exists a faster algorithm for (max,min) matrix multiplication than currently known.
