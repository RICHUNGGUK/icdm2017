Firstly, it is shown that under certain conditions, the stability of a collection of N identical vehicles can be equivalently transferred into the stability analysis of a single vehicle with the same dynamics, modified by only a scalar, representing the interconnection, that takes values according to the eigenvalues of the weights matrix. Then, two types of networks, star-shaped networks and globally coupled networks, are studied in details. Secondly, the general description are presented for such consensus problem via the block diagram of information flow. Finally, a collection of vehicles with different 2-D LSS dynamical model is investigated.", "paper_title": "A consensus problem for a class of vehicles with 2-D dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000281251300004"}
