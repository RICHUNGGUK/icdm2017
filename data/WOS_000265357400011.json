This configuration retains the single-patch and single-layer characteristics of conventional microstrip antenna arrays and provides a good impedance matching over wider scan angles when electrically thick substrates are used to improve the frequency bandwidth. The characteristics of finite phased arrays of U-slot rectangular microstrip patches enclosed in cylindrical cavities are analyzed from a validated hybrid methodology based on the finite element method, the modal analysis, and the properties of spherical waves. The results are compared with those obtained using an infinite array model. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
