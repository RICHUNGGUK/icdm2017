In this article, a method based on joint distribution of motion angles is proposed for gait recognition. The new feature of the motion angles of lower limbs is defined and extracted from either 2D video database or 3D motion capture database, and the corresponding angles of right leg and left leg are joined together to work out the joint distribution spectrums. Based on the joint distribution of these angles, we build a feature histogram individually. In the stage of distance measurement, three types of distance vector are defined and utilized to measure the similarity between the histograms, and then a classifier is built to implement the classification. Experiments has been carried out both on CASIA Gait Database and CMU motion capture database, which show that our method can achieve a good recognition performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
