Here, we focus on applications that rely on sliding a window over a sequence of string data. For this type of problems it is argued that a symbolic, context-based representation of the data should be preferred over a continuous, real format as this is a much more intuitive setting for working with (weighted) distance functions. It is shown how a weighted string distance can be decomposed and subsequently used in different kernel functions and how these kernel functions correspond to real kernels between the continuous, real representations of the symbolic, context-based representations of the vectors.", "paper_title": "Context-sensitive kernel functions: A distance function viewpoint", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100090"}
