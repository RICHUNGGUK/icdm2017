This paper extends well known results for the 1D case, according to which a structured system (A (lambda), B (lambda)) is (generically) reachable if and only if its graph is spanned by a cactus, or, equivalently, if and only if the pair (A (lambda), B (lambda)) is full generically row rank and irreducible.", "paper_title": "Characterizations of global reachability of 2D structured systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000312715000004"}
