This study proposes a research model that examines the factors that determine consumer acceptance of mobile payment system. To achieve this goal, it employed the technology acceptance model (TAM), adding the concepts of security, trust, social influence, and computer-efficacy from Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. The model is examined through an empirical study using structural equation modeling techniques. Although the model confirms the classical role of TAM factors, the results also show that users' attitudes and intentions are influenced by perceived risk and trust. Significant support for the model was found in the data collected from a survey of potential mobile payment system users. Based on the findings, this study proposes a conceptual framework of adoption enablers, drivers, and barriers with propositions to guide future research in mobile payment. Implications to practice and means to overcome the barriers are suggested.", "paper_title": "Modeling the Interaction of Users and Mobile Payment System: Conceptual Framework (Retracted article.
