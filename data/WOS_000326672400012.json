A general convergence theorem is proved by generalizing the previously obtained results in finite dimensions. As application examples we consider two nonlinear elliptic model problems: the stationary solid fuel ignition model and the stationary viscous Burgers equation. For these problems we present a more detailed convergence analysis of the method. The resulting algorithms are computationally implemented in combination with an adaptive mesh refinement strategy, which leads to an improvement in the performance of the one-shot approach.", "paper_title": "One-shot methods in function space for PDE-constrained optimal control problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000326672400012"}
