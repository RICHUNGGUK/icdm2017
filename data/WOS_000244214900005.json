Therefore, the degree structure of the class of disjoint NP-pairs and of all canonical pairs is identical. We show that this degree structure is not superficial: Assuming there exist P-inseparable disjoint NP-pairs, every countable distributive lattice can be embedded into every interval of polynomial NP-degrees of disjoint pairs by maps that preserve the least and greatest element, respectively. As one consequence of this embedding, under the same assumption, there exist intermediate disjoint NP-pairs. That is, if (A, B) is a P-separable disjoint NP-pair and (C, D) is a P-inseparable disjoint NP-pair, then there exist P-inseparable, incomparable NP-pairs (E, F) and (G, H) whose degrees lie strictly between (A, B) and (C, D). Furthermore, between any two disjoint NP-pairs that are comparable and inequivalent, such a diamond exists. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
