During this century, the thought of seeking the system security to the source of system development lifecycle received huge improvement in the system and software assurance domain. This paper firstly expounds the understanding of information security by illustrating information security study development progress since pre-computer age and presents a description of cyberspace and cyberization security by summarizing the status quo of cyberization. Then a security model called PDRL, which includes six core security attributes of sensitive information systems, is proposed to protect the security of sensitive information systems in the whole system life-cycle. At last, this paper probes into further discussion about controllability attribute and proposes a controllability model in sensitive sensor networks, followed by a probability computing formula and the example for computing the controllability of sensitive sensor networks. By dividing each single element of sensitive information and each element-related operation into a corresponding classification, this paper makes a reasonable description of the quantitative description about controllability.", "paper_title": "Security Model for Sensitive Information Systems and Its Applications in Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000369374300001"}
