Especially, with the rapid growth of modern high technology, healthcare is providing many kinds of services for patients. One of those is mobile healthcare that is the integration of mobile computing and health monitoring. By using remote protocol, the service via mobile can directly send the patient heart failure sign to the doctor. Among the existing client-server protocols, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is the typical method but it needs enhancement to adapt for more rigorous requirements: real time, quality of service (QoS), etc. In this paper, we present the architecture with flexibly coding screen image to improve quality of experience (QoE) of users and ensure low bandwidth services. Besides, in order to guarantee the best image quality and reduce redundant communication by using different compression encoding techniques for movies, images and other formats. Based on the edge detection Sobel operator that strongly focuses through horizontal, vertical direction and low complexity computation, our proposed method introduces the efficient block classification for the media healthcare services.", "paper_title": "An efficient block classification for media healthcare service in mobile cloud computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000358214900015"}
