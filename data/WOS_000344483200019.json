Instead of shift-register array or multiport SRAM, only single-port SRAM is used in the proposed design. A new diagonal data mapping scheme is proposed to reduce the number of SRAM banks used to implement the transpose memory. This design can be flexibly extended to support DCT/IDCT of different transform sizes and different data throughput rates. To support larger size DCT/IDCT, only the depth of SRAM needs to be increased. To support different data throughput rate, multiple SRAM banks are well organized according to the required throughput. Row access and column access can be perfectly supported under single port SRAM. The equivalent gate count per bit (EGC) of proposed approach is less than two, which is much more efficient than the previous method. It is suitable for real-time processing of the video with the resolution up to 1080P HD or even higher.", "paper_title": "Single-Port SRAM-Based Transpose Memory With Diagonal Data Mapping for Large Size 2-D DCT/IDCT", "paper_id": "WOS:000344483200019"}
