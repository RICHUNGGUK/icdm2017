We present two approaches in the design of spiking neuronal networks, both of which are applied to engineering tasks. In exploring the input-output relationship of integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons with Poisson inputs, we are able to define mathematically robust learning rules, which can be applied to multilayer and time-series networks. We show through experimental applications that it is possible to train spike-rate networks on function approximation problems and on the dynamic task of robot arm control.", "paper_title": "Training spiking neuronal networks with applications in engineering tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000259499900010"}
