In the past, implementations of these languages used ad hoc techniques to implement layout. Recent work has shown that a simple extension to context-free grammars can replace these ad hoc techniques and provide both formal foundations and efficient parsing algorithms for indentation sensitivity. However, that previous work is limited to bottom-up, LR(k) parsing, and many combinator-based parsing frameworks including Parsec use top-down algorithms that are outside its scope. This paper remedies this by showing how to add indentation sensitivity to parsing frameworks like Parsec. It explores both the formal semantics of and efficient algorithms for indentation sensitivity. It derives a Parsec-based library for indentation-sensitive parsing and presents benchmarks on a real-world language that show its efficiency and practicality.", "paper_title": "Indentation-Sensitive Parsing for Parsec", "paper_id": "WOS:000358311500015"}
