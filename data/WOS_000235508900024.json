However, for a floorplan with dominant wide bus, BSA may instead worsen the congestion. Our proposed Enhanced Buffer Site Approach (EBSA) extends existing BSA in a way that buffers of dominant wide bus can be distributed more evenly while reserving the same fast operation speed as BSA does. Experiments have been performed to integrate our model into an iterative floorplanning algorithm, and the results reveal that buffer congestion in a floorplan with dominant wide bus can be much abated.", "paper_title": "An enhanced BSA for floorplanning", "paper_id": "WOS:000235508900024"}
