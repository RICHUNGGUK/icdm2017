User access control (UAC) is the core component of security in cloud computing environment, aiming to ensure that stored data are allowed to be accessed only by authenticated/authorized users. As a typical behavioural biometrics, keystroke dynamics provides a promising UAC solution. The most challenging issue that hinders the wide deployment of keystroke is the high verification error rate. Gunetti et al. proposed a classical n-graph-based keystroke verification method (GP method), which can achieve a low False Acceptance Rate (FAR). However, the GP method suffers from a high False Rejection Rate (FRR) and a severe scalability issue. Thus, GP is not a feasible solution for computing cloud application where scalability is a big issue. In this paper, two keystroke verification approaches (nGdv-V and nGdv-C) are proposed to overcome GP's shortcomings. To reduce high FRR, we designed a new correlation measure using n-graph equivalent feature (nGdv) that enables more accurate recognition for genuine users. Moreover, correlation-based hierarchical clustering is proposed to address the scalability issue. The experimental results show that the nGdv-C can produce much lower FRR while achieving almost the same level of FAR as that of the GP method. Furthermore, 1250 times (when using nGdv-V) and three times (when using nGdv-C(17,4)) authentication speed gains have been achieved.", "paper_title": "Correlation Keystroke Verification Scheme for User Access Control in Cloud Computing Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000295413400006"}
