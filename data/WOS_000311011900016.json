The existence of optimal (v, 3, 1)-OOCs had been solved completely. Although there are some partial results, the existence of optimal (v, 4, 1)-OOCs is far from settled. In this letter, three general constructions for (v, 4, 1)-OOCs via perfect difference families are presented, new infinite classes of (v, 4, 1)-OOCs are then obtained.", "paper_title": "General Constructions for (v, 4, 1) Optical Orthogonal Codes via Perfect Difference Families", "paper_id": "WOS:000311011900016"}
