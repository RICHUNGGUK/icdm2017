We show that the language of primitive non palindromes is strongly unavoidable for context free languages that are not linear. This means that every language from this class contains infinitely many primitive non-palindromes. In the second part, we extend the defintion of palindromes. In the center of a word we admit a bounded factor that is not palindromic. For k-palindromes, the length of this factor can be up to P. For non-primitive words, k-palindromicity implies conventional palindromicity if these words are long enough. Therefore we can extend the unavoidability result to k-palindromes.", "paper_title": "ON NON-PRIMITIVE PALINDROMIC CONTEXT-FREE LANGUAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000311560300007"}
