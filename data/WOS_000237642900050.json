We aim to develop a path finding method for various applications. Through an integration of the entire tool path finding process, the method becomes not merely optimal to generate an efficient path but also robust enough to be applied to any system with any configuration. The flexibility of the devised method enables us to broaden the application fields of pocketing to fields such as prototype printed circuit board manufacturing. The devised method is applied to generate a clearing path for prototype printed circuit boards. The results verify that the method is concise and simple, but robust and flexible enough to achieve the optimal path in any configuration.", "paper_title": "Path finding method for various applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900050"}
