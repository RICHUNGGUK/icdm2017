(J Stat Plann Inference 106: 303-327, 2002) have examined the existence of BRD(v, 5, lambda) s for lambda is an element of {4, 10, 20}. In addition, Ge et al. (J Combin Math Combin Comput 46:3-45, 2003) have investigated the existence of GBRD(v, 4, lambda; G) s when G is a direct product of cyclic groups of prime orders. For the first problem, necessary existence conditions are (i) v >= 5, (ii) lambda(v - 1) 0 (mod4), (iii) lambda v(v - 1) 0 (mod 40), (iv). = 0 (mod 2). We show these are sufficient, except for v = 5, lambda is an element of {4, 10}. For the second problem, we improve the known existence results. Five necessary existence conditions are (i) v >= 4, (ii) lambda 0 (mod vertical bar G vertical bar), (iii) lambda(v - 1) 0 (mod 3), (iv) lambda v(v - 1) 0 (mod 4), (v) if v = 4 and vertical bar G vertical bar = 2 (mod 4) then lambda 0 (mod 4). We show these conditions are sufficient, except for lambda = vertical bar G vertical bar, (v, vertical bar G vertical bar) is an element of {(4, 3), (10, 2), (5, 6), (7, 4)} and possibly for lambda = vertical bar G vertical bar, (v, vertical bar G vertical bar) is an element of {(10, 2h), (5, 6h), (7, 4h)} with h 1 or 5 (mod 6), h > 1.", "paper_title": "Existence of GBRDs with block size 4 and BRDs with block size 5", "paper_id": "WOS:000294297600004"}
