The Whyline is a new kind of debugging tool that avoids such speculation by instead enabling developers to select a question about program output from a set of \"why did and why didn't\" questions extracted from the program's code and execution. The tool then finds one or more possible explanations for the output in question. These explanations are derived using a static and dynamic slicing, precise call graphs, reachability analyses, and new algorithms for determining potential sources of values. Evaluations of the tool on two debugging tasks showed that developers with the Whyline were three times more successful and twice as fast at debugging, compared to developers with traditional breakpoint debuggers. The tool has the potential to simplify debugging and program understanding in many software development contexts.", "paper_title": "Extracting and Answering Why and Why Not Questions about Java Program Output", "paper_id": "WOS:000282757300001"}
