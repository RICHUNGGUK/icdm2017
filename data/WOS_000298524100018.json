Here, we present a spherical code comprising 60,000 points in five-dimensional space and the list of the uniformly distributed reduced stress tensors corresponding to the points. This code benefits tectonic studies. By the way of example, it is demonstrated how the code improves the resolution of stress tensor inversion. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
