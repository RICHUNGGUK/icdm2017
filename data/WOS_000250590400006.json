The proposed model, unlike the past intercity bus scheduling models, does not assume a fixed market share. Instead, passenger choice behaviors in competitive markets are considered. The model is formulated as a nonlinear mixed integer program that is characterized as nondeterministic polynomial-time hard. We develop a solution algorithm to efficiently solve the model. The test results, which are based on a major Taiwan intercity bus carrier, show the good performance of the model and the solution algorithm.", "paper_title": "An intercity bus scheduling model incorporating variable market share", "paper_id": "WOS:000250590400006"}
