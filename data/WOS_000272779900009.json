Software development risks are inherently dependent, in other words, mutually positive or negative assessments of some risks can influence the decision to accept or reject a project. This fact cannot be modeled with a traditional best compromise seeking method. Aggregation operations based on the family of fuzzy integrals include many operators and thus can express a variety of decision maker behaviors. This study proposes an integrated multi-criteria evaluation methodology for software development experts and managers to better enable them to position their projects in terms of the associated risks. The method relies on a special fuzzy operator, namely a two-additive Choquet integral that enables modeling various effects of importance and interactions among risks. The potential of the proposed methodology is exposed through a case study conducted in a Turkish software company. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
