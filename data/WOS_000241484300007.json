In this paper, we propose an approach based on Cellular Automata (CA) models. The approach is considered for real-valued additive CA. The problem of regional controllability is explored and connected with actuators structures. The so-called rank condition is established. Dual results for the observability of additive CA are developed.", "paper_title": "Regional analysis of a class of Cellular Automata models", "paper_id": "WOS:000241484300007"}
