In order to integrate actuators in preliminary design procedures or in a multidisciplinary optimization approach, reliable models of the actuator performance (actuator force and stroke, loading curves, strength limit, volume and mass specific work and power, frequency range, efficiency) as a function of the design parameters and variables (actuator principle, size of the actuator element) are necessary. The present work deals with the formulation of model-based design rules to be used in the conception of optimized mechatronic and adaptronic systems and applies it to linear electromagnetic actuators optimization focusing on the solenoid and moving coil actuators.
