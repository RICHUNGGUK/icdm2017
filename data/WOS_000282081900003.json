The inversion of Laplace transforms have been carried out numerically using Durbin's approach, while special convergence enhancement techniques are invoked to completely eradicate spurious oscillations and obtain uniformly convergent solutions. Detailed numerical results for the transient and vibratory responses of water-submerged steel cylinders of selected wall thickness parameters with various internal fluid loadings under an exponential pulse excitation are presented. Many of the interesting dynamic features in the transient cylinder-shock interaction are examined using appropriate images of the internal pressure field. Limiting cases are considered and good agreements with solutions in the existing literature are established. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
