The method consists of segmenting the region of the vascular bundle in an optic disc to set a reference point in the temporal side of the cup, determining the position of the centroids of the superior, inferior, and nasal vascular bundle segmented zones located within the segmented region, and calculating the displacement from normal position using the chessboard distance metric. The method was successful in 62 images out of 67, achieving 93.02% sensitivity, 91.66% specificity, and 91.34% global accuracy in pre-diagnosis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
