This work is an experimental and computational fluid dynamic modelling study to determine the permeability of the diploe as a potential receptor for CSF. Human calvariae were studied by micro-CT to measure their porosity, the area of flow and develop model geometry. Pressure-flow measurements were conducted on specimens to determine their permeability in the physiological and transverse flow directions to compare with numerical results. The overall porosity and permeability of the calvaria were spatially variable. Results suggest an order of magnitude increase in permeability for a 14% increase in overall porosity based on a small number of samples. Numerical results fell within the experimental infusion tests results. Due to the difficulty and ethical considerations in obtaining adolescent skull samples to perform large-scale testing, the developed model will be invaluable.", "paper_title": "Numerical model for intraosseous infusion of the human calvarium for hydrocephalus shunting", "paper_id": "WOS:000345142000009"}
