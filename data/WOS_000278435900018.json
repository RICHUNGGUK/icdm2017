Closed form expressions of the throughput which incorporate the dimensions of the interconnects and the wiring overheads incurred by such techniques are derived for lines under different buffering conditions. These formulae are utilized to optimize the bandwidth of constrained-area parallel buses under different latency and power constraints. Our results are confirmed by the simulations we have performed in Spectre for a UMC CMOS 90-nm technology.", "paper_title": "Throughput Optimization for Area-Constrained Links With Crosstalk Avoidance Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000278435900018"}
