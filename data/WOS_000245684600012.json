Moreover, the accuracy of traditional approaches is seriously degraded by noise and intersymbol interference. In this paper, we propose a joint AGC and equalization (joint AGC-EQ) scheme, in which the AGC circuitry comprises only one-tenth of the area of a traditional AGC. In addition, the total convergence time of the proposed Joint AGC-EQ is only half that of traditional blind equalization. The scheme is already silicon proven for the application of a Fast Ethernet transceiver using Faraday/UMC 0.18-mu m cell libraries.", "paper_title": "Joint AGC-equalization algorithm and VLSI architecture for wirelined transceiver designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000245684600012"}
