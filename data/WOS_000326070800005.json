Fresh ovine vertebrae were used to represent embalmed (n=3) and macerated dry-bone (n=3) specimens and treated accordingly. Specimens were scanned pre- and post-treatment using micro-computed tomography. A constant threshold level derived from these images was used to calculate the respective bone volume fraction (BV/TV) from which the conversion factor validated for fresh tissue was used to determine material properties that were assigned to corresponding FE models. Results showed a definite change in the BV/TV between the fresh and the preserved bone. However, the changes in the predicted FE stiffness were not generally greater than the variations expected from assignment of loading and boundary conditions. In conclusion, images of preserved tissue can be used to generate FE models that are representative of fresh tissue with a tolerable level of error.", "paper_title": "The use of preserved tissue in finite element modelling of fresh ovine vertebral behaviour", "paper_id": "WOS:000326070800005"}
