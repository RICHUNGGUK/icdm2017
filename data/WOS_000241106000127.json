In this paper, the k-tree problem with fuzzy weights is firstly formulated as the chance-constrained programming by using the possibility measure and the credibility measure. Then an oriented tree and knowledge-based hybrid genetic algorithm is designed for solving the proposed fuzzy programming models.", "paper_title": "The fuzzy weighted k-cardinality tree and its hybrid genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000127"}
