We define various linguistically motivated classification features and introduce novel ways for computing them. We then manually define interrelationships among the features, and express them in a Bayesian network. The result is a powerful classifier that can identify multiword expressions of various types and multiple syntactic constructions in text corpora. Our methodology is unsupervised and language-independent; it requires relatively few language resources and is thus suitable for a large number of languages. We report results on English, French, and Hebrew, and demonstrate a significant improvement in identification accuracy, compared with less sophisticated baselines.", "paper_title": "Identification of Multiword Expressions by Combining Multiple Linguistic Information Sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000338196000007"}
