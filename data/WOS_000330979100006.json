A model predictive control strategy based on neurodynamic optimization is proposed to control this new hydraulic system in the injection molding process. Simulation results showed that this control method has good control precision and quick response.", "paper_title": "Model predictive control of servo motor driven constant pump hydraulic system in injection molding process based on neurodynamic optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000330979100006"}
