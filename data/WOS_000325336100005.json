The study is based on generating two codebooks, primary and secondary. The writer of a handwritten document is characterized by the probability of occurrence of codebook patterns in his/her writing. The main contribution of this study is the proposition of a secondary codebook to capture information on connecting strokes in addition to the main strokes. The writing is divided into small windows and, for each window, four small adjacent windows are considered. The patterns in the main and adjacent windows are clustered separately to generate two codebooks. The proposed method evaluated on 650 writers of the IAM database reports an identification rate of 96% and validates the idea that complementing the primary codebook with a secondary codebook serves to enhance the recognition rates.", "paper_title": "IMPROVING CODEBOOK-BASED WRITER RECOGNITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000325336100005"}
