Since detailed information on complex load composition at the system buses is usually absent for a constantly changing power demand there exist large parametric uncertainties in the electrical load representation. In order to determine a whole set of electrical load parameters, for which power system voltage stability is preserved, robust control theory was applied in the present paper. A new method exploiting a zero set concept was derived to determine the required set in parameter space. A particular definition of the zero set adopted in this paper allows one to obtain its boundary in a totally analytical, straightforward way.", "paper_title": "Zero set application to voltage stability analysis of power system with uncertain load characteristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000235413800010"}
