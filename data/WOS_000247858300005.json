However, most of the approaches have not intensively addressed the classification of instances including numeric attributes. In this paper, a levelwise subspace clustering deriving hyper-rectangular clusters is proposed to efficiently provide quantitative, interpretative and accurate CARs. Significant performance of the proposed approach has been demonstrated through the tests on UCI repository data.", "paper_title": "A classification method based on subspace clustering and association rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000247858300005"}
