The reason of the dramatic improvement in performance is that the techniques make use of certain properties of the data. These properties are: the data is sparse and there are many repeating records. We claim that particular sources of data consistently satisfy these properties. Excellent examples are Click-stream and retail data which are very sparse and consist of many repititions. Using simple techniques huge speed-ups and compression rates, on real life clickstream data sets, are observed compared to the standard implementation of the EM.", "paper_title": "A fast implementation of the EM algorithm for mixture of multinomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200057"}
