We used a concept similar to the modulus of continuity to characterize the robustness of fuzzy connectives and present robustness results for various fuzzy connectives. We investigated the robustness of fuzzy reasoning from the perspective of perturbation of membership functions. We propose a method for judging the most robust elements of different classes of fuzzy connectives. The results obtained are compared with previous findings in the literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
