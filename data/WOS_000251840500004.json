This computationally intensive task has many biological applications. We first describe an algorithm to detect substrings that have edit distances to a fixed substring at most equal to a given e. We then propose an algorithm that finds the set of all,substrings that have edit distances larger than e to all others. Several applications are given, where attention is paid to practical biological issues such as hairpins and GC percentage. An experiment shows the potential of the methods.", "paper_title": "Selection of DNA markers", "paper_id": "WOS:000251840500004"}
