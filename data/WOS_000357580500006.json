The structure of V+Pron+CP/NP has the ambiguous potential to bring Garden Path effect. If Tell+Pron+NP structure has considerable higher observed frequencies than Tell+Pron+CP structure, the former is regarded as the preferred structure and has much lower confusion quotient. It is possible for the grammatical unpreferred Tell+Pron+CP structure to replace the ungrammatical preferred Tell+Pron+NP, which results in the processing breakdown. The syntactic details of GP processing can be presented by the computational technologies. Computational linguistics is proved to be effective to explore the Garden Path phenomenon.", "paper_title": "Towards GP Sentence Parsing of V+P+CP/NP Structure A Perspective of Computational Linguistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000357580500006"}
