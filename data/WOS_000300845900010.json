The transmitter comprises a linear front-end combined with nonlinear precoding, minimizing transmit energy by means of input alphabet relaxation. For the common discrete lattice-based relaxation, the problem violates replica symmetry and a replica symmetry breaking (RSB) ansatz is taken. The limiting empirical distribution of the precoder's output and the limiting transmit energy are derived for one-step RSB. Particularizing to a \"zero-forcing\" (ZF) linear front-end, a decoupling result is derived. For discrete lattice-based relaxations, the impact of RSB is demonstrated for the transmit energy. The spectral efficiencies of the aforementioned precoding methods are compared to linear ZF and Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP). Focusing on quaternary phase shift-keying (QPSK), significant performance gains of both lattice and convex relaxations are revealed for medium to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) when compared to linear ZF precoding. THP is shown to be outperformed as well. Comparing certain lattice-based relaxations for QPSK against a convex counterpart, the latter is found to be superior for low and high SNRs but slightly inferior for medium SNRs in terms of spectral efficiency.", "paper_title": "Vector Precoding for Gaussian MIMO Broadcast Channels: Impact of Replica Symmetry Breaking", "paper_id": "WOS:000300845900010"}
