Among them the eigenphases algorithm and some variations of it using sub-block processing, appears to be desirable alternatives because they achieves high face recognition rate, under controlled conditions. However, their performance degrades when the face images under analysis present variations in the illumination conditions as well as partial occlusions. To overcome these problems, this paper derives the optimal sub-block size that allows improving the performance of previously proposed eigenphases algorithms. Theoretical and computer evaluation results show that, using the optimal block size, the identification performance of the eigenphases algorithm significantly improves, in comparison with the conventional one, when the face image presents different illumination conditions and partial occlusions respectively. The optimal sub-block size also allows achieving a very low false acceptance and false rejection rates, simultaneously, when performing identity verification tasks, which is not possible to obtain using the conventional approach: as well as to improve the performance of other sub-block-based eigenphases methods when rank tests are performed.
