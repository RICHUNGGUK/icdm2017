In video streaming, Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) is a streaming technique in which a source video is stored on a server at variable encoding rates and each streaming user requests the most appropriate video encoding rate considering their channel capacity. However, these days, ABR related studies are only focusing on real-time rate adaptation omitting energy efficiency though it is one of the most important requirement for mobile devices, which may cause dissatisfaction for streaming users. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient prefetching based dynamic adaptive streaming technique by considering the limited characteristics of the batteries used in mobile devices, in order to reduce the energy waste and provide a similar level of service in terms of the average video rate compared to the latest ABR streaming technique which does not consider the energy consumption. The simulation results is showing that our proposed scheme saves 65 similar to 68% of energy at the average global mobile download speed compared to the latest high performance ABR algorithm while providing similar rate adaptation performance.", "paper_title": "Energy Cognitive Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP", "paper_id": "WOS:000358995800010"}
