Deniable authentication means that a message receiver R, although receiving a message m from a sender S, cannot convince a third party that the sender S has sent R the message m. If signature schemes are secure against selective forgery, the authors can construct a full deniable authentication protocol. The protocol is presented in the extension framework of Raimondo et al. as a deniable message transmission authenticator.", "paper_title": "Deniable message transmission authenticator based on weak signature schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000312962100003"}
