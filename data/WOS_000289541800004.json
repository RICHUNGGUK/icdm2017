A queueing model is extended with the arrival processes of negative custom to capture failures of production stations, reorganization of works and disasters in 1 manufacturing cell. We present an exact solution for the steady-state probabilities of proposed queueing model. The solution does not require the approximation of the infinite sum. In addition, it provides an alternative way to compute the rate matrix for the matrix geometric method as well. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
