However, there has been little research on consumer trust in the new frontier of consumer-to-consumer (C2C) online auctions. The current study investigates the factors that influence bidders' trust in online auctions from seller (trust arguments), bidder (disposition to trust), and auctioneer (structural assurance and perceived Web risk) perspectives in order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of trust in the C2C environment. Laboratory experiments (manipulating the trust arguments in about me page) and online questionnaire surveys (measuring the subjects' responses regarding structural assurance, perceived risk, disposition to trust, trust, and purchase intention) were conducted to collect necessary data. The results suggest that benevolent sellers significantly influence the trust of bidders. Analysis also finds that structural assurance is the most influential predictor of trust, which significantly influences a buyer's intention to purchase. In addition, disposition to trust is a significant predictor of trusting belief, whereas perceived Web risk does not predict purchase intention.", "paper_title": "THE INFLUENCE OF SELLER, AUCTIONEER, AND BIDDER FACTORS ON TRUST IN ONLINE AUCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000329604500002"}
