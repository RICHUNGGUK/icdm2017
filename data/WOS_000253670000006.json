These properties can then be used to reduce the dimension of the composition space (i.e., concentration space for constant density fluid (CDF) reactor networks, mass fraction space for variable density fluid (VDF) reactor networks) within which RNS is conducted and subsequently the attainable region (AR) construction. This procedure may be used to overcome the difficulty preventing the AR methodology and other RNS methods from being used for real industrial size problems.
