The new condition provides a means for removing the unnecessary paths resulting from Guo and Xia's paths. Also, an algorithm and two numerical examples are offered to abbreviate and illustrate the steps of the resolution process of the problem.", "paper_title": "On optimizing a linear objective function subjected to fuzzy relation inequalities", "paper_id": "WOS:000264547800006"}
