To assess the fundamental consequences of branching characteristics, 50 stochastic asymmetrical coronary trees and one non-stochastic symmetrical branching tree were generated. In the stochastic trees, area growth, A, at branching points was varied: A = random; 1.00; 1.10; 1.13 and 1.15 and symmetry, S, was varied: S = random; 1.00; 0.70; 0.58; 0.50 and 0.48. With random S and A values, a large variation in flow and volume was found, linearly related to the number of vessels in the trees. Large A values resulted in high number of vessels and high flow and volume values, indicating vessels connected in parallel. Lowering symmetry values increased the number of vessels, however, without changing flow, indicating a dominant connection of vessels in series. Both large A and small S values gave more realistic gradual pressure drops compared to the symmetrical non-stochastic branching tree. This study showed large variations in tree realizations, which may reflect real biological variations in tree anatomies. Furthermore, perfusion of tissue clearly depends on the branching rules applied.", "paper_title": "Relation between branching patterns and perfusion in stochastic generated coronary arterial trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000243621200005"}
