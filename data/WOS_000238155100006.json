Electronic Fetal Monitoring (EFM) is widely used for assessing fetal well being. EFM involves detection of the Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) signal and the Uterine Activity (UA) signal. The most serious fetal incident is the hypoxic injury leading to cerebral palsy or even death, which is a condition that must be predicted and avoided. This research work proposes a new integrated method for feature extraction and classification of the FHR signal able to associate FHR with umbilical artery pH values at delivery. The proposed method introduces the use of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to extract time-scale dependent features of the FHR signal and the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for the categorization. The proposed methodology is tested on a data set of intrapartum recordings were the FHR categories are associated with umbilical artery pH values, This proposed approach achieved high overall classification performance proving its merits.", "paper_title": "Feature extraction and classification of Fetal Heart Rate using wavelet analysis and Support Vector Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000238155100006"}
