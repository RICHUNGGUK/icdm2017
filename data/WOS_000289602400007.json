However, despite the benefits of RBAC, there are environments in which RBAC can hardly be applied. We present FRBAC (Fuzzy Role-Based Access Control), a generalization of RBAC through fuzzy relations that extends the applicability of RBAC to environments where authorization-related information is vague. Moreover, FRBAC deals with environments where the actions that can be executed over the resources have a fractional meaning, as data lying in databases and risk-based access control.
