By choosing an appropriate Lyapunov functional and utilizing the free-weighting matrix technique, a new delay-dependent condition is firstly proposed for the existence of a state feedback controller which ensures not only the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system, but also an adequate performance bound over all the admissible parameter uncertainties. Based on it, the corresponding guaranteed cost controller is then obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities. An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the upper bound on the cost function. Two examples are given to demonstrate the validity and potential of the developed approach.", "paper_title": "NEW RESULTS ON GUARANTEED COST CONTROL OF UNCERTAIN DISCRETE SYSTEMS WITH BOTH STATE AND INPUT DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289401100016"}
