In this paper we focus on the standard linear nonparametric ICA problem from an optimisation point of view. It is well known that after a pre-whitening process, the problem can be solved via an optimisation approach on a suitable manifold. We propose an approximate Newton's method on the unit sphere to solve the one-unit linear nonparametric ICA problem. The local convergence properties are discussed. The performance of the proposed algorithms is investigated by numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "Newton-like methods for nonparametric independent component analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100119"}
