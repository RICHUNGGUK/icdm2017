The method is tolerant against partial occlusions produced by the presence of any kind of object. The detection algorithm uses invariant properties of the surfaces to segment salient facial features, namely the eyes and the nose. At least two facial features must be clearly visible in order to perform face detection. Candidate faces are then registered using an ICP (Iterative Correspondent Point) based approach aimed to avoid those samples which belong to the occluding objects. The final face versus non-face discrimination is computed by a Gappy PCA (GPCA) classifier which is able to classify candidate faces using only those regions of the surface which are considered to be non-occluded. The algorithm has been tested using the UND database obtaining 100% of correct detection and only one false alarm. The database has been then processed with an artificial occlusions generator producing realistic acquisitions that emulate unconstrained scenarios. A rate of 89.8% of correct detections shows that 3D data is particularly suited for handling occluding objects. The results have been also verified on a small test set containing real world occlusions obtaining 90.4% of correctly detected faces. The proposed approach can be used to improve the robustness of all those systems requiring a face detection stage in non-controlled scenarios.", "paper_title": "Gappy PCA Classification for Occlusion Tolerant 3D Face Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000269999300004"}
