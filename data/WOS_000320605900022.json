In this paper, we study Critical Link Disruptor (CLD) and Critical Node Disruptor (CND) optimization problems to identify critical links and nodes in a network whose removals maximally destroy the network's functions. We provide a comprehensive complexity analysis of CLD and CND on general graphs and show that they still remain NP-complete even on unit disk graphs and power-law graphs. Furthermore, the CND problem is shown NP-hard to be approximated within on general graphs with vertices and critical nodes. Despite the intractability of these problems, we propose HILPR, a novel LP-based rounding algorithm, for efficiently solving CLD and CND problems in a timely manner. The effectiveness of our solutions is validated on various synthetic and real-world networks.", "paper_title": "On the Discovery of Critical Links and Nodes for Assessing Network Vulnerability", "paper_id": "WOS:000320605900022"}
