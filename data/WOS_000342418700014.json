Most previous works only count passing people based on color information. Owing to the restrictions of color information influences themselves for multimedia processing, they will be affected inevitably by the unpredictable complex environments (e.g. illumination, occlusion, and shadow). To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a new algorithm by multimodal joint information processing for crowd counting. In our method, we use color and depth information together with a ordinary depth camera (e.g. Microsoft Kinect). Specifically, we first detect each head of the passing or still person in the surveillance region with adaptive modulation ability to varying scenes on depth information. Then, we track and count each detected head on color information. The characteristic advantage of our algorithm is that it is scene adaptive, which means the algorithm can be applied into all kinds of different scenes directly without additional conditions. Based on the proposed approach, we have built a practical system for robust and fast crowd counting facing complicated scenes. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "Scene-adaptive accurate and fast vertical crowd counting via joint using depth and color information", "paper_id": "WOS:000342418700014"}
