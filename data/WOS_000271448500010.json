In this paper a new semantic similarity metric, that exploits some notions of the feature-based theory of similarity and translates it into the information theoretic domain, which lever-ages the notion of Information Content (IC), is presented. In particular, the proposed metric exploits the notion of intrinsic IC which quantifies IC values by scrutinizing how concepts are arranged in an ontological structure. In order to evaluate this metric, an on line experiment asking the community of researchers to rank a list of 65 word pairs has been conducted. The experiment's web setup allowed to collect 101 similarity ratings and to differentiate native and non-native English speakers. Such a large and diverse dataset enables to confidently evaluate similarity metrics by correlating them with human assessments. Experimental evaluations using WordNet indicate that the proposed metric, coupled with the notion of intrinsic IC, yields results above the state of the art. Moreover, the intrinsic IC formulation also improves the accuracy of other IC-based metrics. In order to investigate the generality of both the intrinsic IC formulation and proposed similarity metric a further evaluation using the MeSH biomedical ontology has been performed. Even in this case significant results were obtained. The proposed metric and several others have been implemented in the Java WordNet Similarity Library. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
