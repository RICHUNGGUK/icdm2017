The interest of our metric lies in the fact that the redundant regions and the complementary/conflicting regions are treated respectively according to the structural similarity between the source images, The experiments show that the proposed measure is consistent with human visual evaluations and can be applied to evaluate image fusion schemes that are not performed at the same level.
