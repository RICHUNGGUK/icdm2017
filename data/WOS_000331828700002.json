Since these objects have intelligence, communication capabilities and ability to work with their environment, they are considered as a key component for future smart buildings and cities. In this article we briefly introduce several architectures for M2M devices, which are being standardized in 3GPP, ETSI TC M2M and OneM2M, highlighting key functionalities used to manage and control M2M devices such as overload control, conflict management and semantic interworking. Further, the description of their realization in the field of smart building, as part of the CAMPUS 21 European project based on the M2M service modeling from the SENSEI European project, is presented.", "paper_title": "Connecting and Managing M2M Devices in the Future Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000331828700002"}
