We also construct the topology of connected components of the silhouette. At each instant t, a three-dimensional object moving along a trajectory touches the envelope surface of its swept volume along a characteristic curve Kt. The same instance of the moving object has a silhouette curve L-t on its own boundary. The intersection K-t boolean AND L-t contributes to the silhouette of the general swept volume. We reformulate this problem as a system of two polynomial equations in three variables. The connected components of the resulting silhouette curves are constructed by detecting the instances where the two curves K-t and L-t intersect each other tangentially on the surface of the moving object. We also consider a general case where the eye position changes while moving along a predefined path. The problem is reformulated as a system of two polynomial equations in four variables, where the zero-set is a two-manifold. By analyzing the topology of the zero-set, we achieve an efficient algorithm for generating a continuous animation of perspective silhouettes of a general swept volume.", "paper_title": "Perspective silhouette of a general swept volume", "paper_id": "WOS:000235751200006"}
