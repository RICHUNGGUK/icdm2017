Consequently, we present three new classes of authentication codes without secrecy from difference balanced functions. This is the first time that the difference balanced functions, which were used in literature mainly to construct sequences with good correlations, have been used to construct authentication codes.", "paper_title": "AUTHENTICATION CODES FROM DIFFERENCE BALANCED FUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000294809400012"}
