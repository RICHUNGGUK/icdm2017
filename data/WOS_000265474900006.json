The k-broadcast center of a graph is the set of vertices that can initiate a minimum time k-broadcast within the graph. We present a linear algorithm to determine the k-broadcast center of a given tree. From this, we obtain a linear time algorithm for finding the k-broadcast time of any vertex of the tree and, thus, the k-broadcast time of the tree itself. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
