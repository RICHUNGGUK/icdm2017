Both the sector-like nonlinearities and the norm-bounded uncertainties enter into the system in random ways, and such randomly occurring uncertainties and nonlinearities obey certain mutually uncorrelated Bernoulli random binary distribution laws. Sufficient computationally tractable linear matrix inequality-based conditions are established for the 2D nonlinear stochastic time-delay systems to be asymptotically stable in the mean-square sense, and then the explicit expression of the desired controller gains is derived. An illustrative example is provided to show the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Robust stabilisation of 2D state-delayed stochastic systems with randomly occurring uncertainties and nonlinearities", "paper_id": "WOS:000337363200009"}
