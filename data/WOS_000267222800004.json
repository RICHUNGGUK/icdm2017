This expansion is done by installing concentrators at the nodes and cables on the links of the network. The goal is to find a least cost capacity expansion strategy over a number of periods to satisfy the demand. A local search heuristic is first proposed to improve previously reported results on problem instances based on different cost and demand structures. This heuristic is then integrated into a genetic algorithm to obtain further improvements.", "paper_title": "Heuristics for multi-period capacity expansion in local telecommunications networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000267222800004"}
