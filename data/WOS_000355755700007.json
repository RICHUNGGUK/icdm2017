The method calculates maximally sparse current dipole magnitudes and directions via spatial l(0) regularization on a cortically-distributed source grid, while constraining the solution to be smooth with respect to time. We demonstrate the utility of this method on real and simulated data by comparison to existing methods.", "paper_title": "Spatially Sparse, Temporally Smooth MEG Via Vector l(0)", "paper_id": "WOS:000355755700007"}
