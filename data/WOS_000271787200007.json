The processing time of a job becomes known only upon its arrival. We give an improved lower bound 1 + alpha(m) on the competitive ratio, where alpha(m) is the positive solution of the equation alpha(2)(m) + m alpha(m) - 1 = 0, and establish a best possible online algorithm matching this lower bound. We also provide a new lower bound 3/2 on the competitive ratio for dense-algorithms, and present a best possible dense-algorithm matching this lower bound. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
