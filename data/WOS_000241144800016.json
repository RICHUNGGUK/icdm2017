Most of the efforts in data management in grids have been focused on data replication. Data replication is a practical and effective method to achieve efficient data access in grids. However all data replication schemes lack in providing a grid file system. One important challenge facing grid computing is the design of a grid file system. The Global Grid Forum defines a Grid File System as a human-readable resource namespace for management of heterogeneous distributed data resources, that can span across multiple autonomous administrative domains. This paper describes a new Grid File System according to the Global Grid Forum recommendations that integrates heterogeneous data storage resources in grids using standard grid technologies: GridFTP and the Resource Namespace Services, both defined by the Global Grid Forum. To obtain high performance, we apply the parallel I/O techniques used in traditional parallel file systems. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
