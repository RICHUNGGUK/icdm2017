We begin with an overview of supply chain management and the associated planning problems. Next, we formally define the production planning problem and explain why integration with scheduling leads to better solutions. We present the major modeling approaches for the integration of scheduling and planning decisions, and discuss the major solution strategies. We close with an account of the challenges and opportunities in this area. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
