The modeling is based on the Euler system where a non-conservative term is added to take the porosity variation into account. A detailed presentation of the scheme is given, the main point is the construction of non-conservative fluxes to reproduce the non-conservation aspect of the problem. We compare the numerical method with an exact solution of the Riemann problem and we check that the method preserves steady-state situations even if we use a discontinuous jump for the porosity. Finally, we present two simulations involving a two-dimensional gas flow. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
