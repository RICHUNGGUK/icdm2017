While the MIS renewal strategies vary depending upon the university programs, the redesign MIS major courses for all business majors can be a feasible approach to increasing the enrollment of MIS courses in the business programs where many business majors demand advanced information technology courses. This paper presents a case of redesign of the information systems analysis and design course for all business majors. It explains the motivation of redesign, the major consideration of redesign, and the implementation of redesign of this course. Our preliminary study for the assessment of the redesigned course has indicated that the information systems analysis and design course can be a valuable MIS elective course for all non-MIS majors.", "paper_title": "REDESIGNING THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS ANALYSIS AND DESIGN COURSE: CURRICULUM RENEWAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000343952500003"}
