A detailed analysis of the transistors used in the DETFF is carried out to determine the critical path. Therefore, the proposed DETFF employs low-V (th) transistors at critical paths such that the power-delay product as well as the large area consumption caused by the low-V (th) transistors can be resolved simultaneously. Therefore, the proposed DETFF fully utilizes the multi-V (th) scheme provided by advanced CMOS processes without suffering from a large area penalty, slow clock frequency, and poor noise immunity. The proposed design is implemented using a typical 0.18-mu m 1P6M CMOS process. The measurement results reveal that the proposed DETFF reduce the power-delay product by at lease 25% (i.e., dissipated energy).", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Double-Edge Triggered Flip-Flop", "paper_id": "WOS:000282051500008"}
