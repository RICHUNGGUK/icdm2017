According to the brittleness relation among the brittleness factors of dynamic quality characteristics (BFDQCs) in this model, a key man-machine-environment influencing factor identification method of dynamic quality characteristics was proposed by the definition of brittle risk degree, brittle coupling degree and brittle degree among BFDQCs. Finally, a case study for applicability was presented. The result showed that the proposed method was available, and can provide guidance for the analysis of dynamic quality characteristics and support for product reliability in complex manufacturing processes.", "paper_title": "Dynamic quality characteristics modelling based on brittleness theory in complex manufacturing processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000296272500004"}
