An accurate voice capacity estimation model considering these factors can greatly assist network designers. In the current work, we propose an analytical model to estimate voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) capacity over Wi-Fi networks addressing these issues. We employ widely used ITU-T E-model to assess voice quality and VoIP call capacity is presented in the form of an optimization problem with voice quality requirement as a constraint. In particular, we analyze delay and loss in channel access and queue, and their impacts on voice quality. The proposed capacity model is first developed for a single hop wireless local area network (WLAN) and then extended for multihop scenarios. To model real network scenario closely, we also consider channel noise and capture effect, and analyze the impacts of transmission range, interference range, and WLAN radius. In absence of any existing call capacity model that considers all the above factors concomitantly, our proposed model will be extremely useful to network designers and voice capacity planners.", "paper_title": "An Analytical Approach for Voice Capacity Estimation Over WiFi Network Using ITU-T E-Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000330245800007"}
