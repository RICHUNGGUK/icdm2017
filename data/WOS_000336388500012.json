The formal Analytical Software Design (ASD) approach of the company Verum has been incorporated into the industrial workflow. The commercial tool ASD:Suite supports both compositional verification and code generation for control components. For other components test-driven development has been used. We discuss the results of these combined techniques in a project which developed the power control service of an interventional X-ray system.", "paper_title": "Experiences with incorporating formal techniques into industrial practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000336388500012"}
