According to different cases, three kinds of continuous and bounded coordination controllers are proposed. With the use of hyperbolic tangent functions, a fundamental controller is presented for an ideal case. Accounting for unavailability of measurements of angular velocities, passive filters are applied to the velocity-free coordination controller design. When parametric uncertainty and external disturbances exist, by introducing some time-varying parameters in nonlinear saturation functions and constructing an adaptive parameter estimation term, a robust coordination controller is proposed. Barbalat's lemma is utilized properly for stability analysis of the closed-loop non-autonomous coordination systems. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.", "paper_title": "ROBUST ATTITUDE COORDINATION CONTROL OF FORMATION FLYING SPACECRAFT UNDER CONTROL INPUT SATURATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000292626900011"}
