One can produce the common hidden key using key agreement protocols; and this helps to have high security in modern data networks. Today, the designers of public key cryptography protocols try to set the public identity of a system's users (like their email addresses) as their public key. This not only makes a cryptographic protocol more efficient but also decreases its cost. These protocols are called \"identity - based\". In this article, an identity - based multiple key agreement scheme will be presented; this scheme uses the challenge - response method to do the verification. While the number of random values produced in our scheme is the same as other schemes, the number of keys generated in this scheme is much more than what many other key agreement schemes produce,. Therefore, we will have less computational complexities campered with other schems. In this paper, we consider the security of our scheme and consequently, we will show that it satisfies many security conditions such as strong security.", "paper_title": "Identity - Based Multiple Key Agreement Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000300515400008"}
