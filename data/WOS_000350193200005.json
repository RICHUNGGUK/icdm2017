In the case of such systems, Radio Resource Management (RRM) techniques are important to balance and optimize the radio resource usage among users of different systems sharing the same frequency band, avoiding the generation of co-channel interference. The paper will provide a concise description of representative RRM techniques used in different environment-aware radio system scenarios, analyzing the criteria that are assumed and the tradeoffs that have to be considered.", "paper_title": "Resource Management in Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000350193200005"}
