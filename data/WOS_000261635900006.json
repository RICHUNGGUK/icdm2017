To achieve this goal, different methods have been adopted in different blocks of a typical BCI system (i.e., in preprocessing, feature extraction, feature classification and feature selection blocks). Since BCI's speed plays a crucial role in its success in real-life applications, using mathematically simple techniques with accurate and reliable performance can improve this aspect of BCI systems design. Methods and materials: In this paper, a new method is introduced, which combines information from different classic time series similarity measures, using a simple fuzzy fusion framework. This method is accurate and reliable in P300 (a positive event-related component occurring 300 ms after stimulus onset) detection. This framework is used to combine two computationally simple signal detection methods: \"peak picking\" and \"template matching\". Fusion takes place in the last step (decision-making step) by means of a fuzzy rule-base. Results and conclusions: Compared to similar works on electroencephalogram-based (EEG-based) BCI datasets, in spite of being computationally simple, this new technique's performance is comparable to very complicated methods, like support vector machines.
