It is advantageous for real-world data analysis and finding relations among variables. Knowledge presentation and rule generation, based on a Bayesian approach, have been studied and reported in many research papers across various fields. Since a Bayesian network has both causal and probabilistic semantics, it is regarded as an ideal representation to combine background knowledge and real data. Rare event predictions have been performed using several methods, but remain a challenge. We design and implement a Bayesian network model to forecast daily ozone states. We evaluate the proposed Bayesian network model, comparing it to traditional decision tree models, to examine its utility. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
