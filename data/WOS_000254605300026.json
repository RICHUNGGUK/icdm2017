A self-reset search line scheme for the serial CAM is proposed to avoid the timing race problem and additional timing penalties. Various 32 entry CAMs are designed using 90 nm 1.2 V CMOS process to verify the proposed RFMSPC scheme. It shows that the RFMSPC saves power consumption by 40%, 53% and 63% at the cost of a 4%, 6% and 16% increase in search time according to 1. 2, and 4 serial CAM bits in a match line.", "paper_title": "Race-free mixed serial-parallel comparison for low power content addressable memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000254605300026"}
