We decompose a given surface into patches that are parameterized as elevation maps over planar domains and resampled on regular grids. The resulting shaped images are encoded using a state-of-the-art wavelet image coder. We show that our method is not only applicable to mesh- and point-based geometry, but also outperforms current surface encoders for both primitives.", "paper_title": "Image-based surface compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000259360200008"}
