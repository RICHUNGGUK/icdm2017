A luma-chroma demultiplexing algorithm is presented in detail, using a least-squares design methodology for the required bandpass filters. A systematic study of objective demosaicking performance and system complexity is carried out, and several system configurations are recommended. The method is compared with other benchmark algorithms in terms of CPSNR and S-CIELAB Delta E* objective quality measures and demosaicking speed. It was found to provide excellent performance and the best quality-speed tradeoff among the methods studied.", "paper_title": "Least-Squares Luma-Chroma Demultiplexing Algorithm for Bayer Demosaicking", "paper_id": "WOS:000291823600009"}
