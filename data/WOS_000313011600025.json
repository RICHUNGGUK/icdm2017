A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is first formulated to find the optimal solution which is useful for small-size problem instances. To solve medium-to large-size problem instances, a branch-and-bound algorithm incorporating with several dominance properties and a lower bound is then provided to derive the optimal solution. A simulated annealing heuristic algorithm incorporating with a heuristic procedure is developed to derive the near-optimal solutions for the problem. A computational experiment is also conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
