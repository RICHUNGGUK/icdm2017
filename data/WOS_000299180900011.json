We begin by establishing some basic properties of these matrices and polytopes. Then, we show that several families of integer polytopes in the literature-the cut, boolean quadric, multicut and clique partitioning polytopes-are faces of binary psd polytopes. Finally, we present some implications of these polyhedral relationships. In particular, we answer an open question in the literature on the max-cut problem, by showing that the rounded psd inequalities define a polytope.", "paper_title": "Binary positive semidefinite matrices and associated integer polytopes", "paper_id": "WOS:000299180900011"}
