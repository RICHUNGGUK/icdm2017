First, without considering process variations, a custom functional unit (CFU) is designed based on nominal timing parameters, then the timing variations of critical paths of the extensible processor, including the baseline processor and the CFU, are investigated by considering both systematic and random variations. Next, the maximum frequency of the extensible processor and the speed enhancement factor of the extended ISA for different benchmarks are investigated. Results show that timing variation could reduce the speedup of the extensible processor. However, this reduction is highly dependent on the baseline processor and the CFU structures. Additionally, the impact of process variations in the worst-case design approach is studied. Results show that the speedup of the extensible processor is reduced more than in the case when custom instructions (CIs) are selected without considering process variations. To study the impact of each variation type, speedup variations due to random and systematic variations are investigated separately. The study reveals that random variation has a similar effect on the CFU and the baseline processor, while the impact of systematic variation on the baseline processor is greater than the CFU.", "paper_title": "Impact of Process Variations on Speedup and Maximum Achievable Frequency of Extensible Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000335920500001"}
