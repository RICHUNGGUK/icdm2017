With the sensing technology of such networks large areas can be monitored and a comprehensive study of the environment be explored. Usually, handling wireless sensor networks requires prior knowledge about the technology and this represents a key issue for a first time user. This issue creates a limitation for a first time user's ability to explore the whole potential of the networks. A novel integration of wireless sensor networks technology with voice user interface technology is proposed and developed by the authors. This integration allows the creation of a new platform for developing innovative interactions between wireless sensor networks and the user regardless of their software skills. The interface is developed using the voice recognition features of the Center for Spoken Language Understanding (CSLU) toolkit to control a network of wireless sensors. The interaction between the user and sensor network is entirely through voice input. In addition, this work explores the use of voice controlled setup and management for sensor network deployment.", "paper_title": "Voice controlled wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000259841200001"}
