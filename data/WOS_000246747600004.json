The system collects up to 20 different spectral bands within a range that vary from 395 nm to 970 nm. The system is designed to acquire geometrically and chromatically corrected images in homogeneous and diffuse illumination, so images can be compared over time. The proposed segmentation algorithm combines the information provided by all the spectral bands to segment the different regions of interest. Three experiments are conducted to show the ability of the system to acquire highly precise, reproducible and standardized multi-spectral images and to show its applicabilities in different situations.
