In this scheme, the dealer need not send any secret information to participants. And the shared secret, the participant set and the access structure can be changed dynamically without updating any participant's secret shadow. The degree of the used Lagrange interpolation polynomial is only one, which makes the computational complexity of the proposed scheme very low. The proposed scheme has advantages over the existing schemes and thus provides great capabilities for many applications.", "paper_title": "A secure and efficient secret sharing scheme with general access structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000077"}
