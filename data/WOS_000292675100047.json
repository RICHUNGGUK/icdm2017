Then, the adsorption transition is analyzed in more detail. This is conveniently done by a microcanonical analysis of densities of states obtained by extensive multicanonical Monte Carlo simulations. For short chains and strong surface attraction, the microcanonical entropy turns out to be a convex function of energy in the transition regime. This is a characteristic physical effect and deserves a careful consideration in analyses of cooperative macrostate transitions in finite systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
