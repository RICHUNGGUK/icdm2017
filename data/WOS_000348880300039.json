While linear convergence proofs for the related (but different) SMO method intended for SVM training require that the kernel matrix be positive definite, no such assumption is needed in NPP for MDM. Moreover, we will also show linear convergence for the sequence of MDM vectors to the unique solution vector W* of NPP and for a quantity that measures the gap in the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Furthermore, even if there might be several multiplier representations for le, we will show that any MDM-generated multiplier sequence converges linearly to an optimal multiplier. This linear convergence is shown to be optimal and it is also numerically illustrated over six datasets. We will follow an approach that relies on a geometric point of view that yields a simple path to the proofs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
