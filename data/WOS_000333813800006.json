However, none of the existing schemes is flexible enough to adapt the sequence of faces visited by the constructed path. Thus, real-world constraints may severely impact the network performance. To address this problem, we extend planar graph routing to allow the algorithm to forward packets along a sequence of faces intersected by any arbitrary curve. We analytically prove that this extended scheme is loop free and allows for guaranteed delivery. Furthermore, we investigate schemes for choosing curves dealing with imperfections in the network.
