Specifically. we examine the effects of two governance mechanisms, expert-and community-governance, on content usage from two web pages. We draw upon the elaboration-likelihood model as the theoretical basis to postulate hypotheses for empirical testing. Data collected from student subjects through a web-based experiment show that credibility of a governance mechanism has a positive effect on individuals' use of content from web pages. while also influencing their perceptions of content quality. Research and practical implications of our findings are discussed.", "paper_title": "CONTENT USE FROM WEBSITES: EFFECTS OF GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000332130900008"}
