We specially focus on the heavy aggregation operators. We suggest some new extensions about the OWA operator such as the induced heavy OWA (IHOWA) operator, the uncertain heavy OWA (UHOWA) operator and the uncertain induced heavy OWA (UIHOWA) operator. For these three new extensions, we consider some of their main properties and a wide range of special cases found in the weighting vector such as the heavy weighted average (HWA) and the uncertain heavy weighted average (UHWA). We further generalize these models by using generalized and quasi-arithmetic means obtaining the generalized heavy weighted average (GHWA), the induced generalized HOWA (IGHOWA) and the uncertain IGHOWA (UIGHOWA) operator. Finally, we develop an application of the new approach in a decision-making problem. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
