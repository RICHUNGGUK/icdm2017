We consider three generalisations of DP. The first is iterated dynamic programming (IDP), where DP is used to recursively solve each of a sequence of one-dimensional problems in turn, to find a local optimum. A second algorithm is an empirical, stochastic optimiser, which is implemented by adding progressively less noise to IDP. The final approach replaces DP by a more computationally intensive Forward-Backward Gibbs Sampler, and uses a simulated annealing cooling schedule. Results are compared with existing pixel-by-pixel methods of iterated conditional modes (ICM) and simulated annealing in two applications: to restore a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image, and to warp a pulsed-field electrophoresis gel into alignment with a reference image. We find that IDP and its stochastic variant outperform the remaining algorithms.", "paper_title": "Two-dimensional generalisations of dynamic programming for image analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000262439800005"}
