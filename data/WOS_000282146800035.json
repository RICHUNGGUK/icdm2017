It introduces a new loss function definition, in which misclassification cost and cost of feature extraction are combined qualitatively and the loss is conditioned with current and estimated decisions as well as their consistency. This loss function definition is motivated with the following issues. First, for many applications, the relation between different types of costs can be expressed roughly and usually only in terms of ordinal relations, but not as a precise quantitative number. Second, the redundancy between features can be used to decrease the cost; it is possible not to consider a new feature if it is consistent with the existing ones. In this paper, we show the feasibility of the proposed framework for medical diagnosis problems. Our experiments demonstrate that this framework is efficient to significantly decrease feature extraction cost without decreasing accuracy. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
