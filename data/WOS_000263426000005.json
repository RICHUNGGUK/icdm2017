Task muddiness is meant to be inclusive and expendable in nature. The intelligence required to execute a task is measured by the composite muddiness of the task described by multiple muddiness factors. The composite muddiness explains why many challenging tasks are muddy and why autonomous mental development is necessary for muddy tasks. It facilitates better understanding of intelligence, what the human adult mind can do, and how to build a machine to acquire higher intelligence. The task-muddiness indicates a major reason why a higher biological mind is autonomously developed from autonomous, simple-to-complex experience. The paper also discusses some key concepts that are necessary for understanding the mind and intelligence, such as intelligence metrics, the mode a task is conveyed to the task executor, a human and a machine being a joint task performer in the traditional artificial intelligence (AI), a developmental agent (human or machine) being a sole task performer, and the need for autonomy in task-nonexplicit learning.", "paper_title": "Task Muddiness, Intelligence Metrics, and the Necessity of Autonomous Mental Development", "paper_id": "WOS:000263426000005"}
