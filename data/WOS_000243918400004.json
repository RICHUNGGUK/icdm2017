FMCN uses hyperbox fuzzy sets to represent the pattern classes. It is a supervised classification technique with new compensatory neuron architecture. The concept of compensatory neuron is inspired from the reflex system of human brain which takes over the control in hazardous conditions. Compensatory neurons (CNs) imitate this behavior by getting activated whenever a test sample falls in the overlapped regions amongst different classes. These neurons are capable to handle the hyperbox overlap and containment more efficiently. Simpson used contraction process based on the principle of minimal disturbance, to solve the problem of hyperbox overlaps. FMCN eliminates use of this process since it is found to be erroneous. FMCN is capable to learn the data online in a single pass through with reduced classification and gradation errors. One of the good features of FMCN is that its performance is less dependent on the initialization of expansion coefficient, i.e., maximum hyperbox size. The paper demonstrates the performance of FMCN by comparing it with fuzzy min-max neural network (FMNN) classifier and general fuzzy min-max neural network (GFMN) classifier, using several examples.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy min-max neural network classifier with compensatory neuron architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000243918400004"}
