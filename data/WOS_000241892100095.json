In this paper, we propose an improved codebook model to solve this problem. Instead of using the original quantization criterion, we quantize the temporal series of the observations at a given pixel into codewords based on the Gaussian distribution assumption. We have performed this approach in our surveillance system for outdoor scenes and achieved excellent detection results.", "paper_title": "Gaussian-based codebook model for video background subtraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100095"}
