This method applied linear GP to derive optimum geometry and sizing of discrete structure from an arbitrary initial design space. The linear GP was used to find out the optimum nodal locations and member sizing of the structure through a linear sequence of programming instructions. The nodal locations and member cross-sectional areas of the structure were used as the design variable for these instructions, with the optimal geometry and sizing obtained by evolving a population of GP individuals satisfying the optimisation design objective. The approach was applied to the benchmark example of ten-bar planar truss for verification. Other truss examples, including 18-bar planar truss and 25-bar space truss, were also used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. The optimum results obtained demonstrate the practicability and generality of using the proposed method in geometry and sizing optimisation problems.", "paper_title": "Geometry and sizing optimisation of discrete structure using the genetic programming method", "paper_id": "WOS:000242613000004"}
