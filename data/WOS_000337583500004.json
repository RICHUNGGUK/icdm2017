The derivate over each pair of atoms in the molecule is defined as G/S(vi,vj)=(fi-2fij+fj)/fij, where fi (or fj) and fij are the individual frequency of atom i (or j) and the reciprocal frequency of the atoms i and j, respectively. These frequencies characterize the participation intensity of atom pairs in S. Here, the event space is composed of molecular sub-graphs which participate in the formation of the G skeleton that could be complete (representing all possible connected sub-graphs) or comprised of sub-graphs of certain orders or types or combinations of these. The atom level graph derivative index, i, is expressed as a linear combination of all atom pair derivatives that include the atomic nuclei i. Global [total or local (group or atom-type)] indices are obtained by applying the so called invariants over a vector of i values. The novel MDs are validated using a data set of 28 alkyl-alcohols and other benchmark data sets proposed by the International Academy of Mathematical Chemistry. Also, the boiling point for the alcohols, the adrenergic blocking activity of N,N-dimethyl-2-halo-phenethylamines and physicochemical properties of polychlorinated biphenyls and octanes are modeled. These models exhibit satisfactory predictive power compared with other 0-3D indices implemented successfully by other researchers. In addition, tendencies of the proposed indices are investigated using examples of various types of molecular structures, including chain-lengthening, branching, heteroatoms-content, and multiple bonds. On the other hand, the relation of atom-based derivative indices with 17O NMR of a series of ethers and carbonyls reflects that the new MDs encode electronic, topological and steric information. Linear independence between the graph derivative indices and other 0-3D MDs is demonstrated by using principal component analysis on a dataset of 41 heterogeneous molecules. It is concluded that the graph derivative indices are independent indices containing important structural information to be used in QSPR/QSAR and drug design studies, and permit obtaining easier, more interpretable and robust mathematical models than the majority of those reported in the literature.", "paper_title": "Discrete Derivatives for Atom-Pairs as a Novel Graph-Theoretical Invariant for Generating New Molecular Descriptors: Orthogonality, Interpretation and QSARs/QSPRs on Benchmark Databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000337583500004"}
