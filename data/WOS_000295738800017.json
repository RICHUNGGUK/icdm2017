We show that when each link consists of D physical paths, the total spectral efficiency can grow linearly with K. This result holds not merely in the limit of large transmit power P, but for any fixed P, and is, therefore, a stronger characterization than degrees of freedom. It is achieved via a form of interference alignment in the time domain. A caveat of this result is that W must grow with K, a phenomenon we refer to as bandwidth scaling. Our insight comes from examining channels with single path links (D = 1), which we refer to as line-of-sight (LOS) links. For such channels, we build a time-indexed interference graph and associate the communication problem with finding its maximum independent set. This graph has a stationarity property that we exploit to solve the problem efficiently via dynamic programming. Additionally, the interference graph enables us to demonstrate the necessity of bandwidth scaling for any scheme operating over LOS interference channels. Bandwidth scaling is then shown to also be a necessary ingredient for interference alignment in the K-user interference channel.", "paper_title": "Interference Alignment for Line-of-Sight Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000295738800017"}
