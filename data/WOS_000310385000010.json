The techniques exploit the inherent redundancy of TCAM cells to allow for protection at lower cost. A fault detection technique with the cost of parity but with about the half probability of silent data corruption is proposed. This technique is then applied at both horizontal and vertical dimensions of the TCAM array, and a low cost error correction scheme is derived. Last, another error correction scheme is proposed, which employs a SECDED ECC of the half complexity, by making use of the TCAM redundancy, without compromising single bit error correction. The proposed schemes come with minimal area, power, and critical path overheads, in comparison with standard schemes, and they are good alternatives for TCAM arrays protection.", "paper_title": "Cost Effective Protection Techniques for TCAM Memory Arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000310385000010"}
