To aid patients in requesting self-referrals, we have developed and evaluated a web-based self-referral system in three specialty clinics at the University of Washington. Two clinics adopted the system for routine clinical use, while the third clinic decided not to. A major difference between these two groups was in how fast online requests from patients were handled, which significantly influenced patients' satisfaction. Clinic's preparedness for handling the temporarily increased workload due to the introduction of a new health information system played a role as well. Also, we noticed that the physician leadership/championship made a difference in the acceptance of our system.", "paper_title": "Factors Affecting Acceptance of a Web-Based Self-Referral System", "paper_id": "WOS:000288082200020"}
