Three different formulations are used for the implementation of the electromagnetic variables. The extended Continuity Vorticity Pressure (CVP) numerical variational method for MHD flows is used for the coupling of the momentum and the continuity equation. Results are obtained for different values of the curvature (0-0.2) and of the Hartmann number (0-1000). The magnitude of the axial velocity is determined by the balance of the centrifugal and the electromagnetic forces. The results reveal the limits of applicability of the used electromagnetic models as the Hartmann number increases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
