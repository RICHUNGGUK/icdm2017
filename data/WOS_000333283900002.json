This survey summarizes the state of the art on automatic recognition and generation of such movements. For both automatic recognition and generation, important aspects such as the movements analyzed, the affective state representation used, and the use of notation systems is discussed. The survey concludes with an outline of open problems and directions for future work.", "paper_title": "Body Movements for Affective Expression: A Survey of Automatic Recognition and Generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000333283900002"}
