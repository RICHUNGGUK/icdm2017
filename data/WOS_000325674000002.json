However, it is too expensive to verify the optimal condition. In this paper, some rules for reducing these problems are proposed and the relationship between minimal solutions and FRI paths is also given. These lead to a new algorithm for solving this kind of problems. Numerical experiments are presented for illustrating the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
