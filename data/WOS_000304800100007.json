The method uses a nonlinear approximation for both diffusive and advective fluxes that guarantee the positivity of the numerical solution. The approximation of the diffusive flux is based on nonlinear two-point approximation, and the approximation of the advective flux is based on the second-order upwind method with proper slope limiter. The second-order convergence rate for concentration and the monotonicity of the nonlinear finite volume method are verified with numerical experiments.
