Hazards are given in terms of 2D relief. To find the optimal 2D path minimizing the risk given constraints on flight time and velocity, the problem with the non-given boundary condition is transformed to the problem with the fixed flight time and the boundary problem solved numerically. The found 2D path is used to construct the polynomial approximation of the 3D path taking into account the local relief.", "paper_title": "Path planning for unmanned aerial vehicle under complicated conditions and hazards", "paper_id": "WOS:000303358200012"}
