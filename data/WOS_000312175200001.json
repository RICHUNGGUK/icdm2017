We give a deterministic algorithm that in time 2(m/2) poly(m.n) finds the number of closed trails in a given graph G with n vertices and m edges. Moreover, within the same time bound we can determine every possible vertex set of a closed trail in G, together with the associated number of closed trails. Our algorithm can be used to deterministically find the longest cycle in an n-vertex claw-free graph in time 2(n/2) poly(m.n) via a framework presented by Broersma et al.
