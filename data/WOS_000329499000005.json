We propose a scheme to realize particle weight calculation without the prior knowledge about the propagation parameters of the target's characteristic signal. With the use of the monotonic relationship of the distance and the received signal strength, we define the signal characteristic sequence and particle distance sequence and utilize the modified sequence distance between the signal characteristic sequence and the particle distance sequence as the criterion to calculate the particle weight blindly with simple lightweight operations. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
