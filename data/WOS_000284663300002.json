The new method is essentially based on the use of a laser beam and a web-cam. A digital filter parameters identification was studied for the laser line detection in the image. After this, a model for the reconstruction in real-time of the laser line in the space was developed. The first test rig was just conceived to validate the method: hence, no high resolution cameras were adopted. Nevertheless, the tests have showed encouraging results. Tests were made on both plane and non-plane surfaces. First of all, it was confirmed that it is possible to calibrate the intrinsic parameters of the video system, the position of the image plane and the laser plane in a given frame, all in the same time. Moreover the surface shapes were recognized and recorded with an appreciable accuracy. The tests also showed that the proposed method can be used for robotic applications, such as robotic kinematic calibration and 3D surfaces recognition and recording. For this last purpose, the test rig is fitted on a robot arm that permits to the scanner device to 'observe' the 3D object from different and known positions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
