From a video of a camera moving within a surface, we compute a mosaic representing the texture of that surface, flattened onto a planar image. Our approach works by defining a warp between images as a function of surface geometry and camera pose. Globally optimizing this warp to maximize alignment across all frames determines the camera trajectory, and the corresponding flattened mosaic image. In contrast to previous mosaicing methods which assume planar or distant scenes, or controlled camera motion, our approach enables mosaicing in cases where the camera moves unpredictably through proximal surfaces, such as in medical endoscopy applications.", "paper_title": "Rectified Surface Mosaics", "paper_id": "WOS:000270432200008"}
