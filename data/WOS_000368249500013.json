Design/methodology/approach - To clarify the relation of design variables, the optimization problem is classified into three general case. For each case, the respective treatment is suggested for coupled or uncoupled variables in the framework of the ICO. Findings - The decoupling treatment suggested in the ICO framework not only avoids the iteration divergence and thus optimization failure, but increases the optimal design space to some extent. The method is validated by optimizing an aircraft assembly and a high-speed train assembly. Originality/value - The two practical examples proves that the present ICO succeeds in solving the problem that the CCO failed to, also gives the optimal results better than those from the sequential optimization method.", "paper_title": "A collaborative optimization framework for parametric and parameter-free variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000368249500013"}
