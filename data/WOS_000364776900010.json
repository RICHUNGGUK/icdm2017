In an attempt to improve the usability and overall experience of user interactions during authentication, this paper proposes an alternative approach of personalizing user authentication tasks based on individual differences in cognitive processing. The presented approach is mainly driven by theories on individual differences in cognitive styles which argue that individuals recall and process textual and graphical information differently. In this realm, the paper presents a 4-month user study in which 153 participants interacted with a personalized user authentication mechanism in an ecological valid context. Analysis of results shows that the presented user authentication approach is a promising alternative to current state of user authentication practices.", "paper_title": "A Personalized User Authentication Approach Based on Individual Differences in Information Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000364776900010"}
