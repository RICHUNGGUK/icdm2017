The existence of symmetric property is investigated. We examine the relation between the structure of a discrete network and the spatio-temporally symmetric periodic dynamics it can support. We illustrate the existence of spatio-temporally periodic solutions through a direct construction of symmetric groups, and show that these solutions can be stable in some region of parameter space. We give computer simulations to support the theoretical predictions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
