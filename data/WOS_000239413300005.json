The distinct features of the framework include a modeling and specification language, dynamic model checking for completeness and consistency, automated code generation from the specification, simulation of different architectures with a template-based platform builder, service-oriented multi-agent simulation for easy re-configuration and re-composition, formal policy specification and enforcement for dynamic verification, and dynamic analyses for evaluation and monitoring. The framework and most of the tools reported in this paper have been implemented and applied in several industrial projects. This paper presents the design principles, user interfaces, its runtime infrastructure, and the experiment results on its performance. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
