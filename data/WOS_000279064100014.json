The model is derived from the kinetic theory which exhibits several features that distinguish it from other previous LBE models. First, the present thermal LBE model is derived from the continuous Boltzmann equation, which has a solid foundation and clear physical significance; Second, the model can recover the energy equation with the viscous dissipation term and work of pressure which are usually ignored by traditional methods and the existing thermal LBE models; Finally, unlike the existing thermal LBE models, no velocity and temperature gradients appear in the force terms which are easy to realize in the present model. The model is validated by thermal flow in a pipe, thermal buoyancy-driven flow, and swirling flow in vertical cylinder by rotating the top and bottom walls. It is found that the numerical results agreed excellently with analytical solution or other numerical results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
