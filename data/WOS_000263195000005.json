However, in many circumstances the above assumption does not match the peculiarities of real multi-agent societies where each agent plays a different role in the synchronization. To make up the restrictions of related work, this paper presents a non-flat synchronization model where the synchronization capacity of each agent is different regarding its social rank and strategy dominance. In the presented model, all agents are situated in a synchronization field where each agent can sense the collective synchronization forces from other agents; if some agents are more prominent than other ordinary agents (e.g., they have the dominance of social ranks or behavior strategies), they will have strong synchronization capacities in the field: and finally the collective synchronization results may incline to converge at such prominent agents' strategies, which is called prominence convergence in collective synchronization and can be proved by our theoretical analyses and experimental results.
