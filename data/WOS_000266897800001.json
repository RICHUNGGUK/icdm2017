As a preprocessing step, surface simplification is important and necessary for the subsequent operations and geometric processing. Owing to adaptive mean-shift clustering scheme, a curvature-aware adaptive re-sampling method is proposed for point-sampled geometry simplification. The generated sampling points are non-uniformly distributed and can account for the local geometric feature in a curvature aware manner, i.e. in the simplified model the sampling points are dense in the high Curvature regions, and sparse in the low curvature regions. The proposed method has been implemented and demonstrated by several examples. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
