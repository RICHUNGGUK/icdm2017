An intermediate virtual viewpoint image is typically synthesized using two pairs of transmitted texture and depth maps from two neighboring captured viewpoints via depth-image-based rendering (DIBR). Tomaintain high quality of synthesized images, it is imperative to contain the adverse effects of network packet losses that may arise during texture and depth video transmission. Towards this goal, we develop an integrated approach that exploits the representation redundancy inherent in the multiple streamed videos-a voxel in the 3D scene visible to two captured views is sampled and coded twice in the two views. In particular, at the receiver we first develop an error concealment strategy that adaptively blends corresponding pixels in the two captured views during DIBR, so that pixels from the more reliable transmitted view are weighted more heavily. We then couple it with a sender-side optimization of reference picture selection (RPS) during real-time video coding, so that blocks containing pixel samples of voxels that are visible in both views are more error-resiliently coded in one view only, given adaptive blending will mitigate errors in the other view. Further, synthesized view distortion sensitivities to texture versus depth errors are analyzed, so that relative importance of texture and depth code blocks can be computed for system-wide RPS optimization. Finally, quantization parameter (QP) is adaptively selected per frame, optimally trading off source distortion due to compression with channel distortion due to potential packet losses. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can outperform previous work by up to 2.9 dB at 5% packet loss rate.", "paper_title": "Loss-Resilient Coding of Texture and Depth for Free-Viewpoint Video Conferencing", "paper_id": "WOS:000333111500012"}
