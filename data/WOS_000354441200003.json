With these methods, moving objects in the scene are modeled as pixel-wised sparse outliers. However, in many practical scenarios, the distributions of these moving parts are not truly pixel-wised sparse but structurally sparse. Meanwhile a robust analysis mechanism is required to handle background regions or foreground movements with varying scales. Based on these two observations, we first introduce a class of structured sparsity-inducing norms to model moving objects in videos. In our approach, we regard the observed sequence as being constituted of two terms, a low-rank matrix (background) and a structured sparse outlier matrix (foreground). Next, in virtue of adaptive parameters for dynamic videos, we propose a saliency measurement to dynamically estimate the support of the foreground. Experiments on challenging well known data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and works effectively on a wide range of complex videos.", "paper_title": "Background Subtraction Based on Low-Rank and Structured Sparse Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000354441200003"}
