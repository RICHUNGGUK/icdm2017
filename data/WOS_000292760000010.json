We aim to establish a two-step filter to simplify the design of the distributed filter parameters by means of a 2-D Roessor model, such that the filtering error dynamics is asymptotically stable and the prescribed average H-infinity performance constraint is met. Consensus protocol is introduced as local information fusion strategy on nodes. In terms of certain linear matrix inequalities, sufficient conditions for the solvability of the addressed problem are obtained. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed design approach.", "paper_title": "Distributed H-infinity filtering with consensus in sensor networks: a two-dimensional system-based approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000292760000010"}
