The AB model is used to derive an amended objective function model with a membership function for signal cognitive optimization. Next, a modified hill climbing algorithm is proposed to strengthen the adaptive ability of intersections for disturbed traffic flow. At the same time, the probability of searching the globally optimal solutions is improved in the cognitive process. Finally, simulation results verify the applicability of the optimized AB model and the effectiveness of the improved hill climbing algorithm compared with conventional fixed-time control.", "paper_title": "An Arterial Traffic Signal Control System Based on a Novel Intersections Model and Improved Hill Climbing Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000357695700005"}
