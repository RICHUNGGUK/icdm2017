Recently, offloading computation workload to the cloud has become a promising solution to enhance both performance and battery life of smart phones. However, it also consumes both time and energy to upload data or programs to the cloud and retrieve the results from the cloud. In this paper, we develop an offloading framework, named Ternary Decision Maker (TDM), which aims to shorten response time and reduce energy consumption at the same time. Unlike previous works, our targets of execution include an on-board CPU, an on-board GPU, and a cloud, all of which combined provide a more flexible execution environment for mobile applications. We conducted a real-world application, i.e., matrix multiplication, in order to evaluate the performance of TDM. According to our experimental results, TDM has less false offloading decision rate than existing methods. In addition, by offloading modules, our method can achieve, at most, 75% savings in execution time and 56% in battery usage.", "paper_title": "Time-and-Energy-Aware Computation Offloading in Handheld Devices to Coprocessors and Clouds", "paper_id": "WOS:000355211600008"}
