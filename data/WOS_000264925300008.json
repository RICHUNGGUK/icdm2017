We present the proof of several properties of these processes, such as the spectral density function expression and its behavior near the seasonal frequencies, the stationarity, the intermediate and long memory characteristics, the auto-covariance function and its asymptotic expression. We also investigate the ergodicity and we present necessary and sufficient conditions for the causality and the invertibility properties of SARFIMA processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
