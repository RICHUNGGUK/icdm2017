These stents made of poly-L-lactic acid cause a very subtle acoustic shadow ( compared to the metallic ones) making difficult the automatic detection and measurements in images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on a cascade of GentleBoost classifiers to detect the stent struts using structural features to code the information of the different subregions of the struts. A stochastic gradient descent method is applied to optimize the overall performance of the detector. Validation results of struts detection are very encouraging with an average F-measure of 81%.", "paper_title": "Automatic Detection of Bioabsorbable Coronary Stents in IVUS Images Using a Cascade of Classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000275666100042"}
