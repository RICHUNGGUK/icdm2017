We focus our study on the medium-motion videos with QCIF, CIF, and VGA resolutions, the most pervasive video formats used by video conferencing applications across the Internet and cellular telephony systems. Using subjective tests for measuring the level of video quality perceived by end users, we expose the relation between the main influential video parameters and the quality experienced by end users. Furthermore, after investigating the effect of different frame rates and compression levels on video streaming bit rate, and consequently on QoE, we propose a QoE control mechanism for limited-bandwidth situations. A congestion control technique is also introduced in this paper and used in simulations for verifying the efficiency of the proposed QoE management algorithm and to implement this algorithm for practical applications.
