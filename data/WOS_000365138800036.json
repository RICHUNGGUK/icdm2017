In this paper, we propose a new outranking method called Prioritized PROMETHEE (P-PROMETHEE) method, which is used to deal with the ranking problem of Prioritized Multiple Criteria Decision Making (PMCDM). First, we use the idea of entropy to get the information of each criterion in the same prioritized level, which is used to get the weight of each criterion. Then, we use the weighted average operator to aggregate all the criteria in the same prioritized level. Moreover, we apply Yager's prioritized measure-guided aggregation operator to the classical PROMETHEE method to get the P-PROMETHEE method. Finally, we give a practical example to illustrate the effectiveness of the P-PROMETHEE method.", "paper_title": "A new prioritized multi-criteria outranking method: The prioritized PROMETHEE", "paper_id": "WOS:000365138800036"}
