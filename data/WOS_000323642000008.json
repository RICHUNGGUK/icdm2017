Experimental results confirm that these behaviors are indeed effective for the automatic detection of Extraversion. The main findings of our study are that: 1) Speaking time and (some forms of) social gaze are effective indicators of Extraversion, 2) classification accuracy is affected by the amount of time for which meeting behavior is observed, 3) independently considering only the attention received by the target from peers is insufficient, and 4) distribution of social attention of peers plays a crucial role.", "paper_title": "Connecting Meeting Behavior with Extraversion-A Systematic Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000323642000008"}
