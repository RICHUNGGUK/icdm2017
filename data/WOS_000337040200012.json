By exploring the rich interaction information provided by high-throughput data, the dynamical network biomarker (DNB) can identify the pre-disease state, but this requires multiple samples to reach a correct diagnosis for one individual, thereby restricting its clinical application. Results: In this article, we have developed a novel computational approach based on the DNB theory and differential distributions between the expressions of DNB and non-DNB molecules, which can detect the pre-disease state reliably even from a single sample taken from one individual, by compensating insufficient samples with existing datasets from population studies. Our approach has been validated by the successful identification of pre-disease samples from subjects or individuals before the emergence of disease symptoms for acute lung injury, influenza and breast cancer.", "paper_title": "Identifying critical transitions of complex diseases based on a single sample", "paper_id": "WOS:000337040200012"}
