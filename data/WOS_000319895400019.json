Important statistical parameters related to path loss, delay, and amplitude characteristics are extracted. Impact of different antenna heights on path loss exponent is investigated. The same measurement procedure is performed to extract the statistical characteristics of a university building due to the structural similarities between the two environments since both include long hallways, crosscuts, and turns. Based on the results, a comparative analysis is presented along with concluding remarks and future directions. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
