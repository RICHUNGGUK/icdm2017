Wide-area measurement system (WAMS), which builds upon PMUs and fast communication links, is consequently emerging as an advanced monitoring and control infrastructure. Rapid adaptation of such devices and technologies has led the researchers to investigate multitude of challenges and pursue opportunities in synchrophasor measurement technology, PMU structural design, PMU placement, miscellaneous applications of PMU from local perspectives, and various WAMS functionalities from the system perspective. Relevant research articles appeared in the IEEE and lET publications from 1983 through 2014 are rigorously surveyed in this paper to represent a panorama of research progress lines. This bibliography will aid academic researchers and practicing engineers in adopting appropriate topics and will stimulate utilities toward development and implementation of software packages.", "paper_title": "Synchrophasor Measurement Technology in Power Systems: Panorama and State-of-the-Art", "paper_id": "WOS:000209653800120"}
