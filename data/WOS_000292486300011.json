The various methods consist of the standard Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) method with 19 (BGK19) and 27 (BGK27) discrete velocities, the multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) model with 19 discrete velocities and the cascaded Lattice-Boltzmann method (CLB). Based on the findings of turbulent channel flow it can be concluded that stability considerations, predicting the superiority of the advanced moment based schemes like the CLB and MRT method not necessarily hold for wall-bounded turbulent flows. Moreover, in some flow problems the simple BGK method with 19 discrete velocities delivers reasonable and stable results, where the other methods yield unphysical solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
