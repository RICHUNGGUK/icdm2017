The model in AFENA is validated against existing laboratory test data of normally consolidated soil. The bearing capacities of spudcans in soils with isotropic and anisotropic strengths are compared. Soil with isotropic strength is simulated using an elasto-plastic model. It is found that the bearing capacity of a spudcan in an anisotropic soil is reduced by about 9% for a rough spudcan and 3% for a smooth spudcan on average. There is a combined effect of soil anisotropy and spudcan roughness on the spudcan bearing capacity. Moreover, the effect of the pressuremeter strength of an anisotropic soil on foundation capacity can't be ignored. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
