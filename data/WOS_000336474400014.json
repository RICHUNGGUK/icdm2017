This technique consists of two stages, known as indexing and searching. For an accurate match at the time of searching, it has proposed a fixed length feature vector built from each minutia, known as Minutia Binary Pattern. Unlike any existing geometric based indexing technique, the proposed technique inserts each minutia along with the feature vector exactly once into a hash table. As a result, it reduces both computational and memory costs. Since minutiae of all fingerprint images in the database are found to be well distributed into the hash table, no rehashing is required. Experiments over FVC 2004 datasets prove the superiority of the proposed indexing technique against well known geometric based indexing techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
