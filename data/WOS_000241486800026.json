The object model is derived from the local features extracted and tracked on an image sequence of the object. The recognition phase is based on an SVM classifier. We analyse in depth all the crucial steps of the method, and report very promising results on a dataset of 11 objects, that show how the method is also tolerant to occlusions and moderate scene clutter.", "paper_title": "Analysis on a local approach to 3D object recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241486800026"}
