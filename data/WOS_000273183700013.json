For effective utilization of the developed system, a novel direct current controlled PWM scheme is designed and implemented to produce the desired dynamic speed characteristic. In comparison to conventional asymmetric converter topology, it can minimize entire system costs by reducing numbers of power semiconductors. Therefore. it may open up investigation of a new way for SRM to compete with other ac motors such as induction motors, brushless dc motors, etc. The validity of the proposed method is verified through theoretical explanation and experimental results.
