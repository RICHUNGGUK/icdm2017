Our method keeps the 3D boundary representation model information during the whole parallel 3D Delaunay triangulation process running on parallel computers so that the solid model information can be accessed dynamically and the meshing results can be very approaching to the model boundary with the increase of meshing scale. The model is coarsely meshed at first and distributed on CPUs with consistent partitioned shared interfaces and partitioned model boundary meshes across processors. The domain partition aims at minimizing the edge-cuts across different processors for minimum communication cost and distributing roughly equal number of mesh vertices for load balance. Then a parallel multi-scale surface mesh refinement phase is iteratively performed to meet the mesh density criteria followed by a parallel surface mesh optimization phase moving vertices to the model boundary so as to fit model geometry feature dynamically. A dynamic load balancing algorithm is performed to change the partition interfaces if necessary. A 3D local non-Delaunay mesh repair algorithm is finally done on the shared interfaces across processors and model boundaries. The experimental results demonstrate our method can achieve high parallel performance and perfect scalability, at the same time preserve model boundary feature and generate high quality 3D Delaunay mesh as well.
