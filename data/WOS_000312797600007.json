Maintaining optimal glycemic control is critical for minimizing associated long-term complications and achieving better quality of life. Effective diabetes self-management education is one key component to enhance diabetes clients' self-management capabilities. The research team established a \"Caring for Yourself-Managing Your Diabetes\" Web site, which contained 35 video clips about diabetes management. The aim of this study was to evaluate user satisfaction with the Web-based diabetes self-management education program. A convenience sample of 100 diabetes clients (mean age, 61.5 [SD, 10.7] years) was invited to view one of the video clips via a laptop computer. A modified version of the Computer-Aided Learning Evaluation Questionnaire and the End-User Computing Satisfaction Questionnaire was used to evaluate participants' satisfaction with the program. The results indicate that participants were satisfied with the format, content, and accuracy of the Web-based diabetes education program. Some participants suggested adding different types of exercises that are specific to the needs of client groups and more explanation of diabetes medications. The results of this study support the use of computer-assisted learning as a promising method for delivering diabetes self-management education, which is satisfactory to diabetes clients.", "paper_title": "An Evaluation of a Web-Based Diabetes Education Program Designed to Enhance Self-management Among Patients Living With Diabetes", "paper_id": "WOS:000312797600007"}
