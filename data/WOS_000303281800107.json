However, a lacuna still remains in the literature as to systematic design of convergent product concepts (CPCs) based on functionality. This study proposes a systematic approach to design of CPCs based on online community information using data mining techniques. At the heart of the suggested approach is the combined use of association rule mining (ARM) and decision tree (DT) for discovering the significant relationships among items and detecting the meaningful conditions of items. Specifically, the proposed approach is composed of four steps: data collection and transformation, definition of target functions, identification of critical product features, and specification of design details. Three maps - function co-preferences map, feature relations map, and concepts specification map - are developed to aid decision making in design of CPCs, structuring and visualizing design implications. A case of the portable multimedia player (PMP) is presented to illustrate the proposed approach. We believe that our approach can reduce uncertainty and risk involved in the concept design stage.
