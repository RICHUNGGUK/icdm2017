In this paper, we propose two new basic operations over HFSs, which are the subtraction operation and the division operation. Several operational laws of these two operations over HFSs are given. The relationship between intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) and HFS is further verified in terms of these two operations. In addition, the relationships between these two operations are also established in this paper. The operations can be immediately extended into interval-valued hesitant fuzzy sets and dual hesitant fuzzy sets. The subtraction and division operations are significantly important in forming the integral theoretical framework of HFS and may have many practical applications in decision making.", "paper_title": "Subtraction and division operations over hesitant fuzzy sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000340435700006"}
