These features are classified by Artificial Neural Network or Support Vector Machine. Experiments are performed on visible and near-IR spectrum images derived from FRGC and MBGC datasets. For 4232 FRGC images of 404 subjects, we obtain baseline gender and ethnicity classifications of 97.3% and 94%. For 350 MBGC images of 60 subjects, we obtain baseline gender and ethnicity results of 90% and 89%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
