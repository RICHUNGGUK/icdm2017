Flows around the Silsoe Cube, a high-rise building (the Jin Mao Tower), and a low-rise large-span building (the Pudong International Airport) are computed with the Navier Stokes solver FENSAP and compared with measurements. Computations are carried out for two wind directions, by solving the steady-state ensemble-averaged Navier Stokes equations with the Spalart Allmaras one-equation turbulence model. Pressure coefficients compare well with wind tunnel experiments and the accuracy of the flow solutions is further improved via an automatic mesh adaptation that dynamically places grid points where the flow physics require them, while keeping the number of unknowns and solution time substantially at the same level.
