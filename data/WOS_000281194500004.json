The method can help humans to understand large data streams, such as the amounts of GPS data recorded by a variety of sensors in mobile phones, cars, etc. We describe the knowledge representations we designed for our method and the main components of our method for generating the summaries: a discourse planner, an abstraction module and a text generator. We also present evaluation results that show the ability of our method to generate certain types of geospatial and temporal descriptions.", "paper_title": "A KNOWLEDGE-BASED METHOD FOR GENERATING SUMMARIES OF SPATIAL MOVEMENT IN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281194500004"}
