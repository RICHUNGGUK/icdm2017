The effectiveness of the hybrid instruction in regard to students' achievement, knowledge retention, attitudes towards the subject, and course satisfaction was evaluated in comparison to traditional classroom instruction. Experimental study with pre-test, post-test control group design was carried out. The sample of the study consisted of 50 university students enrolled in \"Computer Networks and Communication\" course. The control and experimental groups composed of 24 and 26 students respectively, and the experiment lasted 14 weeks. The findings of the study indicated no significant difference between the hybrid course and the traditional course in students' achievement, knowledge retention, satisfaction, and attitude.
