In this paper, we present three different wavelet shrinkage methods, namely NeighShrink, NeighSure and NeighLevel. NeighShrink thresholds the wavelet coefficients based on Donoho's universal threshold and the sum of the squares of all the wavelet coefficients within a neighborhood window. NeighSure adopts Stein's unbiased risk estimator ( SURE) instead of the universal threshold of NeighShrink so as to obtain the optimal threshold with minimum risk for each subband. NeighLevel uses parent coefficients in a coarser level as well as neighbors in the same subband. We also apply a multiplying factor for the optimal universal threshold in order to get better denoising results. We found that the value of the constant is about the same for different kinds and sizes of images. Experimental results show that our methods give comparatively higher peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), are much more efficient and have less visual artifacts compared to other methods.", "paper_title": "IMAGE DENOISING BASED ON WAVELET SHRINKAGE USING NEIGHBOR AND LEVEL DEPENDENCY", "paper_id": "WOS:000266352000004"}
