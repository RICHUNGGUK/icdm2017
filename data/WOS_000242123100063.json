These include the ability to communicate, cooperate, collaborate and the need to be coordinated. This paper presents an overview of two of these social abilities, that of being coordination and cooperation. The discussion develops the theory of each and derives the current definitions. The definitions will then be linked into a single multi-agent system (MAS) model, Agent Coordination and Cooperation Cycle Model. This shows a cognitive loop that replicates the link between coordination and cooperation in systems such as organizations, management and biological systems. This paper will also present the advantages, consequences and challenges associated with the implementation of Agent Coordination and Cooperation Cognitive Model (AC(3)M) within intelligent multi-agent systems.", "paper_title": "An overview of agent coordination and cooperation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100063"}
