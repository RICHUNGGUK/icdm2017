As computer technology continues to improve, smartphones keep getting smaller, mobile processing power continues to significantly increase, and dual-or quad-core processors are becoming more popular. This has created an increase in the availability of software on small portable devices that cannot only take photos, but also edit them directly on the device, including the use of the copy-paste feature. In this paper, we present the copy-cover image forgery detection that can be used to identify a photo, whether it was altered by copying a portion of the image over another portion of itself. We also extend the detection in parallel processing by utilizing a computer with multiple CPU cores and parallel enhancements to the algorithm. Experimental results show there are significant improvements in performance by taking advantage of parallelism. Changing the detection routines in parallel can scale and take advantage of computing hardware equipped with multiple processors and large amounts of memory.", "paper_title": "Copy-Cover Image Forgery Detection in Parallel Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000365890200007"}
