The algorithm combines generalized pairwise interchange neighborhoods, dynasearch optimization and a new machine-based neighborhood whose size is non-polynomial in the number of machines. The computational results significantly improve over the current state of the art for this problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
