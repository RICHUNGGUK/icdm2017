Based on an extensive literature review, this article analyses the factors which have influenced managers' choice of source preferences. The review reveals four key dimensions used to study source preferences, i.e. contextual, situational, personal/sociocultural, and informational and identifies common factors under each. The factors given main weight in the literature are accessibility, quality, and richness of the information, as well as individual and institutional characteristics. The article also reflects on the data collection techniques used in information needs studies.", "paper_title": "Transformation in managers' information seeking behaviour: a review of the literature", "paper_id": "WOS:000241280300008"}
