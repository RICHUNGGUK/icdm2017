In this paper a comparative analysis of eight different relevant technical proposals, which place great importance on the establishing of security requirements in the development of IS, is carried out. And they provide some significant contributions in aspects related to security. These can serve as a basis for new methodologies or as extensions to existing ones. Nevertheless, they only satisfy partly the necessary criteria for the establishment of security requirements, with guarantees and integration in the development of IS. Thus we conclude that they are not specific enough for dealing with security requirements in the first stages of software development in a systematic and intuitive way, though parts of the proposals, if taken as complementary measures, can be used in that manner.", "paper_title": "A comparative study of proposals for establishing security requirements for the development of secure information systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300109"}
