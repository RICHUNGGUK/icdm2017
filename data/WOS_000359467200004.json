When a large-scale disaster occurred, the current communication system might be fragile and the server based network service might be unavailable due to the damages, network congestions, and power failure, etc. In this paper, we proposed an ICN based Disaster Information Sharing Service (DISS) [1], [2] system. DISS could provide robust information sharing service. Users could publish disaster information as a content message with the help of our DISS. In addition, by utilizing DISS's message naming strategy, users could retrieve disaster information even without a server connection. The ICN based DISS could reduce the probability of network congestion when a large number of simultaneous connections occurring. It could provide server-less service in poor network condition. DISS allows users retrieve disaster information from terminals or ICN nodes. During disasters, sharing information timely and effective could protect people from disaster, ensure people's safety.", "paper_title": "Information Centric Networking for Disaster Information Sharing Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000359467200004"}
