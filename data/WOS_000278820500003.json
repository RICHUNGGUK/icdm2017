This contribution deals with efficient computer implementation of the coupled analysis and attention is also devoted to domain decomposition methods which enable utilisation of parallel computers. The parallel processing leads to very good speedup and it also enables to solve significantly large problems in acceptable time. The proposed strategy is demonstrated on a coupled analysis of an existing reactor vessel. (C) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
