A noise pattern belongs to a class that we have either seen or not seen before. In the former case, the difficulty lies in the fact that some types of noise patterns look similar to certain characters or parts of characters. In the latter case, we do not know the class of noise in advance which excludes the possibility of using parametric learning methods. In order to address these difficulties, we formulate the noise removal and recognition as a single optimization problem, which can be solved by expectation maximization given that we have a recognition engine that is trained for clean images. We show that the processing time for a noisy input is higher than that of a clean input by a factor of two times the number of connected components of the input image in each iteration of the optimization process. Therefore, in order to speed up the convergence, we propose to use fuzzy inference systems in the initialization step of the optimization process. Fuzzy inference systems are based on linguistic rules that facilitate the definition of some common classes of noise patterns in handwritten images such as impulsive noise and background lines. We analyze the performance of our approach both in terms of recognition rate and speed. Our experimental results on a database of real-world handwritten images corroborate the effectiveness and feasibility of our approach in removing noise patterns and thus improving the recognition performance for noisy images.
