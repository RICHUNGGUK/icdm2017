But it is hardly considered in scheduling problems. In this paper, autonomous and induced learning are both taken into consideration. The investment of induced learning is interpreted as specialized time intervals to implement training, knowledge sharing and transferring etc. We present algorithms to determine jointly the optimal job sequence and the optimal position of Induced learning intervals, with the objective of minimizing makespan.
