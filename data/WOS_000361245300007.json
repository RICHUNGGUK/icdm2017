This paper addresses the problem of answering these so-called why-not questions in similar graph matching for graph databases. Given a set of answer graphs of an initial query graph q and a set of missing (why-not) graphs, we aim to modify q into a new query graph q* such that the missing graphs are included in the new answer set of q*. We present an approximate solution to address the above as the optimal solution is NP-hard to compute. In our approach, we first compute the bounded search space and the distance to be minimized for q*. Then, we present a two-phase algorithm to find the new query q*. In the first phase, we generate a set of candidate edges to be added/deleted into/from the initial query q within the bounded search space and in the second phase, we select a subset of candidate edges generated in the first phase to minimize the distance for q*. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach by conducting extensive experiments on two real datasets.", "paper_title": "Efficient Answering of Why-Not Questions in Similar Graph Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000361245300007"}
