There appears to be an at least implicit belief in the programming languages community that partial approaches based on type systems or other static analysis techniques are necessary for noninterference analyses to be tractable. In this paper we show that this belief is not necessarily true. We focus on the notion of strong low bisimulation proposed by Sabelfeld and Sands. We show that, relative to a decidable expression theory, strong low bisimulation is decidable for a simple parallel while-language, and we give a sound and relatively complete proof system for deriving noninterference assertions. The completeness proof provides an effective proof search strategy. Moreover, we show that common alternative noninterference relations based on traces or input-output relations are undecidable. The first part of the paper is cast in terms of multi-level security. In the second part of the paper we generalize the setting to accommodate a form of intransitive interference. We discuss the model and show how the decidability and proof system results generalize to this richer setting.", "paper_title": "Decidability and proof systems for language-based noninterference relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000235615800008"}
