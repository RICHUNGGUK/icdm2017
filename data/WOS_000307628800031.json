Our works, as a complement to previous research, investigate tacit knowledge integration based on social networks from transactive memory systems (TMS) perspective. We focus on ties dimension (expressive tie, instrumental tie, and tie strength) and nodes dimension (value similarity), and study the mechanism of social networks on tacit knowledge integration with TMS lens. The explorative results provide that: TMS has significant and positive effect on tacit knowledge integration directly; expressive tie, tie strength and value similarity have significant and positive impact on TMS directly; instrumental tie has no significant effect on TMS, but has negative impact on tacit knowledge integration directly.", "paper_title": "A STUDY ON THE MECHANISM OF TACIT KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION: THE ROLE OF SOCIAL TIES AND TRANSACTIVE MEMORY SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000307628800031"}
