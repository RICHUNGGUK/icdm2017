LACs are defined in terms of definite integrals, and adaptive Gaussian quadrature can be used to obtain curve segments. To date, these integrals have only been evaluated analytically for restricted values (0, 1, 2) of the shape parameter alpha. We present parametric equations expressed in terms of incomplete gamma functions, which allow us to find an exact analytic representation of a curve segment for any real value of alpha. The computation time for generating an LAC segment using the incomplete gamma functions is up to 13 times faster than using direct numerical integration. Our equations are generalizations of the well-known Cornu, Nielsen, and logarithmic spirals, and involutes of a circle. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
