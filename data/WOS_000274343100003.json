The aim of the work presented here is to provide a solution to the problem of recognition and detection of human behaviours inside ubiquitous environments by using a neural-network driven embedded agent working with online, real-time data from a network of unobtrusive low-level sensors. The final objective of this system was to classify a 'normal' pattern of activities, and sense deviations from it, which could be employed for home care applications.", "paper_title": "Detection Of Normal and Novel Behaviours In Ubiquitous Domestic Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000274343100003"}
