The time splitting combines a projection method in the fluid with a specific Robin-Neumann treatment of the interface coupling. A priori energy estimates guaranteeing unconditional stability are established for some of the schemes. The accuracy and performance of the methods proposed are illustrated by a thorough numerical study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
