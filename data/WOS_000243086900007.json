The class of hybrid systems dealt with consists of, in general, coupled continuous-time and digital systems subject to state perturbations whose nominal (i.e., unperturbed) pans are linear and time-varying, in general. The obtained sufficient conditions on robust stability are dependent on the values of the parameters defining the over-bounding functions of the uncertainties and the weakness of the coupling between the analog, and digital sub-states provided that the corresponding uncoupled nominal subsystems are both exponentially stable.", "paper_title": "A note about total stability of a class of hybrid systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243086900007"}
