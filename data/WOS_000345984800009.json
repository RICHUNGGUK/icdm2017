To avoid the binding update storm and to support route optimization as well as intra-domain data communication, a specifically designed solution with a distributed manner is proposed in this paper. By applying the derived analytical results, we demonstrate that the proposed solution is able to significantly outperform the closely related work in the literature.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Route optimization using the distributed binding update for nested mobile networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345984800009"}
