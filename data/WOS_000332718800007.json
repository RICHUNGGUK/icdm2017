The optimum design is posed as single-objective optimization problem in presence of constraints formulated in accordance with the current European building code. The design variables include geometrical dimensions that define the shape of the cross section and the amount of prestressing steel. A special (mu + lambda)-constrained differential evolution method is performed in order to solve the optimization problem. Its search mechanism depends on several mutation strategies whereas an archiving-based adaptive tradeoff model is in charge of selecting a specific constraint-handling technique. Finally, numerical examples are included to illustrate the application of the presented approach.", "paper_title": "Optimum design of prestressed concrete beams using constrained differential evolution algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000332718800007"}
