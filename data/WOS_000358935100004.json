Such proofs do not allow any simulation errors, and therefore techniques from the study of statistical zero-knowledge ( where a small error is allowed) do not apply to them. We introduce a new error shifting technique for building perfect simulators. Using this technique we give the first complete problem for the class of problems admitting non-interactive perfect zero-knowledge (NIPZK) proofs, a hard problem for the class of problems admitting public-coin PZK proofs, and other applications.", "paper_title": "How to Achieve Perfect Simulation and a Complete Problem for Non-interactive Perfect Zero-Knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000358935100004"}
