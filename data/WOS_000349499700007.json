For an l-connected graph Gamma and an integer k with 1 <= k <= 1, the rainbow k-connection number of Gamma is the minimum number of colors required to color the edges of Gamma such that any two distinct vertices of Gamma are connected by k internally disjoint rainbow paths. In this paper, a method is provided for bounding the rainbow 2-connection numbers of graphs with certain structural properties. Using this method; we consider the rainbow 2-connection numbers of Cayley graphs, especially, those defined on abelian groups and dihedral groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
