We characterize the Lukasiewicz-transitive and product-transitive members of this family. Their importance derives from their one-to-one correspondence with pseudo-metrics. Fuzzification schemes based on a commutative quasi-copula are then used to transform these similarity measures for ordinary sets into similarity measures for fuzzy sets, rendering them applicable on graded feature set representations of objects. The main result of this paper is that transitivity, and hence also the corresponding dual metric interpretation, is preserved along this fuzzification process. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
