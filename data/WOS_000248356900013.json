Compared to existing methods, our approach is simpler and more advantageous in eliminating visual seams that may exist in each tile of the existing methods, especially when the samples have elaborate features or distinct colors. Texture tiles generated by our approach can be regarded as single-colored tiles on each orthogonal direction border, which are easier for tiling and more suitable for sentence tiling. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Real-time texture synthesis using s-tile set", "paper_id": "WOS:000248356900013"}
