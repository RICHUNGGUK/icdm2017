The elastic soil underneath the beams is treated as a continuum, characterized by spatially random Young's modulus and constant Poisson's ratio. The randomness of the soil Young's modulus is modeled using a two-dimensional non-Gaussian, homogeneous random field. The beam geometry and Young's modulus are assumed to be deterministic. The total potential energy of the beam-soil system is minimized, and the governing differential equations and boundary conditions describing the equilibrium configuration of the system are obtained using the variational principles of mechanics. The differential equations are solved using the finite element and finite difference methods to obtain the beam and soil displacements. Four different beam lengths, representing moderately short, moderately long and long beams are analyzed for beam deflection, differential settlement, bending moment and beam shear force. The statistics of the beam responses are investigated using Monte Carlo simulations for different beam-soil modulus ratios and for different variances and scales of fluctuations of the soil Young's modulus. Suggestions regarding the use of the analysis in design are made. A novelty in the analysis is that the two-dimensional random heterogeneity of soil is taken into account without the use of traditional two-dimensional numerical methods, which makes the new approach computationally efficient.
