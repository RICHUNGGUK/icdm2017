We also propose dynamic parameters to make the model more practical for real life social network. Subsequently, the simulations are conducted based on the small-world network and its characteristics, and the parameters in the model are analyzed to increase efficiently the power of information distribution. Our study and simulation results show that the proposed model can be used to analyze and predict the effectiveness of information distribution, Moreover, the study also shows how to use the model parameters to increase power of the distribution.", "paper_title": "Information Distribution Analysis Based on Human's Behavior State Model and the Small-World Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000265703000005"}
