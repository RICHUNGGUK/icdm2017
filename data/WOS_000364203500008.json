In particular, we investigate the problem of amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying in hybrid satellite-terrestrial link, where the relay is interfered by multiple co-channel interferers. The direct link between satellite and terrestrial destination is not available due to masking by surroundings. The destination node can only receive signals from satellite with the assistance of a relay node situated at ground. The satellite-relay link is assumed to follow the shadowed Rice fading, while the channels of interferer-relay and relay-destination links experience Nakagami-m fading. For the considered AF relaying scheme, we first derive the analytical expression for the moment generating function (MGF) of the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Then, we use the obtained MGF to derive the average symbol error rate (SER) of the considered scenario for M-ary phase shift keying (M-PSK) constellation under these generalized fading channels.", "paper_title": "Exact Performance Analysis of AF Based Hybrid Satellite-Terrestrial Relay Network with Co-Channel Interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000364203500008"}
