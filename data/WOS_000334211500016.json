The introduction of cooperative learning to fundamental curriculum reform has been a main direction of various countries education reforms and develops. In the education and the teaching, how appraises student's cooperation ability, especially the interpersonal skills is count for much, the school and the teacher should give the high value. The aim of this paper is to investigate the multiple attribute decision making problems for social network analysis in the evaluation of collaborative learning research with hesitant fuzzy information. Based on the basic ideal of traditional TOPSIS, calculation steps for solving hesitant fuzzy multiple attribute decision- making problems with completely known weight information are given. The weighted Hamming distances between every alternative and positive ideal solution and negative ideal solution are calculated. Then, according to the weighted Hamming distances, the relative closeness degree to the positive ideal solution is calculated to rank all alternatives. Finally, a practical example for social network analysis in the evaluation of collaborative learning research is used to illustrate the developed procedures.", "paper_title": "TOPSIS method for hesitant fuzzy multiple attribute decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000334211500016"}
