Recently, BDD (Binary Decision Diagram) and ZDD (Zero-suppressed BDD) attract a great deal of attention, because they efficiently represent; and manipulate large-scale combinational logic data, which are the basic discrete structures in various fields of applications, including system verification/optimization, knowledge discovery, statistical analysis, etc. Last year; the author proposed a new research project to focus on BDDs/ZDDs. In this proposal, as a new viewpoint of BDD/ZDD-based techniques, we intended to organize an integrated method of algebraic operations for manipulating various types of discrete structures, and to construct standard techniques for efficiently solving large-scale and practical problems. Fortunately, the proposal was accepted by JST (Japan Science and Technology Agency) as an ERATO (Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology) project, one of the prestigious projects in Japan. In this article, we present an overview of our research project. Our project aims to develop \"The Art\" of discrete structure manipulation between Science and Engineering.", "paper_title": "Overview of ERATO Minato Project: The Art of Discrete Structure Manipulation between Science and Engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000290915600005"}
