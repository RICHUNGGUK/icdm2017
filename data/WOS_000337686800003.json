We show that graph walks, combined with existing techniques of supervised learning that model local and global information about the graph walk process, can be used to derive a task-specific word similarity measure in this graph. We also propose and evaluate a new learning method in this framework, a path-constrained graph walk variant, in which the walk process is guided by high-level knowledge about meaningful edge sequences ( paths) in the graph. Empirical evaluation on the tasks of named entity coordinate term extraction and general word synonym extraction show that this framework is preferable to, or competitive with, vector-based models when learning is applied, and using small to moderate size text corpora.", "paper_title": "Adaptive graph walk-based similarity measures for parsed text", "paper_id": "WOS:000337686800003"}
