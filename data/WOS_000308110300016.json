Based on the unified approach, we develop a SPICE-compatible parameter extraction algorithm that can be used in high-performance computer-aided-design applications. A range of multilayered interconnect geometries with arbitrary boundaries are analyzed. Different typical configurations of ground placement are considered to verify the applicability of this method. For all such cases, results are compared for admittance, line parameters, and delay giving physical insight on the effect of boundary conditions on them. Compared with existing industry standard numerical field-solvers, like HFSS, the proposed model demonstrates more than 10x speedup within 2% accuracy.", "paper_title": "Fast and efficient extraction algorithm for high-speed interconnects with arbitrary boundaries", "paper_id": "WOS:000308110300016"}
