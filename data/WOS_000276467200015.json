Semantic Web technology provides the solution to semantic interoperability of heterogeneous applications. In this paper, we analysis existing access control approaches and present a new Semantics Based Cross Domain Access Control Approach with Semantic Access Control Policy Language (SACPL) for describing ACPs. Semantic access control architecture is designed to embed SACPL language and Access Control Oriented Ontology System (ACOOS) into the access control process. Using the approach presented, access control across different domains can be effectively solved through the description and management of semantic attribute. This study enriches the research that the semantic web technology is applied in the field of security, and provides a new way of thinking of access control in cloud computing.", "paper_title": "A Semantics Based Approach for Cross Domain Access Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000276467200015"}
