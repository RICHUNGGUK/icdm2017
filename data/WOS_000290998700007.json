In this paper, we propose a machine-independent loop memory access optimization technique, redundant load exploration and migration (REALM), to explore hidden redundant load operations and migrate them outside loops based on loop-carried data dependence analysis. We implement REALM into IMPACT and Trimaran. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to implement the memory access reduction with loop-carried data reuse in real world compilers. We conduct experiments using a set of benchmarks from DSPstone and MiBench on the cycle-accurate VLIW simulator of Trimaran. The experimental results show that our technique significantly reduces the number of memory accesses.", "paper_title": "On Reducing Hidden Redundant Memory Accesses for DSP Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000290998700007"}
