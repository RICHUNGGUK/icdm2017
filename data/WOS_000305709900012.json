Moving a scaled copy of the curve P*(s) up and down along the z-axis with the size controlled by the curve P(t), we get the surface S(s,t). For example, when P*(s) is a circle with center at the origin, the surface S(s,t) is a surface of revolution. Many other useful and interesting surfaces whose cross sections are not circles can also be generated in this manner. We provide a new technique to implicitize this kind of rational surface using mu-bases. Let P(t) be a rational planar curve of degree n with a mu-basis consisting of two moving lines of degree mu and n - mu, and let P*(s) be a rational planar curve of degree m with a mu-basis consisting of two moving lines of degree mu* and m - mu*. From the mu-bases for these two directrix curves P(t), P* (s), we can easily generate a mu-basis for the surface S(s,t) consisting of three moving planes that follow the surface with generic bidegrees (m -1, mu), (m - 1, n - mu), (m, 0). To implicitize the surface S(s. t), we construct a (2m - 1)n x (2m - 1)n sparse resultant matrix R-s,R-t for these three polynomials. We show that det(R-s,R-t) = 0 is the implicit equation of the surface S(s, t) with a known extraneous factor of degree (m - 1)n. To decrease the size of this matrix and to eliminate entirely the extraneous factor, we construct a new mn x mn Sylvester style sparse matrix S-s,S-t from four moving planes that follow the surface S(s,t). We prove that det(S-s,S-t) = 0 is the exact implicit equation of the surface S(s, t) without any extraneous factors. Examples are presented to illustrate our methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
