It is thought that the 'mismatch' between modalities may represent tissue that could be recovered with proper (thrombolytic) treatment. We have designed a tool for semi-automated segmentation of the images and calculation of the mismatch volume. We present results from software phantoms and clinical data. Phantom results show our mismatch volume calculations are unbiased at realistic noise levels. Clinical data show that raters using our tool are consistent, fast (15 min per subject) and indistinguishable from an expert using manual segmentation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
