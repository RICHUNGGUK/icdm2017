This is the case, for instance, of the operation of activated-carbon filters. For industrial applications there is a growing demand for 3D simulations, so efficient linear solvers are a major concern. We have compared the numerical performance of two families of incomplete Cholesky factorizations as preconditioners of conjugate gradient iterations: drop-tolerance and prescribed-memory strategies. Numerical examples show that the former are computationally more efficient, but the latter may be preferable due to their predictable memory requirements. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. and Civil-Comp Ltd.
