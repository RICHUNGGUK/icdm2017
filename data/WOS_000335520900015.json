These advances in the ability to predict the concentration of an analyte using information-rich data collected from such instruments are outstanding examples of the philosophy of analytical method development outlined by Bruce R. Kowalski more than three decades ago. With the increase in the complexity of analytical objects, sophistication in analytical instrumentation has also been enhanced. Chemometrics classifies analytical instruments as zeroth-order, first-order, second-order, and higher-order according to the order of data that the instrument produces. Different multiway calibration methodologies have been developed to calibrate the instrument and predict the concentration of analytes. In this review, select works of Kowalski and co-workers in the context of second-order calibrations, as well as other recent developments in multiway calibration, especially the three-way and four-way calibrations, which preserve the second-order or high-order advantages, are highlighted. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. This paper reviews chemical multiway calibration methodologies, in particular those with second-order advantage, a term coined by Kowalski and co-workers. Among others, some ground-breaking contributions from Kowalski and co-workers in the field of second-order calibration are outlined. Recent developments in multiway calibration, especially in three-way and four-way calibrations, possessing second-order or higher-order advantage with a focus on novel theories and methodologies, as well as practical applications in the quantitative analysis of complicated systems, are also reviewed.", "paper_title": "Recent developments of chemical multiway calibration methodologies with second-order or higher-order advantages", "paper_id": "WOS:000335520900015"}
