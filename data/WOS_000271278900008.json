Similarly to Earth's non-constant magnetic field, the magnetic field inside buildings can be highly non-uniform. The magnetic field fluctuations inside buildings arise from both natural and man-made sources, such as steel and reinforced concrete structures, electric power systems, electric and electronic appliances, and industrial devices. Assuming that the anomalities of the magnetic field inside a building are nearly static and they have sufficient local variability, the anomalies provide a unique magnetic fingerprint that call be utilized in global self-localization. Based on the evidence presented in this article it call be argued that this hypothesis is valid. In this article, a Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) technique based oil the above hypothesis is proposed. The feasibility of the technique is demonstrated by presenting a series of global self-localization experiments conducted ill four arbitrarily selected buildings, including a hospital. The experiment Setup Consists of a mobile robot instrumented with a 3-axis magnetometer and a computer. In addition to global robot self-localization experiments, successful person self-localization experiments were also conducted by using a wireless, wearable magnetometer. The reported experiments suggest that the ambient magnetic field may remain sufficiently stable for longer periods of time giving support for self-localization techniques utilizing the local deviations of the magnetic field.
