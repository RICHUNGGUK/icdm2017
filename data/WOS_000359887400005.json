In this paper, we propose the use of meta-learning to combine and enrich those approaches by adding also other knowledge-based features. In addition to the aforementioned classical approaches, our system uses the BabelNet multilingual semantic network to generate features derived from word sense disambiguation and vocabulary expansion. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance on single and cross-domain polarity classification. Contrary to other approaches, ours is generic. These results were obtained without any domain adaptation technique. Moreover, the use of meta-learning allows our approach to obtain the most stable results across domains. Finally, our empirical analysis provides interesting insights on the use of semantic network-based features. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
