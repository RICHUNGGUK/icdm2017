We found in our previous study, that the traditional linear interpolation used for the epicardial mapping may cause errors and distortions in reconstruction of the electric activities on the epicardial surface especially during the atrial fibrillation. In this study, we devoted on the implementation of a 3D interpolating method, and verified it in comparison with another interpolating method as well as studying of the mechanism of vagal atrial fibrillation (AF). In case studying, we analyzed the epicardial data from seven canine cardiac models using this method and found the macro-re-entry during the sustainable AF is more likely due to the dispersion of refractoriness in the myocardium and does not demonstrated the focal patterns at the beginning of AF. This indicated that the electrophysiological characteristics of myocardium might have been changed during the paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
