In this paper we add primitives for broadcast communication in order to model wireless protocols. The additions preserve the purity of the psi-calculi semantics, and we formally prove the standard congruence and structural properties of bisimilarity. We demonstrate the expressive power of broadcast psi-calculi by modelling the wireless ad hoc routing protocol LUNAR and verifying a basic reachability property.", "paper_title": "Broadcast psi-calculi with an application to wireless protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000349026100012"}
