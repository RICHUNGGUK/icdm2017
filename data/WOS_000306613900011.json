Using an inorganic AB(2) compound database as a template data platform, the evolution of design rules for crystal chemistry based on an information-theoretic partitioning classifier for a high-dimensional manifold of crystal chemistry descriptors is monitored. An application of this data-mining approach to establish chemical and structural design rules for crystal chemistry is demonstrated by showing that, when coupled with first-principles calculations, statistical inference methods can serve as a tool for significantly accelerating the prediction of unknown crystal structures.", "paper_title": "Information-Theoretic Approach for the Discovery of Design Rules for Crystal Chemistry", "paper_id": "WOS:000306613900011"}
