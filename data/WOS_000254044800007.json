The reliability of such a channel is governed and significantly lowered by capacitive crosstalk effects between adjacent wires. A more robust high-speed phase-encoded channel can be designed by minimizing its vulnerability to crosstalk noise. This paper investigates the impact of crosstalk on phase-encoded transmission channels. A functional fault model is presented to characterize the problem. Two fault-tolerant schemes are introduced which are based on information redundancy techniques and a partial-order coding concept. The area overheads, performance, and fault-tolerant capability of those methods are compared. It is shown that a substantial improvement in the performance can be obtained for four-wire channels when using the fault-tolerant design approach, at the expense of 25 percent of information capacity per symbol.", "paper_title": "Fault-tolerant techniques to minimize the impact of crosstalk on phase-encoding communication channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000254044800007"}
