By constructing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with triple integral terms and using Jensen inequality and linear matrix inequality (LMI) framework, the delay-dependent criteria are presented so that the error system is globally asymptotically stable with H-infinity performance. The activation functions are assumed to satisfy sector-like nonlinearities. The estimator gain matrix for delayed neural networks can be achieved by solving LMIs, which can be easily facilitated by using some standard numerical packages. Finally a numerical example with simulation is presented to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
