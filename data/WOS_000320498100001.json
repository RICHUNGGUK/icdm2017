We have used the MC moves for polypeptide sampling known as Concerted Rotations with Angles (CRA) to selectively sample the region of the prion protein comprising the beta-sheet and one of the a-helices. The results indicate that the MC/MD simulations sample the phase space substantially faster than regular Molecular Dynamics simulations starting with the same initial conditions. This work further indicates the MC/MD technique as a potentially powerful simulation tool, allowing the selective sampling of a region of a physical system that is deemed important.
