Fir-it, we focus on ST code constructions for the short block-length case, i.e., when the block length is equal to or slightly larger than the number of transmit antennas. We present constructions based on dense lattice packings and nested lattice (Voronoi) shaping. Our codes achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of quasi-static multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels for any fading statistics, and perform very well also at practical, moderate values of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Then, we extend the construction to the case of large block lengths, by using trellis coset coding. We provide constructions of trellis coded modulation (TCM) schemes that are endowed with good packing and shaping properties. Both short-block and trellis constructions allow for a reduced complexity decoding algorithm based on minimum mean-squared error generalized decision feedback equalizer (MMSE-GDFE) lattice decoding and a combination of this with a Viterbi TCM decoder for the TCM case. Beyond the interesting algebraic structure, we exhibit codes whose performance is among the state-of-the art considering codes with similar encoding/decoding complexity.", "paper_title": "Space-Time Codes From Structured Lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000263375500007"}
