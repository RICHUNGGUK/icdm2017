Then a U-D factorization-based RPE (UD-RPE) algorithm is proposed to further improve the training rate and accuracy of the FNNs. In comparison with the backpropagation (BP) and existing RPE based training algorithms, the proposed UD-RPE can provide substantially better results in fewer iterations with fewer hidden nodes and improve significantly convergence rate and numerical stability. In addition, it is less sensitive to start-up parameters, such a's initial weights and covariance matrix. It has also good model prediction ability and need less training time. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated via two nonlinear systems modeling and identification examples.", "paper_title": "A fast and numerically robust neural network training algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000239600000018"}
