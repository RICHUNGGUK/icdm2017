To seek the unknown parameters of g-SVM, an adaptive normal Gaussian particle swarm optimization (ANPSO) is also proposed. The results of applications show that the hybrid forecasting model based on the g-SVM and ANPSO is feasible and effective, the comparison between the method proposed in this paper and other ones is also given which proves this method is better than v-SVM and other traditional methods.
