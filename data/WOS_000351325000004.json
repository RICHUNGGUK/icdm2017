Yet improvements have been made for coding or pooling separately, this paper proposes a spatially constrained scheme for sparse coding on both steps. Specifically, we employ the m-nearest neighbors of a local feature in the image space to improve the consistency of coding. The benefit is that similar image features will be encoded with similar codewords, which reduced the stochasticity of a conventional coding strategy. We also show that the Viola-Jones algorithm, which is well-known in face detection, can be tailored to learning receptive fields, embedding the spatially constrained information on the pooling step. Extensive experiments on the URIC sport event, 15 natural scenes and the Caltech 101 database suggests that scene categorization performance of several popular algorithms can be ubiquitously improved by incorporating the proposed two spatially constrained sparse coding scheme.
