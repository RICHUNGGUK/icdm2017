In this paper, we propose a WSN-specific solution to MFP based on the well-known push-relabel method. In our solution we provide several techniques and heuristics to implement asynchronous communication, reduce message complexity, support adaptability, and satisfy soft real-time requirements. Because these heuristics are independent, we can adjust the algorithm by applying some heuristics and ignoring the others, according to the application requirements. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm makes a significant improvement in the case of message and time complexities in comparison with the best existing algorithms.
