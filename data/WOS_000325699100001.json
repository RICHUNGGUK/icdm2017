In this paper, we propose a metamodeling approach for pattern specification, in which a pattern is modeled as a meta-level class and its participants are meta-level references. Instead of defining a new metamodel, we reuse the Unified Modeling Language (UML) metamodel and incorporate the concepts of Variable and Set into our approach, which are unavailable in the UML but essential for pattern specification. Our approach provides straightforward solutions for pattern-related problems, such as pattern instantiation, evolution, and implementation. By integrating the solutions into a single framework, we can construct a pattern management system, in which patterns can be instantiated, evolved, and implemented in a correct and manageable way.", "paper_title": "A metamodeling approach for pattern specification and management", "paper_id": "WOS:000325699100001"}
