The limit surfaces also have bounded curvature, which leads to improved quality surfaces. The eigen-structure analysis demonstrates the smoothness of the limit surfaces. According to the new scheme, the approach for progressive transmission of meshes is presented. Finally, results of refined models with the new scheme are shown. In most cases, the new scheme generates more pleasure surfaces than the traditional modified butterfly scheme, especially near the irregular settings.", "paper_title": "An interpolatory subdivision scheme for triangular meshes and progressive transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900027"}
