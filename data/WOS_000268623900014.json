It aims to help support the promotion of productivity for manufacturing firms belonging to the Federation of Thai Industries or FTI. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is based on survey data collected from FTI-based manufacturing firms. There are five profiles: industrial type; size; years operating in business; ownership; and targeted customer to be studied in a pair-wise circumstance. There are 40 companies that participated in this study. The statistical analyses include general linear mode with ANOVA. Altogether, there are a total of 138 circumstances (pair-wise profiles) under study. Findings - In general, productivity information is important as indicated from most circumstances the must-measure and require-to-measure circumstances. The findings also indicate that there is no specific prediction for particular circumstances (e.g. the larger-size firms with longer years operating in business need productivity information than the smaller ones). Practical implications - The results show that there is no need for the FTI to single out specific groups to focus on productivity-measurement efforts. The study helps gain better understanding into the issues regarding when-to-measure productivity. It is generally known that there are a few measurement techniques that are communicated to the FTI firms on a regular basis such as multi-factor productivity measurement and value-added productivity measurement - what to measure. In addition, their applications are primarily at the organizational and production levels where-to-measure. The process to deploy these measurement techniques is well known and documented - how-to-measure. Originality/value - The findings support the use of both financial and non-financial information to ensure an effective management process (i.e. measurement, analysis, and improvement).", "paper_title": "Profile-based circumstances for productivity measurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000268623900014"}
