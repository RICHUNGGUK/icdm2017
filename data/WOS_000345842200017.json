Among the performance metrics of the comparator, the noise is the most difficult to estimate and simulate, specially for circuits that present a time-varying behavior such as clocked comparators. In this work we present a framework to size and optimize comparators which uses periodic steady-state (PSS) and periodic noise (PNOISE) analyses, commonly employed for RF circuits, together with an optimization kernel based on evolutionary algorithms. We present a case study comparator design, taking into account noise, power and delay. The results show that the proposed framework minimizes these parameters and achieves systematic convergence to consistent Pareto fronts in a short timespan (approximately 27 mins). Furthermore, the accuracy of the PSS/PNOISE noise estimation method is validated through comparison to extensive transient noise simulations, showing a difference standard deviation of 3.47 % between the two methods.", "paper_title": "Noise-aware simulation-based sizing and optimization of clocked comparators", "paper_id": "WOS:000345842200017"}
