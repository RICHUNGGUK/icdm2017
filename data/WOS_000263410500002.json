These networks do not work on any infrastructure and the mobiles communicate either directly or via other nodes of the network by establishing routes. These routes are prone to frequent ruptures because of nodes mobility. If the future movement of the mobile can be predicted in a precise way, the resources reservation can be made before be asked, which enables the network to provide a better QoS. In this aim, we propose a virtual dynamic topology, which on one hand, will organize the network as well as possible and decreases the impact of mobility, and on the other hand, is oriented user mobility prediction. Our prediction scheme uses the evidence theory of Dempster-Shafer in order to predict the future position of the mobile by basing itself on relevant criteria. These ones are related to mobility and network operation optimisation. The proposed scheme is flexible and can be extended to a general framework. To show the relevance of our scheme, we combine it with a routing protocol. Then, we implemented the prediction-oriented topology and the prediction scheme which performs on it. We implemented also a mobility prediction based routing protocol. Simulations are made according to a set of elaborate scenarios. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
