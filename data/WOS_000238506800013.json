After a brief introduction of the SCA Model, the general methodological approach is described. The main steps provide the definition of the spatial abstraction of the environment, the definition of its active elements, and the specification of types of mobile agents, the related behaviours with particular attention to their movement by means of the notion of utility. A case study is also briefly described in order to show how the methodology was applied in the modelling of crowd behaviour in an underground station.", "paper_title": "Towards a methodology for situated cellular agent based crowd simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000238506800013"}
