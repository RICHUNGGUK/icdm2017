They are usually not thoroughly tested so they often contain faults. Debugging spreadsheets is a hard task due to the size and structure, which is usually not directly visible to the user, i.e., the functions are hidden and only the computed values are presented. A way to locate faulty cells in spreadsheets is by adapting software debugging approaches for traditional procedural or object-oriented programming languages. One of such approaches is spectrum-based fault localization (SFL). In this paper, we study the impact of different similarity coefficients on the accuracy of SFL applied to the spreadsheet domain. Our empirical evaluation shows that three of the 42 studied coefficients (Ochiai, Jaccard and Sorensen-Dice) require less effort by the user while inspecting the diagnostic report, and can also be used interchangeably without a loss of accuracy. In addition, we illustrate the influence of the number of correct and incorrect output cells on the diagnostic report.", "paper_title": "On the empirical evaluation of similarity coefficients for spreadsheets fault localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000351476800003"}
