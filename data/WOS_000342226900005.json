SBS divides the search space into many small segments according to the evolutionary information feedback from the set of current optimal solutions. Two operations, micro-jumping and macro-jumping, are implemented upon these segments in order to guide an efficient information exchange among \"good\" individuals. Moreover, the running of SBS is adaptive according to the current evolutionary status. SBS is activated only when the population evolves slowly, depending on general genetic operators (e. g., mutation and crossover). A comprehensive set of 36 test problems is employed for experimental verification. The influence of two algorithm settings (i. e., the dimensionality and boundary relaxation strategy) and two probability parameters in SBS (i. e., the SBS rate and micro-jumping proportion) are investigated in detail. Moreover, an empirical comparative study with three representative variation operators is carried out. Experimental results show that the incorporation of SBS into the optimization process can improve the performance of evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective optimization problems.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary Algorithms with Segment-Based Search for Multiobjective Optimization Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000342226900005"}
