Many such protocols have been proposed but most of them are either insecure or inefficient. Very recently, He et al. proposed an improved protocol to overcome the weakness of a novel handover authentication protocol, namely PairHand. Later, they pointed out that their protocol is vulnerable to a private key compromised problem under certain circumstances and proposed an improved protocol to overcome the weakness. In this paper, we examine the security of He et al.' s improved protocol and show it is vulnerable to a private key compromised problem. To improve security, we propose a new ID-based signature protocol and construct a new handover authentication protocol based on the proposed signature protocol.", "paper_title": "A new handover authentication protocol based on bilinear pairing functions for wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352086600007"}
