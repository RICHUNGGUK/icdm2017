The proposed approach synergistically adopts the poly biasing technique in conjunction with single-well/flip-well configurations and body biasing to opportunely tune the threshold voltage of the devices in the standby and active mode. A tuning methodology is described to optimize the static energy consumption. Post-layout simulations, done at power supply voltages ranging between 1 V and 0.5 V, have shown that, in comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques based on the same UTBB FDSOI technology, the proposed design achieves a maximum leakage up to 85% lower without paying significant delay penalties.", "paper_title": "Low-Leakage SRAM Wordline Drivers for the 28-nm UTBB FDSOI Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000365206300038"}
