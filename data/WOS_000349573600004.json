Although NoSQL systems have not been designed to support joins, as they are applied to a wide variety of applications, the need to support joins has emerged. Furthermore, joins performed in NoSQL systems are generally similarity joins, rather than exact-match joins, which find similar pairs of records. Since Web applications often use the MapReduce framework, we develop a solution to perform similarity joins in NoSQL systems using the MapReduce framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
