La) (Zr. Ti)O-3) high-speed optical switch is introduced, with a view to realizing the next-generation high capacity scalable access network. This system is developed based on the latest IEEE standard of PUN (10G-EPON; IEEE802.3av) in consideration of the coordination with future high capacity PON. PLZT high-speed optical switches are able to switch an optical signal at nano-second speed (<5-10 ns). Generally, the merits of using optical switches are increasing the number of subscribers and transmission distance easily, preventing malicious ONUs from interfacing with the communication between OLT and the other ONUs, realizing fast fiber and OLT protection/restoration and providing various services by controlling optical switches dynamically. This paper focuses on two key technologies; a PLZT optical switch and a new discovery process for active optical access network based on MPCP defined at IEEE802.3. A major challenge in designing active optical access network is supporting the discovery process of MPCP because it does not offer broadcast transmission unlike the regular PUN. We propose here a new discovery process; it has been tested successfully in an implementation of our proposed system. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
