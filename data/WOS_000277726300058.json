In order to resolve this tough issue, the Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training, Council of Labor Affairs of Executive Yuan has been aggressively conducting Employment Service Outreach Program to reduce the unemployment rate. Under Employment Service Outreach Program, the outreach personnel are recruited, trained, and supervised to perform the duties including identifying unemployed persons and then providing job information for them, using the social resource link to increase employment opportunities, conducting employer forum or workshops for job-seekers, and so on. This study applies decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method to not only evaluate the importance of the criteria but also construct the causal relationships among the criteria of evaluating outreach personnel. The results show that identification of the number of unemployed people and number of follow-up visit are the two most essential causes under the category of job-seeking service when the performance of outreach personnel in Employment Service Outreach Program is evaluated.
