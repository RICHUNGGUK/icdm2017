It added two new constructs, Perceived Cost Savings and Company's Willingness to Fund, and two causal relationships, job Relevance and Experience, as moderating effects. The 286 sets of data collected in an online survey were tested against the model using SEM. Results supported my new model: the new constructs and variables accounted for 62.7% of the variance found in an individual's behavioral intention to use MWT. The path coefficients between the constructs ranged from 0.26 to 0.85 also supporting the model. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
