These procedures are based on the combined approximations approach, which is further developed to improve both the efficiency of the calculations and the accuracy of the results. The procedures are suitable for linear, nonlinear, static, and dynamic reanalysis problems, and they can be used to improve the efficiency of response surface calculations. It is shown that the procedures presented provide accurate approximations and may significantly reduce the computational effort involved in reanalysis of large-scale structures. This might prove useful in various design and optimization problems.", "paper_title": "Efficient procedures for repeated calculations of the structural response using combined approximations", "paper_id": "WOS:000242296400001"}
