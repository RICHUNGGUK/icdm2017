To overcome this, transmission rate is usually adjusted to a more error-resistant rate. In this paper, we first present a novel rate adaptation algorithm for IEEE 802.11 that can efficiently identify the threshold frame error rate (FER) at which link adjustment is required, based on a simple throughput analysis at the MAC layer. Then, we extend our rate adaptation algorithm to support IEEE 802.11 e quality of service (QoS) requirements. When a real-time stream with QoS requirements is admitted, critical constraints such as delay bound and maximum packet drop count are integrated in the selection of the most convenient transmission rate that best respects the flow requirements. Moreover, we use dynamic bandwidth allocation rather than the default transmission opportunities (TXOPs) in a way that best offers a flow the required time for retransmissions due to packet failure based on the variant loss rate present in the channel. We validate our proposed rate adaptation algorithms via simulation results where the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm are noticed for both best effort and QoS flows.
