The designed circuit consists of a dual-resonance LC resonator and a Colpitts negative resistance cell. The dual-resonance LC resonator comprises a series-tuned LC resonator and a parallel resonant resonator. The proposed VCO has been implemented with the TSMC 0.18 m 1P6M CMOS technology. The VCO can generate differential signals in the frequency range of 3.0-3.37 GHz and 6.95-7.40 GHz with core power consumption of 10.08 and 10.24 mW at the dc drain-source bias V-DD of 1.4 V, respectively. The die area of the dual-band VCO is 0.485 x 0.800 mm(2). The circuit was operated at V-DD = 3 V for 8 h and significant drift in RF parameters was found. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
