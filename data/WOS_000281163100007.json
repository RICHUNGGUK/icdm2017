The proposed extensions allow the programmer to write portable code easily for a number of different platforms, relieving him/her from developing the specific code to off-load tasks to the accelerators and the synchronization of tasks. Our results obtained from the StarSs instantiations for SMPs, the Cell, and GPUs report reasonable parallel performance. However, the real impact of our approach in is the productivity gains it yields for the programmer.", "paper_title": "Extending OpenMP to Survive the Heterogeneous Multi-Core Era", "paper_id": "WOS:000281163100007"}
