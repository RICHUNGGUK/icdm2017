Since magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may he employed to obtain real-time temperature maps noninvasively the combination of these two technologies offers great advantages specifically aimed toward oncological studies. Real-time identification of the target region and accurate control of the temperature evolution during the treatment has now become possible. Thermal ablation of pathological tissue, local drug delivery using thermosensitive micro-carriers and controlled transgene expression using thermosensitive promoters have recently been demonstrated with this unique technology. Based on these experiments combined focused ultrasound and MRI thermometry holds promise for future oncological diagnostics and treatment. In this paper, we review some of the recent methodological developments as well as experimental and first clinical studies using this approach.", "paper_title": "MRI-Guided focused ultrasound: Methodology and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000237980700005"}
