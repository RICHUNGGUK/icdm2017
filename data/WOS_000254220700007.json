In this new method, a 3D problem of the \"transmission line excited by external EM field\" is subdivided into two problems. The first problem called \"forced terms problem\" is a 2D problem of the \"cross section of the transmission line excited by external EM field.\" The second problem is a one-dimensional problem of the \"transmission line excited by external EM field\" called \"TL problem.\" The first problem can be solved using a two-dimensional analysis. The second problem can be described by a pair of simple nonhomogeneous differential equations of the transmission lines with forced terms. The forced terms of the differential equations are obtained solving the first problem. The method is fast and validated with conventional 3D full wave analysis software like HFSS.
