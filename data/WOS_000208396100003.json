Instead of using microphone arrays, each sensor node in the sensornetwork uses only a single microphone as its sensing device. This design can greatly reduce the size and cost of each sensor node and allow more flexible deployment of the sensornetwork. The self-organization algorithm presented in this paper can dynamically select proper sensor nodes to form the localization sensor groups that can work as a virtual microphone array to perform energy efficient target localization and tracking. To achieve this, we use a time-delay based bearing estimation plus triangulation for source localization in the sensornetwork. Major error sources of the localization method like time delay estimation, bearing calculation and triangulation are analyzed and sensor selection criteria are developed. Based on these criteria and neighborhood information of each sensor node, a distributed self-organization algorithm is developed. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Self-organization of unattended wireless acoustic sensor networks for ground target tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000208396100003"}
