As an example of the analysis, a fully integrated dual-band LNA is designed in a standard 0.18-mu m 6M1P CMOS technology from the system viewpoint for the first time to provide a higher gain at the high band in order to compensate the high-band signal's extra loss over the air transmission. The LNA drains 6.21 mA of current from a 1.5-V supply voltage and achieves voltage gains of 14 and 22 dB, input S, I of 15 and 18 dB, and noise figures of 2.45 and 2.51 dB at 2.4 and 5.2 GHz, respectively.
