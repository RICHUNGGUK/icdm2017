The demand rate is a power function of the on-hand inventory down to a certain stock level, at which the demand rate becomes a constant. We prove that the optimal replenishment policy not only exists but also is unique. Furthermore, we provide simple solution procedures for finding the maximum total profit per unit time. Numerical examples have also been given to illustrate the model and we conclude the paper with suggestions for possible future research. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
