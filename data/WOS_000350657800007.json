The control strategies are based on one of two approaches to the path parameterization-either the Serret-Frenet frame with an orthogonal projection or the Serret-Frenet frame with a non-orthogonal projection of a robot on the desired path. The complete control system for the wheeled mobile robot consists of two parts, a kinematic controller and a dynamic controller, because of a presence of nonholonomic constraints. The behaviour of the presented algorithms is demonstrated through computer simulations.", "paper_title": "Different Kinematic Path Following Controllers for a Wheeled Mobile Robot of (2,0) Type", "paper_id": "WOS:000350657800007"}
