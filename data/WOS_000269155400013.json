In the new architecture, we replace the CAM dictionary set used in the PDLZW algorithm with a CAM-tag-based dictionary set to reduce hardware cost and the CAM-based ordered list used in the AHDB algorithm with a memory inter-reference (MIR) stage realized by using two SRAMs. The resulting architecture is then implemented based on cell-based libraries with both 0.35-mu m 2P4M and 0.18-mu m 1P6M process technologies, respectively. With the same process technology, the prototyped chip demonstrates the new architecture not only has better performance, at least 33% improvement, but also occupies less area, only about 44%, and consumes less power, about 50%, in comparison with the architecture proposed in [8]. In addition, the maximum data rate can achieve 2 Gbps when realizing in 0.35 mu m 2P4M process technology and 4 Gbps when realizing in 0.18-mu m 1P6M process technology.", "paper_title": "A New Architecture of a Two-Stage Lossless Data Compression and Decompression Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000269155400013"}
