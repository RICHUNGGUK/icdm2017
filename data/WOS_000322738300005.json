However, the two models are unlikely to address the issues beyond their modelling targets (i.e., pedestrian movement for microscopic models and crowd movement for macroscopic models). In order to solve such problem, we propose a hybrid model integrating macroscopic model into microscopic model, which is capable of taking into account issues both from crowd movement tendency and individual diversity to simulate crowd evacuation. In each simulation time step, the macroscopic model is executed first and generates a course-grain simulation result depicting the crowd movement, which directs microscopic model for goal selection and path planning to generate a fine-grain simulation result. In the mean time, different level-of-detail simulation results can also be obtained due to the proposed model containing two complete models. A synchronization mechanism is proposed to convey simulation results from one model to the other one. The simulation results via case study indicate the proposed model can simulate the crowd and agent behaviour in dynamic environments, and the simulation cost is proved to be efficient.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid Model for Simulating Crowd Evacuation", "paper_id": "WOS:000322738300005"}
