The proposed control strategy has some clear advantages in respect to existing neural internal model control methods. It can be used for open-loop unstable nonlinear processes or a class of systems with unstable zero dynamics. Based on a novel input-output approximation, the proposed neural control law can be derived directly and implemented straightforward for an unknown process. Only one neural network needs to be trained and control algorithm can be directly obtained from model identification without further training. The stability and robustness of a closed-loop system can be derived analytically. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed AIMNC strategy.", "paper_title": "An approximate internal model-based neural control for unknown nonlinear discrete processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000237521300010"}
