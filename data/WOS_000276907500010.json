Specifically, we investigate the self-assembly of fractal shapes in the TAM. We prove that no self-similar fractal weakly self-assembles at temperature 1 in a locally deterministic tile assembly system, and that certain kinds of discrete self-similar fractals do not strictly self-assemble at any temperature. Additionally, we extend the fiber construction of Lathrop et al. ( 2009) to show that any discrete self-similar fractal belonging to a particular class of \"nice'' discrete self-similar fractals has a fibered version that strictly self-assembles in the TAM.", "paper_title": "Self-assembly of discrete self-similar fractals", "paper_id": "WOS:000276907500010"}
