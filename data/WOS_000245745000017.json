According to the theorem, we can view SPs as stable points (attractors and rejectors by their rotations), estimate core's direction, and restore SP offset. The proposed method is validated in the following two hierarchical aspects, one is to test the reliability and accuracy of coarse SP detection by means of two indices (RI and AC), and the other is the accuracy of core's location and the stability of core's direction in terms of improved FingerCode matching. Experiments on partial FVC2004 data sets show that it works well and outperforms three other methods. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
