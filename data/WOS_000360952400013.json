The bifurcation diagram is approximated using the POD modes resulting from unconverged snapshots for just one specific value of R, calculated in either Newton iterations or time-dependent runs converging to steady states. Moreover, the selection of the specific value of R is quite flexible. In addition, a horizontal reflection symmetry is taken into account to construct a symmetry-preserving Galerkin system. The resulting un-symmetric and symmetric low-dimensional systems are combined with a basic continuation method, which provide the bifurcation diagram at a quite low computational cost.
