Methods: The methods of structuring information in dentistry are described and the interactive DentCross component is introduced. A system of structured voice-supported data entry in electronic health record on several real cases in the field of dentistry is performed. The connection of this component to the MUDRLite electronic health record is described. Results: The use of DentVoice, an application which consists of the electronic health record MUDRLite and the voice-controlled interactive component DentCross, to collect dental information required by temporomandibular joint disorders is shown. Conclusions: The DentVoice application with the DentCross component showed the practical ability of the temporomandibular joint disorder treatment support.", "paper_title": "Voice-supported Electronic Health Record for Temporomandibular Joint Disorders", "paper_id": "WOS:000276936300010"}
