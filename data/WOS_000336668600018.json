In this paper, we consider three recently proposed aperiodic control algorithms which have the potential to address this problem. By showing how these controllers can be implemented over the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, a practical wireless control system architecture with guaranteed closed-loop performance is detailed. Event-based predictive and hybrid sensor and actuator communication schemes are compared with respect to their capabilities and implementation complexity. A two double-tank laboratory experimental setup, mimicking some typical industrial process control loops, is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. Experimental results show how the sensor communication adapts to the changing demands of the control loops and the network resources, allowing for lower energy consumption and efficient bandwidth utilization.", "paper_title": "System Architectures, Protocols and Algorithms for Aperiodic Wireless Control Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600018"}
