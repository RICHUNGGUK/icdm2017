Highly resonant systems with collocated sensor/actuator are often controlled using resonant shunt dampers. Unfortunately, in the configuration used here, this approach is not possible due the non-minimum phase property arising from the the presence of a right-half plane zero. This problem is solved by: (i) interpreting the resonant shunt damper in the context of physical-model-based control (PMBC) and (ii) extending the PMBC approach to handle non-minimum phase systems. The resultant controller combines the physical insight of the resonant shunt damper with the ability to control the non-minimum phase piezoelectric tube. A digital implementation of the controller was experimentally evaluated and found to successfully eliminate the resonant mode of vibration during an accurate and fast scan using a piezoelectric tube actuator.
