In this paper, we address the metric reconstruction problem of such filamentary structures from data sampled around them. We prove that they can be approximated with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff distance by well-chosen Reeb graphs (and some of their variants) and provide an efficient and easy-to-implement algorithm to compute such approximations in almost linear time. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm on a few datasets.", "paper_title": "Gromov-Hausdorff Approximation of Filamentary Structures Using Reeb-Type Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000353895200007"}
