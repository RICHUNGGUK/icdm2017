Although RECORD has a graphic user interface based on box-and-arrow diagrams to develop models, members of modeling communities who prefer Forrester diagrams may become disoriented when using RECORD. To help them, we developed a plugin that displays models as Forrester diagrams and translates them into DEVS formalism. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
