This abduction problem remains an open issue since a simple sensitivity analysis on the value of the unknown prior yields empty results. This paper tries to propose some criteria a solution to this problem should satisfy. It then surveys and comments on various existing or new solutions to this problem: the use of likelihood functions (as in classical statistics), the use of information principles like maximum entropy, Shapley value, maximum likelihood. Finally, we present a novel maximum likelihood solution by making use of conditional event theory. The formal setting includes de Finetti's coherence approach, which does not exclude conditioning on contingent events with zero probability. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
