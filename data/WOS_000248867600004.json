Here K is any constructible field of characteristic 0. In this paper, we show that their algorithm requires 0 (112) field operations, where n is the degree of a given polynomial. We also show how their algorithm can be used to find a polynomial parametrization of a plane Curve p(x, y) = 0 which is isomorphic to a line. This requires 0(172 1092 11) field operations.
