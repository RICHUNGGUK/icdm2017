The method is based on an analytical design model of the machine, an electrical model of the machine rectifier system and a non-linear optimization procedure. The coupling between both models is achieved by a specific correction mechanism during the iterative process that performs an efficient convergence of the optimization procedure. The machine design model is derived from an analytical computation of the two-dimensional magnetic field distribution created by the magnets, the armature currents and the stator eddy currents that circulate in the SMC material. It has been cross-validated by 2D finite element analysis. The design approach is applied to the specifications of a 1.5 MW, I 8,000 rpm slotless permanent magnet generator with a rated DC output voltage of 1500 V. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
