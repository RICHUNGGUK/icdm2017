When the SSDs are configured in a RAID, the performance variance of individual SSDs could significantly degrade the overall performance of the RAID of SSDs. The internal cache on the RAID controller can help mitigate the performance variability issues of SSDs in the array; however, the state-of-the-art cache algorithm of the RAID controller does not consider the characteristics of SSDs. In this paper, we examine the most recent write cache algorithm for the array of disks, and propose a synchronous independent write cache (SIW) algorithm. We also present a pre-parity-computation technique for the RAID of SSDs with parity computations, which calculates parities of blocks in advance before they are stored in the write cache. With this new technique, we propose a complete paradigm shift in the design of write cache. In our evaluation study, large write requests dominant workloads show up to about 50 and 20 percent improvements in average response times on RAID-0 and RAID-5 respectively as compared to the state-of-the-art write cache algorithm.", "paper_title": "Synchronous I/O Scheduling of Independent Write Caches for an Array of SSDs", "paper_id": "WOS:000356718700020"}
