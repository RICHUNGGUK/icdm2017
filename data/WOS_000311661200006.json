For this purpose, the well known complexes of Pb(II) and Cd(II) with nitrilotriacetate (NTA) systems are considered. The proposed methodology is based on least-squares fitting and can be applied for a fixed time at different metal-to-ligand ratios and in a time-dependent way, which involves the fitting of current vs. potential vs. time matrices. In both cases, consistent and realistic results are obtained, thus suggesting the potential usefulness of this approach for more involved systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
