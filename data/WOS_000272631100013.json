Several Hirsch-type measures are defined and their basic properties are analysed. Empirical properties are illustrated using examples from the micro- and meso-level. Among these measures, the h-index proved the most, the arithmetic and geometric g-indices, the least robust measures. The mu-index and the harmonic g-index provide more balanced results and are still robust enough. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
