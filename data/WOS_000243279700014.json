We show that the probability that ([ n], R( n, k)) is projective tends to one, as either n or k tends to infinity. This result implies that for most relational systems (B, (R) under bar) the CSP( B, (R) under bar) problem is NP-complete ( and thus that the dichotomy conjecture holds with probability 1), and confirms a conjecture of Rosenberg [ I.
