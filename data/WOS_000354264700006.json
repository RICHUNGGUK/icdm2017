Instead of heuristically designing behaviors for certain personalities, this paper bridges the gap between personalities and behaviors using a medium concept, mood, to make the behaviors of the characters consistent enough to convey their personalities, while flexible enough to make appropriate response in various situations. We propose a personality-characterized mood dynamics model, in which the emotion weights are computed as a solution of a convex optimization problem that is constructed to make the overall mood approaches the personality after sufficient interactions. The convergence of the algorithm is demonstrated by numerical simulations. The implementation of the personality-characterized mood dynamics model enables an emotion-oriented virtual human, Sophie, to show personalized behaviors in the emotional interactions with users.
