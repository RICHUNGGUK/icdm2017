The jet Reynolds number was varied from 404 to 1026, where it is presumed that the transient regime exists. We found that the vortical structures in the shear layer are developed with increase of Reynolds number and that the jet becomes remains steady at the Reynolds number of 404. Vortical structures and their temporal evolution are verified and the results were compared with previous numerical studies.", "paper_title": "Time-resolved PIV investigation on the unsteadiness of a low Reynolds number confined impinging jet", "paper_id": "WOS:000250542700013"}
