Data were gathered from students in the final grades of high school in the Swiss Canton Ticino as part of a wider European project, with a particular focus on the potential uptake of a study or professional career in ICT. Preliminary focus groups with teachers and interviews with women with a job in ICT were followed by a quali-quantitative study which involved 539 students. Results indicate that there are no big gender differences when it comes to ICT use and perception. Small differences are found in the perception of the gender digital divide, while relevant differences were found in the perception and values attached to future professional or academic careers in ICT.", "paper_title": "Boys are like Girls: Insights in the Gender Digital Divide in Higher Education in Switzerland and Europe", "paper_id": "WOS:000303599700004"}
