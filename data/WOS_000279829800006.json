The properties of the limiting zeros are studied and conditions for ensuring the stable limiting zeros of the discrete-time systems for sufficiently small sampling periods are derived. It is a natural extension of Liang et al.'s result for single-input-single-output systems to multivariable systems.", "paper_title": "STABILITY OF ZEROS OF DISCRETE-TIME MULTIVARIABLE SYSTEMS WITH GSHF", "paper_id": "WOS:000279829800006"}
