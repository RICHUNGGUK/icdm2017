Here, we also used a version of AutoDock which permits additional conformational flexibility in selected amino acid side chains of the target protein.", "paper_title": "Automated Docking with Protein Flexibility in the Design of Femtomolar \"Click Chemistry\" Inhibitors of Acetylcholinesterase", "paper_id": "WOS:000318060200016"}
