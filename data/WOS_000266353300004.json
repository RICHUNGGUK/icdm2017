This may hold both in the agents preference ordering and in the social order. In this article, we consider this scenario and study what properties it may have. In particular, we show that, despite the added expressivity and ability to resolve conflicts provided by incomparability, classical impossibility results (such as Arrows theorem, MullerSatterthwaites theorem and GibbardSatterthwaites theorem) still hold. We also prove some possibility results, generalizing Sens theorem for majority voting. To prove these results, we define new notions of unanimity, monotonicity, dictator, triple-wise value-restriction and strategy-proofness, which are suitable and natural generalizations of the classical ones for complete orders.", "paper_title": "Aggregating Partially Ordered Preferences", "paper_id": "WOS:000266353300004"}
