We develop a theoretical model in which hybrid resolution can be achieved as the computation of a fixpoint of elementary functions. These functions correspond to basic resolution techniques and their applications can easily be parameterized by different search strategies. This framework is used to solve a specific problem and we discuss the experimental results showing the interest of the of the model to design such hybridizations.", "paper_title": "Solving the balanced academic curriculum problem with an hybridization of genetic algorithm and constraint propagation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239600000044"}
