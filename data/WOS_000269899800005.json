In order to transmit the data to the client efficiently, this paper proposes a node-layer data model to manage the 3D scene. Because the large spatial data and limited network bandwidth are the main bottlenecks of web-based 3DGIS, a client/server architecture including progressive transmission methods and multiresolution representations, together with the spatial index, are developed to improve the performance. All this makes the application quite scalable. Experimental results reveal that the application works appropriately.", "paper_title": "Web-based visualization of spatial objects in 3DGIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000269899800005"}
