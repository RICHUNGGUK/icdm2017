Relationships between functions in the procedural system were identified using various coupling metrics. While the coupling metrics used for analysis were helpful in identifying candidate objects, domain expert analysis of the candidate objects was required. The time taken at each step in the process was captured to help determine the effectiveness of the method. Overall the process was found to be effective for identifying objects.", "paper_title": "Case study of a method for reengineering procedural systems into OO systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575400014"}
