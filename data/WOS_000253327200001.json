The reliability of the flight test measurement is examined in engineering judgment, scatter and Cramer-Rao bound, which turns out to be satisfactory with minor defects. Estimated parameter values are validated by comparing the simulated responses with the ones from actual flight tests. The ChangGong-91 FTD turns out to satisfy the qualification of FAA Level 7 FTD in lateral-directional motion. All the necessary practices for generation of high-fidelity data in lateral-directional motion of a light aircraft are successfully performed in this study.
