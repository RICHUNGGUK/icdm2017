It is required to generate a collision-free routing for multiple automated guided vehicles (AGVs) within a few seconds. In this paper, we propose a distributed routing method under motion delay disturbance for multiple AGVs. The proposed method features a characteristic that each AGV subsystem derives its optimal route to minimize the sum of the transportation time and the penalties with respect to collision probability with other AGVs. The penalties reflect the collision probability distribution function for motion delay disturbances. The proposed method is applied to a routing problem for transportation in the semiconductor fabrication bay with 143 nodes and 20 AGVs. The computational results show that the total transportation time obtained by the proposed method is shorter than that of the conventional method. For dynamic transportation environments, an optimal timing for re-routing multiple AGVs under motion delay disturbance is systematically determined by the tradeoff relationship between the total computation time to derive a solution and the uncertainties for re-routings. Markov chain is used to represent uncertainty distribution for re-routings. The proposed method is implemented in an experimental transportation system with 51 nodes and 5 AGVs. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is applicable to real transportation environments. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
