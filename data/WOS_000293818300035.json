In addition, a dynamic parameter update rule of the neuron for achieving synchronizations to the input spike-train having various spike frequencies is presented. Using an analytical two-dimensional return map, local stability of the parameter update rule is analyzed. Furthermore, a pulse-coupled network of the neurons is presented and its basic self-organizing function is analyzed. Fundamental comparisons are also presented.", "paper_title": "A Self-Organizing Pulse-Coupled Network of Sub-Threshold Oscillating Spiking Neurons", "paper_id": "WOS:000293818300035"}
