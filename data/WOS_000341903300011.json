Different from other formulations, decision variables are associated with pairs of vertices. Consequently, colors will be distinguishable. Although the objective function is fractional, it can be replaced by a piece-wise linear convex function. Numerical experiments show that our formulation has significantly good performance for dense graphs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
