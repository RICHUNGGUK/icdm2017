Here, we focus on a particular class of fuzzy weak preference relations, the so-called fuzzy orderings. The definition of a fuzzy ordering involves a fuzzy equivalence relation and, in this paper, the latter will be considered as the corresponding fuzzy indifference relation. We search for fuzzy strict preference relations compatible with a given fuzzy ordering and its fuzzy indifference relation. In many situations, depending on the t-norm and t-conorm used, this quest results in a unique fuzzy strict preference relation. Our aim is to characterize these fuzzy strict preference relations and to study their transitivity.", "paper_title": "FUZZY STRICT PREFERENCE RELATIONS COMPATIBLE WITH FUZZY ORDERINGS", "paper_id": "WOS:000274916700002"}
