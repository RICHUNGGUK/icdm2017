The greenish ink with nano-particle pigments was injected in the stripe-type pattern with 90 mu m in width and 250 mu m in length by pre-designed inkjet head and driving system, and only green color was tested. The height of transparent rib wall, prepared by lithographic processes, on black matrix is 5.0 mu m. The chromatic coordinates of color filter with greenish subpixel patterns in CIE 1931 standard diagram can achieve in the region of x = 0.3095 +/- 0.04, y = 0.5912 +/- 0.04, brightness of Y= 58.887 for 50 droplets and x = 0.3103 +/- 0.04, y = 0.5784 +/- 0.04, brightness of Y= 60.328 for 41 droplets. The structural surface morphologies of the greenish subpixel patterns remain homogenous, smooth and flatten. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
