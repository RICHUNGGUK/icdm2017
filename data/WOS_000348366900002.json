In this paper, the orders of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are discussed. The orders of IFNs have undesired mathematical properties. By using a special function, a new order of IFNs is proposed. This new type of order has good mathematical properties on algebraic intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (A-IFNs) which is a dense collection of IFNs, and A-IFNs are adequate in most applications.", "paper_title": "The orders of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000348366900002"}
