Both SEEDED PURSUIT EVASION and SHORT SEEDED PURSUIT EVASION are played on undirected graphs with given starting positions for both the cops and the robber. DIRECTED PURSUIT EVASION and its short variant are played on directed graphs, with the players free to choose their starting positions. We show for SEEDED PURSUIT EVASION and DIRECTED PURSUIT EVASION that finding a winning strategy for the cops is AW[*]-hard when we parameterize by the number of cops. Further, we show that the short (k-move) variants of these problems (SHORT SEEDED PURSUIT EVASION and SHORT DIRECTED PURSUIT EVASION) are AM[*]-complete when we parameterize by both the number of cops and turns.
