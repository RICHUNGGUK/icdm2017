While most previous research focuses on the detection of local events, in this paper we propose novel algorithms to energy efficiently detect events of large and global scale. We divide a global event into regional events, so the detection algorithm can be executed distributively inside the network. Our approach also takes advantage of the temporal correlations of sensing data to gain energy efficiency. It uses a bound-suppression mechanism to set bounds and suppresses 'silent' regional events, cutting down the transmissions. Simulation results show that the proposed c-GEDA (Continuous Global Event Detection Algorithm) is efficient to reduce the cost of transmissions, and it gains more than 50% of cost reduction compared with the previous detection approaches.", "paper_title": "Continuous monitoring of global events in sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280104700009"}
