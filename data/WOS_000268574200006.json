We examined the use of RFID technology as the key enabler for building the RHMS to deliver higher business values and provide effective support in transforming and optimizing healthcare practices in the industry. In this study, a prototype RHMS was built and implemented in a quasi-real world setting. The results validate the practical viability of the proposed system architecture. We show that the Information System Design Theory used to develop the RHMS could form the basis for further research. We hope the proposed system architecture and the developed prototype system from this study will help support and further the efforts of both academics and practitioners in RFID research.", "paper_title": "Design of an RFID-based Healthcare Management System using an Information System Design Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000268574200006"}
