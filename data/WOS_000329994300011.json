From the perspective of secondary users, spectrum availability is a time-varying network resource over which multihop end-to-end connections must be maintained. In this paper, a theoretical outlook on the problem of routing secondary user flows in a CRN is provided. The investigation aims to characterize optimal sequences of routes over which a secondary flow is maintained. The optimality is defined according to a novel metric that considers the maintenance cost of a route as channels, and/or links must be switched due to the primary user activity. Different from the traditional notion of route stability, the proposed approach considers subsequent path selections, as well. The problem is formulated as an integer programming optimization model. Properties of the problem are also formally introduced and leveraged to design a heuristic algorithm when information on primary user activity is not complete. Numerical results are presented to assess the optimality gap of the heuristic routing algorithm in realistic CRN scenarios.", "paper_title": "A New Outlook on Routing in Cognitive Radio Networks: Minimum-Maintenance-Cost Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000329994300011"}
