Machine translation and cross language information access are related technologies, and yet they have their own unique contributions in handling information in multiple languages. This paper aims to demonstrate that there are many opportunities to further integrate machine translation with cross language information access, and the combination can greatly empower web users in their information access. Design/methodology/approach - Using English and Chinese as the language pair for studying, this paper looks at machine translation in query translation-based cross language information access at multiple important aspects, which include query translation, relevance feedback, interactive cross language information access, out-of-vocabulary term translation, and data fusion. The goal is to obtain more insights about the wide range usages of machine translation in cross language information access, and to help the community to identify promising future directions for both machine translation and cross language access. Findings - Machine translation can be applied effectively in many places in the whole cross language information access process. Queries translated by a machine translation system are high quality and are more robust in handling potential untranslated terms. Translation enhancement, a relevance feedback method using machine translation generated returned documents, is not only a valid technique by itself, but also helps to generate more robust cross language information access performance when combined with other relevance feedback. techniques. Machine translation is also found to play a significant role in resolving untranslated terms and in data fusion. Originality/value - This set of comparative empirical studies on integrating machine translation and cross language information access was performed on a common evaluation framework, and examined integration at multiple points of the cross language access process. The experimental results demonstrate the value of further integrating machine translation in cross language information access, and identify interesting future directions for both machine translation and cross language information access research.", "paper_title": "Exploring the further integration of machine translation in English-Chinese cross language information access", "paper_id": "WOS:000311475200003"}
