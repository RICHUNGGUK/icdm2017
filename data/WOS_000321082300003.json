Although reducing feedback, this strategy in its plain implementations displays a linear growth in the feedback load with the total number of users in the system n, which is an onerous requirement for large systems. This paper focuses on a more stringent but realistic O (1) feedback constraint on the feedback load. Starting with a set of statistically identical users, we obtain the tradeoff curve tracing the Pareto optimal boundary between feasible and infeasible feedback-capacity pairs for opportunistic beamforming. Any point on this tradeoff curve can be obtained by means of homogeneous decentralized threshold feedback policies, which are rate-wise optimal, in which a user feeds back only if the received signal quality is good enough. The paper includes the derivation of these optimum policies, and further shows to what extent the O (1) feedback constraint must be relaxed to achieve the same sum-rate scaling as with perfect CSI. Extensions of these results to heterogeneous communication environments in which different users experience non-identical path-loss gains are also provided. We also show how threshold feedback policies can be used to provide fairness in a heterogeneous system, while simultaneously achieving optimal capacity scaling. Although most of our results are asymptotic in the sense that they are derived by letting n grow large, they provide promising performance figures with a close match to the asymptotically optimal results when used in finite size systems.
