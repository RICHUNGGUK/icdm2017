In this paper, we devise G-EDF-like (GEL) schedulers, which have identical implementations to G-EDF and therefore the same overheads, but that provide better tardiness bounds. We discuss how to analyze these schedulers and propose methods to determine scheduler parameters to meet several different tardiness bound criteria. We employ linear programs to adjust such parameters to optimize arbitrary tardiness criteria, and to analyze lateness bounds (lateness is related to tardiness). We also propose a particular scheduling algorithm, namely the global fair lateness (G-FL) algorithm, to minimize maximum absolute lateness bounds. Unlike the other schedulers described in this paper, G-FL only requires linear programming for analysis. We argue that our proposed schedulers, such as G-FL, should replace G-EDF for SRT applications.", "paper_title": "Fair lateness scheduling: reducing maximum lateness in G-EDF-like scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000328351200002"}
