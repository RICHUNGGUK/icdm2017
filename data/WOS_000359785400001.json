These temporal effects include user preference drifts and shifts, seasonal effects, inclusion of new users, and items entering the systemand old ones leavinguser and item activity rate fluctuations and other similar time-related phenomena. These phenomena continuously change the underlying relations between users and items that recommendation algorithms essentially try to capture. In the past few years, a new generation of CF algorithms has emerged, using the time dimension as a key factor to improve recommendation models. In this overview, we present a comprehensive analysis of these algorithms and identify important challenges to be faced in the near future.(C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "An overview on the exploitation of time in collaborative filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000359785400001"}
