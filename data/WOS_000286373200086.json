The nature of an underwater sensor network, such as low bandwidth and large propagation latency, floating node mobility, and power efficiency, is significantly different from traditional ground-based wireless sensor networks. Power-efficient communication protocols are thus urgently demanded in the deployment of underwater sensor networks. In this paper, a routing protocol is developed to tackle these problems in underwater wireless sensor networks. A forwarding node selector is employed to determine the appropriate sensors to forward the packets to the destination, and a forwarding tree trimming mechanism is adopted to prevent excess spread of forwarded packets. The proposed protocol is compared with a representative routing protocol for UWSNs in the literature. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed work.
