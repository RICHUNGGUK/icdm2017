To exploit the underlying geometrical structure, NSC-NPE constructs a global information-based dual-objective optimization function for modeling the process data. Besides the local variance information refined by the neighborhood preserving embedding algorithm, NSC-NPE also considers to utilize the meaningful nonlocal variance information via maximizing the Euclidean distance between the points outside the neighbors. The objective that having the local and nonlocal characteristics preserved in the low-dimensional space is achieved by minimizing the local scatter and maximizing the nonlocal scatter simultaneously. The proposed method is applied to fault detection based on the Hotelling's T-2 and squared prediction error (SPE) statistics. Three case studies are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
