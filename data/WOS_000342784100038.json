They achieve energy savings via selected access to L1 cache, but severely decrease system performance. Therefore, a filter cache system should adopt components that balance execution delay against energy savings. In this letter, we analyze the legacy filter cache system and propose Data Filter Cache with Partial Tag Cache (DFPC) as a new solution. The proposed DFPC scheme reduces energy consumption of L1 data cache and does not impair system performance at all. Simulation results show that DFPC provides the 46.36% energy savings without any performance loss.", "paper_title": "Data Filter Cache with Partial Tag Matching for Low Power Embedded Processor", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784100038"}
