Therefore, key aspects of heuristics for the minimum energy multicast problem (MEMP) are low time complexity (measured in the numbers |V| and |A| of networking devices and their possible power assignments, respectively) and low deviation from the optimal energy consumption. Following a center-oriented approach, we develop the STSuS and STESuS algorithms (time complexity O(|V|(2)) and O(|V|(2) log |V|), respectively), and analyze their performance in numerical simulations. They deviate from the optimal energy consumption by only approximate to 11% and approximate to 7.5%, respectively, and thereby outperform the well-known MIP (O(|V|(2)), approximate to 22% deviation) and many other algorithms significantly.
