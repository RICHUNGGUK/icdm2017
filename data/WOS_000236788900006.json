This study bridges that gap by deducing rules-in-use by participants in a human experiment in a multiple-team social dilemma. It then uses a computer simulation to evaluate which of the identified rules-in-use generates the best performance. The results suggest that participants use either a Win-Stay/Lose-Revert strategy or a Win-Cooperate/Lose-Defect strategy. While a mean-Win-Stay/Lose-Revert strategy dominates most often. the Win-Cooperate/Lose-Defect strategy performs better in a two-team than in a single-team setting. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
