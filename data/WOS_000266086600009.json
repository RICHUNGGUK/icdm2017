In this paper, we introduce HTOMs, which have fast algorithm, to the mechanic signal analysis. Concretely speaking, the mechanic signals are transformed by various HTOMs, which can be generated easily by varying any one of two parameters in the same program, then the performance of the transform results is compared by viewing FDC as the evaluation criterion, and the most optimal HTOM is achieved, which provides guidance and reference for the HTOMs applied in the signal analysis.
