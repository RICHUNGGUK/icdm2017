The set up of general boundary conditions and communication structures for parallel computations should be accomplished during the pre-processing phase of the analysis, if possible, to ensure efficient computations for large scale problems in computational fluid dynamics. This paper introduces a general methodology for geometry based boundary condition application and pre-computing of parallel communication tasks.", "paper_title": "Geometry based pre-processor for parallel fluid dynamic simulations using a hierarchical basis", "paper_id": "WOS:000252539700002"}
