The online tool presents extracted phosphorylation objects (phosphorylated proteins, phosphorylation sites and protein kinases) in summary tables and full reports with evidence-tagged abstracts. The tool further allows mapping of phosphorylated proteins to protein entries in the UniProt Knowledgebase based on PubMed ID and/or protein name. The literature mining, coupled with database association, allows retrieval of rich biological information for the phosphorylated proteins and facilitates database annotation of phosphorylation features.", "paper_title": "An online literature mining tool for protein phosphorylation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238905700021"}
