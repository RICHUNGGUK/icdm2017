This study employs micro-computed tomography (mu CT) and image techniques for analysing the anisotropy of regenerative medicine polymer scaffolds. For this purpose, three three-dimensional anisotropy evaluation image methods were used: ellipsoid of inertia (EI), mean intercept length (MIL) and tensor scale (t-scale). These were applied to three patterns (a sphere, a cube and a right prism) and to two polymer scaffold topologies (cylindrical orthogonal pore mesh and spherical pores). For the patterns, the three methods provided good results. Regarding the scaffolds, EI mistook both topologies (0.0158, [-0.5683; 0.6001]; mean difference and 95% confidence interval), and MIL showed no significant differences (0.3509, [0.0656; 0.6362]). T-scale is the preferable method because it gave the best capability (0.3441, [0.1779; 0.5102]) to differentiate both topologies. This methodology results in the development of non-destructive tools to engineer biomimetic scaffolds, incorporating anisotropy as a fundamental property to be mimicked from the original tissue and permitting its assessment by means of mu CT image analysis.", "paper_title": "Micro-computed tomography image-based evaluation of 3D anisotropy degree of polymer scaffolds", "paper_id": "WOS:000343708500011"}
