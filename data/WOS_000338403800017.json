By utilizing the intermittent pinning control idea, a novel controller is designed to pin the coupled networks to reach the synchronization state. Some sufficient criteria are derived in matrix inequalities form by resorting to the generalized Halanay inequality, which guarantee the subnetworks synchronizing exponentially. Two numerical examples are finally exploited to show the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
