However, in high-tech industry such as semiconductor manufacturing, many factors that are interrelated affect the yield of fabricated wafers. Engineers who rely on personal domain knowledge cannot find possible root causes of defects rapidly and effectively. This study aims to develop a framework for data mining and knowledge discovery from database that consists of a Kruskal Wallis test, K-means clustering, and the variance reduction splitting criterion to investigate the huge amount of semiconductor manufacturing data and infer possible causes of faults and manufacturing process variations. The extracted information and knowledge is helpful to engineers as a basis for trouble shooting and defect diagnosis. We validated this approach with an empirical study in a semiconductor foundry company in Taiwan and the results demonstrated the practical viability of this approach. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
