During the last years, notable efforts have been made to develop reliable and robust monitoring systems based on different types of sensors such as cutting force and torque, motor current and effective power, vibrations, acoustic emission or audible sound energy. This work is focused on this last sensor technology. The basic objective is to characterise the audible sound energy signals generated during different machining operations carried out on a milling machine. In order to achieve this, rotation speed, feed and depth of cut have been analysed separately. The main contributions of this work are, on the one hand, the application of a systematic methodology to set up the cutting tests and, on the other hand, the independent signal analysis of the noise generated by the milling machine used for the cutting tests in order to filter this noise out from the signals obtained during the actual material processing. The classification of audible sound signal features for process monitoring has been obtained by graphical analysis and parallel distributed data processing using a supervised neural network (NN) paradigm.", "paper_title": "Cutting parameters analysis for the development of a milling process monitoring system based on audible energy sound", "paper_id": "WOS:000262578000004"}
