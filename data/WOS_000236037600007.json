Variables single, and double sampling plans are proposed for the lot acceptance of parts whose life follows a Weibull distribution with known shape parameter. The proposed plans are different from the existing ones in that the lot acceptance criteria do not depend on the estimated scale parameter. Design parameters of both sampling plans are determined by using the usual two-point approach. The number of groups is determined independently of the group size, and even independently of the shape parameter. Also, the double sampling plan can reduce the average number of groups required. The effects of mis-specification of the shape parameter on the probability of accepting the lots under the single sampling plan are analyzed & discussed.", "paper_title": "Variables sampling plans for Weibull distributed lifetimes under sudden death testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000236037600007"}
