In this contribution we combine the median c-means algorithm with the fuzzy c-means approach, which is only applicable for vectorial (metric) data in its original variant. For the resulted median fuzzy c-means approach we prove convergence and investigate the behavior of the algorithm in several experiments including real world data from psychotherapy research.
