In this paper, we introduce locally initiating line-based object association with the parallel projection camera model, which can be applicable to the situation without the common ( ground) plane. The parallel projection camera model supports the camera movement (i.e., panning, tilting and zooming) by using the simple table based compensation for non-ideal camera parameters. We propose the threshold distance based homographic line generation algorithm. This takes account of uncertain parameters such as transformation error, height uncertainty of objects and synchronization issue between cameras. Thus, the proposed algorithm associates multiple objects on demand in the surveillance system where the camera movement dynamically changes. We verify the proposed method with actual image frames. Finally, we discuss the strategy to improve the association performance by using the temporal and spatial redundancy.", "paper_title": "Locally Initiating Line-Based Object Association in Large Scale Multiple Cameras Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000279378500010"}
