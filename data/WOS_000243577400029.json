Several reports have clustered cell line drug activity profiles as well as drug activity-gene expression correlation profiles and noted that the resulting groupings differ but still reflect mechanism of action. The present paper shows that these discrepancies can be viewed as a weighting of drug-drug distances, the weights depending on which cell lines the two drugs differ in.", "paper_title": "In vitro drug sensitivity-gene expression correlations involve a tissue of origin dependency", "paper_id": "WOS:000243577400029"}
