We consider the video quality of TV channels and the channel zapping time as quality of experience metrics. The proposed algorithm controls the channel distribution state and the target bit rate of TV channels based on the channel preference information of subscribers to achieve an effective trade-off between channel zapping time and video quality. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
