These decisions are often converted into valuable knowledge needed by other people in decision positions. For example, students becoming leaders need knowledge about leadership to make good judgments. When the situation is sensitive, perhaps concerning personal changes or an unfamiliar business strategy, leaders need opinions and not just those from people involved in the company. An artificial system allows us to replicate a system of opinions and observations from outside advisors, which is why we base our research on this kind of system. In this paper we present a knowledge representation for a knowledge-based leadership system used in the experimental system we are developing.", "paper_title": "Knowledge representation for knowledge based leadership system", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000043"}
