The first one aggregates the transitive closure (R) over bar of R with a (maximal) T-transitive relation B contained in R. The second one computes the closest homotecy of (R) over bar or B to better fit their entries with the ones of R. The third method uses nonlinear programming techniques to obtain the best approximation with respect to the Euclidean distance for T the Lukasiewicz or the product t-norm. The previous methods do not apply for the minimum t-norm. An algorithm to approximate a given proximity relation by a Mintransitive relation (a similarity) is given in the last section of the paper.", "paper_title": "How to Make T-Transitive a Proximity Relation", "paper_id": "WOS:000263225100017"}
