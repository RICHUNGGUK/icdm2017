This algorithm uses the unstructured grids to obtain good computational efficiency and geometric flexibility. A novelty cell-wise data reconstruction scheme based on least square method is derived to achieve second-order spatial accuracy. A well-posed PML is applied to truncate computational domain by absorbing outgoing electromagnetic waves. The explicit Runge-Kutta scheme is employed to solve the semidiscrete Maxwell's equations. Several numerical results are presented to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
