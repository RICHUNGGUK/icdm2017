With the advances in computational power and sophisticated sensors, home safety is being ensured with the help of robots. This study proposes SSPR, a SIP-enabled Surveillance Patrol Robot which tracks a moving object actively and informs the householder of security issues for the home environment. Such a robot is equipped with a camera and is aware of session initiation protocol (SIP). When SSPR senses a moving object, it starts tracking and initiates a SIP call to the mobile device of the householder. SIP will establish both audio and video streams between SSPR and the mobile device. Thus, the householder is able to get the whole picture of the home status through his/her mobile device. With the mobility support in SIP, SSPR can switch its wireless link adaptively to another access point (AP) and the audio and video streams will continue after handoff. As a result, SSPR can complement the security routine and make a home smarter and safer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
