We then compute the intrinsic volumes of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices over the real numbers, over the complex numbers, and over the quaternions in terms of integrals related to Mehta's integral. In particular, we obtain a closed formula for the probability that the solution of a random (standard Gaussian) semidefinite program has a certain rank.", "paper_title": "Intrinsic volumes of symmetric cones and applications in convex programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000347830300004"}
