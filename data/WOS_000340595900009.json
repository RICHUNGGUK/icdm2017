Conventionally a number of deployment rules are specified for these applications. This paper studies a practically important problem of rule checking over RFID tags, i.e., checking whether the specified rules are satisfied according to the RFID tags within the monitoring area. This rule checking function may need to be executed frequently over a large number of tags and therefore should be made efficient in terms of execution time. Aiming to achieve time efficiency, we respectively propose two protocols, CRCP and ECRCP. CRCP works based on collision detection, while ECRCP combines the collision detection and the logical features of the rules. Simulation results indicate that our protocols achieve much better performance than other solutions in terms of time efficiency.", "paper_title": "Check out the Rules: Towards Time-Efficient Rule Checking over RFID Tags", "paper_id": "WOS:000340595900009"}
