Two different utility functions are designed for primary users and secondary users respectively based on marketing mechanism to formulate the decide module mathematically. Also, we adopt expectation and learning process in the utility design which considers the variance of channels, transmission forecasting, afore trading histories and etc. A double auction based spectrum trading scheme is established and implemented in two scenarios assorted from the supply-and-demand relationship i.e. LPMS (Less PNs and More SNs) and MPLS (More PNs and Less SNs). After the discussion of the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, numerical results with four bidding strategies of SNs are presented to reinforce the effectiveness of the proposed utility evaluation based decision modules under two scenarios. Besides, we prove that the proposed behavior model based spectrum access method maintains frequency efficiency comparable with traditional centralized cognitive access approaches and reduces the network deployment cost.", "paper_title": "Behavior modeling for spectrum sharing in wireless cognitive networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000309864500004"}
