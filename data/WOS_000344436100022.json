The ideal or balanced curves determine the number and size of feet that should appear in a forest with certain characteristics. These curves have traditionally been defined and applied to uneven-aged stands, and relate diameter with number of stems. However it is also possible to construct similar curves to manage stands composed of even-aged units. This paper proposes and compares alternative methodologies, based on yield tables, for establishing distribution curves for height/number of stems for Pinus sylvestris L. Based on the yield tables for this specie, it can be seen that the \"direct\" methods correspond more closely to the original chart, but also require highly complex calculations. However, estimation methods based on the use of kernel functions are generally simpler and can produce similar results, with the correct choice of smoothing parameter. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
