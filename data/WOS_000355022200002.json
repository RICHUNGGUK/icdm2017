To this end, the semantic of profile tolerance in ASME Y14.5.1M is reviewed and the mathematical definition of profile tolerance is discussed. Subsequently, a mathematical model for error evaluation is built. This mathematical model is augmented based on distance function by considering the second-order terms in the computation of the distance from point to surface. Then, a profile error evaluation algorithm, which combines Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm and Nelder-Mead (NM) algorithm, is developed to solve this model. The proposed model and optimization algorithm are validated with simulation results from a case study. Additionally, the model is superior to Least-squares (LS) model in simplicity, efficiency and robustness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
