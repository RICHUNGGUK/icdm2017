Since its introduction in the 1970s, a lot of variants have been proposed to cope with the different network conditions we can have (e.g., wired networks, wireless networks, satellite links) and nowadays Linux OS includes 13 different TCP variants. The aim of this paper is to offer a comparative analysis of the behavior of the different TCP Linux variants, in terms of throughput, fairness, and friendliness. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
