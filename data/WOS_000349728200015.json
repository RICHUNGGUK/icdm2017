The functions expressing the cited constraints must satisfy certain smoothness conditions, and other types of restrictions are simultaneously possible, but the effect of dimensional reduction will be proportional to the number of equality constraints. The objective functions under study do not need to be differentiable or even continuous, and it is shown that the optimization task will be executed so that candidate points remain in the corresponding submanifolds, evolving there during the whole optimization process. The proposed paradigm may be employed jointly with an extensive family of already established metaheuristics. After introducing the fundamental ideas and establishing the theoretical basis, some examples will illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
