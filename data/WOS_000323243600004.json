We outline the current situation in ethnomusicological archives as well as the specificity of the use of ethnomusicological collections, in order to highlight the relevance of the development of appropriate access tools. We propose a novel system for intuitive exploration of ethnomusicological recordings which combines a geographical visual interface with ethnomusicological annotation and audio similarity matching, with the novel addition of dynamic location tracking. The starting point for designing the interface was a subset of the Cantometrics Training Tapes dataset, which was assembled by the ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax. For representing music tracks we use our manual musical and geographic annotation along with Lomax's tags and comments. The novelty of the approach lies in the design of the interface allowing for a comprehensive representation of many layers of information specific to the needs of the users of ethnomusicological archives. This system allows integration of MIR tools, including low level and high level similarity search, and the visualization of their results. It displays a unique location tracking feature, where a dynamic highlighting device helps the user experience geographic distances between similar tracks and the cultures they originate from. A proof-of-concept implementation is presented, and evaluated according to three interrelated levels: a basic level of functionality (identifying and using components of the interface), a middle level concerned with the benefits and use of the software, and a reference to high level concerned with the social and cultural value of a system. Further research plans and suggestions are outlined.", "paper_title": "A Location-Tracking Interface for Ethnomusicological Collections", "paper_id": "WOS:000323243600004"}
