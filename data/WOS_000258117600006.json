A tagged Bengali news corpus has been developed from the web archive of a widely read Bengali newspaper. A web crawler retrieves the web pages in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) format from the news archive. At present, the corpus contains approximately 34 million wordforms. Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems based on pattern based shallow parsing with or without using linguistic knowledge have been developed using a part of this corpus. The NER system that uses linguistic knowledge has performed better yielding highest F-Score values of 75.40%, 72.30%, 71.37%, and 70.13% for person, location, organization, and miscellaneous names, respectively.", "paper_title": "A web-based Bengali news corpus for named entity recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000258117600006"}
