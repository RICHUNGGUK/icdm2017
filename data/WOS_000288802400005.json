A unitary extension principle is established; in particular, for a general expansive matrix A with |det A| = 2, an explicit construction of Parseval framelets is obtained. Some examples are also provided to illustrate the generality of our theory.", "paper_title": "GMRA-BASED CONSTRUCTION OF FRAMELETS IN REDUCING SUBSPACES OF L-2(R-d)", "paper_id": "WOS:000288802400005"}
