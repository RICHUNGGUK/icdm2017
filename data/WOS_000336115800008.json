High rates of such activity may have clinical relevance. This paper presents wavelet (WT) analyses to detect phasic EMG, examining both Symlet and Daubechies approaches. Feature extraction included 1 s epoch processing with 24 WT-based features and dimensionality reduction involved comparing two techniques: principal component analysis and a feature/variable selection algorithm. Classification was conducted using a linear classifier. Valid automated detection was obtained in comparison to expert human judgment with high (> 90%) classification performance for 11/12 datasets.
