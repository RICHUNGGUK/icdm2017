These pictures can be provided by shooting just one camera several times when reconstructing a static object, or a set of synchronized cameras, when dealing with a human or any other moving object. We suppress the colour seams due to image misalignments and irregular lighting conditions that multi-texturing approaches typically suffer from, while minimizing the blurring effect introduced by colour blending techniques. Our system is robust enough to compensate for the almost inevitable inaccuracies of 3D meshes obtained with visual hull-based techniques: errors in silhouette segmentation, inherently bad handling of concavities, etc.", "paper_title": "Seamless, Static Multi-Texturing of 3D Meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000350145600018"}
