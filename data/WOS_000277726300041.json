Since conventional query-by-text retrieval cannot satisfy users' requirements in finding the desired videos effectively, content-based video retrieval is regarded as one of the most practical solutions to improve the retrieval quality. In addition, video retrieval using query-by-image is not successful in associating the videos with user's interest either. In this paper, we propose an innovative method to achieve the high quality of content-based video retrieval by discovering the temporal patterns in the video contents. On basis of the discovered temporal patterns, an efficient indexing technique and an effective sequence matching technique are integrated to reduce the computation cost and to raise the retrieval accuracy, respectively. Experimental results reveal that our approach is very promising in enhancing content-based video retrieval in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
