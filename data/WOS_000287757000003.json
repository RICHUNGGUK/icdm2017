This first competition uses the so-called ADAB database with Arabic on-line handwritten words. At this first competition, 3 groups with 7 different systems have participated. The systems were tested on known data (training datasets made available for the participants, sets 1 to 3) and on one test dataset that is unknown to all participants (set 4). The systems are compared on the most important characteristic of classification systems, the recognition rate. Additionally, the relative speed of the different systems was compared. A short description of the participating groups, their systems, the experimental setup, and the performed results is presented.", "paper_title": "On-line Arabic handwriting recognition competition", "paper_id": "WOS:000287757000003"}
