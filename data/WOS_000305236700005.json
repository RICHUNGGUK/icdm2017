These new paradigms create new threats for security such as pollution attacks and denial of services (DoS). These attacks exploit the difficulty to authenticate data in such contexts. The particular case of xor network coding is considered herein. We investigate different strategies based on message authentication codes algorithms (MACs) to thwart these attacks. Yet, classical MAC designs are not compatible with the linear combination of network coding. Fortunately, MACs based on universal hash functions (UHFs) match nicely the needs of network coding: some of these functions are linear h(x1?x2) = h(x1)?h(x2). To demonstrate their efficiency, we consider the case of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Although these functions can drastically reduce the energy consumption of authentication (up to 68% gain over the classical designs is observed), they increase the threat of DoS. Indeed, an adversary can disrupt all communications by polluting few messages. To overcome this problem, a group testing algorithm is introduced for authentication resulting in a complexity linear in the number of attacks. The energy consumption is analyzed for cross-point and butterfly network topologies with respect to the possible attack scenarios. The results highlight the trade-offs between energy efficiency, authentication and the effective throughput for the different MAC modes.
