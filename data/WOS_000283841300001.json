This result was extended by Sadeghi et al. to a small class of lattices based on Construction D' only. In this paper, we prove a key theorem which relates the minimum distance of every lattice to the minimum distance of its label code. Then, using this powerful tool along with some new bounds on minimum distance of cycle-free group codes, we generalize those results to a large class of lattices here called RPS and PFP lattices. More importantly, we show that this class of cycle-free lattices are not so good in the view of coding gain.", "paper_title": "ON CYCLE-FREE LATTICES WITH HIGH RATE LABEL CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000283841300001"}
