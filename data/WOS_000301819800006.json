Based on a pay-as-you-go model, it enables hosting of pervasive applications from consumer, scientific, and business domains. However, data centers hosting Cloud applications consume huge amounts of electrical energy, contributing to high operational costs and carbon footprints to the environment. Therefore, we need Green Cloud computing solutions that can not only minimize operational costs but also reduce the environmental impact. In this paper, we define an architectural framework and principles for energy-efficient Cloud computing. Based on this architecture, we present our vision, open research challenges, and resource provisioning and allocation algorithms for energy-efficient management of Cloud computing environments. The proposed energy-aware allocation heuristics provision data center resources to client applications in a way that improves energy efficiency of the data center, while delivering the negotiated Quality of Service (QoS). In particular, in this paper we conduct a survey of research in energy-efficient computing and propose: (a) architectural principles for energy-efficient management of Clouds; (b) energy-efficient resource allocation policies and scheduling algorithms considering QoS expectations and power usage characteristics of the devices; and (c) a number of open research challenges, addressing which can bring substantial benefits to both resource providers and consumers. We have validated our approach by conducting a performance evaluation study using the CloudSim toolkit. The results demonstrate that Cloud computing model has immense potential as it offers significant cost savings and demonstrates high potential for the improvement of energy efficiency under dynamic workload scenarios.
