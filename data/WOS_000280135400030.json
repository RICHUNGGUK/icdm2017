We propose an original method that produces motions that preserve the statistical properties of a reference motion while ensuring some constraints. This method uses principles of conditional stochastic simulation to achieve this goal. Notably, a new real time algorithm, performing sequentially and producing the desired motion is introduced. Possible applications of our method are numerous and several examples are given, along with results.
