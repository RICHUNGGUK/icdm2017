A game is specified by the omega-language which contains the plays won by Player 2. We analyze omega-languages generated from certain classes K of regular languages of finite words (called *-languages), using natural transformations of *-languages into omega-languages. Winning strategies for infinite games can be represented again in terms of *-languages. Continuing work of Selivanov (2007) and Rabinovich et al. (2007), we analyze how these \"strategy *-languages\" are related to the original language class K. In contrast to that work, we exhibit classes K where strategy representations strictly exceed K.", "paper_title": "LANGUAGES VERSUS omega-LANGUAGES IN REGULAR INFINITE GAMES", "paper_id": "WOS:000309470000003"}
