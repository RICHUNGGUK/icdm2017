Namely, the classes Max(PR)(X -> D) and Max(Rec)(X -> D) of functions X -> D which are pointwise maximum of partial or total computable sequences of functions where D = (D, <) is some computable partially ordered set. The enumeration theorem and the invariance theorem always hold for Max(PR)(X -> D), leading to a variant K-max(D) of Kolmogorov complexity. We characterize the orders D such that the enumeration theorem (resp. the invariance theorem) also holds for Max(Rec)(X -> D). It turns out that Max(Rec)(X -> D) may satisfy the invariance theorem but not the enurneration theorem. Also, when Max(Rec)(X -> D) satisfies the invariance theorem then the Kolmogorov complexities associated to Max(Rec)(X -> D) and Max(PR)(X -> D) are equal (up to a constant). Letting K-min(D) = K-max(Drev), where D-rev is the reverse order, we prove that either K-min(D) =ctK(max)(D)=ctK(D) (=(ct) is equality up to a constant) or K-min(D), K-max(D) are <=(ct) incomparable and <(ct) K-D and >(ct) K-0,K-D. We characterize the orders leading to each case. We also show that K-min(D), K-max(D) cannot be both much smaller than K-D at any point. These results are proved in a more general setting with two orders on D, one extending the other. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
