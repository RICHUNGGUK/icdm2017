However, there are some flaws existing in both schemes. Therefore, a new scheme for improving these drawbacks is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme has the following benefits: (1) it complies with all the requirements for multi-server environments; (2) it can withstand all the well-known attacks at the present time; (3) it is equipped with a more secure key agreement procedure; and (4) it is quite efficient in terms of the cost of computation and transmission. In addition, the analysis and comparisons show that the proposed scheme outperforms the other related schemes in various aspects.", "paper_title": "Towards secure and efficient user authentication scheme using smart card for multi-server environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000326461100025"}
