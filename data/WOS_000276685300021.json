To achieve this energy saving without scarifying streaming quality, the base station must carefully construct the burst schedule for all TV channels. This is called the burst scheduling problem. In this paper, we prove that the burst scheduling problem for TV channels with arbitrary bit rates is NP-complete. We then propose a practical simplification of the general problem, which allows TV channels to be classified into multiple classes, and the bit rates of the classes have power of two increments, e.g., 100, 200, and 400 kbps. Using this practical simplification, we propose an optimal and efficient burst scheduling algorithm. We present theoretical analysis, simulation, and actual implementation in a mobile TV testbed to demonstrate the optimality, practicality, and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "On Burst Transmission Scheduling in Mobile TV Broadcast Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000276685300021"}
