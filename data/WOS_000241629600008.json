We discuss in detail how to identify frequent patterns in a protein sequence database using a level-wise search technique, how to define a set of features from those patterns and how to use those features in the prediction of the secondary structure of a protein sequence using support vector machines (SVMs). Results: Three different sets of features based on frequent patterns are evaluated in a blind testing setup using 150 targets from the EVA contest and compared to predictions of PSI-PRED, PHD and PROFsec. Despite being trained on only 940 proteins, a simple SVM classifier based on this new representation yields results comparable to PSI-PRED and PROFsec. Finally, we show that the method contributes significant information to consensus predictions.", "paper_title": "A new representation for protein secondary structure prediction based on frequent patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000241629600008"}
