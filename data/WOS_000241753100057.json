Due to the dynamic nature of the network topology and restricted resources, quality of service (QoS) and multicast routing in MANET is a challenging task. It attracts the interests of many people. In this paper, we present a fuzzy controllers based QoS routing algorithm with a multiclass scheme (FQRA) in MANET. The performance of this scheduler is studied using NS2 and evaluated in terms of quantitative met-rics such as path success ratio, average end-to-end delay and throughput. Simu-lation shows that the approach is efficient, promising and applicable in MANET.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy controllers based QoS routing algorithm with a multiclass scheme for ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100057"}
