The CD characteristic of this logic style regardless of the logic type makes it suitable in implementing complicated logic expressions such as addition. CD logic exhibits a unique characteristic where the output is pre-evaluated before the inputs from the preceding stage is ready. This feature offers performance advantage over static and dynamic domino logic styles in a single-cycle multistage circuit block. Several design considerations including timing window width adjustment and clock distribution are discussed. Using 65-nm general-purpose CMOS technology, the proposed logic demonstrates an average speedup of 94% and 56% over static and dynamic domino logic, respectively, in five different logic gates. Simulation results of 8-bit ripple carry adders show that CD logic is 39% and 23% faster than the static and dynamic-based adders, respectively. CD logic also demonstrates 39% speedup and 64% (22%) energy-delay product (EDP) reduction from static logic at 100% (10%) data activity in 32-bit carry lookahead adders. For 8-bit Wallace tree multiplier, CD logic achieves a similar speedup with at least 50% EDP reduction across all data activities.", "paper_title": "Constant Delay Logic Style", "paper_id": "WOS:000315639900015"}
