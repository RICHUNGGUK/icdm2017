Their evolution and interaction behaviours form business service ecosystem (BSE). In this environment, service providers adopt different business strategies, such as promotion alliance and industry association, thereby forming relationships of cooperation and competition, which have a significant influence on services selection. However, most current related works consider business services to be static and independent, and some works consider correlation but without classification and analysis of correlation types, which is very important to investigate their different influences. In this research, first, a business correlation framework (BCF) is proposed to formally classify and describe business correlations. Then, a business service correlation model (BSCM) is established to model actual BSE, supporting correlation modelling. Next, a correlation-aware services selection model (CaSSM) is investigated. Finally, a case study of marine logistic service indicates the effectiveness of BCF and BSCM, and the selection result shows that a higher quality of service and performance can be achieved by CaSSM.", "paper_title": "Business correlation-aware modelling and services selection in business service ecosystem", "paper_id": "WOS:000322616900007"}
