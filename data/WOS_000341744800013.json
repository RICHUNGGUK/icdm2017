To overcome the burst path losses over the Internet, we propose a transmission scheme dubbed TRAding DElay for Reliability (TRADER), which appropriately spreads out the FEC (Forward Error Correction) packets' departures with respect to the delay constraint. The network measurements from a video conferencing system and the PlanetLab demonstrate that the transmission delays to different destinations mainly differ by 100-250 ms. Motivated by this observation, we present a mathematical formulation and a systematic design to effectively leverage the delay differences for optimizing the receivers' video quality. The superiority of TRADER over existing transmission schemes is analyzed based on Gilbert model and continuous time Markov chain. We conduct performance evaluation via semi-physical emulations in Exata and experimental results show that TRADER outperforms the previous approaches in improving video quality in terms of PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio).
