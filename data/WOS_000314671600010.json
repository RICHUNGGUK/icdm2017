Human gait cycles for walking and running are examples of the latter. Fast and flexible DES is made possible by linear interpolation for both motion types. It gives close approximation to finite Fourier series that model natural gait cycles. We use the simulator as the building block in simulating a futuristic tele-immersive collaboration system with arbitrary multi-actor collaboration scenario from remote locations. The silhouette area from the visualization of simulated moving human bodies is the main feature in synthesizing transient traffic that would result from such collaboration system. It will be useful as the input traffic for DES of arbitrary networks in future work. We demonstrate how to apply the simulation framework to simulate a scenario of collaborative dancing and singing that involves four performers with both motion types from two different places. Through the scenario we also show how the simulator works as a novel transient-traffic generator. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
