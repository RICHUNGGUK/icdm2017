This paper proposes a novel joint Packet Scheduling and Radio Resource Assignment algorithm for WiMAX Networks. Our algorithms can effectively assign the suitable slots to meet the QoS requirements of the different service type flows while taking the throughput and fairness into considerations. The effectiveness of our algorithms have been demonstrated through extensive analysis and simulation data. The results show that our algorithms greatly improve the throughput with relatively low complexity.", "paper_title": "Joint Packet Scheduling and Radio Resource Assignment for WiMAX Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000297961000002"}
