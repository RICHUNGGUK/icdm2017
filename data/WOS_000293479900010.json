In this paper, we have proposed an efficient scheduling scheme for IEEE 802.16j networks, which maximizes the number of connections that are scheduled in a particular time slot. The proposed scheme schedules the connections based on their priority, which is decided by the quality of service (QoS) requirement of the connections. A selected connection can be scheduled in the current timeslot only if it is not having interference with any of the already scheduled connections. Our algorithm considers scheduling of lower priority connections even if any higher priority connection is not scheduled due to interference. Thus, the delay for lower priority connections is reduced without increasing the delay for higher priority connections. In addition, our algorithm achieves higher frame utilization and higher system throughput by reducing the length of the schedule. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
