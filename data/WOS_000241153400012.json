European Journal of Operational Research, 141, 339-347] for solving the disk packing problem with equilibrium constraints. An efficient strategy of accelerating the search process is introduced in the gradient method to shorten the execution time. A number of computational results are presented, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
