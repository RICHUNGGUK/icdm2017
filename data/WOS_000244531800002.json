A representative database of technical articles was extracted from the Science Citation Index for the year 2002, with each article containing at least one author with a Mexican address. Many different manual and statistical clustering methods were used to identify the structure of the technical literature (especially the science and technology core competencies), and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each technique. Each method is summarized, and its results presented.", "paper_title": "Clustering methodologies for identifying country core competencies", "paper_id": "WOS:000244531800002"}
