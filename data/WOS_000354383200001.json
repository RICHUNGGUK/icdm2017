In the context of coloring, strong spatial mixing has been established for Kelly trees in (Ge and Stefankovic, arXiv:1102.2886v3 (2011)) when q*+1where q the number of colors, is the degree and *=1.763.. is the unique solution to xe-1/x=1. It has also been established in (Goldberg et al., SICOMP 35 (2005) 486-517) for bounded degree lattice graphs whenever q*-for some constant , where is the maximum vertex degree of the graph. We establish strong spatial mixing for a more general problem, namely list coloring, for arbitrary bounded degree triangle-free graphs. Our results hold for any >*whenever the size of the list of each vertex v is at least (v)+where (v)is the degree of vertex v and is a constant that only depends on . The result is obtained by proving the decay of correlations of marginal probabilities associated with graph nodes measured using a suitably chosen error function. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
