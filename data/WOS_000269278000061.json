In order to succeed, control policies must look ahead to determine stabilizing actions, but such planning is complicated by frequent ground contacts that produce a discontinuous search space. This paper introduces a locomotion system that generates high-quality animation of agile movements using nonlinear controllers that plan through such contact changes. We demonstrate the general applicability of this approach by emulating walking and running motions in rigid-body simulations. Then we consolidate these controllers under a higher-level planner that interactively controls the character's direction.", "paper_title": "Contact-aware Nonlinear Control of Dynamic Characters", "paper_id": "WOS:000269278000061"}
