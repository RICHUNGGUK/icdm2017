Firstly, WPC discovers potentially interesting pages based on ontology-assisted focused crawler. Then, FSC analyzes the interesting pages and determines whether these pages subsume searchable forms based on structural characteristics. Lastly, FCC identifies searchable forms that belong to a given domain in the semantic level, and stores these URLs of Domain-Specific searchable forms to a database. Through a detailed experimental evaluation, WFF framework not only simplifies discovering process, but also effectively determines Domain-Specific databases.", "paper_title": "Research on Discovering Deep Web Entries", "paper_id": "WOS:000295127500014"}
