Our method consists of first extracting geometric features from the induction data and then matching them to precomputed data for known objects from a given dictionary. The matching step relies on fundamental properties of conductive polarization tensors and new invariance properties introduced in this paper. A new shape identification scheme is developed and tested in numerical simulations in the presence of measurement noise. Resolution and stability properties of the proposed identification algorithm are investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
