We show that simultaneous optimization of pipe diameters and nodal positions (topology and geometry optimization) results for fluid networks in a better optimization strategy than traditionally used ground-structure approach (topology optimization only), as opposed to the linear truss case. We also show how the results for linear flow networks can be easily carried out to nonlinear transient and turbulent cases. Stating the optimality conditions for the latter types of flow, we give an alternative derivation of generalized Murray's law, which is well-known in physiology. We illustrate our theoretical findings with numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous optimization of topology and geometry of flow networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000242613500002"}
