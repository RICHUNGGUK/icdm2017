We prove, in particular, that with probability 1-o(n(-1)) (resp. with probability 1-o(n(-c)) for any c >= 1) there is a unique vertex with the maximal label in the graph G having n vertices. In the first case, the size of labels is O (logn) with probability 1-o(n(-1)) and the expected value of the size of labels is also O (logn). In the second case, the size of labels is O ((logn)(log* n)(2)) with probability 1-o(n(-c)) for any c >= 1; their expected size is O ((logn)(log* n)). We analyse a basic Simple maximum broadcasting algorithm and prove that if vertices of a graph G use the same probabilistic distribution to choose a label then, for broadcasting the maximal label over the labelled graph, each vertex sends O (logn) messages with probability 1-o(n(-1)). From these probabilistic procedures we deduce Monte Carlo algorithms for electing or computing a spanning tree in anonymous graphs without any initial knowledge and for counting vertices of an anonymous ring; these algorithms are correct with probability 1-o(n(-1)) or with probability 1-o(n(-c)) for any c >= 1. The size of messages has the same value as the size of labels. The number of messages is O(m logn) for electing and computing a spanning tree; it is O (n logn) for counting the vertices of a ring. These algorithms can be easily extended to also ensure for each vertex v an error probability bounded by epsilon(v); the error probability epsilon(v), is decided by v in a totally decentralised way. We illustrate the power of the splitting procedure by giving a probabilistic election algorithm for rings having n vertices with identities which is correct and always terminates; its message complexity is equal to O(n logn) with probability 1-o(n(-1)).
