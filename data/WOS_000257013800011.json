Learning English involves memorization and practice of a large number of vocabulary words and numerous grammatical structures. Vocabulary learning is a principal issue for English learning because vocabulary comprises the basic building blocks of English sentences. Therefore, many studies have attempted to improve the efficiency and performance when learning English vocabulary. With the accelerated growth in wireless and mobile technologies, mobile learning using mobile devices such as PDAs, tablet PCs, and cell phones has gradually become considered effective because it inherits all the advantages of e-learning and overcomes limitations of learning time and space that limit web-based learning systems. Therefore, this study presents a personalized mobile English vocabulary learning system based on Item Response Theory and learning memory cycle, which recommends appropriate English vocabulary for learning according to individual learner vocabulary ability and memory cycle. The proposed system has been successfully implemented on personal digital assistant (PDA) for personalized English vocabulary learning. The experimental results indicated that the proposed system could obviously promote the learning performances and interests of learners due to effective and flexible learning mode for English vocabulary learning.
