The platform measured effects of postural perturbations in static and dynamic conditions. This paper describes the implementation of an FSP using force-sensing resistors as sensing elements. Real-time qualitative assessment utilized a rainbow color scale to identify areas with high force concentration. Postprocessing of the logged data provided end-users with quantitative measures of postural control. The objective of this research was to establish the feasibility of using an FSP to test and gauge human postural control. Tests were conducted in eye open and eye close states. Readings obtained were tested for repeatability using a one-way analysis of variance test. The platform gauged postural sway by measuring the area of distribution for the weighted center of applied pressure at the foot. A fuzzy clustering algorithm was applied to identify regions of the foot with repetitive pressure concentration. Potential application of the platform in a clinical setting includes monitoring rehabilitation progress of stability dysfunction. The platform functions as a qualitative tool for initial, on-the-spot assessment, and quantitative measure for postacquisition assessment on balance abilities.", "paper_title": "Determining Level of Postural Control in Young Adults Using Force-Sensing Resistors", "paper_id": "WOS:000293660300014"}
