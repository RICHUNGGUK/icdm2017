However, in its basic form, it is not suitable for use in problems which contain periodic attributes, such as oscillator phase, hour of day or directional heading. A commonly used technique of trigonometrically encoding periodic input attributes to artificially generate the required topology introduces a systematic error. In this paper, a metric which induces a conceptually correct topology for periodic attributes is embedded into the K-means algorithm. This requires solving a non-convex minimization problem in the maximization step. Results of numerical experiments comparing the proposed algorithm to K-means with trigonometric encoding on synthetically generated data are reported. The advantage of using the proposed K-means algorithm is also shown on a real example using gas load data to build simple predictive models.", "paper_title": "K-MEANS CLUSTERING FOR PROBLEMS WITH PERIODIC ATTRIBUTES", "paper_id": "WOS:000267117500003"}
