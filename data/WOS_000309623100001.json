Its aim is to minimize the height of the strip such that non-guillotinable and fix orientation constraints are meet. In this paper, an improved scoring rule is developed and the least waste priority strategy is introduced, and a randomized algorithm is presented for solving this problem. This algorithm is very simple and does not need to set any parameters. Computational results on a wide range of benchmark problem instances show that the proposed algorithm obtains a better or matching performance as compared to the most of the previously published meta-heuristics.
