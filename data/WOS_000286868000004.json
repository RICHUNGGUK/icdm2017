Such boxes have been central to the study of quantum or generalized non-locality, as well as the simulation of non-signaling distributions. In this paper, we start by studying how many non-local boxes Alice and Bob need in order to compute a Boolean function f. We provide tight upper and lower bounds in terms of the communication complexity of the function both in the deterministic and randomized case. We show that non-local box complexity has interesting applications to classical cryptography, in particular to secure function evaluation, and study the question posed by Beimel and Malkin [1] of how many Oblivious Transfer calls Alice and Bob need in order to securely compute a function f. We show that this question is related to the non-local box complexity of the function and conclude by greatly improving their bounds. Finally, another consequence of our results is that traceless two-outcome measurements on maximally entangled states can be simulated with 3 non-local boxes, while no finite bound was previously known.", "paper_title": "NON-LOCAL BOX COMPLEXITY AND SECURE FUNCTION EVALUATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000286868000004"}
