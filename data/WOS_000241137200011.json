Most of the existing efforts attempt to develop accurate analytical models. In this paper, our goal is to develop an effective conceptual model: A model that can be easily drawn by hand, while at the same time, it captures significant macroscopic properties. We build the foundation for our model with two thrusts: a) We identify new topological properties and b) we provide metrics to quantify the topological importance of a node. We propose the jellyfish as a model for the inter-domain Internet topology. We show that our model captures and represents the most significant topological properties. Furthermore, we observe that the jellyfish has lasting value: It describes the topology for more than six years.", "paper_title": "Jellyfish: A conceptual model for the AS Internet topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137200011"}
