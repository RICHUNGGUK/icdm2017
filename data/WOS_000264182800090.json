But these charts do not relieve the need for pinpointing source(s) of the out-of-control signals, which would be very useful for quality practitioners to locate the assignable causes that give rise to the out-of-control situation. In this study, a learning-based model has been investigated for monitoring and diagnosing out-of-control signals in a bivariate process. In this model, a selective neural network (NN) ensemble approach (DPSOEN, Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization) was developed for performing these tasks. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the conventional multivariate control scheme in terms of average run length (ARL), and can accurately classify source(s) of out-of-control signals. Extensive experiment is also carried out to examine the effects of six statistical features on the performance of DPSOEN. Analysis from this study provides guidelines in developing NN ensemble-based Statistical process control recognition systems in multivariate processes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
