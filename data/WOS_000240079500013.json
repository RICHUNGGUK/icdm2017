In traditional technique the B-mode ultrasound can only measure a small range of temperature changes using the gray scale of images. We obtained a series of real-time B-mode ultrasound images with a wide range of temperature variation from 28 degrees C to 85 degrees C. In this paper, we investigate image texture characteristics with respect to changes of tissue temperature. Results from water bath and radiofrequency ablation experiments show that there is a strong correlation between several texture features and temperature in a wide range of 28-85 degrees C.", "paper_title": "Noninvasive temperature monitoring in a wide range based on textures of ultrasound images", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079500013"}
