Specifically, performance variability has hindered performance scaling, while soft errors become an emerging problem for logic computation at recent technology nodes. In this article, we leverage the existing Totally Self-Checking (TSC)/Strongly Fault-Secure (SFS) logic design techniques, and propose Resilient and Adaptive Performance (RAP) logic for maximum adaptive performance and soft error resilience in nanoscale computing. RAP logic clears all timing errors in the absence of external soft errors, albeit at a higher area/power cost compared with Razor logic. Our experimental results further show that dual-rail static (Domino) RAP logic outperforms alternative Delay-Insensitive (DI) code-based static (Domino) RAP logic with less area, higher performance, and lower power consumption for the large test cases, and achieves an average of 2.29(2.41) x performance boost, 2.12(1.91) x layout area, and 2.38(2.34) x power consumption compared with the traditional minimum area static logic based on the Nangate 45-nm open cell library.", "paper_title": "Resilient and Adaptive Performance Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000307868500009"}
