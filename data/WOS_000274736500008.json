A prominent reason for this is the gap that exists between agent-oriented modeling languages and the agent-based system modeling needs, including accessibility, flexibility, and expressiveness. This paper addresses the need for such a language by proposing object-process methodology (OPM)/MAS, an agent modeling language (AML) that extends OPM with an intermediate metamodel of the MAS domain. Three case studies and a comparison to contemporary AMLs demonstrate the novelty and benefits of OPM/MAS.", "paper_title": "An Object-Process-Based Modeling Language for Multiagent Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000274736500008"}
