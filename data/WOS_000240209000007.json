Its purpose is to evaluate the truth that a claim X is supported by evidence Y. This paper exposes some flaws with how the original unification function handles belief, possibility, and inconsistency. By making changes to the function this paper allows both interval and point-value semantic unification to be used in a more consistent and intuitive way. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
