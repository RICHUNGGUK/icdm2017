Equations have been derived to theoretically evaluate the extent to which such temperature changes will degrade the overall OCDMA system performance. To mitigate these negative effects on the OCDMA system, several steps have been introduced to improve the code robustness. System design improvements have then been investigated. We also found they would help to improve the spectral efficiency.", "paper_title": "Effect of Variations in Environmental Temperature on 2D-WH/TS OCDMA Code Performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000313906300007"}
