The technique mainly consists in controlling a manipulator by assigning not only the way points on the path but also the geometrical tangent of the desired path shape at each of those points. This is achieved by assigning to the control system not only the joint variables q(i), but also the vector values q(i) of the velocities that the joints must have when the end-effector passes through each of those trajectory points. In this way if a path is defined by a same number of points, the proposed technique permits to achieve more accurate paths than those obtained by a traditional point to point technique. Finally, some examples are presented making comparisons on same trajectories assigned by different techniques and also an example of a elaborate surface. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
