Empirical results indicate that (1) the market differentiates five performance levels forming the benchmark structure for 34 hotels; (2) the hotels with higher attractiveness can be served as learning targets for the hotels in the lagging levels so as to establish the best path for performance improvements: (3) the hotels in the leading levels can use lower progress to analyze potential competitors in the lagging levels. The results of this study can provide hotel's managers with insights of competitive advantage and help them with strategic decision making. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
