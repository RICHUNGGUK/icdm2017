The evaluation is on long real-world video sequences where disparity ground-truth is not available. The paper applies two alternative (or mutually supporting) techniques for performance evaluation: the previously known third-eye method, and a few new data measures on video sequences. The main contribution of the paper is on answering the questions, how to evaluate stereo matchers on long real-world sequences if disparity ground truth is not available, and how to compare evaluation measures relatively to each other. The two stereo matchers used are illustrating the discussed evaluation measures; they could be replaced by other matchers, but evaluation results for those two matchers are also of interest on its own, by illustrating correlations in the behavior of those two basically very different matchers (defined by dynamic programming or by belief propagation optimization, respectively) on data sequences recorded in different traffic situations.
