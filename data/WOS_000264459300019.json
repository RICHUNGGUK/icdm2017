Design/methodology/approach - The paper is an extension of the application of neuropsychology to physics, as previously described in Part I, to cosmology Findings The paper removes the apparent contradictions in physics implied by the EPR paradox. Practical implications A theoretical basis for a possible instantaneous (faster than light) sending of messages to everywhere in the cosmos is provided. Originality/value This theory is entirely new. The possible application is independent from the existence of tachions.", "paper_title": "Cybernetical physics Part II: the EPR paradox and its implications", "paper_id": "WOS:000264459300019"}
