Firstly, a delay-dependent sufficient condition of robust exponential stability for such 2-D discrete systems is derived in linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) form. Secondly, a delay-dependent exponential stability criterion with performance for the considered systems is also proposed. Then a state feedback controller is constructed based on the above results. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Delay-dependent robust H-infinity control for 2-D discrete nonlinear systems with state delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000339724400009"}
