However, many of them are based on pre-shared secret incurring key management costs, and are still vulnerable from practical countermeasures. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using defensive jamming technique to protect enterprise Wi-Fi networks from potential eavesdroppers. This non-cryptographic approach requires neither any pre-shared key or high deployment costs. Defensive jammers geographically confine the wireless coverage of Wi-Fi access point, and thus block the message reception outside an arbitrary boundary at a physical layer. We provide a theoretical model fine tuning the jamming parameters for jammer placement. We then discuss practical considerations including optimized jammer arrangement algorithms, interference countermeasures to legitimate communications, and countermeasures against advanced attackers.", "paper_title": "A jamming approach to enhance enterprise Wi-Fi secrecy through spatial access control", "paper_id": "WOS:000367070400013"}
