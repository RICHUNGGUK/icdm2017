In the algorithm, the cross-correlation matrix is first constructed by using the received data which are arranged according to the transmit array and the receive array, respectively. And the DOAs and DODs are estimated independently employing cross-correlation Root-MUSIC algorithms without eigendecomposition, where the null spaces are constructed with a linear operation of the cross-correlation matrices. Secondly the pair-matching of DOAs and DODs is accomplished by solving an angle estimate optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through numerical simulations, and it is shown that the proposed method can provide more accurate angle estimation with small computational complexity than conventional eigendecomposition algorithms.", "paper_title": "Cross-correlation matrix Root-MUSIC algorithm for bistatic multiple-input multiple-output radar", "paper_id": "WOS:000350534000005"}
