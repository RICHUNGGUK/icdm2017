In this paper we explore the optimal weight setting to support hose-model VPN traffic in an IP-based hop-by-hop routing network. We try to answer the following questions: 1) What is the maximum amount of hose-model VPN traffic with bandwidth guarantees that can be admitted to an IP-based hop-by-hop routing network (as opposed to an MPLS-based network), and 2) what is the optimal link weight setting that can achieve that? We first present a mixed-integer programming formulation to compute the optimal link weights that can maximize the ingress and egress VPN traffic admissible to a hop-by-hop routing network. We also present a heuristic algorithm for solving the link weight searching problem for large networks. We show simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the search algorithm.", "paper_title": "Optimal Link Weights for IP-Based Networks Supporting Hose-Model VPNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000267379400008"}
