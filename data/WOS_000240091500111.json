During buying, agents purchase insurance as a method to search for potential sellers and select their partners based on the information provided by insurance agents. During selling, agents purchase insurance as a method to protect themselves against potential risk. The insurance concept greatly simplifies the trading procedure in the open marketplace. The novelty of this proposal is that it ensures a dynamic trading environment while agents continue to seek maximum utility and being fully protected by insurance. Our experimental results confirm the feasibility of our approach.", "paper_title": "Buying and selling with insurance in open multi-agent marketplace", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500111"}
