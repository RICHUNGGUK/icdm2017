Continuous Awareness is an extension of Continuous Coordination emphasizing continuous awareness support across space and time. Traditional desktop-based approaches are insufficient for the requirements of continuous awareness. Team Radar Mobile takes a visual mobile approach to awareness by extending the visualization of awareness information on desktop platforms to mobile platforms. The concept of continuous awareness and its implementation on multiple platforms are discussed. An experiment has evaluated the visual mobile approach to continuous awareness, and found visualization express awareness information more efficiently than the non-visual approach. Our work also provides experience on mobile visualization. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
