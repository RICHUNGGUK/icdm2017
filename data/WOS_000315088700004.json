The resulting method was tested at various benchmark cases and then it was used to simulate the jet impingement on a flat plate for several different impingement angles, in comparison with the standard SPH method and results from literature. The SPH-ALE method proves to produce higher quality results than the standard SPH method in all cases, while the MUSCL treatment tends to remedy the issues of the numerical viscosity, inherent to the method, up to a point.
