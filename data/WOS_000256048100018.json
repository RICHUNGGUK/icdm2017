Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual approach is taken in the paper. Findings - The authors modify the conventional rule of thinking that each predicate determines a unique set, and establish a principle regarding the relationship between predicates and sets. Then, the authors study the structures of actually infinite, rigid sets. Originality/value - The structure of actually infinite sets is detailed.", "paper_title": "Intension and structure of actually infinite, rigid sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000256048100018"}
