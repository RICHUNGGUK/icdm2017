This paper develops a virtual workflow system to construct distributed collaborative applications for Grid users. The virtual workflow system consists three levels: abstract workflow system, translator and concrete workflow system. The research highlight of the implementation is that this workflow system is developed based on CORBA and Unicore Grid middleware. Furthermore, this implementation can support legacy application developed with Parco and C++ codes. This virtual workflow system can provide efficient GUI for users to organize distributed scientific collaborative applications and execute them on Grid resources. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of this virtual workflow system in the paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
