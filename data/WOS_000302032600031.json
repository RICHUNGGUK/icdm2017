In this paper we look into personal photos as an additional source for social network analysis and analyze the potential of people tags in the photos for friend recommendations. We also propose a new compact data structure, collectively called Face Co-Occurrence Networks (FCON), which stores crucial and quantitative information about people's appearance in photos. We discover strong associative relationships among people and recommend reliable social friends by utilizing FCON. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method for recommending friends in ;social network services. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
