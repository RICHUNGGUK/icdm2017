Among all, a common use of such a class of clustering algorithms is in the training of radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs). In this paper, we describe a novel approach to fuzzy clustering, which organizes the data in clusters on the basis of the input data and a 'prototype' regression function built, in the output space, as a summation of a number of linear local regression models. This methodology is shown to be effective in the training of RBFNNs leading to improved performance with respect to other clustering algorithms. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
