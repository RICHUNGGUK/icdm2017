In this paper we engineer a better algorithm for this task, which improves over those proposed by Demaine, Munro and Lopez-Ortiz [SODA 2000/ALENEX 2001], by using a variant of interpolation search. More specifically, our contributions are threefold. First, we corroborate and complete the practical study from Demaine et al. on comparison based intersection algorithms. Second, we show that in practice replacing binary search and galloping (one-sided binary) search [4] by interpolation search improves the performance of each main intersection algorithms. Third, we introduce and test variants of interpolation search: this results in an even better intersection algorithm.", "paper_title": "Faster adaptive set intersections for text searching", "paper_id": "WOS:000238121700013"}
