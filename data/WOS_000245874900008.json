A mixed sampling and deterministic strategy is adopted to balance between effectiveness and efficiency: the parameters are estimated via Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques and the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) disparity map is inferred by a deterministic approximation algorithm. Additionally, a new method is provided to evaluate the partition function of the associated Markov random field model. Encouraging results are obtained on a standard set of stereo images as well as on synthetic forest images. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
