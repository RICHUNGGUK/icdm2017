In this paper, we prove that if H-n is an n-vertex (r+1)-uniform hypergraph in which every r-element set is contained in at most d edges, where 0<d<n/(log n)(3r2), then alpha(H-n) >= C-r (n/d log n/d)(1/r) where cr > 0 satisfies cr similar to r/e as r ->infinity. The value of c(r) improves and generalizes several earlier results that all use a theorem of Ajtai, Komlos, Pintz, Spencer and Szemeredi (J Comb Theory Ser A 32 (1982), 321-335). Our relatively short proof extends a method due to Shearer (Random Struct Algorithms 7 (1995), 269-271) and Alon (Random Struct Algorithms 9 (1996), 271-278). The above statement is close to best possible, in the sense that for each r2 and all values of dN, there are infinitely many H-n such that alpha(H-n) <= b(r) (n/d log n/d)(1/r) where br > 0 depends only on r. In addition, for many values of d we show br similar to cr as r ->infinity, so the result is almost sharp for large r. We give an application to hypergraph Ramsey numbers involving independent neighborhoods.Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "paper_title": "On Independent Sets in Hypergraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000329938900004"}
