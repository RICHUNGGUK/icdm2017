First, we describe a general framework, where we consider the class of 21/2-player games with almost-sure parity winning conditions on possibly infinite game graphs, assuming that the game contains a finite attractor. An attractor is a set of states (not necessarily absorbing) that is almost surely re-visited regardless of the players' decisions. We present a scheme that characterizes the set of winning states for each player. Then, we instantiate this scheme to obtain an algorithm for stochastic game lossy channel systems.", "paper_title": "STOCHASTIC PARITY GAMES ON LOSSY CHANNEL SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000350399900001"}
