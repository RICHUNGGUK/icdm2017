Examples are drawn from clinical cases of MRI/PET breast studies, CT angiography/SPECT cardiac studies, and total wrist arthroplasty. These types of studies should be contrasted with those involving the head, thorax, and pelvis where there is much less deformation and the existence of (some) large bones facilitates automatic matching.", "paper_title": "Clinical application of a semiautomatic 3D fusion tool where automatic fusion techniques are difflicult to use", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485200024"}
