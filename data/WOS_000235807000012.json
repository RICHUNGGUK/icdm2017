Barriers to AOD adoption are, in part, due to this fragmentation. Individually, many approaches provide elegant solutions to subsets of particular key issues related to AOD. Collectively, a significant set of these issues are addressed. We propose integrating existing AOD approaches through a generic AOD process. It is our intuition that such integration will consistently address the issues relevant to AOD.", "paper_title": "Towards a generic aspect oriented design process", "paper_id": "WOS:000235807000012"}
