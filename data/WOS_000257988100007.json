In this letter, we consider how spiking neural populations might transmit information about continuous dynamic stimulus variables. The combination of simple encoders and temporal stimulus correlations leads to a code in which information is not readily available to downstream neurons. Here, we explore a complex encoder that is paired with a simple decoder that allows representation and manipulation of the dynamic information in neural systems. The encoder we present takes the form of a biologically plausible recurrent spiking neural network where the output population recodes its inputs to produce spikes that are independently decodeable. We show that this network can be learned in a supervised manner by a simple local learning rule.", "paper_title": "Encoding and decoding spikes for dynamic stimuli", "paper_id": "WOS:000257988100007"}
