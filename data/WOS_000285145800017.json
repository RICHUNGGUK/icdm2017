It is possible to create a model that cannot satisfy equilibrium conditions for a set of external loading conditions. A model is 'loadable' if there exists a set of muscle forces that can resist an arbitrary applied force within a prescribed range. In this study, a novel mathematical method is introduced to determine whether models are loadable. In addition, an idealised musculoskeletal model is presented in order to develop the theory behind the mathematical method. The method uses the simplex algorithm to determine feasibility of the linear programming problem and can determine loadability for an arbitrary, continuous range of external forces. The method was applied to a three-dimensional model of the shoulder and correctly determined loadability for a range of externally applied forces.", "paper_title": "A method to determine whether a musculoskeletal model can resist arbitrary external loadings within a prescribed range", "paper_id": "WOS:000285145800017"}
