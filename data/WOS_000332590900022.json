Firstly, we introduce a necessary and sufficient condition for null Boolean functions in trace representation, which can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known additive Hilbert-90 theorem. Based on this condition, we propose an algorithmic method with preprocessing to address the original problem. The worst-case complexity of the algorithm is still exponential; its average-case performance, however, can be improved. We prove that the expected complexity of the refined procedure is O(n), if the coefficients of input functions are chosen i.i.d. according to the uniform distribution over F-2n ; therefore, it performs well in practice.", "paper_title": "An Average-Case Efficient Algorithm on Testing the Identity of Boolean Functions in Trace Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000332590900022"}
