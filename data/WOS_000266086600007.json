Therefore, a new model named EFGMm(1, 1) is proposed in this paper by eliminating the error term resulted from the traditional calculation of background value with an integration equation to substitute for such error term. In addition, Fourier series and exponential smooth technique have also been integrated into the new model to reduce the periodic and stochastic residual errors, respectively. An illustrative example of building material stock index is adopted for demonstration. Results show that the proposed model can increase the prediction accuracy, particularly when the system is instable. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
