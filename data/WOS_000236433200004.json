If we restrict the broadcast of control packets within a small subset of hosts in the network, the protocol overhead can be substantially reduced. This motivates our research of constructing a virtual backbone by computing a connected dominating set (CDS) in unit-disk graphs. In this paper, we propose two distributed algorithms to approximate a minimum CDS. These algorithms take linear time. Their performance is verified by a complete theoretical analysis.
