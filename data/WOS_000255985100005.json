S-rough sets are defined by element equivalence class that proposes dynamic characteristic. S-rough sets have dynamic characteristic. By introducing the function equivalence class (law equivalence class) that proposes dynamic characteristic into S-rough sets, the first author improved S-rough sets and put forward function S-rough sets (function singular rough sets). Function S-rough sets have dynamic characteristic and law characteristic, and a function is a law. By using function S-rough sets, this paper presents law identification, law identification theorem, and law identification criterion and applications. Function S-rough sets are a new research direction of rough sets theory, and it is also a new tool to the research of system law identification.", "paper_title": "Function S-rough sets and law identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000255985100005"}
