Predictive dynamics is used to simulate the task in which joint angle profiles are treated as primary unknowns in the formulation. The joint torques are treated as dependent variables that are evaluated directly from the equations of motion. For the performance measure, the normalized dynamic effort represented by the integral of the squares of all the normalized joint torques is minimized subject to the associated physical constraints. Backward walking at different speeds is simulated and analyzed. The backward walking is validated with motion capture data and the available data in the literature. The results of the backward walking motion are compared to those of the forward walking motion in order to study the differences between the two walking patterns. It is seen that the joint torque profiles for hip and knee of backward walk are quite similar to those of forward walk with reverse sequence, but with different time duration of flexion and extension activations. These findings can impact many fields, such as improvement of human performance, rehabilitation from injuries, and others.", "paper_title": "Backward walking simulation of humans using optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000338333200012"}
