They play crucial roles in enhancing security, privacy and usability of distributed services. There has been extensive research in the area, including the Semantic Web community, but several aspects still exist that prevent policy frameworks from widespread adoption and real world application. This paper discusses important requirements and open research issues in this context, focusing on policies in general and their integration into trust management frameworks, as well as on approaches to increase system cooperation, usability and user-awareness of policy issues.", "paper_title": "Semantic web policies - A discussion of requirements and research issues", "paper_id": "WOS:000238574900048"}
