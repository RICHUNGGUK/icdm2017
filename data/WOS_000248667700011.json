A mathematical model was developed for predicting distillation results for multicomponent systems based on Rayleigh equation. A Microsoft Excel Visual Basic (VB) Macro program was coded for inputting property data, carrying out calculations, and presenting outcomes in both table and graphic forms. The simulation can be conducted using the VB Macro program when users-specified inputs in mole, volume, or weight are entered.
