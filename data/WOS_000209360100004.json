Despite their importance, the literature has not adequately dealt with post disaster operations - at least in part - because of the difficulty in rapidly solving the mathematically complex problems involved. In this paper we consider two important issues within the scope of post natural disaster actions; first, we develop deterministic and probabilistic districting and routing problems for scheduling infrastructure inspection crews following a natural disaster in urban areas; second, we assess and compare five metaheuristic optimization algorithms for solving these districting and routing problems. Results suggest that the five approaches examined offer applicable as well as fast solutions but with varying qualitative characteristics; selection of the preferred approach for practical applications will largely depend upon the network's characteristics.
