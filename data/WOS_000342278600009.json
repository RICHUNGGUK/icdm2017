This paper presents fusion methods which enable a crowdsourcing enhanced system to use human sensor data and physical sensor data synergistically to improve its sensor coverage and the quality of its decisions. The methods are built on results of classical statistical detection and estimation theory and use value fusion and decision fusion of human sensor data and physical sensor data in a coherent way. They are the building blocks of a central fusion unit in a crowdsourcing support system for disaster surveillance and early warning applications.", "paper_title": "A Framework for Fusion of Human Sensor and Physical Sensor Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000342278600009"}
