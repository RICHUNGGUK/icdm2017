Not only does it satisfy some real application requirements, it also acts as an important aid for RFID identification. Due to the extremely long processing time, slotted ALOHA-based or tree-based arbitration protocols are often impractical for many applications, because tags are usually attached to moving objects and they may have left the readers interrogation region before being counted. Recently, estimation schemes have been proposed to count the approximate number of tags. Most of them, however, suffer from two scalability problems: time inefficiency and multiple-reading. Without resolving these problems, large-scale RFID systems cannot easily apply the estimation scheme as well as the corresponding identification. In this paper, we present the Lottery Frame (LoF) estimation scheme, which can achieve high accuracy, low latency, and scalability. LoF estimates the tag numbers by utilizing the collision information. We show the significant advantages, e. g., high accuracy, short processing time, and low overhead, of the proposed LoF scheme through analysis and simulations.", "paper_title": "Cardinality Estimation for Large-Scale RFID Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000292908300003"}
