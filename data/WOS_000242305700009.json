The method first divides a document image into a number of non-overlapping slabs in which each object is covered by parallelograms. It then estimates the skew angle based on these parallelograms or, equivalently, their complementary regions. Putting our method to a systematic test and comparing it with some alternatives, we find that it yields favorable results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity to non-textual objects, effectiveness in dealing with documents of unspecified reading order, and computational efficiency. Some work is also conducted to find an effective way to further shorten its computation time at the expense of an extremely small loss of accuracy. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society.
