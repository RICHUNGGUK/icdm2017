Drawing on the environmental aesthetics, human-computer interaction, and psychology literature, we identify webpage visual Complexity and Order as two salient webpage aesthetic features and investigate the moderating role of the e-commerce customer's motivational orientation on his/her preference for web aesthetic features. Two independent samples were recruited and presented with images of 24 homepages varying across six levels of Complexity and four levels of Order. The results of this study suggested significant influences of webpage Complexity and Order on customer's preference for the web pages and a moderating effect of customer's shopping motivational orientation on his/her preference for webpage Complexity. However, no moderating effect of motivational orientation was found on the preference for webpage Order. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
