Human has not believed what they see. Many digital images can not be judged whether they are real or feigned visually, i.e., many fake images are produced whose content is feigned. In this paper, firstly, image fakery is introduced, including how to produce fake images and its characters. Then, a fake image detection scheme is proposed, which uses radial basis function (RBF) neural network as a detector to make a binary decision on whether an image is fake or real. The experimental results also demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Image fakery and neural network based detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000090"}
