After reviewing the desirable features of simulation environments, an approach based on the Modelica language is presented and motivated. Finally, the general concepts presented above are exemplified by modelling a simple process based on a heat exchanger.", "paper_title": "Modelling of thermo-hydraulic power generation processes using Modelica", "paper_id": "WOS:000234717700003"}
