We consider the mechanisms of real networks, and define a cost function to describe different hierarchies of networks to measure node importance. This method takes up a node's regional influence as well as its global influence to evaluate its importance. The results of simulation prove that this method is proper to describe effectively and detect node discrepancies in a network.", "paper_title": "A new centrality measure based on sub-tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971100009"}
