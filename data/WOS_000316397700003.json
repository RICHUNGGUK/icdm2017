We provide comprehensive a priori convergence estimates for their spatiotemporal discretization by means of a first-order in time semi-Lagrangian approach combined with a discontinuous Galerkin method. Under rather weak assumptions on the velocity underlying the advection we establish an asymptotic L (2)-estimate of order , where h is the spatial meshwidth, tau denotes the time step, and r is the polynomial degree of the forms used as trial functions. This estimate can be improved considerably in a variety of special settings.", "paper_title": "Convergence of Lowest Order Semi-Lagrangian Schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000316397700003"}
