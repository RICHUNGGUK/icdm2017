The flow topology is described by the velocity and the pressure fields. The influence of the wake vortices on the aerodynamic drag is clarified and quantified. In order to reduce this drag, an active open-loop flow control is applied by continuous blowing devices distributed around the base periphery. The blowing effect on the behind body flow is a reduction of the wake section and of the total pressure loss in the wake and an increase of the static pressure on the base of the square body. This control leads to a significant drag reduction of Delta C-x = -29% with a blowing velocity of 1.5 V-0. The efficiency is then studied, and we found that the most efficient control is obtained for a blowing velocity of 0.5 V-0 and a jet angle of 45 degrees. In this case, a 20% drag reduction is obtained, and the energy needed to control the system is seven times lower than the energy saved by the control. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
