To measure trends in biodiversity conservation over time, historical records on protected-area boundaries are needed. Protected-area systems represent a challenge in information management for public environmental organizations. Protected areas may be subjected to changes which must follow a mandatory multiple-step administrative process. A wealth of information is generated which needs to be stored in a way that eases the handling process and for future reference. We present an information system which handles both change on protected-area boundaries over time and their related administrative processes. It also provides distributed data maintenance functionality as well as integrated alphanumeric, file and cartographic information handling. We discuss the actual implementation of the system for handling Natura 2000 sites in the Catalan and Spanish contexts. The designed system is applicable to other European Union member states.
