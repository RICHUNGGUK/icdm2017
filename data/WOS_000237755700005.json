The actuator uses a repulsive force instead of an attractive force and thus avoids the \"pull-in\" effect associated with conventional parallel-plate microelectrostatic actuators. The multi-level repulsive-force actuator is modelled, and the performance of an example design of the actuator is presented through numerical simulations. Simulation results show that the multi-level actuator can output a stroke much larger than that of a two-layer repulsive-force actuator when subject to the same voltage.", "paper_title": "Performance assessment of a multi-level repulsive-force out-of-plane microelectrostatic actuator", "paper_id": "WOS:000237755700005"}
