The idea is to use the so-called locking operation to \"lock\" the entanglement channels, thus requiring a joint unlocking operation by Bob and Charlie in order to simultaneously obtain the information sent by Alice. We present some new results on SDC: (1) We propose three SDC protocols, which use different N-dimensional entanglement (Bell state, W state and GHZ state). (2) Besides the quantum Fourier transform, two new locking operators are introduced (the double controlled-NOT operator and the SWAP operator). (3) In the case that spatially distant Bob and Charlie have to finalize the protocol by implementing the unlocking operation through communication, we improve our protocol's fairness, with respect to Bob and Charlie, by implementing the unlocking operation in series of steps. (4) We improve the security of SDC against the intercept-resend attack. (5) We show that SDC can be used to implement a fair contract signing protocol. (6) We also show that the N-dimensional quantum Fourier transform can act as the locking operator in simultaneous teleportation of N-level quantum systems.", "paper_title": "Secure N-dimensional simultaneous dense coding and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000370975000003"}
