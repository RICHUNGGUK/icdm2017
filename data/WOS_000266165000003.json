The electrostatic potential around the DNA fragments containing either the intact guanine-cytosine pair or 8-oxoguanine-cytosine or the guanine-abasic site was projected on a cylindrical surface around the double helix. The 2D maps of EP of intact and damaged DNA fragments were compared using image analysis methods. Occurrence of abasic site and 8-oxoguanine lesions were found to be reflected in the EP maps. In the case of the 8-oxoguanine lesion, the two phosphate groups and countercations of the damaged strand are moved away from the lesion in opposite directions, whereas they are moved in the same direction in the case of the abasic site lesion. The characteristic features of 8-oxoguanine lesion might be identified in the major groove, whereas the features of abasic site lesion the minor groove.", "paper_title": "Electrostatic potential maps of damaged DNA studied by image analysis tools. 8-Oxoguanine and abasic site lesions", "paper_id": "WOS:000266165000003"}
