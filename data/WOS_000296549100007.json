The authors implemented this research by using the Personal Dead Reckoning positioning system to serve as the inertial navigation based positioning system. The primary contribution of the presented work is the development and implementation of the Integrated Tracking System algorithm which was implemented in two levels. At the first level, the Integrated Tracking System (ITS) was developed by integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) and Personal Dead Reckoning (PDR) system to ubiquitously track a mobile user, in dynamic environments where GPS coverage may be uncertain. At the second level, the PDR system was integrated with a database of pre-determined known indoor location points in order to correct the accumulated drift error during a mobile user's navigation in an indoor environment. Finally, a hybrid tracking system was developed and implemented by integrating the PDR system with the mobile user's intervention and discernment of the environment. The implementation and the results obtained from validation experiments performed on the aforementioned hybrid tracking systems demonstrate the potential of using hybrid tracking for determining the spatial context of mobile users in ubiquitous context-aware engineering applications.
