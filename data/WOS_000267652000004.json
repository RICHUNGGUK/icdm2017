In contrast, one of the most known applications of Continuous Nonlinear Optimization is on the control of dynamic systems. In this paper, we combine both views, solving scheduling problems as dynamic systems, modeled as discrete-time nonlinear optimal control problems wilth state and control continuous variables subjected to upper and lower bounds. Complementarity constraints are used to represent scheduling decisions. One example we discuss in detail is the Crude oil scheduling in ports. with numerical results presented.", "paper_title": "Continuous Nonlinear Programming Techniques to Solve Scheduling, Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000267652000004"}
