The main goal of the paper is the modelization of these situations by means of a generalization of the L-fuzzy concept analysis called L-fuzzy bicontext. We study the L-fuzzy concepts of these L-fuzzy bicontexts obtaining some interesting results. Specifically, we will be able to classify the biconcepts of the L-fuzzy bicontext. Finally, a practical case is developed using this new tool. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
