The simulations were made both before (Class-A) and after (Class-C) the field data became known. It is shown that the Class-A prediction resulted in poor simulations of the measured settlement-time curves, mainly due to over-estimation of the magnitude of the yield stresses of the subsoils (i.e., the sizes of the yielding loci) and under-estimation of the compressibility, hydraulic conductivity and the slope (M) of the critical state line. It is demonstrated that: (a) appropriate site investigation, soil testing and interpretation of the test results are essential for accurate prediction of the behaviour of an earth structure constructed on soft clayey deposits; (b) when using a soil model developed within the framework of Critical State Soil Mechanics to make such predictions, M value should be directly determined from tests with an appropriate effective stress path; and (c) yield stresses of soft soil layers can be calibrated by comparing the predicted undrained shear strengths (S-u) with measured values, provided the effect of strain rate and/or strain softening on the value of S-u is properly considered. The results of this analysis indicate that Bjerrum's strain rate correction factor can be adopted as a first approximation of the correction factor applied to field or laboratory measured values of S-u.
