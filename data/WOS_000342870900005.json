However, it is affected by changes in covariate conditions (carrying, clothing, view angle, etc.). Existing methods suffer from lack of training samples, can only cope with changes in a subset of conditions with limited success, and implicitly assume subject cooperation. We propose a novel approach which casts gait recognition as a bipartite ranking problem and leverages training samples from different people and even from different datasets. By exploiting learning to rank, the problem of model over-fitting caused by under-sampled training data is effectively addressed. This makes our approach suitable under a genuine uncooperative setting and robust against changes in any covariate conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach drastically outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 14-fold increase in recognition rate under the most difficult uncooperative settings.
