Specialized, problem-specific techniques are needed for the resulting partitioned methods to avoid time step restrictions which make long time calculations costly. This report studies unconditionally stable, uncoupled time stepping methods for a model problem sharing mathematical structure akin to the coupled atmosphere-ocean system. Three decoupled time stepping algorithms are introduced and their stability and consistency are rigorously examined. Numerical experiments are performed that study their stability and convergence properties.", "paper_title": "Partitioned time discretization for parallel solution of coupled ODE systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000291482000002"}
