This paper describes a compatible discrete space version of the heuristic Voronoi diagram algorithm. Since the algorithm gets stuck in local optimums in some cases, we apply a number of changes in the body of the algorithm with regard to the geometry of the problem, in a way that it can reach the global optimum with a high probability. Finally, a comparison between the results of these two algorithms on several test problems and a real-world problem are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
