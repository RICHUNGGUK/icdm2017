The consequences can be observed not only in epidemic extensions of chronic diseases (diabetes type-2, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension) but also in increased number of patients with serious health complications. Their treatment represents an immense social and economical burden. In this paper simulation results are presented which can be used for evaluation of patients' number with coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure and end-stage renal disease in Slovenia. At the same time also year treatment costs were calculated regarding each of observed diseases. Finally the presented results enable the estimation of potential savings resulting from more intensive chronic diseases treatment. The extrapolation is also suggested, with which the results can be extended to the countries with similar demographic and social situation. Resembling circumstances can be expected in practically all the EU countries. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
