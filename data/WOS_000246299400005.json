In particular, we give an O(1)-approximation algorithm for placing the fewest point guards on a 1.5D terrain, so that every point of the terrain is seen by at least one guard. While polylogarithmic-factor approximations follow from set cover results, our new results exploit the geometric structure of terrains to obtain a substantially improved approximation algorithm.", "paper_title": "A constant-factor approximation algorithm for optimal 1.5D terrain guarding", "paper_id": "WOS:000246299400005"}
