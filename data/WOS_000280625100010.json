The MSA comprises three steps. First, a given source uses the MSA to find multiple label switch paths (LSPs) from the source to a destination for a specific class type (CT). Second, the source uses the available bandwidth of the CT on all the links along these LSPs to allocate the initial traffic to the selected LSPs. Third, the source dynamically adjusts traffic to these LSPs based on individual round trip time. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm offers better performance than existing approaches in average transmission time, average packet loss rate, average throughput, and available bandwidth variance for each link.
