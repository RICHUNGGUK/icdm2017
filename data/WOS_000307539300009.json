It does not cover the effect of temperature on the camera's electronics. Firstly, the influence of temperature change on camera parameters was modelled and integrated into an existing analytical camera model. A modified camera model enables quantitative assessment regarding the influence of temperature variations for a single camera. Temperature variations also directly influence the accuracies of calibrated cameras. The inability to analytically determine the calibration method error magnitude, led us to experimentally estimate errors regarding calibrated cameras. Finally, the total error regarding calibrated cameras was derived by combining the numerical error of the calibration method with those errors originating from temperature variations. The results show that the influence of temperature variations decreases when increasing the distances of the observed objects from the cameras. On a typical building site, the temperature influence is reflected in the image as an error of less than one pixel.", "paper_title": "Assessing the influence of temperature variations on the geometrical properties of a low-cost calibrated camera system by using computer vision procedures", "paper_id": "WOS:000307539300009"}
