The algorithm is based on a quadrature formula for a singular integral and has been validated by comparison with the exact expressions for the compactons of the K(n, n) Rosenau-Hyman equation. Compactons and kovatons, the CTWs of the K(cos) Rosenau-Pikovsky equation, are numerically determined and their main features are discussed. The normalization of the shape of these solutions show that there is no scaling symmetry among them, as it does for the K(n, n) equation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
