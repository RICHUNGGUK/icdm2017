We present a compact routing scheme capable of handling multiple edge failures. Assume a source node s contains a message M designated to a destination target t and assume a set F of edges crashes (unknown to s). Our scheme routes the message to t (provided that s and t are still connected in G \\ F) over a path whose length is proportional to the distance between s and t in G \\ F, to \\F\\(3) and to some poly-log factor. The routing table required at a node v is of size proportional to the degree of v in G and some poly-log factor. This improves on the previously known fault-tolerant compact routing scheme for general graphs, which was capable of overcoming at most 2 edge failures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
