Multiway data result from measurements as a function of two or more independent variables. The PSE comprises a parameter estimation loop and a model adjustment loop. The model can be specified hierarchically using mathematically described building blocks which encapsulate the model assumptions. A typical case study of three-way data illustrates the need for interactive model adjustment. Requirements for interactive problem solving are discussed.
