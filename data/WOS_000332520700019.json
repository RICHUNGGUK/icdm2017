The proposed models are based on linearized versions of standard mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulations of these problems. We extend the linearized models to address uncertainty by assuming that the component reliabilities belong to a budgeted uncertainty set, and develop robust counterpart models. A key challenge is that, because the models involve nonlinear functions of the uncertain data, classical robust optimization approaches cannot apply directly to construct their robust optimization counterparts. We exploit problem structure to develop robust counterparts and exact solution methods, and present computational results demonstrating their performance.", "paper_title": "The Robust Redundancy Allocation Problem in Series-Parallel Systems With Budgeted Uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000332520700019"}
