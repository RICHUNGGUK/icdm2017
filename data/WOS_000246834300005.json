In 2005, the HB+ protocol was proposed as an improvement of the original HB to overcome the weakness against active attacks. Later, several authors have successfully applied new attacks to both HB and HB+, resulting in a new modification known as HB++. Again, this protocol has been cryptanalyzed and a new protocol has been presented by Piramuthu in 2006. This kind of protocol is especially suitable for RFID systems in which every tag has to be authenticated by the reader. Taking into account security and performance aspects, we present in this paper a new protocol, named HB-MP, derived from HB+, providing a more efficient performance and resistance to the active attacks applied to the HB-family.
