We present an algorithm that finds in a family of k permutations of n elements all z common intervals in optimal O(kn+z) time and O(n) additional space. Additionally, we show how to adapt this algorithm to multichromosomal and circular permutations. This extends a result by Uno and Yagiura (Algorithmica 26:290-309, 2000) who present an algorithm to find all z common intervals of k=2 (regular) permutations in optimal O(n+z) time and O(n) space. To achieve our result, we introduce the set of irreducible intervals, a generating subset of the set of all common intervals of k permutations.", "paper_title": "Common Intervals of Multiple Permutations", "paper_id": "WOS:000288752600001"}
