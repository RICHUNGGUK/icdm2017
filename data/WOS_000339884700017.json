Building on the powerful Kurdyka-Aojasiewicz property, we derive a self-contained convergence analysis framework and establish that each bounded sequence generated by PALM globally converges to a critical point. Our approach allows to analyze various classes of nonconvex-nonsmooth problems and related nonconvex proximal forward-backward algorithms with semi-algebraic problem's data, the later property being shared by many functions arising in a wide variety of fundamental applications. A by-product of our framework also shows that our results are new even in the convex setting. As an illustration of the results, we derive a new and simple globally convergent algorithm for solving the sparse nonnegative matrix factorization problem.", "paper_title": "Proximal alternating linearized minimization for nonconvex and nonsmooth problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000339884700017"}
