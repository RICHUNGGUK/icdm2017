The formulation is based on the scaled boundary-finite element method. The surrounding medium is approximately accounted for by a dashpot boundary condition derived from the acoustic impedances of the infinite medium. It is discussed under which circumstances this approximation leads to sufficiently accurate results. Computational costs are very low, since the surrounding medium does not require discretization and the number of degrees of freedom on the cross-section is significantly reduced by utilizing higher-order spectral elements.
