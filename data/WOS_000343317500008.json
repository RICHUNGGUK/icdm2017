Our measurements show that the 3G traffic exhibits high fluctuations both in time and over space, thus incurring energy waste. In this paper, we propose Green base station networks (GreenBSN) to approximate network-wide energy proportionality using non-loadadaptive BSes. The instrument is a traffic-driven approach. By leveraging the inherent temporal-spatial traffic dynamics and node deployment heterogeneity, we power off under-utilized BSes under light traffic. Our evaluation on four regional 3G networks shows that GreenBSN yields up to 53 percent energy savings in dense large cities and 23 percent in sparsely deployed regions.", "paper_title": "GreenBSN: Enabling Energy-Proportional Cellular Base Station Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000343317500008"}
