The camera pose estimation process, the process of estimating a camera's extrinsic parameters, is based oil closed-form geometrical approaches which use the benefit of simple corner detection of 3D cubic-like virtual studio landmarks. We first look at the effective parameters of the camera pose estimation process for the virtual Studio. Our Studies include all characteristic landmark parameters like landmark lengths, landmark corner angles and their installation position errors and some camera parameters like lens focal length and CCD resolution. Through computer simulation we investigate and analyze all these parameters' efficiency in camera extrinsic parameters, including camera rotation and position matrixes. Based oil this work, we found that the camera translation vector is affected more than other camera extrinsic parameters because of the noise of effective camera pose estimation parameters. Therefore, we present a novel iterative geometrical noise cancellation method for the closed-form camera pose estimation process. This is based oil the collinearity theory that reduces the estimation error of the camera translation vector, which plays a major role in camera extrinsic parameters estimation errors. To validate our method, we test it in a complete virtual studio simulation. Our simulation results show that they are in the same order as those of some commercial systems, Such as the BBC and InterSense IS-1200 VisTracker. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
