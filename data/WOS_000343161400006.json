The proposed method is based on a parametric linear least squares approach to find the coefficients of synthesis filters used for signal reconstruction of periodic-nonuniform samples. The coefficients of synthesis filters found by linear least squares approach satisfy the general condition for an alias-free filter bank.", "paper_title": "Second Order Taylor Polyphase Reconstruction of Periodic-Nonuniform Samples in Time-Interleaved ADCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000343161400006"}
