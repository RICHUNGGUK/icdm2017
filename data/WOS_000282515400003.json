Our approach avoids the need for explicit mathematical representation of the surface and can be implemented easily in existing graphical software, as it is based on the very popular representation of a surface as collection of polygons. We discuss applications involving the volumes, surface areas and molecular surface electrostatic potentials, and local ionization energies of a group of 11 molecules.", "paper_title": "Quantitative analysis of molecular surfaces: areas, volumes, electrostatic potentials and average local ionization energies", "paper_id": "WOS:000282515400003"}
