Recent work has shown that exploiting strong correlation between high-frequency content of different color components can improve the denoising performance. We show that for typical color images high correlation also means similarity, and propose to exploit this strong intercolor dependency using an optimal luminance/color-difference space projection. Experimental results confirm that performing denoising on the projected color components yields superior denoising performance, both in peak signal-to-noise ratio and visual quality sense, compared to that of existing solutions. We also develop a novel approach to estimate directly from the noisy image data the image and noise statistics, which are required to determine the optimal projection.", "paper_title": "Edge-preserving image denoising via optimal color space projection", "paper_id": "WOS:000239774800010"}
