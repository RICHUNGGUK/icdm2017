Compared to differential path, the common-mode feedback loop is often affected by poles and zeros shifting that degrades the large signal response of the amplifiers. This drawback is made worse in some well-known topologies as the difference-differential amplifier (DDA) that shows non-constant transconductance and poor linearity. This work proposes a body-driven positive-feedback frequency compensation technique (BD-PFFC) to improve the linearity for precision DDA-based S/H applications. Theoretical calculations and circuit simulations carried out in a 0.13 mu m process are also given to demonstrate its validity.", "paper_title": "An improved common-mode feedback loop for the differential-difference amplifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000312769900005"}
