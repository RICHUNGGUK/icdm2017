Parameter estimation in these models relies heavily on accurate evaluations of the log likelihood and its derivatives. Classical approaches use a discretized time version of the spiking process, and recent work has exploited the existence of a refractory period (during which the conditional intensity is zero following a spike) to obtain more accurate estimates of the likelihood. In this brief letter, we demonstrate that this method can be improved significantly by applying classical quadrature methods directly to the resulting continuous-time integral.", "paper_title": "On Quadrature Methods for Refractory Point Process Likelihoods", "paper_id": "WOS:000344921400004"}
