Most physicians in Taiwan have adopted a computerized physician order entry system for traditional Chinese medicine. Use of such a system can prevent some adverse events related to a paper-based system but increases other unexpected risks. This study is the first to introduce a patient safety-based acupuncture treatment information system that integrates advanced healthcare devices to reduce the risks associated with acupuncture treatment using a computerized physician order entry system for traditional Chinese medicine. The acupuncture treatment information system considerably improved patient safety and increased clinicians' workflow efficiency. The importance-performance analysis indicated that improvement in the vital sign measurement function was of the highest priority. In conclusion, acupuncture treatment-the demand for which is increasing-can be performed more safely using an acupuncture treatment information system.", "paper_title": "Application of an Importance-Performance Analysis Approach to Evaluate an Acupuncture Treatment Information System", "paper_id": "WOS:000348188800005"}
