We have studied VSNs by utilizing about 4000 taxis and 1000 buses equipped with GPS-based mobile sensors in Shanghai to constitute a virtual vehicular sensor network. The communication-connection intermittence makes the routing issue nontrivial when delay-tolerant applications are deployed in VSNs. The existing DTN routing protocols can be categorized as \"neighbor-oriented\" and how to select a neighbor candidate was always neglected. In this paper, we present a new DTN routing protocol for Delay-Tolerant Vehicular Sensor Networks, Packet-Oriented Routing protocol (POR), which is designed to emphasize neighbor selection based on awareness of packets to be sent and in consideration of probability to complete transferring of these packets. Our results show that POR performs much better than the ordinary Epidemic routing, as well as other popular routing protocols applied in a similar setting.", "paper_title": "Packet-Oriented Routing in Delay-Tolerant Vehicular Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000271834700009"}
