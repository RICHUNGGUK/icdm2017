We show that for a given Kanban system, it is possible to change the original feedback loop by a (max,+)-linear controller which keeps the same quality of service but reduces the work in process. This new control policy contains a (max,+)-linear dynamic behaviour for the recycling of Kanban cards.", "paper_title": "Kanban policy improvement thanks to a (max, plus )-algebra analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000256799900004"}
