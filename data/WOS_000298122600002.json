Recently, the concept of clustering stability, which measures the robustness of any given clustering algorithm, has been utilized in Wang (2010) for selecting the number of clusters through cross validation. In this paper, an estimation scheme for clustering instability is developed based on the bootstrap, and then the number of clusters is selected so that the corresponding estimated clustering instability is minimized. The proposed selection criterion's effectiveness is demonstrated on simulations and real examples. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
