Herein, we employed an intensified CCD system installed in a commercial small animal CT (Computed Tomography) scanner to compare image reconstructions from time-independent, continuous wave (CW) measurements and from time-dependent, frequency domain (FD) measurements in a series of physical phantoms specifically designed for evaluation. Comparisons were performed as a function of 1) number of projections, 2) the level of preprocessing filters used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 3) endogenous heterogeneity of optical properties, as well as in the cases of 4) two fluorescent targets and 5) a mouse-shaped phantom. Assessment of quantitative recovery of fluorescence absorption cross section was performed using a fully parallel, regularization-free, linear reconstruction algorithm with diffusion approximation (DA) and high order simplified spherical harmonics (SPN) approximation to the radiative transport equation (RTE). The results show that while FD measurements may result in superior image reconstructions over CW measurements, data acquisition times are significantly longer, necessitating further development of multiple detector/source configurations, improved data read-out rates, and detector technology. FD measurements with SP3 reconstructions enabled better quantitative recovery of fluorescent target strength, but required increased computational expense. Despite the developed parallel reconstruction framework being able to achieve more than 60 times speed increase over sequential implementation, further development in faster parallel acceleration strategies for near-real time and real-time image recovery and more precise forward solution is necessary.", "paper_title": "Experimental Comparison of Continuous-Wave and Frequency-Domain Fluorescence Tomography in a Commercial Multi-Modal Scanner", "paper_id": "WOS:000355755700001"}
