An example of one of the main applications is to communicate important information from inaccessible areas by spreading \"enough\" mobile sensors which must self-configure and assemble. According to our protocol, virtual infrastructure-based energy-efficient (VIBE) routing, the information is routed in a multihop, cluster level fashion by enabling each sensor to make individual decisions regarding its mode of operation. The aim is to prolong the network's lifetime by minimising the average energy spent for each communication. VIBE is capable of addressing mobility requirements as it is completely independent of any kind of topological knowledge and control messages. We show by extended experiments that VIBE performs very well in terms of consumed energy by comparing it to standard directed flooding and greedy forwarding protocols. We also compare it to LEACH (Rabiner Heinzelman et al., 2000) and a more recent protocol, namely MECH (Chang and Kuo, 2006). VIBE proves to save large amounts of energy when compared to the first three and up to 15% compared to MECH. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
