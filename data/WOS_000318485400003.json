This makes it difficult to execute programs having control divergence among PEs without predication. However, conventional predication techniques have a negative impact on both performance and power consumption due to longer instruction words and unnecessary instruction-fetching/decoding/nullifying steps. This article reveals performance and power issues in predicated execution which have not been well-addressed yet. Furthermore, it proposes fast and power-efficient predication mechanisms. Experiments conducted through gate-level simulation show that our mechanism improves energy-delay product by 11.9% to 23.8% on average.", "paper_title": "Power-Efficient Predication Techniques for Acceleration of Control Flow Execution on CGRA", "paper_id": "WOS:000318485400003"}
