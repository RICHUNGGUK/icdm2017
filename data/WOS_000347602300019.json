The material properties are assumed to vary through the thickness according to the power law. The formulations are based on the classical plate theory and the concept of the principle of the minimum potential energy. The Newton-Raphson method is used to solve the equilibrium equations. A range of applications are described and the numerical results are compared to the available results, wherever possible. (C) 2014 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
