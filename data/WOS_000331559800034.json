Knowledge diffusion across countries in the field of management is then analyzed as a case study. Main countries in the field of management studies are considered as centers in their own ego-centered citation networks. The three indicators mentioned above are then calculated for these ego-centered citation networks. They measure the scientific impact each of these countries has on other nations. A general picture of the knowledge diffusion process is given by the three indicators at the country level over four periods 1992-1996, 1997-2001, 2002-2006, and 2007-2011. The validity of the proposed indicators is verified by the calculated results.", "paper_title": "How knowledge diffuses across countries: a case study in the field of management", "paper_id": "WOS:000331559800034"}
