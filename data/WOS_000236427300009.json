To be effective, self-managed, learning requires individuals to self-assess their IT knowledge; accurate self-assessment helps them optimize the capabilities they possess and be aware of those they do not. This study demonstrated that, in general, individuals did not accurately self-assess their knowledge of the software they used. However, we also found that the accuracy of self-assessment increased with greater experience in, and better understanding of, IT domains. Organizations need to recognize the self-assessment problem to facilitate effective software teaming and to gain the most from their software investments. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
