This method enables a robot to perform flexible cooperation based on the global evaluation of the achievement of objectives. Each robot communicates qualitative evaluation on the achievement level of each objective. Each robot calculates the global evaluation on the achievement of the team objective from the individual evaluation. The evaluation on the objective achievement is abstracted in order to reduce the influence of variation of the evaluation value and the communication load. As an example, the method is applied to the EIGEN team robots for the Middle Size League of RoboCup, since it is necessary for the soccer robots to cooperate each other in dynamic environment. Its effectiveness was demonstrated through the RoboCup 2004 competition.", "paper_title": "Cooperative action control tbased on evaluating objective achievements", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623100019"}
