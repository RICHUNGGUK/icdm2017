In the present work, two different structure representationsatom counts (2D) and radial distribution function (RDF) (3D)and two supervised classification methodscounterpropagation neural networks and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)were used to predict the tribe in which a given STL occurs. The data set was extended from 144 to 921 STLs, and the Asteraceae tribes were augmented from three to seven. The k-NN classifier with k = 1 showed the best performance, while the RDF code outperformed the atom counts. The quality of the obtained model was assessed with two test sets, which exemplified two possible applications: (1) finding a plant source for a desired compound and (2) based on a plant species chemical profile (STLs): (a) study the relationship between the current taxonomic classification and plant's chemistry and (b) assign a species to a tribe by majority vote. In addition, the problem of defining the applicability domain of the models was assessed by means of two different approachesprincipal component analysis combined with Hotelling T(2) statistic and an a posteriori probability-based rule.", "paper_title": "Sesquiterpene lactones-based classification of the family Asteraceae using neural networks and k-nearest neighbors", "paper_id": "WOS:000243577400002"}
