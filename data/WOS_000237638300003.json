We show that it is crucial to use neutral examples in learning polarity for a variety of reasons. Learning from negative and positive examples alone will not permit accurate classification of neutral examples. Moreover, the use of neutral training examples in learning facilitates better distinction between positive and negative examples.", "paper_title": "The importance of neutral examples for learning sentiment", "paper_id": "WOS:000237638300003"}
