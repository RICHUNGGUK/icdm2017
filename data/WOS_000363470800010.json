In this paper, we study its properties by (1) giving a closed form solution to the surface area of HS(2n,n), (2) discussing its Hamiltonicity by establishing an isomorphism between the graph and the well-known middle levels problem, and (3) showing that full binary trees can be embedded into HS(2n,n) with dilation 1. We also develop a single-port optimal neighbourhood broadcasting algorithm for HS(2n,n).
