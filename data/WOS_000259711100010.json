In this paper the inverse problem, of reconstructing the space from the geodesic equations is addressed. A procedure is developed for obtaining the metric tensor explicitly from the Christoffel symbols. The procedure is extended for determining if a second order quadratically semi-linear system can be expressed as a system of geodesic equations, provided it has terms only quadratic in the first derivative apart from the second derivative term. A computer code has been developed for dealing with large systems of geodesic equations.", "paper_title": "Constructing a space from the geodesic equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000259711100010"}
