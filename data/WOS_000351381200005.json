All prior work assumes that the underlying data is deterministic. However, in reality, graphs are often noisy and uncertain due to various factors, such as errors in data extraction, inconsistencies in data integration, and for privacy-preserving purposes. Therefore, in this paper, we study similarity graph containment search on large uncertain graph databases. Similarity graph containment search consists of subgraph similarity search and supergraph similarity search. Different from previous works assuming that edges in an uncertain graph are independent of each other, we study uncertain graphs where edges' occurrences are correlated. We formally prove that subgraph or supergraph similarity search over uncertain graphs is P-hard; thus, we employ a filter-and-verify framework to speed up these two queries. For the subgraph similarity query, in the filtering phase, we develop tight lower and upper bounds of subgraph similarity probability based on a probabilistic matrix index (PMI). PMI is composed of discriminative subgraph features associated with tight lower and upper bounds of subgraph isomorphism probability. Based on PMI, we can filter out a large number of uncertain graphs and maximize the pruning capability. During the verification phase, we develop an efficient sampling algorithm to validate the remaining candidates. For the supergraph similarity query, in the filtering phase, we propose two pruning algorithms, one lightweight and the other strong, based on maximal common subgraphs of query graph and data graph. We run the two pruning algorithms against a probabilistic index that consists of powerful graph features. In the verification, we design an approximate algorithm based on the Horvitz-Thompson estimator to fast validate the remaining candidates. The efficiencies of our proposed solutions to the subgraph and supergraph similarity search have been verified through extensive experiments on real uncertain graph datasets.", "paper_title": "Graph similarity search on large uncertain graph databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000351381200005"}
