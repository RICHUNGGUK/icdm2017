The security concerns add more complexity as well as potential risks to COTS selection process, and it is always a great challenge for developers to make the selection decisions. In this paper, we provide a method for security risk analysis in COTS based development (CBD) based on Common Criteria and our previous work in identifying general risk items for CBD. The research result provides useful insights for developers in identifying security risks, so that it can be used to aid for the COTS selection decision.", "paper_title": "Towards an approach for security risk analysis in COTS based development", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107800014"}
