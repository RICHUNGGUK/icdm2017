A sine curve of the change rate of acceleration, which is called as jerk in the following text, is proposed for uniaxial flexible acceleration and deceleration planning based on the optimal time and velocity and acceleration constraints. Compared with other curves, the proposed curve can realize a continuous n-order derivative and the smooth change of the speed and acceleration. The method is computationally simple and suitable for programming. In addition, a multiaxial coordinated movement scheme is proposed. The motion trajectory is no longer simply split into many single-direction trajectories nor are all single-direction planning trajectories combined directly. The multiaxial coordinated movement scheme aims to achieve synergic movement in multiple directions to ensure smoothness of the movement in the event of a kinematic error when maintaining a stable value. If the movement fails to achieve this goal, driving force mutations will deteriorate the effect of synergic movement. A physical model of the parallel mechanism is developed in simMechanics, and a holistic system model is completed in SIMULINK. The feasibility of the new planning algorithm is simulated and tested, and then, the multiaxial synergic movement planning method is proposed and verified.", "paper_title": "Synergic Motion Trajectory Planning for Airplane Docking Based on 6PURU Parallel Mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000364490200008"}
