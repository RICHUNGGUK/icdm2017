We use the received data to construct a set of Toeplitz matrices through which a trilinear model is formed, and then the trilinear decomposition is used to attain the DOAs of sources. The proposed algorithm is effective for a single pulse. Compared to the forward backward spatial smoothing estimation method of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT), the ESPRIT-like of Han, and the ESPRIT-like of Li algorithms, our method has better angle estimation performance. Numerical simulations present the effectiveness and improvement of our approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
