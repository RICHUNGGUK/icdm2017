This entanglement is a footprint of the presence of the Kondo cloud and may be engineered so as to attain-even for very large chains-a constant high value independent of the length; in addition, it is thermally robust. To better evidence the remarkable peculiarities of the Kondo regime, we carry a parallel analysis of the entanglement properties of the Kondo spin chain model in the gapped dimerised regime where these remarkable features are absent.", "paper_title": "ENGINEERING LONG RANGE DISTANCE INDEPENDENT ENTANGLEMENT VIA LOCAL MANIPULATION OF A KONDO SPIN CHAIN", "paper_id": "WOS:000289153800006"}
