A recent CRT-based factorization attack exploiting hardware fault has received growing attention because of its potential vulnerability on most existing implementations. In this attack any single erroneous computation will make the RSA system be vulnerable to factorizing the public modulus. Recently, two hardware fault immune protocols for CRT speedup on RSA private computation were reported based on the concept of fault infective computation. A special property of these two protocols is that they do not assume the existence of totally fault free and tamper free comparison operation within the machine in order to enhance the reliability. However, it will be shown in this paper that these two protocols are still vulnerable to a potential computational fault attack on an auxiliary process that was not considered in the usual CRT-based factorization attack.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis of two protocols for RSA with CRT based on fault infection", "paper_id": "WOS:000241693000005"}
