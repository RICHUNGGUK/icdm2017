Selection of process variables to optimize combustion efficiency is discussed. The selected variables are critical for control of combustion efficiency of a coal-fired boiler in the presence of operating constraints. Two schemes of generating control settings and updating control variables are evaluated. One scheme is based on the controllable and noncontrollable variables. The second one incorporates response variables into the clustering process. The process control scheme based on the response variables produces the smallest variance of the target variable due to reduced coupling among the process variables. An industrial case study. and its implementation illustrate the control approach developed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Constraint-based control of boiler efficiency: A data-mining approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000244803600009"}
