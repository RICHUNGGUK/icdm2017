They are generated by ALMA (A Layered Model of Affect), a real-time computational model of affect, designed to serve as a modular extension for virtual humans. By a unique integration of psychological models of affect, it provides three major affect types: emotions, moods and personality that cover short, medium, and long term affect. The evaluation of computer-generated affect is based on textual dialog situations in which at least two characters are interacting with each other. In this setup, elicited emotions or the change of mood are defined as consequences of dialog contributions from the involved characters. The results indicate that ALMA provides authentic believable emotions and moods. They can be used for modules that control cognitive processes and physical behavior of virtual humans in order to improve their lifelikeness and their believable qualities.", "paper_title": "Are computer-generated emotions and moods plausible to humans?", "paper_id": "WOS:000240268400028"}
