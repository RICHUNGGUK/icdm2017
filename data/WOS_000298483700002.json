We describe methods proposed to enforce dissemination scope such as geocast/broadcast and multicast. A growing category consisting of methods designed to achieve disruption tolerance in vehicular networks is presented. We describe the key ideas of representative technologies in each category. In addition, we consider location service and security issues that are crucial for data dissemination in VANET. We conclude by sharing our thoughts on further challenges.
