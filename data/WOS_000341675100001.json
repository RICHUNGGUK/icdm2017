There are, however, insufficient empirical measures to assess students' ICT literacy. In this study, a three-factor, 17-item perceived ICT literacy scale (3F-PICTLS) assessing information literacy (information), internet literacy (communication), and computer literacy (technology) was developed and validated using a stratified random sample of 826 junior secondary school students from 36 schools in Hong Kong. Results indicated that the scale demonstrated good reliability and validity. We discussed the pedagogical and educational contributions of the scale. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
