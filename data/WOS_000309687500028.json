Our lab recently developed an intensity-incorporated peptide identification algorithm, and here we implemented this scheme for cross-linked peptide discovery. Our program, SQID-XLink, searches all regular, dead-end, intra and inter cross-linked peptides simultaneously, and its effectiveness is validated by testing a published dataset. This new algorithm provides an alternative approach for high confidence cross-linking identification.", "paper_title": "SQID-XLink: implementation of an intensity-incorporated algorithm for cross-linked peptide identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000309687500028"}
