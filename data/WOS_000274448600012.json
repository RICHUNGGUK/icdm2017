This filter is used essentially to remove impulsive and Gaussian noise in colour images. In our design we start by implementing the software solution in system on programmable chip context using NIOS-II softcore processor and mu Clinux as operating system. We evaluate the execution lime of the whole filtering process. Than we add a hardware accelerator part. This latter is implemented using fast parallel architecture. Compared to the software solution results, the use of the hardware accelerator improves clearly the filtering speed and maintains the good filtering quality as shown by simulations.", "paper_title": "HW/SW Design-Based Implementation of Vector Median Rational Hybrid Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000274448600012"}
