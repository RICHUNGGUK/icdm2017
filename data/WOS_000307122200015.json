Anomaly intrusion detection plays an important role in IDS to detect new attacks by detecting any deviation from the normal profile. In this paper, an intelligent algorithm with feature selection and decision rules applied to anomaly intrusion detection is proposed. The key idea is to take the advantage of support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and simulated annealing (SA). In the proposed algorithm, SVM and SA can find the best selected features to elevate the accuracy of anomaly intrusion detection. By analyzing the information from using KDD'99 dataset, DT and SA can obtain decision rules for new attacks and can improve accuracy of classification. In addition, the best parameter settings for the DT and SVM are automatically adjusted by SA. The proposed algorithm outperforms other existing approaches. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is successful in detecting anomaly intrusion detection.
