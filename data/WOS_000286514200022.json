Turbo equalization followed as a natural extension to this development, as an iterative technique for detection and decoding of data that has been both protected with forward error correction and transmitted over a channel with intersymbol interference (ISI). In this paper, we review the turbo equalization approach to coded data transmission over ISI channels, with an emphasis on the basic ideas, some of the practical details, and many of the research directions that have arisen from this offshoot, introduced by Douillard, et al. of the original turbo decoding algorithm. The subsequent relaxation of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) equalization algorithm to include linear and other simpler receivers sparked a decade and a half of research into iterative algorithms, spanning research problems ranging from trellis coded modulation to underwater acoustic communications.", "paper_title": "Turbo Equalization: An Overview", "paper_id": "WOS:000286514200022"}
