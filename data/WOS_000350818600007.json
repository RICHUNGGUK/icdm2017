Employing a value-sensitive approach, we undertook theoretical and empirical analyses to explore the values that influence potential users' adoption of cloud courseware, by integrating cognitive motivations and user values as primary determining factors. We found that users' intentions and behaviours are largely influenced by their perceptions of what is valuable about the cloud courseware in terms of sociability, learnability, and usability. These evaluations were found to be significant antecedents of cloud-computing intentions. This study makes a contribution to theory development as our model extends existing technology acceptance models and can be used to design user interfaces and promote the acceptance of cloud computing. For practical applications, the study findings can be used by industries promoting cloud services to increase user acceptance by addressing user values and incorporating them into cloud-computing design.", "paper_title": "User value design for cloud courseware system", "paper_id": "WOS:000350818600007"}
