It not only simplifies the cumbersome certificate management in traditional PIG, but also solves the key escrow problem inherent in identity-based encryption. In this paper, we propose a new certificate-based encryption scheme without random oracles that is provably secure against key replacement attacks. The proposed certificate-based encryption scheme is proven to be secure under the hardness of the decision 3-Party Diffie-Hellman problem in the standard model. Performance comparison shows that the proposed scheme outperforms all the previous standard-model certificate-based encryption schemes in the literature.", "paper_title": "Efficient Certificate-Based Encryption Scheme Secure Against Key Replacement Attacks in the Standard Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000342328800014"}
