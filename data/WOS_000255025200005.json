An additional difficulty is the high nonuniformity of the background in different parts of the same image. The first method is based on correlating subimages with a nondefective reference subimage and searching for pixels with low correlation. To speed up calculations, correlations are replaced by a map of locally computed inner products. The second approach does not require a reference subimage and is based on estimating local entropies and searching for areas with maximum entropy. A nonparametric estimator of local entropy is also proposed, together with its realization as a bank of RBF neural networks. The performance of both methods is illustrated with an industrial image.", "paper_title": "Local correlation and entropy maps as tools for detecting defects in industrial images", "paper_id": "WOS:000255025200005"}
