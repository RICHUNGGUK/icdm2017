The research design involved the assessment of participants' ERP competency, each of whom participated in four games of a computer-based simulation, ERPsim. ERP knowledge was assessed using a validated questionnaire, which included questions with different complexity levels. Results indicate that although reported student grade point average is not a predictor of ERP competency, ERP knowledge mastery (particularly complex knowledge) does predict ERP competence. While mastering basic ERP knowledge does not predict the competency of the participants, these results can provide useful guidelines with respect to teaching and assessment practices, as well as the development of ERP curricula. To effectively prepare learners to be able to perform in authentic learning contexts, instructors could emphasize the mastery of complex knowledge and consequently use complex knowledge test questions as a component of the instruction.", "paper_title": "DEVELOPING AND ASSESSING ERP COMPETENCIES: BASIC AND COMPLEX KNOWLEDGE", "paper_id": "WOS:000362927200004"}
