In this paper, a new and reversible watermarking method is proposed to address this security issue. Specifically, signature information and textual data are inserted into the original medical images based on recursive dither modulation (RDM) algorithm after wavelet transform and singular value decomposition (SVD). In addition, differential evolution (DE) is applied to design the quantization steps (QSs) optimally for controlling the strength of the watermark. Using these specially designed hybrid techniques, the proposed watermarking technique obtains good imperceptibility and high robustness. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is not only highly competitive, but also outperforms the existing methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
