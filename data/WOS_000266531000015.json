Let us consider a channel with bandwidth a . b Mbps where a is a positive integer and b Mbps is the same as the normal playback rate. The SingBroad protocol first divides a video with time length L into 2(a-1) - 1 equal-length segments and broadcasts these segments over the given single channel. The average waiting time of the SingBroad protocol is L/(2a(2(a-1) - 1)1(a - 1)) and the buffer requirement is ((1 + 1/a) . 2(a-2) - 1)/(2(a-1) - 1) of a video size. In terms of the average waiting time and the maximum buffer requirement, the SingBroad method outperforms the alternative broadcasting method when utilizing the same single channel.
