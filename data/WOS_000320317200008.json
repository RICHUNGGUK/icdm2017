However, certain categories of people are excluded from this form of entertainment and social interaction because they are unable to use the interface of the games. The reason for this can be deficits in motor control, vision or hearing. By using automatic speech recognition systems (ASR), voice driven commands can be used to control the game, which can thus open up the possibility for people with motor system difficulty to be included in game communities. This paper aims at find a standard way of using voice commands in games which uses a speech recognition system in the backend, and that can be universally applied for designing inclusive games. Present speech recognition systems however, do not support emotions, attitudes, tones etc. This is a drawback because such expressions can be vital for gaming. Taking multiple types of existing genres of games into account and analyzing their voice command requirements, a general ASRS module is proposed which can work as a common platform for designing inclusive games. A fuzzy logic controller proposed then is to enhance the system. The standard voice driven module can be based on algorithm or fuzzy controller which can be used to design software plug-ins or can be included in microchip. It then can be integrated with the game engines; creating the possibility of voice driven universal access for controlling games.", "paper_title": "Automatic speech recognition- an approach for designing inclusive games", "paper_id": "WOS:000320317200008"}
