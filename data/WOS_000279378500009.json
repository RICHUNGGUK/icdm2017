The efficiency of the FEC has been significantly compromised, however, due to the characteristics of the wireless channel such as burst packet loss, channel fluctuation and lack of Quality of Service (QoS) support. We propose herein an Adaptive Cross-layer FEC mechanism (ACFEC) to enhance the quality of video streaming over 802.11 WLANs. Under the conventional approaches, FEC functions are implemented on the application layer, and required feedback information to calculate redundancy rates. Our proposed ACFEC mechanism, however, leverages the functionalities of different network layers. The Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) function on the Media Access Control ( MAC) layer can detect packet losses. Through cooperation with the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), the redundancy rates are adaptively controlled based on the packet loss information. The experiment results demonstrate that the ACFEC mechanism is able to adaptively adjust and control the redundancy rates and, thereby, to overcome both of temporary and persistent channel fluctuations. Consequently, the proposed mechanism, under various network conditions, performs better in recovery than the conventional methods, while generating a much less volume of redundant traffic.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive FEC Mechanism Using Cross-layer Approach to Enhance Quality of Video Transmission over 802.11 WLANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000279378500009"}
