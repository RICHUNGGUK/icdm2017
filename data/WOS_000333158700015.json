To this end we use a globally convergent algorithm based on a potential reduction approach. We establish global convergence results for many interesting instances of quasi-variational inequalities, vastly broadening the class of problems that can be solved with theoretical guarantees. Our numerical testings are very promising and show the practical viability of the approach.", "paper_title": "Solving quasi-variational inequalities via their KKT conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000333158700015"}
