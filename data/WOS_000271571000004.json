However, the nature of supplier selection is a complex multi-criteria problem including both quantitative and qualitative factors which may be in conflict and may also be uncertain. The VIKOR method was developed to solve multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problems with conflicting and non-commensurable (different units) criteria, assuming that compromising is acceptable for conflict resolution, the decision maker wants a solution that is the closest to the ideal, and the alternatives are evaluated according to all established criteria. In this paper, linguistic values are used to assess the ratings and weights for these factors. These linguistic ratings can be expressed in trapezoidal or triangular fuzzy numbers. Then, a hierarchy MCDM model based on fuzzy sets theory and VIKOR method is proposed to deal with the supplier selection problems in the supply chain system. A numerical example is proposed to illustrate an application of the proposed model.
