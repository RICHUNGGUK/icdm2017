Design/methodology/approach - Scheduling model is formulated as a discrete-time State Task Network. Given a scheduling horizon consisting of several time-periods in which product demands are placed, the objective is to select a schedule that maximizes the expected profit for a single and multiple product with a given probability level. The stochastic elements of the model are expressed with equivalent deterministic optimization models. Findings - The TSM model not only allows for uncertain product demand correlations, but also gives different processing modes by a range of batch sizes and a task-dependent processing time. The experimental results show that the TSM model is more appropriate than another model for multiperiod scheduling of multiproduct batch plants under correlated uncertain demand. Research limitations/implications - The choice of penalty parameter of demand uncertainty is the main limitation. Practical implications - The paper provides very useful advice for multiperiod scheduling of multiproduct batch plants under demand uncertainty. Originality/value - A stochastic model for the multiperiod scheduling of multiproduct batch plants under demand uncertainty was set up. A test problem involving 12 correlated uncertain product demands and two alternative models verified the availability of the TSM.", "paper_title": "Optimal multiperiod scheduling of multiproduct batch plants under demand uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000294884200023"}
