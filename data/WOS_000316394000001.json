Two methods are proposed to synchronize the general forms of hyperchaotic systems, and their performance in secure communication application is verified. These methods use the radial basis function (RBF)-based neural controllers for this purpose. The first method uses a standard RBF neural controller. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to derive and optimize the parameters of the RBF controller. In the second method, with the aim of increasing the robustness of the RBF controller, an error integral term is added to the equations of RBF neural network. For this method, the coefficients of the error integral component and the parameters of RBF neural network are also derived and optimized via PSO algorithm. For better comparison, the proposed methods and an optimal PID controller optimized by PSO are applied to the Lorenz hyperchaotic system for secure communication. Simulation results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods in both performance and robustness in comparison with the PID controller.", "paper_title": "Hyperchaos synchronization using PSO-optimized RBF-based controllers to improve security of communication systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000316394000001"}
