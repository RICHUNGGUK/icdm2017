Static fingerprint-based techniques are commonly used for location estimation, in which a radio map is built by calibrating signal-strength values in the offline phase. These values, compiled into deterministic or probabilistic models, are used for online localization. However, the radio map can be outdated when signal-strength values change over time due to environmental dynamics, and repeated data calibration is infeasible or expensive. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, known as Location Estimation using Model Trees (LEMT), to reconstruct a radio map by using real-time signal-strength readings received at the reference points. This algorithm can take real-time signal-strength values at each time point into account and make use of the dependency between the estimated locations and reference points. We show that this technique can effectively accommodate the variations of signal strength over different time periods without the need to repeatedly rebuild the radio maps. The effectiveness of LEMT is demonstrated using two real data sets collected from an 802.11b wireless network and a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)-based network.", "paper_title": "Learning adaptive temporal radio maps for signal-strength-based location estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000255792700005"}
