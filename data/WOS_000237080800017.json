Hence, QoS (Quality of Service) plays an important role. In this paper, a QoS framework is proposed to support partial request satisfaction by a priority attribute controlling the preferences of WSDL requests and the corresponding sub-requests. In our framework, the priority attribute and the QoS information from the service providers are utilized by the PRSA algorithm for the assignments of client requests. The core of the PRSA algorithm is using the online open-bin packing approach. We have performed a set of experiments to demonstrate the significance of the partial request satisfaction with a range of values set for the priority attribute. The results are interesting and demonstrated the usefulness of the new WSDL enhancement.", "paper_title": "Quality assignments for WSDL-based services", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800017"}
