Current implementations test the effect of one or more genetic markers while including prespecified covariates such as sex. Here we develop an efficient implementation of the linear mixed model that allows composite hypothesis tests to consider genotype interactions with variables such as other genotypes, environment, sex or ancestry. Our R package, Irgpr, allows interactive model fitting and examination of regression diagnostics to facilitate exploratory data analysis in the context of the linear mixed model. By leveraging parallel and out-of-core computing for datasets too large to fit in main memory, Irgpr is applicable to large GWAS datasets and next-generation sequencing data.", "paper_title": "Irgpr: interactive linear mixed model analysis of genome-wide association studies with composite hypothesis testing and regression diagnostics in R", "paper_id": "WOS:000344644600024"}
