Simulations were conducted numerically by the finite element method using a commercial CFX code (v.12.0) and an analysis of interfacial forces such as drag, lift and turbulent dispersion, as well as a comparison of k-epsilon and Reynolds Stress (RSM) turbulence models were performed. Different bubble sizes and two boundary conditions for the column exit were also verified. Gas velocities and holdup profiles were compared with experimental data. Results have shown that at the sparger region and without any simplification on the boundary condition the RSM model better represents the flow. At the fully developed region k-epsilon also showed good results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
