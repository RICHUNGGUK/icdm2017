This new paradigm applies to the design of the future Internet, which currently faces issues in supporting new applications, efficient resource utilization, and continuous evolvement. We observe several technological transformations in network architecture, services, and applications, and point out the grand opportunities for designing future Internet architecture, communication models, and resource management mechanisms enabled by the availability of massive network data. In particular, we envision in the future Internet: 1) computational complexity replaces state complexity in the control plane; 2) data intelligence enables user choices and rewards innovations; and 3) correlations from data analytics help solve inherently hard optimization problems. Finally, we identify the key challenges in data-driven Internet design and outline future research directions.", "paper_title": "Big Data: Transforming the Design Philosophy of Future Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000345579100004"}
