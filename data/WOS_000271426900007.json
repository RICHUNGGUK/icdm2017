The research has been conducted in the context of the DeltaGrid project, focusing on the development of a semantically robust execution environment for the composition of grid services. Delta-Enabled Grid Services (DEGS) are a foundational aspect of the DeltaGrid environment, extending grid services with the capability of recording incremental data changes, known as deltas. Deltas generated by DEGS are forwarded to a Process History Capture System (PHCS) that organises deltas from distributed sources into a global, time-sequenced schedule of data changes. The design and construction of DEGS is presented, along with the storage and indexing techniques for merging deltas from multiple DEGS to create a global schedule of data changes that can be analysed to determine how the failure and recovery of one process can potentially affect other data-dependent processes. The paper also summarises the performance results for the global history construction and retrieval process.", "paper_title": "Monitoring data dependencies in concurrent process execution through delta-enabled grid services", "paper_id": "WOS:000271426900007"}
