The past skyline query is a special case of the combinatorial skyline query. This generalized concept is semantically more abundant when used in decision making, market analysis, business planning, and quantitative economics research. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of the combinatorial skyline query (CSQ) and explain the difficulty in resolving this type of query. Then, we propose two algorithms to solve the problem. The experiments manifest the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
