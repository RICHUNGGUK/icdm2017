This technique transforms the minimum leakage pattern generation problem into a pseudo-Boolean optimization (PBO) problem. Nonlinear objective functions of leakage power are approximated by linear ones such that this problem can be solved efficiently by an existing PBO solver. A partitioning-based algorithm is applied for control point insertion and also CPU time reduction. Experimental results on the IEEE ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 90-nm technology show that, for large circuits, the static power is reduced from 8.3% (without partition) to 17.47% (with 64 partitions). Besides, the overall CPU time is reduced from 3600 s (without partition) to 83 s (with 64 partitions). This technique reduces the static power without changing the manufacturing process or library cells.", "paper_title": "DFT and Minimum Leakage Pattern Generation for Static Power Reduction During Test and Burn-In", "paper_id": "WOS:000274995400005"}
