A sensor device has limited computation capability, low battery power, and small memory size. To save the overall energy resources and maintain the security, we need to reduce the computation cost as well as the amount of encrypted data transmitting through the WSN. One plausible approach is to consolidate the encrypted data along the routing path. This is called concealed data aggregation (CDA). This paper proposes a novel end-to-end CDA scheme based on the concept of secret sharing. It has the following characteristics: 1) It provides efficient end-to-end encryption on the sensed data between. the sensor node and the sink node so that the sensed data remains confidential during transmission. 2) It is secure up to some fixed number of compromised nodes. 3) The size of the aggregated ciphertext is constant throughout the network. 4) It extends to aggregate two or more pieces of data separately in one round of transmission. 5) It is good for key update and routing flexibility.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT CONCEALED DATA AGGREGATION SCHEME FOR SENSOR NETWORKS BASED ON SECRET SHARING", "paper_id": "WOS:000271036900014"}
