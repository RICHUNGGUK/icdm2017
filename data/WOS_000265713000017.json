Burnashev's classic result is extended to finite-state ergodic Markov channels. For these channels, a single-letter characterization of the reliability function is presented, under the assumption of full causal output feedback, and full causal observation of the channel state both at the transmitter and at the receiver side. Tools from stochastic control theory are used in order to treat channels with intersymbol interference (ISI). Specifically, the convex-analytic approach to Markov decision processes is adopted in order to handle problems with stopping time horizons induced by variable-length coding schemes.", "paper_title": "The Error Exponent of Variable-Length Codes Over Markov Channels With Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000265713000017"}
