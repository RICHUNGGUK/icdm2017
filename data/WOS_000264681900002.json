The applications are started and stopped at run time, creating different use-cases. Resources, such as interconnects and memories, are shared between different applications, both within and between use-cases, to reduce silicon cost and power consumption. The functional and temporal behaviour of the applications is verified by simulation and formal methods. Traditionally, designers resort to monolithic verification of the system as whole, since the applications interfere in shared resources, and thus affect each other's behaviour. Due to interference between applications, the integration and verification complexity grows exponentially in the number of applications, and the task to verify correct behaviour of concurrent applications is on the system designer rather than the application designers. In this work, we propose a Composable and Predictable Multi-Processor System on Chip (CoMP-SoC) platform template. This scalable hardware and software template removes all interference between applications through resource reservations. We demonstrate how this enables a divide-and-conquer design strategy, where all applications, potentially using different programming models and communication paradigms, are developed and verified independently of one another. Performance is analyzed per application, using state-of-the-art dataflow techniques or simulation, depending on the requirements of the application. These results still apply when the applications are integrated onto the platform, thus separating system-level design and application design.", "paper_title": "CoMPSoC: A Template for Composable and Predictable Multi-Processor System on Chips", "paper_id": "WOS:000264681900002"}
