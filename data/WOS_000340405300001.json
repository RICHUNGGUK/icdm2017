How to organize and how to query the big sensing data are big challenges for intelligent applications. This paper studies the organization of big sensing data with event-linked network (ELN) model, where events are regarded as primary units for organizing data and links are used to represent the semantic associations among events. Several different types of queries on the event-linked network are also explored, which are different from queries on traditional relational database. We use an instance of smart home to show the effectiveness and efficiency of organization and query approaches based on the event-linked network.", "paper_title": "Organizing and Querying the Big Sensing Data with Event-Linked Network in the Internet of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000340405300001"}
