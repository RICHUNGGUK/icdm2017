Results: Our study identified 45 321 tags that match the antisense strand of 9804 known mRNA sequences, 6606 of which contain antisense ESTs and 3198 are mapped only by SAGE tags. Quantitative analysis showed that the detected antisense transcripts are present at levels lower than their counterpart sense transcripts. Experimental results confirmed the presence of antisense transcripts detected by the antisense tags. We also constructed an antisense tag database that can be used to identify the antisense SAGE tags originated from the antisense strand of known mRNA sequences included in the RefSeq database. Conclusions: Our study highlights the benefits of exploring SAGE data for comprehensive identification of human antisense transcripts and demonstrates the prevalence of antisense transcripts in the human genome.", "paper_title": "A large quantity of novel human antisense transcripts detected by LongSAGE", "paper_id": "WOS:000241271300005"}
