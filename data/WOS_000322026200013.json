Leakage energy waste can be reduced by power gating. In this paper, we extend token-based adaptive power gating (TAP), a technique to power gate an actively executing core during memory accesses, to many-core Chip Multi-Processors (CMPs). TAP works by tracking every system memory request and its estimated time of arrival so that a core may power gate itself without performance or energy loss. Previous work on TAP [11] shows several benefits compared to earlier state-of-the-art techniques [10], including zero performance hit and 2.58 times average energy savings for out-of-order cores. We show that TAP can adapt to increasing memory contention by increasing power-gated time by 3.69 times compared to a low memory-pressure case. We also scale TAP to many-core architectures with a distributed wake-up controller that is capable of supporting staggered wake-ups and able to power gate each core for 99.07% of the time, achieved by a non-scalable centralized scheme.", "paper_title": "Many-Core Token-Based Adaptive Power Gating", "paper_id": "WOS:000322026200013"}
