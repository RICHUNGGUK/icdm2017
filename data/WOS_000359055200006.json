In previous researches on P-D planning, the demands of the retailers and their inventory levels have less been controlled. This may lead into huge challenges for a P-D plan such as the bullwhip effects. Therefore, to remove this challenge, the purpose of this paper is to integrate a P-D planning and the vendor-managed inventory (VMI) as a strong strategy to manage the bullwhip effects in supply chains. The proposed P-D-VMI aims to minimize the total cost of the manufacturer, the total cost of the retailers, and the total distribution time simultaneously. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a multi-objective non-linear model for a P-D planning in a three-level supply chain including several external suppliers at the first level, a single manufacturer at the second level, and multi-retailer at the third level. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm and a non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm are designed and tuned to solve the proposed problem. Then, their performances are statistically analyzed and ranked by the TOPSIS method. Findings - The applicability of the proposed model and solution methodologies are demonstrated under several problems. A sensitivity analysis indicates the market scale and demand elasticity have a substantial impact on the total cost of the manufacturer in the proposed P-D-VMI. Originality/value - Although the P-D planning is a popular approach, there has been little discussion about the P-D planning based on VMI so far. The novelty comes from developing a practical and new approach that integrates the P-D planning and VMI.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective production-distribution planning based on vendor-managed inventory strategy in a supply chain", "paper_id": "WOS:000359055200006"}
