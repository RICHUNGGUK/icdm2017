Among the above-mentioned factors, the physical-layer impairments may significantly weaken the signal quality at the receiver. In this paper, the impact of both the channel power adjustment and the optical signal noise rate on the optimization of optical amplifiers over the optical propagation links is studied. Our objective is to employ a proper control strategy to effectively adjust the signal power level in the chain network. A new algorithm, which takes into account the physical-layer impairments in performance optimization, facilitates an impairment aware-proportional-integral-derivative neuron controller for improving the quality of transmission. Numerical results show that the proposed controller is capable of effectively compensating for the power impairments in optical links.", "paper_title": "Channel power control in optical amplifiers to mitigate physical impairment in optical network", "paper_id": "WOS:000362698900010"}
