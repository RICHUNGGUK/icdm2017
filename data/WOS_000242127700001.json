The system I is defined in the first order language and consists of the universal inductive rule, the refutation revision rule and the basic sentence expansion rule. A rule of I can be applied to a theory and a given instance depending on their logical relation, and generates a new version of the theory. When the instances are taken one after another, a version sequence will be generated. The rationality of the system I is demonstrated by the following three properties of the generated version sequence: the convergency, commutativity, and independency. The rationality of the system I is formally proved by constructing a procedure GUINA which generates such version sequences.", "paper_title": "An inductive inference system and its rationality", "paper_id": "WOS:000242127700001"}
