Because of the special requirements of our system, the chirp spread spectrum (CSS) is the most suitable indoor localization technology. The details of the new localization system are described. The system involves several anchors, tags, and a gateway, all of which use the nanoLOC TRX transceiver (NA5TR1) RF chip (Nanotron Co., Germany), which is based on the CSS technology. To validate the effectiveness of our system, both ranging and localization tests were carried out. The difference between the ranging accuracy indoors and outdoors was small. The localization system can position indoor mobile staff precisely, enabling the establishment of an emergency rescue mechanism.", "paper_title": "Hardware design of a localization system for staff in high-risk manufacturing areas", "paper_id": "WOS:000313369700001"}
