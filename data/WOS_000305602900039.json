To account for the influence of the solvent environment, the implicit polarized continuum model was also employed. For the halogenated cyclophane receptors 1 and 2, the halide ions are held by a bidentate array of halogen bonds (C-Br/C-I...X-), while multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions (C-H...X-) are present in the complexes of the nonhalogenated macrocyclic receptor 3. To accommodate the negatively charged guest anions, the structures of 1 and 2 fully reorganize into a calix-like shape, while both the imidazole and benzene rings in 3 tend to point towards the anions and thus rotate to form a cage-like shape. In both the gas phase and aqueous solution, the binding affinities of the anions for halogen-bonding receptors 1 and 2 become stronger than those for hydrogen-bonding receptor 3. The results reported here should prove to be of great value in the design and synthesis of effective and selective anion receptors based on halogen bonding.", "paper_title": "Anion recognition based on halogen bonding: a case study of macrocyclic imidazoliophane receptors", "paper_id": "WOS:000305602900039"}
