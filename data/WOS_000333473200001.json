However, termination itself was demonstrated only for a regular sequence of polynomials. In this paper, it is proved that the algorithm terminates for any input data. First, it is shown that if the algorithm does not terminate, it eventually generates two polynomials where the first is a reductor for the second. However, it is not argued that such a reduction is permitted by all the criteria introduced in F5. Next, it is shown that if such a pair exists, then there exists another pair for which the reduction is permitted by all the criteria, which is impossible.", "paper_title": "Termination of the F5 algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000333473200001"}
