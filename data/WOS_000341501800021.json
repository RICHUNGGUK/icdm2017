In contrast to implement what a plant has to do, we suggest a novel modelling approach which enables describing what a plant is able to do. Based on an extension of the Unified Modelling Language meta model, an object-oriented approach for describing a manufacturing system's state space in a consolidated way is proposed. The strict, declarative semantics of ontologies is utilized to automatically reason about this model for determining the manufacturing system's state space and deriving an optimal operation sequence to be implemented.", "paper_title": "Automatic generation of field control strategies for supporting (re-)engineering of manufacturing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000341501800021"}
