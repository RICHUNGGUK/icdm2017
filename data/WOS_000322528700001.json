Though wireless multicast has an excellent resource efficiency, its performance suffers deterioration from the channel condition and wireless resource availability. Cognitive Radio (CR) and Device to Device (D2D) are two solutions to provide potential resource. However, resource allocation for cognitive wireless multicast based on D2D is still a great challenge for LTE social networks. In this paper, a joint sub-carriers and power allocation model based on D2D for general cognitive radio multicast (CR-D2D-MC) is proposed for Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) LTE systems. By opportunistically accessing the licensed spectrum, the maximized capacity for multiple cognitive multicast groups is achieved with the condition of the general scenario of imperfect spectrum sensing, the constrains of interference to primary users (PUs) and an upper-bound power of secondary users (SUs) acting as multicast source nodes. Furthermore, the fairness for multicast groups or unicast terminals is guaranteed by setting a lower-bound number of the subcarriers allocated to cognitive multicast groups. Lagrange duality algorithm is adopted to obtain the optimal solution to the proposed CR-D2D-MC model. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of cognitive multicast groups and achieves a good balance between capacity and fairness.", "paper_title": "Joint Subcarriers and Power Allocation with Imperfect Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive D2D Wireless Multicast", "paper_id": "WOS:000322528700001"}
