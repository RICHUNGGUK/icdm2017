We first perform mathematical analysis on the potential improvement in the content availability and bandwidth utilization induced by two existing network coding schemes. It is found that these two coding schemes either incur a very high coding complexity and disk operation overhead or cannot effectively leverage the potential of improving the content availability. In this regard, we propose a simple sparse network coding scheme in which both the drawbacks mentioned before are precluded. To accommodate the proposed coding scheme into BitTorrent, a new block scheduling algorithm is also developed based on the original rarest-first block scheduling policy of BitTorrent. Through extensive simulations and performance evaluations, we show that the proposed coding scheme is very effective in terms of improving the content availability of BitTorrent swarms when compared with some existing methods.", "paper_title": "Two Blocks Are Enough: On the Feasibility of Using Network Coding to Ameliorate the Content Availability of BitTorrent Swarms", "paper_id": "WOS:000321153600020"}
