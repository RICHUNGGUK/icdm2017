A simplified real-world supply chain example is modeled with discrete event, mesoscopic and system dynamics simulation. The objective of the study is to compare the process of model creation and its validity using each approach. The study examines advantages of the mesoscopic approach for the simulation. Major benefits of the mesoscopic approach are that modeling efforts are balanced with the necessary level of detail and facilitate quick and simple model creation and simulation.
