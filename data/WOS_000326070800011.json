Indeed, motion at the bone-implant interface above 40m leads to partial bone ingrowth, while motion exceeding 150m completely inhibits bone ingrowth. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of two cementless femoral stem designs with different lengths on the primary stability. A finite element model of a composite Sawbones((R)) fourth generation, implanted with five lengths of the straight prosthesis design and four lengths of the curved prosthesis design, was loaded with hip joint and abductor forces representing two physiological activities: fast walking and stair climbing. We found that reducing the straight stem length from 146 to 54mm increased the average micromotion from 17 to 52m during fast walking, while the peak value increased from 42 to 104m. With the curved stem, reducing length from 105 to 54mm increased the average micromotion from 10 to 29m, while the peak value increased from 37 to 101m. Similar findings are obtained for stair climbing for both stems. Although the present study showed that femoral stem length as well as stem design directly influences its primary stability, for the two femoral stems tested, length could be reduced substantially without compromising the primary stability. With the aim of minimising surgical invasiveness, newer femoral stem design and currently well performing stems might be used with a reduced length without compromising primary stability and hence, long-term survivorship.", "paper_title": "The influence of uncemented femoral stem length and design on its primary stability: a finite element analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000326070800011"}
