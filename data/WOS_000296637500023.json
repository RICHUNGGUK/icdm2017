It is an implementation of the DSD programming language and compiler described by Lakin et al. (2011) with additional features such as support for polymers of unbounded length. It also supports stochastic and deterministic simulation, construction of continuous-time Markov chains and various export formats which allow models to be analysed using third-party tools.", "paper_title": "Visual DSD: a design and analysis tool for DNA strand displacement systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000296637500023"}
