This scheme, called Quick-and-Cool X-fill (QC-Fill), built upon the multicasting-based scan architecture, further leverages on the merits of previous low-capture-power X-fill methods through techniques like multicasting-driven X-fill and clique stripping. QC-Fill is independent of the automatic test pattern generation patterns and does not require any extra area overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that this scheme strikes a good balance between the seemingly conflicting criteria of low power and test compression.", "paper_title": "QC-Fill: Quick-and-Cool X-Filling for Multicasting-Based Scan Test", "paper_id": "WOS:000271019800012"}
