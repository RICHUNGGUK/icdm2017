We found 18 data aspects on which heavy consideration and coordination is important during a software process. We present these data aspects and point out that these data aspects are dealt with at different levels within Extended Enterprises. A good software process embraces the idea that choices have to be made on these 18 data aspects, and it recognizes the dependencies between the aspects, and the dependencies between decisions made at different levels in the enterprise.", "paper_title": "Dependencies between data decisions", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107800005"}
