We first extract the feature vertices around a hole of a CAD model and classify them into different feature sets. These feature sets are then automatically paired, using ordered double normals, Gaussian mapping and convex/concave analysis, to produce missing feature curves. Additionally, by minimizing a newly defined energy, the missing corners can be efficiently recovered as well. The hole is consequently divided into simple sub-holes according to the produced feature curves and recovered corners. Finally, each sub-hole is filled by a modified advancing front method individually. The experiments show that our approach is simple, efficient, and suitable for CAD systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
