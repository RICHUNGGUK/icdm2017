Coordinates of the emitter are computed using differential time-of-arrival and differential Doppler shift of received signals. Our main purpose is mathematical analysis of statistical problems that arise in estimating these parameters.", "paper_title": "On statistical problems in geolocation", "paper_id": "WOS:000325562200004"}
