There are no canonical methods for performing such compensations; hence, a number of different procedures serving this goal in different ways can be found in the literature. Unfortunately, the normalization has a significant impact on the final results. Different methods yield very different numbers of detected \"significant peaks\" even in the simplest scenario of ChIP-Seq experiments that compare the enrichment in a single sample relative to a matching control. This becomes an even more acute issue in the more general case of the comparison of multiple samples, where a number of arbitrary design choices will be required in the data analysis stage, each option resulting in possibly (significantly) different outcomes. In this article, we investigate a principled statistical procedure that eliminates the need for a normalization step. We outline its basic properties, in particular the scaling upon depth of sequencing. For the sake of illustration and comparison, we report the results of reanalyzing a ChIP-Seq experiment for transcription factor binding site detection. In order to quantify the differences between outcomes, we use a novel method based on the accuracy of in silico prediction by support vector machine (SVM) models trained on part of the genome and tested on the remainder.
