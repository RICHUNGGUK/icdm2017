Multi-sender authentication codes allow a group of senders to construct an authenticated message such that the receiver can verify the authenticity of the received message. In this paper, a new construction of multi-sender authentication code from singular pseudo-symplectic geometry over finite fields is put forward. Both the parameters and the probabilities of successful deceptions from a part of senders are computed by the method of matrices and combinatorial enumeration. Finally, we appropriately adjust the parameters of our scheme for achieving the optimum case.", "paper_title": "A novel construction of optimal multi-sender authentication code from singular pseudo-symplectic geometry over finite fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000345397600002"}
