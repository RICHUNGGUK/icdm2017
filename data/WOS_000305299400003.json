However, the difficulty of such an approach is to build the model and to manage the uncontrolled commutations that occur in the studied static converter, and also to deal with large equations. The purpose of this paper is to propose an aid in the frequency modelling of the drive elements, in the frequency domain, including all key parameters for sizing aim i.e. a way to optimize the EMC filter using different algorithms. Design/methodology/approach - The paper aims to propose an aid to create such models, and to assure its good solving, i.e. that the correct operating mode is represented. So, the solving problem is formulated as an optimization problem under constraints, to solve this difficulty. Findings - The difficulty is to be sure to deal with the good operating mode of the static converter when soft or uncontrolled commutations occur. So, the model is formulated as a constrained optimization problem. The paper proposes a symbolic approach, that allows to build automatically the frequency model. It is translated to be solved in Matlab. Research limitations/implications - The approach does not fit for static converters with a control implying numerous commutations per operating period. However, the approach deals with natural and soft commutations. Originality/value - The modelling is based on the use of linear components and ideal switches.", "paper_title": "Using constrained optimization algorithm for the modeling of static converter harmonics", "paper_id": "WOS:000305299400003"}
