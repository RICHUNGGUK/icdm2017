The method is such that in order to calibrate the system, the user is only required to place the projectors and capture a single image of the images projected from them onto a planar screen using a hand-held camera. The problem to be solved is divided into the image registration for stitching different projector images into a single seamless image and the image rectification for making the image have the correct rectangular shape. The proposed method is characterized by simultaneously solving both of them from only a single image, which makes the calibration procedures easy. The method assumes an uncalibrated camera and partially calibrated projectors in which only focal lengths are unknown among the internal parameters. In the paper, we first prove the uniqueness of solutions to the problem, which was unclear in the previous studies, and then present a stable numerical algorithm for actually finding the solution. We present several experimental results for synthetic data, in which we show the relation between the calibration accuracy and several factors, and also present experimental results for real data, in which we demonstrate that the proposed method can calibrate a real system with sufficient accuracy for a number of layouts of the projectors.", "paper_title": "Easy Calibration of a Multi-projector Display System", "paper_id": "WOS:000268008000001"}
