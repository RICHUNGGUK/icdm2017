According to the compromise principle, three types of capacity identification methods - the simple arithmetic average based compromise method, the least squares based compromise method and the linear programming based compromise method - are proposed. The input information required for the compromise principle based identification methods consists of the preference information with respect to the decision criteria and the partial evaluations of the alternatives provided by the decision maker. An illustrative example is given to show the processes of the proposed methods, and a comparison analysis with the maximum entropy principle based identification method is also presented.
