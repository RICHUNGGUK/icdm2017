We derive an asymptotic equivalent of the minimum rank distance of codes that reach the rank metric Gilbert-Varshamov bound. We show that the random codes reach GV-bound. Finally, we show that the optimal codes in rank metric have a packing density which is bounded by functions depending only on the base field and on the minimum distance. We show the potential interest in cryptographic applications.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic behaviour of codes in rank metric over finite fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000331643300007"}
