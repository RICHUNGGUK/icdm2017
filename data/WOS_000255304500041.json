In this paper we consider implicit-explicit (IMEX) multistep methods. Suitable methods will be constructed, based on explicit methods with general monotonicity and boundedness properties for hyperbolic equations. Numerical comparisons are made with several implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
