Besides, for systems with a highly variable load, as the induction heating systems, a real-time load estimation is mandatory. This paper presents the development of an FPGA-based test-bench aimed to extract the electrical equivalent of the induction heating loads. The proposed test-bench comprises a resonant power converter, sigma-delta ADCs, and an embedded system implemented in an FPGA. The characterization algorithm is based on the discrete-time Fourier series computed directly from the Sigma Delta ADC bit-streams, and the FPGA implementation has been partitioned into hardware and software platforms to optimize the performance and resources utilization. Analytical and simulation results are verified through experimental measurements with the proposed test-bench. As a result, the proposed platform can be used as a load identification tool either for stand-alone or PC-hosted operation.", "paper_title": "FPGA-Based Test-Bench for Resonant Inverter Load Characterization", "paper_id": "WOS:000323569900045"}
