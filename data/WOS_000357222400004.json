In our model, a dynamic path network consists of an undirected path with positive edge lengths and uniform edge capacity, and each vertex supply which is non-negative value is unknown but only the interval of supply is known. A particular assignment of supply to each vertex is called a scenario. Under any scenario, the cost of a sink location is defined as the minimum time to complete the evacuation for all supplies (evacuees), and the regret of a sink location x is defined as the cost of x minus the cost of the optimal sink location. Then, the problem is to find a point as a sink such that the maximum regret for all possible scenarios is minimized. We propose an O(n logn) time algorithm for the minimax regret 1-sink location problem in dynamic path networks with uniform capacity, where n is the number of vertices in the network.
