This paper gives insight how this is practically achieved, and where researchers are confronted with several challenges like privacy of data, access performance, efficient storage and cost benefit achievement.", "paper_title": "Challenges in Efficient Data Warehousing", "paper_id": "WOS:000366968000006"}
