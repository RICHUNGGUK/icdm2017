Focusing in the case (which is of special interest, e.g. for looking for cocyclic Hadamard matrices), this method provides a basis for 2-cocycles in such a way that representative -cocycles are calculated all at once, so that there is no need to distinguish between inflation and transgression 2-cocycles (as it has traditionally been the case until now). When , this method provides an uniform way of looking for higher dimensional n-cocyclic Hadamard matrices for the first time. We illustrate the method with some examples, for . In particular, we give some examples of improper 3-dimensional -cocyclic Hadamard matrices.", "paper_title": "On higher dimensional cocyclic Hadamard matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000351302200011"}
