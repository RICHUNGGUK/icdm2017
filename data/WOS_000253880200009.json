There exists a rich literature devoted to the efficient implementation of cryptographic S-boxes, wherein hardware designs for FPGAs and standard cells received particular attention. In this paper we present a comprehensive study of different standard-cell implementations of the AES S-box with respect to timing (i.e. critical path), silicon area, power consumption, and combinations of these cost metrics. We examine implementations which exploit the mathematical properties of the AES S-box, constructions based on hardware look-up tables, and dedicated low-power solutions. Our results show that the timing, area, and power properties of the different S-box realizations can vary by up to almost an order of magnitude. In terms of area and area-delay product, the best choice are implementations which calculate the S-box output. On the other hand, the hardware look-up solutions are characterized by the shortest critical path. The dedicated low-power implementations do not only reduce power consumption by a large degree, but they also show good timing properties and offer the best power-delay and power-area product, respectively.", "paper_title": "Area, delay, and power characteristics of standard-cell implementations of the AES S-Box", "paper_id": "WOS:000253880200009"}
