But these charts do not relieve the need for pinpointing source(s) of the out-of-control signals. Neural networks (NNs) have excellent noise tolerance and high pattern identification capability in real time, which have been applied successfully in MSPC. This study proposed a selective NN ensemble approach DPSOEN, where several selected NNs are jointly used to classify source(s) of out-of-control signals in multivariate processes. The immediate location of the abnormal source(s) can greatly narrow down the set of possible assignable causes, facilitating rapid analysis and corrective action by quality operators. The performance of DPSOEN is analyzed in multivariate processes. It shows improved generalization performance that outperforms those of single NNs and Ensemble All approach. The investigation proposed a heuristic approach for applying the DPSOEN-based model as an effective and useful tool to identify abnormal source(s) in bivariate statistical process control (SPC) with potential application for MSPC in general.
