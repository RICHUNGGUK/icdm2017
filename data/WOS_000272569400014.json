Our solution is based on using shape grammars to set up the different aspects of a visualization, including the geometric content of the visualization, methods for resolving layout conflicts and interaction methods. Our approach significantly increases modelling efficiency over similarly flexible systems currently in use.", "paper_title": "A Shape Grammar for Developing Glyph-based Visualizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000272569400014"}
