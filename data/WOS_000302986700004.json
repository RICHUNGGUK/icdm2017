There is no guarantee that the job which has started to execute in a resource will complete its execution without any disruption from user activity (such as a keyboard stroke or mouse move) if the desktop machines are used for other purposes. This problem becomes more challenging in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model for a desktop grid where there is no central server that decides to allocate a job to a particular resource. This paper describes a P2P desktop grid framework that utilizes resource availability prediction, using group availability data. We improve the functionality of the system by submitting the jobs on machines that have a higher probability of being available at a given time. We benchmark our framework and provide an analysis of our results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
