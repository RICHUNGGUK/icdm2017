From the angle of rough set theory, when inducing decision trees, entropy based methods emphasize the effect of class distribution. Whereas the rough set based approaches emphasize the effect of certainty. The presented approach takes the advantages of both criteria for inducing decision trees. Comparisons between the presented approach and the fundamental information entropy based method on some data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository are also reported.", "paper_title": "ComEnVprs: A novel approach for inducing decision tree classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200013"}
