The metric of partial secrecy is introduced as the amount of distortion that can be guaranteed at the eavesdropper, and three different channel models are proposed to capture various transmission strategies to achieve partial secrecy. It is shown that a range of secrecy-energy operating points can be achieved with an appropriate allocation of power resources between private and nonprivate data substreams.", "paper_title": "On Energy-Secrecy Trade-Offs for Gaussian Wiretap Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000318596100005"}
