We propose an NLP approach that undertakes pre-processing, tokenisation and POS tagging of texts to then obtain the syntactic structure of sentences by means of a dependency parser. This structure is then used to address three of the most significant linguistic constructions for the purpose in question: intensification, subordinate adversative clauses and negation. We also propose a semi-automatic domain adaptation method to improve the accuracy of our system in specific application domains, by enriching semantic dictionaries using machine learning methods in order to adapt the semantic orientation of their words to a particular field. Experimental results are promising in both general and specific domains.", "paper_title": "A syntactic approach for opinion mining on Spanish reviews", "paper_id": "WOS:000346641500006"}
