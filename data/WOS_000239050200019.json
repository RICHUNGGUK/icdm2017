III this paper, we focus on recognizing facial action units (AUs), which represent the subtle change of facial expressions. We adopt ICA (independent component analysis) as the feature extraction and representation method and SVM (support vector machine) as the pattern classifier. By comparing with three existing systems, such as Tian, Donato, and Bazzo, our proposed system can achieve the highest recognition rates. Furthermore, the proposed system is fast since it takes only 1.8 ms for classifying a test image.
