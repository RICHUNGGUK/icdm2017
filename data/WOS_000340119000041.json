Its diagnosis can be achieved by analyzing the interference patterns of the tear film lipid layer and by classifying them into one of the Guillon categories. The manual process done by experts is not only affected by subjective factors but is also very time consuming. In this paper we propose a general methodology to the automatic classification of tear film lipid layer, using color and texture information to characterize the image and feature selection methods to reduce the processing time. The adequacy of the proposed methodology was demonstrated since it achieves classification rates over 97% while maintaining robustness and provides unbiased results. Also, it can be applied in real time, and so allows important time savings for the experts.", "paper_title": "A Methodology for Improving Tear Film Lipid Layer Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000340119000041"}
