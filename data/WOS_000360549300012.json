It is difficult to incorporate inter-flow network coding into opportunistic routing (OR) because the next hop of a packet in OR can't be determined in advance. Coding-aware opportunistic routing (CAR) is proposed in this paper to address this problem on fixed wireless mesh networks (WMNs). Meanwhile, it aims to maximize the number of native packets coded in each single transmission. It dynamically selects a route for a given flow according to the real-time coding opportunities. There are no control packets in CAR, which greatly reduces the overhead costs. CAR gives the coded packet that consists of a larger number of native packets with a smaller forwarding delay. The forwarder with the largest number of native packets coded together is ultimately selected to send data. Simulations demonstrate that CAR achieves significantly better throughput gains and derives a reasonable end-to-end delay in both cross topology and mesh topology under both transmission control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP) traffic, as explained below. CAR achieves more than 35 % throughput improvement under TCP traffic and more than 15 % throughput improvement under UDP traffic, compared to other state-of-art protocols in cross topology, respectively. CAR also provides a several-fold increase in throughput in a large scale network (mesh topology). In a word, CAR significantly improves network performance of a WMN.", "paper_title": "CAR: Coding-Aware Opportunistic Routing for Unicast Traffic in Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000360549300012"}
