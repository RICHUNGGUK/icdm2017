Each individual is represented by Penna model with an immune system. In order to study how the infection and immunity influence the survival process, we modify the Verhulst factor. Then, we present the results of our simulations, and discuss the evolution of population and the effect of immunity respectively. In addition, we study the effect of the memory of the immune system and the effect of vaccination under different conditions.", "paper_title": "A study of immunity based on Penna aging model", "paper_id": "WOS:000237900900003"}
