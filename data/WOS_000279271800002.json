A semi-local implementation of Delta-TSR is also proposed, making the description robust to viewpoint changes. We evaluate Delta-TSR for image retrieval under the query-by-example paradigm, on contents represented with interest points in a bag-of-features model: it improves state-of-the-art techniques, in terms of retrieval quality as well as of execution time, and is scalable. Finally, its effectiveness is evaluated on a topical scenario dedicated to scene retrieval in datasets of city landmarks. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
