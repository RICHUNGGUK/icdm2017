It is found that the jamming phenomenon occurs when the total entrance density is small in spite of influence of information. The mean velocity < v >(ped) of the walkers moving remains a constant via a small fluctuation for the small total entrance density, but for the large total entrance density, the < v >(ped) increases from 0 to 1. The mean velocity < v >(inf) of information spreading increases from 0 to 1, and then decreases to 0. The critical density decreases with increasing the size W of the system. When the size of the system is small, the platform appears because of asymmetry in propagation of information.", "paper_title": "INFLUENCE OF INFORMATION ON CROWD DISPERSION PROCESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000268592300002"}
