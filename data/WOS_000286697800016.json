Three different types of activation functions are considered, including general bounded and two types of sigmoid activation functions. By constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions, some easily verifiable criteria for the ultimate boundedness and global exponential attractivity of NRNNs are obtained. These results can be applied to monostable and multistable neural networks as well as chaos control and chaos synchronization. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
