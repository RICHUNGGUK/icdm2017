Utilizing optimization techniques, three distinct configurations are formulated that differ in sequence of coupling and uncertainty quantification campaigns. Focusing on a controlled structural dynamics problem, the systematic biases from the constituents are quantified, from which the critical components of the model that require further improvement can be identified to aid in the prioritization of future code development efforts.", "paper_title": "Partitioned Analysis of Coupled Numerical Models Considering Imprecise Parameters and Inexact Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000333446100015"}
