For higher performance, they can be compiled into machine code before runtime using an ahead-of-time compiler (AOTC). There are many approaches to AOTC, yet a bytecode-to-C (b-to-C) AOTC which translates the bytecode into the C code and then compiles it using an existing optimizing compiler such as gcc would be the most straightforward one. This paper explores a few important design and optimization issues of a b-to-C AOTC, including the compilation form for the translated C code, the call interfaces among translated and interpreted Java methods, and Java-specific optimizations by the AOTC that can complement the gcc optimizations. We evaluate these issues with our b-to-C AOTC implemented on the MIPS platform for the Sun's CDC VM to understand their performance impact.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of a Java Ahead-of-Time Compiler for Embedded Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000300042300009"}
