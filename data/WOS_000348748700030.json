The core elements of our approach are a dynamic deformation model, an efficient data-driven finite difference solution, and a curve-based representation of 3D models. We first reconstruct skin deformation models at different poses from the taken photos of a male human arm movement to achieve real deformed skin shapes. Then, we extract curves from these reconstructed skin deformation models. A new dynamic deformation model is proposed to describe physics of dynamic curve deformations, and its finite difference solution is developed to determine shape changes of the extracted curves. In order to improve visual realism of skin deformations, we employ data-driven methods and introduce skin shapes at the initial and final poses into our proposed dynamic deformation model. Experimental examples and comparisons made in this paper indicate that our proposed dynamic skin deformation technique can create realistic deformed skin shapes efficiently with a small data size.
