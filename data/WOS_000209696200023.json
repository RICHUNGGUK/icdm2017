We obtain MMSE channel prediction for the future time slots and maximize perceived lifetime at each time slot to determine the power allocation. The P-PLT algorithm implements m-step channel prediction for power allocation, where m depends on the trade-off between performance and complexity. Compared to the existing non-prediction based energy-aware power allocation algorithm, which is solely based on the current channel state information, the proposed algorithm can provide substantial performance improvement as shown in the numerical results.", "paper_title": "Prediction-Based Energy-Aware Relay Cooperation for Lifetime Maximization", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696200023"}
