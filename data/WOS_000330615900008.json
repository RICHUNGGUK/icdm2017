The underlying theories are usually developed in different scientific communities and both formalisms have distinct strong points: for instance, conciseness for TPNs and a more flexible notion of urgency for NTA. The objective of the paper is to introduce a new model allowing the joint use of both TPNs and NTA for the modeling of timed systems. We call it Clock Transition System (CTS). This new model incorporates the advantages of the structure of Petri nets, while introducing explicitly the concept of clocks. Transitions in the network can be guarded by an expression on the clocks and reset a subset of them as in timed automata. The urgency is introduced by a separate description of invariants. We show that CTS allow to express TPNs (even when unbounded) and NTA. For those two classical models, we identify subclasses of CTSs equivalent by isomorphism of their operational semantics and provide (syntactic) translations. The classical state-space computation developed for NTA and then adapted to TPNs can easily be defined for general CTSs. Armed with these merits, the CTS model seems a good candidate to serve as an intermediate theoretical and practical model to factor out the upcoming developments in the TPNs and the NTA scientific communities.", "paper_title": "Blending Timed Formal Models with Clock Transition Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000330615900008"}
