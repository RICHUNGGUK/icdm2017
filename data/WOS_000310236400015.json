Suitable MPSoCs contain a potentially heterogeneous multi-core computing cluster and can be further equipped with application specific accelerators. The physical layer of a MIMO OFDM transceiver, for which the IEEE 802.11n standard serves as reference, is investigated in this work. To maintain portability, the platform independent algorithmic kernels (Nuclei) are identified first. In the following case study, efficient implementations (Flavors) of these Nuclei are implemented on an MPSoC platform. Resultant algorithmic performance (e. g., frame-error-rate) as well as the system performance (e. g., latency and throughput) are discussed.", "paper_title": "Systematic MIMO OFDM transceiver implementation for MPSoCs: a nucleus based approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000310236400015"}
