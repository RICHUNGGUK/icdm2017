Those resins are a commercial mixed bed, constituted of 75 wt.% of a cationic resin and 25 wt.% of an anionic resin, and both are pure cationic and anionic resins. Then, irradiated samples were leached, at two different temperatures (20 degrees C and 50 degrees C). Solid matrices were characterized by a spectroscopic technique and spectral data were analysed by the ANOVA Common Dimensions (AComDim) method to detect and highlight influential factors and interactions. Four factors were studied (absorbed dose under irradiation, atmosphere during irradiation, dose rate, leaching temperature and resin type) with several levels for each. In a first study of the separate resins, the absorbed dose and the irradiation atmosphere appeared as the most influencing factors for the anionic resin. The leaching temperature was significant but only in interaction with other factors, while this parameter was significant for the cationic and mixed bed resins. In a global study of all the spectral data, the resin type appeared as the most influential factor for the radiolysis of resins. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
