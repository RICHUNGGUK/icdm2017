The analysis of MD trajectories comprises the biophysical characterization of membrane properties or the study of protein-lipid interactions and dynamics. However, there is a lack of automated tools to analyse MD simulations of complex membrane or membrane-protein systems. Here we present MEMBPLUGIN, a plugin for the Visual Molecular Dynamics package that provides algorithms to measure a host of essential biophysical properties in simulated membranes. MEMBPLUGIN features are accessible both through a user-friendly graphical interface and as command-line procedures to be invoked in analysis scripts.", "paper_title": "MEMBPLUGIN: studying membrane complexity in VMD", "paper_id": "WOS:000336530000023"}
