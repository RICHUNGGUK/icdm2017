However, in multi-tap channels, the residual inter-symbol and inter-antenna interference still exist after FDE and degrade the performance. Conventional interference cancellation schemes can minimize this interference by using frequency domain interference cancellation. However, those schemes have high complexity and large feedback latency, especially when adopting a large number of iterations. These result in low throughput and require a large amount of resource in software defined radio implementation. In this paper, we propose a novel low complexity interference cancellation scheme to minimize the residual interference in LTE/LTE-A uplink. Our proposed scheme can bring about 2 dB gains in different channels, but only adds up to 7.2% complexity to the receiver. The scheme is further implemented on Xilinx FPGA. Compared to other conventional interference cancellation schemes, our scheme has less complexity, less data to store, and shorter feedback latency.", "paper_title": "LTE uplink MIMO receiver with low complexity interference cancellation", "paper_id": "WOS:000310236400002"}
