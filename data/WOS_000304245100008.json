In this paper, we take a deterministic view and revisit the problem of wiretap channel with side information. A precise characterization of the secrecy capacity is obtained for a linear deterministic model, which naturally suggests a coding scheme which we show to achieve the secrecy capacity of the degraded Gaussian model (dubbed as \"secret writing on dirty paper\") to within half a bit.", "paper_title": "Secret Writing on Dirty Paper: A Deterministic View", "paper_id": "WOS:000304245100008"}
