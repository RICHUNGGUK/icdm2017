A protocol is self-stabilizing if, starting from an arbitrary configuration, be it initial state or after a corrupted state, the protocol can start behaving normally within a finite time. We propose the first deterministic self-stabilizing distributed k-out-of-l exclusion protocol in message-passing systems for asynchronous oriented tree networks which assumes bounded local memory for each process.", "paper_title": "SELF-STABILIZING k-out-of-l EXCLUSION IN TREE NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289639700009"}
