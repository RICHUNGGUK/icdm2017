The proposed controller increases the number of steps on-line for the deadbeat tracking performance, satisfying given admissible state constraints. LMI conditions are given to minimize the unavoidable step delay. The proposed schemes can be easily developed by using LMI approach, and are validated by numerical simulation.", "paper_title": "Deadbeat Control for Linear Systems with State Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701700040"}
