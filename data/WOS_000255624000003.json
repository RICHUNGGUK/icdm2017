In this paper, we show that PLSI and NMF (with the I-divergence objective function) optimize the same objective function, although PLSI and NMF are different algorithms as verified by experiments. This provides a theoretical basis for a new hybrid method that runs PLSI and NMF alternatively, each jumping out of the local minima of the other method successively, thus achieving a better final solution. Extensive experiments on five real-life datasets show relations between NMF and PLSI, and indicate that the hybrid method leads to significant improvements over NMF-only or PLSI-only methods. We also show that at first-order approximation, NMF is identical to the X(2)-statistic.
