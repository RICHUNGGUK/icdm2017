Design/methodology/approach - A classic finite element method is coupled with probabilistic methods. These probabilistic methods are based on the expansion of the random parameters in two different ways: a spectral expansion and a nodal expansion. Findings - The computation of the mean and the variance on a simple scattering problem shows that only a few hundreds calculations are required when applying these methods while the Monte Carlo method uses several thousands of samples in order to obtain a comparable accuracy. Originality/value - The number of calculations is reduced using several techniques: a regression technique, sparse grids computed from Smolyak algorithm or a suited coordinate system.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic methods applied to 2D electromagnetic numerical dosimetry", "paper_id": "WOS:000256573500006"}
