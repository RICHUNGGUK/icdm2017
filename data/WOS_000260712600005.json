This paper aims to analyze double pressing systems using discontinuous pre-compaction, both technically and economically. Two operative conditions are considered: the traditional forming of tiles during pressing is compared with the innovative production of a unique large-sized slab, subsequently customized according to market requirements. Furthermore, manufacturing conditions are explored with infrequent or frequent production runs, due to increasingly smaller production batches, in order to evaluate which production process is more suitable when changing operative conditions are managed. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is carried out experimentally, by collecting data in existing pilot plants, producing batches of products of different size and colour. Details are provided concerning the technical characteristics of the systems, along with costs per manufactured square metre for investments, personnel, maintenance, spare parts and electric power. A case in which some production days are reserved for each manufactured batch is compared to a case in which production runs are repeated more frequently in a day. Findings - Manufacturing large-sized slabs and customization has shown to be an efficient solution for companies operating in changing markets. Research limitations/implications - Further research should study double pressing systems using continuous pre-compaction. Originality/value - The proposed analysis, by presenting an evaluation process and sharing data collected experimentally, provides innovative support for addressing decision makers when new pressing systems for porcelain stoneware tiles are selected.", "paper_title": "Double pressing for porcelain stoneware tiles: an exploratory analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000260712600005"}
