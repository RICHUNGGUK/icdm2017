In this approach, the kinetic equation is approximated with a global velocity grid. The grid must be large and fine enough to capture all the distribution functions, which is very expensive for high speed flows (like in hypersonic aerodynamics). In this article, we propose to use instead different velocity grids that are local in time and space: these grids dynamically adapt to the width of the distribution functions. The advantages and drawbacks of the method are illustrated in several 1D test cases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
