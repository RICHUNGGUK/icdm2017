The need for local time-stepping arises when adaptive mesh refinement results in a mesh containing cells of greatly different sizes. The global CFL number and, hence, the global time step, are defined by the smallest cell size. This can be inefficient as a few small cells may impose a restrictive time step on the whole mesh. A local time-stepping scheme allows us to use the local CFL number which reduces the total number of function evaluations. The algorithm is based on a second order Runge-Kutta time integration. Its important features are a small stencil and the second order accuracy in the L(2) and L(infinity) norms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
