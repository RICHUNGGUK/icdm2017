In addition, securities historical data, experts' opinions and judgements and investors' different attitudes are considered in the portfolio selection process, such that the investor's individual preference is reflected by an optimistic-pessimistic parameter lambda. To avoid the difficulty of evaluating a large set of efficient solutions and to ensure the selection of the best solution, a compromise approach-based genetic algorithm has been designed to solve the proposed model. In addition, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
