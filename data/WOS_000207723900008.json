In all of these applications many thousands of phase screens need to be generated. The computation time required for a large iterations of algorithms that model this effect is important an issue and for this reason there have been many previous attempts to improve the computation speed such algorithms. In this paper, the computation performance of the best previous algorithm that models this phenomenon is substantially improved using high performance reconfigurable computing through acceleration of the key computationally intensive steps of the algorithm on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). Our best hardware implementation can provide a speedup of more than 60 times the original algorithm.", "paper_title": "Multiple parallel FPGA implementations of a Kolmogorov phase screen generator", "paper_id": "WOS:000207723900008"}
