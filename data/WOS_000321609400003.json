Its scaled, online gradient descent unsupervised learning algorithm is an amalgam of the SOM unsupervised training and the HMM reparameterized forward-backward techniques. In essence, with each neuron of the SOHMMM lattice, an HMM is associated. The image of an input sequence on the SOHMMM mesh is defined as the location of the best matching reference HMM. Model tuning and adaptation can take place directly from raw data, within an automated context. The SOHMMM can accommodate and analyze deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, protein chain molecules, and generic sequences of high dimensionality and variable lengths encoded directly in nonnumerical/symbolic alphabets. Furthermore, the SOHMMM is capable of integrating and exploiting latent information hidden in the spatiotemporal dependencies/correlations of sequences' elements.", "paper_title": "SCALED SELF-ORGANIZING MAP - HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL ARCHITECTURE FOR BIOLOGICAL SEQUENCE CLUSTERING", "paper_id": "WOS:000321609400003"}
