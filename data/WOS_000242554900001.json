Making all phases of the design flow aware of this physical phenomenon helps in reaching faster design closure. In this paper, we present an integrated approach to thermal management in architectural synthesis. Our synthesis flow combines temperature-aware scheduling and binding based on feedback from thermal simulation. We show that our flow is effective in preventing hotspot formation and creating an even thermal profile of the resources. Our integrated thermal management technique on average reduces the peak temperature of the, resources by 7.34 degrees C when compared to a thermal unaware flow without increasing the number of resources across our set of benchmarks.", "paper_title": "An integrated approach to thermal management in high-level synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000242554900001"}
