Fundamental problems from engineering, chemistry, medicine, etc. can be formulated as a system of equations. Finding a solution for such a system requires sometimes high computational efforts. There are situations when these systems having multiple solutions. For such problems, the task is to find as many solutions as possible. This task can be complicated by adding several inequalities and/or variable bound constraints. In this paper, we deal with such systems of equations, which have multiple solutions and we try to solve them using two different approaches. Both approaches transform the problem into an optimization problem. One approach uses a line search based technique and the other one an evolutionary algorithm technique. Several experiments are performed in order to emphasize the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods.", "paper_title": "Multiple solutions for a system of nonlinear equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000259152300004"}
