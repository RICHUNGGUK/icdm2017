We show that in real-time applications, an accurate estimation of the decoding delay is essential to achieve a minimum communication latency. As opposed to single-view codecs, the complexity of the multiview prediction structure and the parallel decoding of several views requires a systematic analysis of this decoding delay, which we solve using graph theory and a model of the decoder hardware architecture. Our framework assumes a decoder implementation in general purpose multi-core processors with multi-threading capabilities. For this hardware model, we show that frame processing times depend on the computational load of the decoder and we provide an iterative algorithm to compute jointly frame processing times and decoding delay. Finally, we show that decoding delay analysis can be applied to design decoders with the objective of minimizing the communication latency of the MVC system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
