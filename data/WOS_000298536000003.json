This is particularly true in some agronomical fields, where parameter and variable uncertainties are often quantified by a handful of measurements or by expert opinions. In this paper, we propose a simple alternative approach based on interval analysis, which avoids the pitfalls of a classical probabilistic approach. We propose simple methods to achieve uncertainty propagation, parameter optimisation and sensitivity analysis in cases where the model satisfies some monotonic properties. As a realworld case study, we interest ourselves to the application developed in our laboratory that has motivated the present work, that is the design of sustainable food packaging preserving fresh fruits and vegetables as long as possible.
