Conventional frame-based methods are not well suited to the problem, as each time frame contains a mixture of information from multiple sources. Missing feature masks are able to improve the recognition in such cases, but are limited by the accuracy of the mask, which is a non-trivial problem. In this paper, we propose an approach based on Local Spectrogram Features (LSFs) which represent local spectral information that is extracted from the two-dimensional region surrounding \"keypoints\" detected in the spectrogram. The keypoints are designed to locate the sparse, discriminative peaks in the spectrogram, such that we can model sound events through a set of representative LSF clusters and their occurrences in the spectrogram. To recognise overlapping sound events, we use a Generalised Hough Transform (GHT) voting system, which sums the information over many independent keypoints to produce onset hypotheses, that can detect any arbitrary combination of sound events in the spectrogram. Each hypothesis is then scored against the class distribution models to recognise the existence of the sound in the spectrogram. Experiments on a set of five overlapping sound events, in the presence of non-stationary background noise, demonstrate the potential of our approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
