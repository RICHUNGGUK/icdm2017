The paper also aims to further explore the mechanism through which fairness influences customer satisfaction online, i.e. identifying the mediators. Design/methodology/approach - A survey is used to validate a research model based on equity theory and relationship marketing theory that incorporates fairness, trust, perceived value and customer satisfaction. A total of 331 surveys were analyzed using Partial Least Square. Findings - In internet banking, fairness that includes distributive fairness, procedural fairness and informational fairness is positively related to customer satisfaction. Trust is identified as the key mediator of fairness to customer satisfaction. Research limitations/implications - In an online context, where human interactions are replaced by graphic user interfaces, fairness still plays an important role in customer satisfaction. Further comparison of online and offline context could be conducted. Practical implications - For online service managers, it is crucial to incorporate the fairness perspective into operations, which involves topics like segmented marketing efforts, consistency in procedures, and providing ample information to customers. Originality/value - This research is one of the first attempts to examine fairness in internet banking, as well as to delineate the mediating process of fairness to satisfaction online.", "paper_title": "Service fairness and customer satisfaction in internet banking Exploring the mediating effects of trust and customer value", "paper_id": "WOS:000309949000005"}
