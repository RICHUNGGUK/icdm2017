Therefore, selective inhibition or antagonism of cytokines is a target of anti-inflammatory drug design. The QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships) analysis presented here attempts to identify the structural features and physicochemical properties that are significant for cytokine antagonists or inhibitors and in particular of i) interleukin-5 (IL-5), ii) interleukin-6 (IL-6) and iii) of the chemotactic cytokine (chemokine) interleukin-8 (IL-8). Firstly, a historical aspect of the limited published QSARs is discussed and then a 2D-QSAR analysis was carried out for 26 data sets of compounds using the C-QSAR program of Biobyte. In six cases hydrophobicity appeared to be important. Steric factors in the form of overall molar refractivity (CMR), molar refractivity of the substituent (MR), molar volume (MgVol), Taft's E-s constant and the sterimol parameters B-1 and B-5 have a significant impact on biological activity in most of the derived equations whereas electronic parameters as sigma(p), sigma(m) or sigma(sigma) appeared in five cases.", "paper_title": "Cytokines in terms of QSAR.
