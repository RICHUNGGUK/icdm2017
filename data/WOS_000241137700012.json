The faster a motion the more important it is to exploit the system's natural stability properties for control. The stability of a periodic motion can be measured in terms of the spectral radius of the monodromy matrix. We optimize this stability criterion for a given robot topology, using special purpose optimization methods and leaving the model parameters, actuator inputs, trajectory start values and cycle time free to be determined by the optimization. This approach allows us to create simulations of robots that can move stably without any feedback. In order to analyze the robustness of a resulting periodic motion, we propose two methods, the first of which relies on forward simulations using perturbed start data and parameters while the second is based on the pseudospectra of the matrix. As a new example for a fast open-loop stable motion that has been produced by stability optimization, we present a biped gymnastics robot performing repetitive flip-flops (i.e. back handsprings). A similar model has previously been shown capable of performing open-loop stable running motions and repetitive somersaults.", "paper_title": "Performing open-loop stable flip-flops - An example for stability optimization and robustness analysis of fast periodic motions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137700012"}
