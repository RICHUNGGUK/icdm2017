The concepts of power and energy are used in the global model construction, with the definition of global parameters and variables. This new global model presents an advantage over the classical detailed one, which is the reduction of the number of dynamic equations. The time-dependent global parameters disadvantage, which appears in the model construction process, is overcome with the consideration of average values for global variables and global parameters, allowing the representation of the machine non-detailed behavior. An average values global model is obtained. An 8/6 SRM with four phases, eight stator poles and six rotor poles is characterized and used for illustration of the system behavior, regarding its variables evolution. In the SRM command it is assumed that the m.m.f. is imposed, which means that the system current is controlled. (c) 2006 IMACS.
