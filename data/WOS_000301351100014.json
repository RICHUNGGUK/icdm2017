The subjectivity and vagueness in the prediction procedures are dealt with linguistic variables quantified in an interval [-t, t]. Then predicted success/failure values are obtained to enable organizations to decide whether to initiate ERP, inhibit adoption or take remedial actions to increase the success possibility of ERP. Pairwise comparisons are used to determine the priority weights of influential factors, and the possible occurrence ratings of success or failure outcome amongst decision makers. There are not any inconsistency occurred in this procedures because this proposed approach allows every decision expert to choose an explicit criterion or alternative for the without restriction. When there are n criteria in a decision matrix, only n - 1 times of pairwise comparisons are taken. This approach not only improves the efficiency of pairwise comparison compared with the traditional AHP, but also avoids the checking the consistency of linguistic preference relation when the decision makers undertake the pairwise comparison processes.
