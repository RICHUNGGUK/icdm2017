Some characterizations for these notions are given. The results exhibit many different features from the base (subbase) in L-topologies. Some non-trivial examples including a base for the topologically generated (stratified, strong) L-topologies and a base for the Alexandrov L-topologies derived from L-fuzzy rough sets, are constructed. At last, an application in open and continuous functions is offered.", "paper_title": "On enriched L-topologies: Base and subbase", "paper_id": "WOS:000358755600002"}
