In this paper, an integrated feature description for scene categorization is constructed. First, we extract a type of extended contextual features for scene images that contain the local gradient information and more comprehensive local structural information. Mapping the local features by using improved LLC (Local-constrained Linear Coding) scheme to form the original image representation; Secondly, a set of global features named 'gist' are extracted that provide a statistical summary of the spatial layout properties of the scene; Then, the contextual features and 'gist' features are weighted combined based on their contribution for the integrated feature description, and each image is represented by using LLC scheme. Finally, we perform the scene categorization by libSVM with the HIK (Histogram Intersection Kernel) function. The proposed method achieves a satisfactory average accuracy rate 87.60% on a set of 15-scene categories. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
