We present a number of local improvement heuristics based on the work of previous researchers, a rolling horizon heuristic, and an incomplete dynamic programming heuristic. Extensive computational experiments on randomly generated test problems compare the performance of these heuristics. The rolling horizon procedures perform particularly well but require their parameters to be set based on problem characteristics to obtain their best performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
