These problems are strongly NP-hard and it is even conjectured that no list scheduling algorithm can be defined without explicitly considering jointly scheduling and resource allocation. We propose dominance conditions based on the analysis of the problem structure and an extension to setup times of the energetic reasoning constraint propagation algorithm. An exact branch-and-bound procedure and a climbing discrepancy search (CDS) heuristic based on these components are defined. We show how the proposed dominance rules can still be valid in the CDS scheme. The proposed methods are evaluated on a set of randomly generated instances and compared with previous results from the literature and those obtained with an efficient commercial solver. We conclude that our propositions are quite competitive and our results even outperform other approaches in most cases. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
