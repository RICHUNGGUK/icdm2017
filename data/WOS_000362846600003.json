Results: We developed two quantitative methods for the identification and statistical characterization in sequence regions of three-base periodicity ( hits) associated with open reading frame structures. The methods were implemented in the N-Profile Analysis Computational Tool ( NPACT), which highlights in graphical representations inconsistencies between newly identified ORFs and pre-existing annotations of coding-regions. We applied the NPACT procedures to two recently annotated strains of the deltaproteobacterium Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans, identifying in both genomes numerous conserved ORFs not included in the published annotation of coding regions.", "paper_title": "Quantitative frame analysis and the annotation of GC-rich (and other) prokaryotic genomes.
