In order to reduce this gap, 12 pelvic bones were removed from male and female embalmed cadavers and compressed. Anatomic angles were measured and bone's density was calculated after each test. Fractures observed during those tests were coherent with those observed in real life. Bone's density and percentage of mineralisation were not significantly different between the male and female groups. The retropubic angle was significantly larger in the female group (p0.05). Mean load necessary to obtain the collapse was significantly higher in the male group (p0.05).", "paper_title": "Biomechanical response of impacted bony pelvis: influence of the morphometry and bone density", "paper_id": "WOS:000281851500013"}
