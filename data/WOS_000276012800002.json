These techniques are traditionally built from systems modeling approaches including simulation, blind decovolution, and state estimation. In this work, we define target time series (TTS) and its related time series (RTS) as the output and input of a time series estimation process, respectively. We then propose a novel data mining framework for time series estimation when TTS and RTS represent different sets of observed variables from the same dynamic system. This is made possible by mining a database of instances of TTS, its simultaneously recorded RTS, and the input/output dynamic models between them. The key mining strategy is to formulate a mapping function for each TTS-RTS pair in the database that translates a feature vector extracted from RTS to the dissimilarity between true ITS and its estimate from the dynamic model associated with the same TTS-RTS pair. At run time, a feature vector is extracted from an inquiry RTS and supplied to the mapping function associated with each TTS-RTS pair to calculate a dissimilarity measure. An optimal TTS-RTS pair is then selected by analyzing these dissimilarity measures. The associated input/output model of the selected TTS-RTS pair is then used to simulate the TTS given the inquiry RTS as an input. An exemplary implementation was built to address a biomedical problem of noninvasive intracranial pressure assessment. The performance of the proposed method was superior to that of a simple training-free approach of finding the optimal TTS-RTS pair by a conventional similarity-based search on RTS features.
