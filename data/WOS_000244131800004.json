The FAMA is a memetic algorithm with a dynamic parameter setting and two local searchers adaptively launched, either one by one or simultaneously, according to the necessities of the evolution. The FAMA has been tested for both offline and online optimization. The former is based on a simulation of the whole system-control system and plant-using a model obtained through identification tests. The online optimization is model free because each fitness evaluation consists of an experimental test on the real motor drive. The proposed algorithm has been compared with other optimization approaches, and a matching analysis has been carried out offline and online. Excellent results are obtained in terms of optimality, convergence, and algorithmic efficiency. Moreover, the FAMA has given very robust results in the presence of noise in the experimental system.", "paper_title": "A fast adaptive memetic algorithm for online and offline control design of PMSM drives", "paper_id": "WOS:000244131800004"}
