However, other types of variance estimators are needed when using monotonic regression (MR) models, which are particularly suitable for estimating response functions with pronounced thresholds. Here, we propose a simple bootstrap estimator to compensate for the over-fitting that occurs when MR models are estimated from empirical data. Furthermore, we show that, in the case of one or two predictors, the performance of this estimator can be enhanced by introducing adjustment factors that take into account the slope of the response function and characteristics of the distribution of the explanatory variables. Extensive simulations show that our estimators perform satisfactorily for a great variety of monotonic functions and error distributions.", "paper_title": "Bootstrap estimation of the variance of the error term in monotonic regression models", "paper_id": "WOS:000317276900003"}
