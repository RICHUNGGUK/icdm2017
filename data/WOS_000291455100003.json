The five-factor theoretical model of satisfaction proposed by Porteous et al. (1995) was selected as a starting point for further empirical validation. An iterative psychometric process was used where responses to three versions of the CPQ were gathered from three independent user samples. Factor analysis and item analysis were used to produce the final thirty-item instrument. The original five-factor model was reduced to three factors, namely, Efficiency, Helpfulness, and Transparency. Cronbach's alpha for the Global scale and the three subscales are all above 0.90. In addition, preliminary validation studies indicate that the questionnaire can distinguish between products that differ in terms of usability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
