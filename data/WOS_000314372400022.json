Hence a realistic computation of indoor room airflows that are produced from plane wall and free jets requires an accurate prediction of the anisotropic turbulent stresses. This is particularly the case in regions near the wall and entrainment effects which are caused by the turbulent shear stresses. For this reason a non-linear eddy viscosity assumption is presented which can be adjusted to account for the turbulent mixing process in the free shear flow region, and to reproduce the redistribution of the turbulent normal stresses near the wall. Based on several test cases such as a free and plane wall jet, IEA (International Energy Agency) Annex 20 room airflow, and a 3D room with a partition, the essential characteristics of the linear and non-linear k-epsilon, k-omega and v(2)-f turbulence models are analysed. Thereby it is shown that the proposed non-linear assumption can improve the prediction of linear diffuser airflows. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
