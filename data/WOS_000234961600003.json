Through coordinate transformation. we call obtain the geometric relationship in the absolute coordinate system via a set of parametric equations. As a result. the least order's Jacobian matrix will be gained and the singularity of the manipulator can be expressed as the determinate of the Jacobian matrix is zero, The distinctive merit of this methodology is that the order of Jacobian matrix is the least compared with others, (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
