Set-based approaches such as evolutionary algorithms are very popular for solving multi-objective optimization problems. Convergence of set-based approaches for multi-objective optimization is essential for their success. We take an order-theoretic view on the convergence of set-based multi-objective optimization and examine how the use of indicator functions can help to direct the search towards Pareto optimal sets. In doing so, we point out that set-based multi-objective optimization working on the dominance relation of search points has to deal with a cyclic behavior that may lead to worsening with respect to the Pareto-dominance relation defined on sets. Later on, we show in which situations well-known binary and unary indicators can help to avoid this cyclic behavior and therefore guarantee convergence of the algorithm. We also study the impact of deteriorative cycles on the runtime behavior and give an example in which they provably slow down the optimization process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
