In this study, a new class of FtsZ inhibitors bearing the pyrimidine-quinuclidine scaffold was identified from structure-based virtual screening of natural product libraries. Iterative rounds of in silico studies and biological evaluation established the preliminary structure activity relationships of the new compounds. Potent FtsZ inhibitors with low micromolar IC50 and antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli were found. These findings support the use of virtual screening and structure-based design for the rational development of new antibacterial agents with innovative mechanisms of action.", "paper_title": "Identification of a New Class of FtsZ Inhibitors by Structure-Based Design and in Vitro Screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000323797700027"}
