High computational complexity, however, restricts it to non-time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we present a parallel implementation of Sauvola's method with integral image optimization, called fast Sauvola's method, on Nvidia Kepler architecture GPUs using CUDA 5.0. Our implementation is evaluated on a GTX 650 graphic card (384 cores) and exhibits an average speedup of about 38 compared to a sequential implementation on a fast CPU, and computational complex of our implementation is constant for any size of local windows.", "paper_title": "CUDA-accelerated fast Sauvola's method on Kepler architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000365446600037"}
