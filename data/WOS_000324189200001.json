So, constrained energy is a prominent feature for wireless sensor networks. Since the radio transceiver typically consumes more energies than any other hardware component on a sensor node, it is of great importance to design energy optimized routing algorithm to prolong network lifetime. In this work, based on analysis of energy consumption for data transceiver, single-hop forwarding scheme is proved to consume less energy than multihop forwarding scheme within the communication range of the source sensor or a current forwarder, using free space energy consumption model. We adopt the social welfare function to predict inequality of residual energy of neighbors after selecting different next hop nodes. Based on energy inequality, the method is designed to compute the degree of energy balance. Parameters such as degree of closeness of node to the shortest path, degree of closeness of node to Sink, and degree of energy balance are put into fuzzy logic system. Fuzzy-logic-based energy optimized routing algorithm is proposed to achieve multiparameter, fuzzy routing decision. Simulation results show that the algorithm effectively extends the network lifetime and has achieved energy efficiency and energy balance together, compared with similar algorithms.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy-Logic-Based Energy Optimized Routing for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000324189200001"}
