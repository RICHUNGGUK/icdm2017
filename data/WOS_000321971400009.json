The 3D model is first projected into a depth map, and a set of candidate feature points are extracted. Then, a conditional random fields (CRF) model is established to match the sketch points and the candidate feature points. Using sketch strokes, the candidate feature points can then be connected to obtain the feature lines, and using a CRF-matching model, the 2D image shape similarity features and 3D model geometric features can be effectively integrated. Finally, a relational metric based on shape and topological similarity is proposed to evaluate the matching results, and an iterative matching process is applied to obtain the globally optimized model feature lines. Experimental results showed that the proposed method can extract sound 3D model feature lines which correspond to the initial sketch template.", "paper_title": "Extracting 3D model feature lines based on conditional random fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000321971400009"}
