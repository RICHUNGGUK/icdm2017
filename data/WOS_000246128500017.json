Though some influence functions by single perturbation and local influence in LDA have been discussed in literature, we propose yet another influence function inspired by Critchley [1985. Influence in principal component analysis. Biometrika 72, 627-636], called the deleted empirical influence function, as an alternative approach for the influence analysis in LDA. It is well-known that single-perturbation diagnostics can suffer from the masking effect. Hence in this paper we also develop the pair-perturbation influence functions to detect the masked influential points. The comparisons between pair-perturbation influence functions and local influences in pairs in LDA are also investigated. Finally, two examples are provided to illustrate the results of these approaches. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
