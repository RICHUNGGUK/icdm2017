These classes were originally defined via the weighted satisfiability problem for Boolean circuits. Here, besides the Boolean connectives we consider connectives such as majority, not-all-equal, and unique. For example, a gate labelled by the majority connective outputs TRUE if more than half of its inputs are TRUE. For any finite set C of connectives we construct the corresponding W(C)-hierarchy. We derive some general conditions which guarantee that the W-hierarchy and the W(C)-hierarchy coincide levelwise. If C only contains the majority connective then the first levels of the hierarchies coincide. We use this to show that a variant of the parameterized vertex cover problem, the majority vertex cover problem, is W[1]-complete.", "paper_title": "W-Hierarchies Defined by Symmetric Gates", "paper_id": "WOS:000273480600009"}
