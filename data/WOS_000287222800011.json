Design/methodology/approach - The energetic model of ferromagnetic hysteresis evolved from some well-known concepts in ferromagnetism in the last years. The magnetisation process is calculated from energy balance and statistical domain behaviour. Based on vectorial, anisotropic, multi-domain considerations an isotropic, scalar model is derived, which gives quite simple equations to describe the nonlinear, hysteretic magnetisation process. Findings - The presented simulations for steel samples and ferrite samples show very nice correspondence with measurements. Originality/value - The scalar model seems to be especially suited for integration into finite element modelling or into simulations of electro-magnetic circuits.", "paper_title": "Energetic model of ferromagnetic hysteresis", "paper_id": "WOS:000287222800011"}
