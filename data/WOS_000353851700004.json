For a given SLP-compressed dictionary D of size n and height h representing in patterns of total length N, we present an O (n(2) log N)-size representation of Aho-Corasick automaton which recognizes all occurrences of the patterns in D in amortized O (h + m) running time per character. We also propose an algorithm to construct this compressed Aho-Corasick automaton in O (n(3) logn log N) time and O (n(2) log N) space. In a spacial case where 7, represents only a single pattern, we present an O (n log N)-size representation of the Morris-Pratt automaton which permits us to find all occurrences of the pattern in amortized O (h) running time per character, and we show how to construct this representation in O (n(3) logn log N) time with O (n(2) log N) working space.
