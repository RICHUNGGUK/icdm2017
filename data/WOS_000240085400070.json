A lot of solutions have been proposed to deal with it. However, with the evolvement of spammers' techniques and the diversification of email content, the traditional anti-spam approaches alone are no longer efficient. In this paper, a new anti-spam Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model based on immunity was presented. Self, Non-self, Antibody, Antigen and immune cells in email system were defined. The model architecture, the process of Antigen presenting, clone selection and mutation, immune tolerance, immune response, life cycle of immune cells and some other immune principles were described respectively. The analyses of theory and experiment results demonstrate that this model enjoys better adaptability and provides a new attractive solution to cope with junk emails in P2P environment.", "paper_title": "Immune-based peer-to-peer model for anti-spam", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400070"}
