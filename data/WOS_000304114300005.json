(Cogn Neurodyn 4(4):359-366, 2010). Since the basal ganglia (BG) and dopamine (DA) are confirmed to play an important role in protecting memories against noise and distraction stimulus, we add the BG in our present model and remove the plausible Ca2+ subsystem. We found that our network model maintained the persistent activity in response to a brief transient stimulus, which was similar to the above work. Furthermore the working memory performance was resistant to noise and performed better than that by Liang et al. (Cogn Neurodyn 4(4):359-366, 2010) in the aspect of resistance to distraction stimulus when the model is tuned to be bistable by DA.", "paper_title": "The Effect of Dopamine on Working Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000304114300005"}
