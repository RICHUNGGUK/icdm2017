Nevertheless, the heterogeneous memory demands from multiple virtual machines (VM) make it more challenging to design efficient memory systems. Even worse, mission critical VM management activities (e. g. checkpointing) could incur significant runtime overhead due to intensive IO operations. In this paper, we propose to leverage the adaptable and non-volatile features of the emerging phase change memory (PCM) to achieve efficient virtual machine execution. Towards this end, we exploit VM-aware PCM management mechanisms, which 1) smartly tune SLC/MLC page allocation within a single VM and across different VMs and 2) keep critical checkpointing pages in PCM to reduce I/O traffic. Experimental results show that our single VM design (IntraVM) improves performance by 10% and 20% compared to pure SLC- and MLC-based systems. Further incorporating VM-aware resource management schemes (IntraVM+InterVM) increases system performance by 15%. In addition, our design saves 46% of checkpoint/restore duration and reduces 50% of overall IO penalty to the system.", "paper_title": "Leveraging Phase Change Memory to Achieve Efficient Virtual Machine Execution", "paper_id": "WOS:000324470900017"}
