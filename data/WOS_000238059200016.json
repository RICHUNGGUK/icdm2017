The agent behavior and environment emulator are independent of implementation. To achieve this, a Language of Interface for Animations in 3D called LIA-3D, is presented. The agent and environment simulator uses LIA to establish communication with each other.", "paper_title": "3D emotional agent architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000238059200016"}
