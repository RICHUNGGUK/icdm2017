Most existing CDS systems are stand-alone products (first generation) or part of complete electronic medical record packages (second generation). Experience shows that creating and maintaining CDS systems is expensive and requires effort that should be economized by sharing them among multiple users. It makes good economic sense to share CDS service installations among a larger set of client systems. The paradigm of a service-oriented architecture (SOA) embraces this idea of sharing distributed services. Some attempts making CDS services available to distributed health information systems exist. However, these approaches have not gained much adoption. We argue that they do not provide a sufficient level of decoupling between client and CDS in order to be broadly reusable in SOAs. In this paper, we present a new CDS service component called EGADSS, which has been designed and implemented with the declared objective to minimize the coupling between client and CDS server. We present our key design decisions, which are guided by empirical research in SOA development. We evaluate our result theoretically by measuring the level of decoupling achieved compared to existing CDS approaches. Furthermore, we report on an empirical evaluation of the resulting design, integrating the EGADSS service with an example client system.", "paper_title": "DESIGN OF DECOUPLED CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT FOR SERVICE-ORIENTED ARCHITECTURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000266912800002"}
