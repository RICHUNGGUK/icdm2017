In this paper, we extend the technique to a kind of fault tolerant neural network. Consider a neural network to be suffering from multiple-node fault, a formulae similar to that of Generalized Prediction Error has been derived. Hence, the effective number of parameter of such a fault tolerant neural network is obtained. A difficulty in obtaining the mean prediction error is discussed and then a simple procedure for estimation of the prediction error empirically is suggested.", "paper_title": "Prediction error of a fault tolerant neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100058"}
