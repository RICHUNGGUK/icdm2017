This novel combination addresses two issues of existing SPH and FLIP solvers, namely mass preservation in FLIP and efficiency and memory consumption in SPH. First, the SPH component enables the simulation of incompressible fluids with perfect mass preservation. Second, the FLIP component efficiently enriches the SPH component with detail that is comparable to a standard SPH simulation with the same number of particles, while improving the performance by a factor of 7 and significantly reducing the memory consumption. We demonstrate that the proposed IISPH-FLIP solver can simulate incompressible fluids with a quantifiable, imperceptible density deviation below 0.1%. We show large-scale scenarios with up to 160 million particles that have been processed on a single desktop PC using only 15GB of memory. One- and two-way coupled solids are illustrated.", "paper_title": "IISPH-FLIP for incompressible fluids", "paper_id": "WOS:000337543000026"}
