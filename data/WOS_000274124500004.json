A colossal number of ways have been proposed to decrease delay, delay jitter and loss in wireless networks and good user-perceived quality in video over internet. This paper studies the multimedia over heterogeneous wireless networks, requirements and problems, and proposes a new scheme to overcome the obstacles. The proposed scheme, takes into account the effects of Application-Level Wireless Multilevel ECN marking (AWMECN), thus helps us overcome the congestion/loss mistake problems. For handoff, handover and lossy link problems, it is considered that a freezing mechanism is in use in application layer and assumed that the upper layers can be aware of disconnection periods to make the rate adaptation decisions. Also a new scheme has been added to receiver to gracefully degrade the quality when no other action is available to combat the long delays without data which is caused by handoffs and wireless temporary disconnections. The transport layer mechanism is chosen to be UDP for avoiding TCP regarding problems. We believe that obtaining a good quality of video depends on good performance of all layers and tried to use the best mechanism in each layer. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
