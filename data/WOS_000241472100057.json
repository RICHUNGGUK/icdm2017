We proposed a mechanism whereby neurotic behavior may be understood as an associative memory process in the brain, and the symbolic associative process involved in psychoanalytic working-through can be mapped onto a process of reconfiguration of the neuronal network. Memory was modeled by a Boltzmann machine represented by a complete graph. However, it is known that brain neuronal topology is selectively structured. Here, we further develop the memory model, by including known mechanisms that control synaptic properties, showing that the network self organizes to a hierarchical, clustered structure. Two modules corresponding to sensorial and declarative memory interact, producing sensorial and symbolic activity, representing unconscious and conscious mental processes. This extension of the model allows an evaluation of the idea of working-through in a hierarchical network structure.", "paper_title": "A complex neural network model for memory functioning in psychopathology", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100057"}
