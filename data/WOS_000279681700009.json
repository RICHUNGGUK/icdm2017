That representation allows us to answer adjacency queries in O(1) time. The approach is based on a fully dynamic modular decomposition algorithm for permutation graphs that works in O(n) time per edge and vertex modification. We thereby obtain a fully dynamic algorithm for the recognition of permutation graphs.", "paper_title": "Fully Dynamic Algorithm for Recognition and Modular Decomposition of Permutation Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000279681700009"}
