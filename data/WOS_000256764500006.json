Four problems have been analyzed by using SiZer Map: testing for additivity, testing the components significance, testing parametric models for the components and testing for interactions. The simplicity and flexibility of SiZer Map for our purposes are highlighted from the performed empirical study with several real datasets. With these data, we compare the conclusions derived from SiZer analysis with the global results derived from standard tests, previously proposed in the literature.", "paper_title": "SiZer Map for inference with additive models", "paper_id": "WOS:000256764500006"}
