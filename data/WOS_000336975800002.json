A promising approach to solve this problem is the following of a visual path extracted from a visual memory. In this paper, we propose an image-based control scheme for driving wheeled mobile robots along visual paths. Our approach is based on the feedback of information given by geometric constraints: the epipolar geometry or the trifocal tensor. The proposed control law only requires one measurement easily computed from the image data through the geometric constraint. The proposed approach has two main advantages: explicit pose parameters decomposition is not required and the rotational velocity is smooth or eventually piece-wise constant avoiding discontinuities that generally appear in previous works when the target image changes. The translational velocity is adapted as demanded for the path and the resultant motion is independent of this velocity. Furthermore, our approach is valid for all cameras with approximated central projection, including conventional, catadioptric and some fisheye cameras. Simulations and real-world experiments illustrate the validity of the proposal.", "paper_title": "Visual navigation of wheeled mobile robots using direct feedback of a geometric constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000336975800002"}
