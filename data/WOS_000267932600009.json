Then by means of stable topology, we define and study pure filters of a BL-algebra A and obtain a one to one correspondence between pure filters of A and closed subsets of Max(A), the set of all maximal filters of A, as a subspace of Spec(A). We also show that for any filter F of BL-algebra A if sigma(F) = F then U(F) is stable and F is a pure filter of A, where sigma(F) = {a is an element of A vertical bar y boolean AND z = 0 for some z is an element of F and y is an element of a(perpendicular to)} and U(F) = {P is an element of Spec(A) vertical bar F not subset of P}.", "paper_title": "PURE FILTERS AND STABLE TOPOLOGY ON BL-ALGEBRAS", "paper_id": "WOS:000267932600009"}
