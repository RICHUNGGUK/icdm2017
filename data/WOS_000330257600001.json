Based on the TOE framework and upper echelon theory, this study investigated the relationships between top managers' individual differences and IIT championing behavior from two perspectives: the personal context and the technical context. An empirical survey was administered to 130 top managers to test the research model. The results reveal that 52.6% of the variance in top managers' IIT championing behavior can be explained by three antecedent variables: the OSL, IIT absorptive capacity, and involvement. Finally, the implications for practitioners and researchers are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
