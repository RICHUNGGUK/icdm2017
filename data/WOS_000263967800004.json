Two characters are considered in the proposed network: 1) nodes, and arcs all have multiple possible capacities, and may fail; and 2) the capacity weight varies with arcs, nodes, and types of commodity. The purpose of this paper is to study the systems reliability, in this case the possibility that a given quantity (d(1), d(2)) of two types of commodities can be transmitted from the source factory to the destination factory simultaneously. Such a possibility can be treated as a performance index to measure the quality level of a supply chain network. The flow model is constructed by flow assignments, and capacity vectors. The (d(1), d(2))-MP, which represents the capacity of each arc/node, is a minimal capacity vector meeting the demand constraint. A simple algorithm in terms of minimal paths is first proposed to generate all (d(1), d(2))-MP. The system reliability can then be calculated efficiently in terms of (d(1), d(2))-MP. Time complexity of the proposed algorithm is also analyzed.", "paper_title": "System Reliability Evaluation for a Multistate Supply Chain Network With Failure Nodes Using Minimal Paths", "paper_id": "WOS:000263967800004"}
