Therefore, how to secure users' privacy information must be taken into consideration. Many different approaches have been proposed to protect users' identity, location and so on. This paper reviews and analyzes existing privacy protection research works from an integrated perspective, gives the LBS category from two views, and discusses the challenges of securing privacy information. Lastly, our suggestions for future research works are presented.", "paper_title": "Privacy Protection for LBS in Mobile Environments: Progresses, Issues and Challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000361372000024"}
