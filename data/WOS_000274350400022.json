It is therefore a powerful tool for studying hydrological and environmental impacts associated with land-use and climate change. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been developed that allows a catchment data set to be set up quickly using a minimum of information. The GUI has an algorithm for the automatic generation of river channel networks from a DEM and has access to libraries of soil and vegetation parameters. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
