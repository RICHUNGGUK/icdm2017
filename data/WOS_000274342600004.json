In this article, we propose a labelled tableau calculus for this logic, and show that it decides satisfiability of formulas in deterministic polynomial space. Since this problem is known to be PSPACE-complete, it follows that our proof method is optimal.", "paper_title": "Tableaux for Public Announcement Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000274342600004"}
