Fundamental conditions for availability of system behaviors of such network systems are clarified in a form of fixed point theorem for system of set-valued operators. Here, the proof of this theorem is accomplished by the concept of Hausdorff's ball measure of non-compactness.", "paper_title": "A basic theory for available operation of extremely complicated large-scale network systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093800023"}
