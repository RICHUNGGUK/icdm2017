Hadoop which is a MapReduce implementation has been widely used in developing MapReduce applications. This paper presents HSim, a MapReduce simulator which builds on top of Hadoop. HSim models a large number of parameters that can affect the behaviors of MapReduce nodes, and thus it can be used to tune the performance of a MapReduce cluster. HSim is validated with both benchmark results and user customized MapReduce applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
