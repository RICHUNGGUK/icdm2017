In order to highlight the evolution of this research stream, we have retained and analysed 30 studies in which the authors use neural networks to solve companies' classification problems (healthy and failing firms). This review of all these works gives us the opportunity to stress upon future trends in bankruptcy forecasting research.", "paper_title": "Artificial neural networks and bankruptcy forecasting: a state of the art", "paper_id": "WOS:000235318000006"}
