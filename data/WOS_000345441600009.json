Unlike the majority of approaches in the literature, we use the raw Wikipedia text for knowledge acquisition. The main assumption made is that the concepts classified under the same node in a taxonomy are described in a comparable way in Wikipedia. The annotation of the extracted knowledge is done at two levels: ontological and logical. The extracted properties are evaluated in the traditional way, that is, by computing the precision of the extraction procedure and in a clustering task. The second method of evaluation is seldom used in the natural language processing community, but it is regularly employed in cognitive psychology.", "paper_title": "What Kind of Knowledge Is in Wikipedia?
