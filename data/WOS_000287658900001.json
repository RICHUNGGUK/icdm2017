There is not much previous work that considers the desired placement configuration between power and thermally-sensitive devices for a better thermal profile to reduce the thermally-induced mismatches. This paper first introduces the properties of a desired thermal profile for better thermal matching of the matched devices. It then presents a thermal-driven analog placement methodology to achieve the desired thermal profile and to consider the best device matching under the thermal profile while satisfying the symmetry and the common-centroid constraints. Experimental results based on real analog circuits show that the proposed approach can achieve the best analog circuit performance/accuracy with the least impact due to the thermal gradient, among existing works.", "paper_title": "Thermal-Driven Analog Placement Considering Device Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000287658900001"}
