Three metaheuristic are studied: Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm, and hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm. The experimental evaluation over instances accounting for workloads and scenarios using real data from cloud providers, indicates that the parallel hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm is the best method to solve the problem, computing solutions with up to 368.9% profit improvement over greedy heuristics results while accounting for accurate makespan and flowtime values.", "paper_title": "Metaheuristics for the Virtual Machine Mapping Problem in Clouds", "paper_id": "WOS:000352753100007"}
