One of the key mechanisms to establish trust among different platforms in an open and dynamic environment is remote attestation, which allows a platform to vouch for its trust-related characteristics to a remote challenger. This paper proposes a novel attestation scheme for a dynamically reconfigurable CBS to reliably prove whether its execution satisfies the specified security model, by introducing a TPM-based attestation service to dynamically monitor the execution of the CBS. When only parts of the dynamic CBS are concerned, our scheme enables fine-grained attestation on the execution of an individual component or a sub-system in the dynamic CBS, such that it involves only minimal overhead for attesting the target parts of the CBS. With flexible attestation support, the proposed attestation service can attest a CBS at the granularity from an individual component to the whole CBS. As a case study, we have applied the proposed scheme on OSGi systems and implemented a prototype based on JVMTI for Felix. The evaluation results show that the proposed scheme is both effective and practical. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
