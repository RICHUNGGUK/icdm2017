When neural networks contain unbounded activation functions, it may happen that equilibrium point does not exist at all. In this paper, without assuming the boundedness, monotonicity and differentiability of the active functions, the algebraic criteria ensuring existence, uniqueness and global exponential stability of the equilibrium point of neural networks are obtained.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis of reaction-diffusion recurrent cellular neural networks with variable time delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000033"}
