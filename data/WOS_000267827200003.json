However, existing network management data has no link to business concepts. This makes it very difficult to ensure that services offered by the network are meeting business objectives. This paper describes a novel context-aware policy model that uses a combination of modeled and ontological data to determine the current context, which policies are applicable to that context, and what services and resources should be offered to which users and applications.", "paper_title": "The Use of Context-Aware Policies and Ontologies to Facilitate Business-Aware Network Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000267827200003"}
