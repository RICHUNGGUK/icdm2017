It has been theoretically proved that the proposed architecture can be reconfigured to generate a large number of mappings, all of which have high nonlinearity, satisfies Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC) and is robust against linear and differential cryptanalysis. The architecture can be also used to optimize the resiliency and algebraic degree. The architecture has been found to scale easily to handle large number of input variables, which is an important criterion in realizing nonlinear combiners for stream ciphers using Boolean functions.", "paper_title": "A Parallel Efficient Architecture for Large Cryptographically Robust n x k (k > n/2) Mappings", "paper_id": "WOS:000286475800006"}
