In this paper, a new analytical method called alpha/beta-Dominant-Skyline on MTS and a formal definition of the alpha/beta-dominant skyline MTS are given. Also, three algorithms, called NL, BC and MFB, are proposed to address the alpha/beta-dominant skyline queries over MTS. Finally experimental results on both synthetic and real data verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method and algorithms.", "paper_title": "Dominant Skyline Query Processing over Multiple Time Series", "paper_id": "WOS:000321566800006"}
