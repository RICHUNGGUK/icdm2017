A primary idea of it is to improve the performance of peer-to-peer content delivery by employing deduplication to take advantage of similarity both among and within VM images in cloud datacenters. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is validated through an evaluation that demonstrates substantial performance gains.", "paper_title": "A Deduplication-Enabled P2P Protocol for VM Image Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000356590300014"}
