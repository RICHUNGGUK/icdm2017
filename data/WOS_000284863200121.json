The proposed approaches are based on a Reduced Reward-punishment editing approach for selecting several subsets of patterns, which are subsequently used to train different classifiers. The basic idea of the Reduced Reward-punishment editing algorithm is to reward patterns that contribute to a correct classification and to punish those that provide a wrong one. We propose ensembles based on the perturbation of patterns; in particular we propose a baggingbased algorithm and two variants of recent feature transform based ensemble methods (Rotation Forest and Input Decimated Ensemble). In our variants the different subsets of patterns find by the Reward-punishment editing are used to create a different subspace projection (the Principal Component Analysis and the Independent Component Analysis are tested in this work). These feature transformations are applied to the whole dataset and a classifier Di is trained using these transformed patterns. To combine the set of classifiers obtained the sum rule is used. Experiments carried out on several classification problems show the superiority of this method with respect to other well known state-of-the-art approaches for building ensembles of classifiers. @ 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
