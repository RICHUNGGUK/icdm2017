Let s, t epsilon V and let L be a real number. An L-bounded leg path from s to t is an ordered set of points which connects s to t such that the leg between any two consecutive points in the set has length of at most L. The minimal path among all these paths is the L-bounded leg shortest path from s to t. In the s-t Bounded Leg Shortest Path (stBLSP) problem we are given two points s and t and a real number L, and are required to compute an L-bounded leg shortest path from s to t. In the All-Pairs Bounded Leg Shortest Path (apBLSP) problem we are required to build a data structure that, given any two query points from V and a real number L, outputs the length of the L-bounded leg shortest path (a distance query) or the path itself (a path query). In this paper we obtain the following results: 1. An algorithm for the apBLSP problem in any l(p)-metric which, for any fixed epsilon > 0, computes in O(n(3)(log(3) n + log(2) n center dot epsilon(-d))) time a data structure which approximates any bounded leg shortest path within a multiplicative error of (1 + epsilon). It requires O(n(2) log n) space and distance queries are answered in O(log log n) time. An algorithm for the stBLSP problem that, given s, t epsilon V and a real number L, computes in O(n center dot polylog(n)) the exact L-bounded shortest path from s to t. This algorithm works in l(1) and l(infinity) metrics. In the Euclidean metric we also obtain an exact algorithm but with a running time of O(n(4/3+epsilon) ), for any epsilon > 0. For any weighted directed graph we give a data structure of size O(n (2.5)log n) which is capable of answering path queries with a multiplicative error of (1 + epsilon) in O(log log n + l) time, where l is the length of the reported path.", "paper_title": "On Bounded Leg Shortest Paths Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000287319100007"}
