We give a simple proof that the distribution satisfies negative association. We also show that under a linear match schedule it satisfies the stronger condition of conditional negative association via a non-trivial application of the Feder-Mihail theorem. This method involves the notion of a variable of positive influence. We give some results and related counter-ex am pies which might shed some light on its role in a theory of negative dependence.", "paper_title": "Positive influence and negative dependence", "paper_id": "WOS:000243584500003"}
