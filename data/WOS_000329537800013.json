We model the corruptions as sparse error. Therefore the structure from motion problem is reduced to the problem of recovering a low-rank matrix from corrupted observations. We first decompose the matrix of trajectories of features into low-rank and sparse components by nuclear-norm and l(1)-norm minimization, and then obtain the motion and structure from the low-rank components by the classical factorization method. Unlike pervious methods, which have some drawbacks such as depending on the initial value selection and being sensitive to the large magnitude errors, our method uses a convex optimization technique that is guaranteed to recover the low-rank matrix from highly corrupted and incomplete observations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is more efficient and robust to large-scale outliers.", "paper_title": "Robust structure from motion with affine camera via low-rank matrix recovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000329537800013"}
