In a work Aloimonos and Herve (IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell 12(5):504-510, 1990) presented an algorithm that could reconstruct a single planar surface without establishing point-to-point correspondences. The work uses images that are taken under a specific stereo configuration. In this paper, we generalize the algorithm to one for general stereo configuration of the cameras. We further provide an extension of the algorithm, so that not only distant or planar scene but also multi-surface polyhedral scene can be reconstructed. Experimental results on a number of real image sets are presented to illustrate the performance of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Correspondence-free stereo vision: extension from planar scene case to polyhedral scene case", "paper_id": "WOS:000277415700006"}
