FS has been proposed as a diversity scheme and achieves path diversity by enlarging the bandwidth of the baseband filters in order to transmit the imaging components of the desired signal. However, FS is not able to achieve diversity with very short delay multipaths because of its low multipath delay resolution. Wider bandwidth of the transmission signal is required to improve the resolution of the delay. On the other hand, cognitive radio is an emerging technology to utilize frequency spectrum flexibly through dynamic spectrum access (DSA). To resolve the small delay multipaths and to use the spectrum flexibly with DSA, this paper investigates the FS path diversity with the imaging components on the separated frequency channel. The correlation between the 2 FS branches is analyzed theoretically on the 2 path channel under the conditions of sampling interval, delay spread, and frequency separation. Numerical results through computer simulation show that the proposed scheme improves the multipath resolution and the bit error rate (BER) performance under the existence of small delay multipaths.", "paper_title": "Improvement of Multipath Delay Resolution with Imaging Components on Separate Frequency Channel in Fractional Sampling OFDM", "paper_id": "WOS:000311011900025"}
