From the experience of working with mobile telephony systems for over three years, it is the author's belief that the huge amount of variance in application logics, not the diversity of hardware platforms, is the major obstacle to the development of embedded software. A domain specific language (DSL) for modelling the user interface (UI) architecture of embedded software, especially focusing on telephony applications is proposed. With the proposed DSL, developers can describe the UI architecture of applications by the fundamental domain concepts at a higher level of abstraction. The proposed DSL is based on the concept of scene. A scene is proposed as a unit of UI in the UI architecture and UI-related behaviours are associated with scenes. The result of a pilot project conducted in a major company dedicated to developing mobile telephony applications is also described.", "paper_title": "Domain-specific language approach to modelling Ul architecture of mobile telephony systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243816300003"}
