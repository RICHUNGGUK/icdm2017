To specify not only test goals but entire suites, FQL describes families of related test goals by regular expressions over extended alphabets: Herein, each symbol corresponds to a regular expression over program locations, and thus, a word in an FQL expression corresponds to a regular expression describing a single test goal. In this paper we provide a systematic foundation for FQL test specifications, which are in fact rational sets of regular languages (RSRLs). To address practically relevant problems like query optimization, we tackle open questions about RSRLs: We settle closure properties of general and finite RSRLs under common set theoretic operations. We also prove complexity results for checking equivalence and inclusion of star-free RSRLs, and for deciding whether a regular language is a member of a general or star-free RSRL.
