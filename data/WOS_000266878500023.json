Equivalently, the chip rate can be reduced for a given number of users, which implies bandwidth reduction for downlink wireless systems. An upper bound for the maximum number of users for a given number of chips is derived. Also, lower and upper bounds for the sum channel capacity of a binary overloaded CDMA are derived that can predict the existence of such overloaded codes. We also propose a simplified maximum likelihood method for decoding these types of overloaded codes. Although a high percentage of the overloading factor(1) degrades the system performance in noisy channels, simulation results show that this degradation is not significant. More importantly, for moderate values of E(l)/N(0) (in the range of 6-10 dB) or higher, the proposed codes perform much better than the binary Welch bound equality sequences.", "paper_title": "A Class of Errorless Codes for Overloaded Synchronous Wireless and Optical CDMA Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000266878500023"}
