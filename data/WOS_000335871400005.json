The findings indicate that extraversion is positively related to UGC usage for entertainment and negatively related to communication and information, whereas neuroticism is positively related to UGC usage for entertainment and communication. Only extraversion has an influence on flow, which is positive, and flow, in turn, has a positive influence on UGC usage for entertainment and communication. This study extends flow theory by exploring antecedents and outcomes of the flow state experience. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
