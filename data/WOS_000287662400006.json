This is mainly because parameterization will probably decrease the size of the software to be downloaded, and also because it will limit the reconfiguration time. In this paper, parameterization is considered as a digital radio design methodology. Two different techniques, namely common functions and common operators are considered. In this paper, the second view is developed and illustrated by two examples: the well known Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the proposed Reconfigurable Linear Feedback Shift Register (R-LFSR), derived from the classical Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) structure.", "paper_title": "Promising Technique of Parameterization For Reconfigurable Radio, the Common Operators Technique: Fundamentals and Examples", "paper_id": "WOS:000287662400006"}
