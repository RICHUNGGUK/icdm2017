The projections onto lower dimensional subspaces associated with lower degree basis functions are used as LES filter, along the lines proposed in Variational Multiscale templates. Comparisons with DNS results available in the literature for plane and constricted channel flows at Mach numbers 0.2, 0.7 and 1.5 show clearly that the dynamic models are able to improve the prediction of most key features of the flow with respect to the Smagorinsky models employed so farina VMS-DG context.
