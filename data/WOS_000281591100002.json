Most of the factors that determine the structure of a decision depend largely on the feelings and memories of the decision makers and that leaves room for doubt about the completeness of the decision. The decision makers would be helped by having available a general well-researched list of factors for some of their complex decisions in order to have greater assurance that their decisions are comprehensive and right. To do that, they must have wide exposure and be familiar with the full spectrum of human values and environmental opportunities. Our concern is about structuring decisions in a reliable way to serve the needs of decision makers. A very broad framework is provided in this paper to address this issue. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.
