Based on the spark plug's current discharge channel, the circuit model of the spark plug is established with the parasitic parameters and the an-gap model. The parasitic parameters of the spark plug are extracted with the finite element method, and the air-gap model of the spark plug is analyzed using the electric circuit principles and the air-discharge theory. The simulation and measurement results validate this model. Furthermore, this model confirms that the spark plug discharge is the main conducted EMI source in the ignition system, based on simulation.", "paper_title": "Circuit model and parasitic parameter extraction of the spark plug in the ignition system", "paper_id": "WOS:000306302000010"}
