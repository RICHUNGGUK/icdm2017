We use Expected Utility Theory as the basic mechanism for decision-making. Our theoretical and experimental analysis shows that Expected Utility is useful for choosing between cheap-but-risky and costly-but-safe bids. Moreover, we show how bids with similar costs and similar probabilities of being successfully completed but different time windows can be efficiently selected or rejected.", "paper_title": "Winner determination for combinatorial auctions for tasks with time and precedence constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000248524400006"}
