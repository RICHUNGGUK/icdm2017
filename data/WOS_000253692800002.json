By applying Young's inequality and Milder's inequality techniques together with the properties of monotonic continuous functions, global exponential stability criteria are established for BAM NNs with time delays. This is done through the use of a new Lyapunov functional and an M-matrix. The results obtained in this paper extend and improve previous results.", "paper_title": "Global exponential stability of bidirectional associative memory neural networks with time delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000253692800002"}
