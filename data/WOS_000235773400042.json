As we known, text classification problem is representative multiclass problem. This paper describes a framework, which we call Strong-to-Weak-to-Strong (SWS). It transforms a \"strong\" learning algorithm to a \"weak\" algorithm by decreasing its iterative numbers of optimization while preserving its other characteristics like geometric properties and then makes use of the kernel trick for \"weak\" algorithms to work in high dimensional spaces, finally improves the performances of text classification. We analyzed the particular properties of learning with text and identified why this approach is appropriate for this task. Empirical results show that our approach is competitive with the other methods.", "paper_title": "A multiclass classification framework for document categorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773400042"}
