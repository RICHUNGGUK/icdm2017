Such a realization allows for concepts of curve design such as de Casteljau algorithm, blossom, dimension elevation to be transferred from the general theory of Chebyshev blossoms in Muntz spaces to these generalized Bernstein bases that we termed here as Gelfond-Bernstein bases. The advantage of working with Gelfond-Bernstein bases lies in the simplicity of the obtained concepts and algorithms as compared to their Chebyshev-Bernstein bases counterparts.
