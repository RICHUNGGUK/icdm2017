This article proposes a particular parallel mixed-model assembly line balancing problem in an assemble-to-order environment for the first time. One of the lines works in conventional condition, the other one works faster and both of them produce similar products. The mixed-model assembly lines are useful to have varied and flexible products and also considering assemble-to-order environment enables companies to have higher flexibility in product mix and lead time (promise date). In this regard, a mathematical model that reflects real-world assembly line condition is developed for the problem. A hybrid genetic algorithm which minimises the weighted cycle time is proposed to solve such a complex problem. Finally, the proposed solution approach is implemented to solve a case study reflecting actual industry environment.", "paper_title": "Mixed-model assembly line balancing in assemble-to-order environment with considering express parallel line: problem definition and solution procedure", "paper_id": "WOS:000335851200006"}
