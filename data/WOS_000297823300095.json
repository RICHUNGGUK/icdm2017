Companies and organizations store more and more information about themselves on the Internet. Sometimes, that information is not well organized. Other times, the huge volume of available data makes useful information difficult to be found. The result is that users have to waste their time looking for what they want to know using the traditional menu-driven navigation and keyword search that websites provide. This is a critical issue because it decreases users interest about companies. In order to avoid this problem, in this paper we propose a framework for designing virtual assistants, which are, considering first results, an ideal alternative to help users find, not only the information that they are looking for, but also some related information which could be of the highest interest.
