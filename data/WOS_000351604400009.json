The system has been used by students for the self-learning and the work in the laboratory. They have the possibility to test abstract algorithms that are explained in classes and to explore their visual simulation. Its purpose is to demonstrate the application of theoretical knowledge in practice. Students are using it not only to understand how certain algorithms function, but also to gain insight into how they can be applied in practice and how to choose the right algorithm.
