The mingling and 2-step mingling inequalities of Atamturk and Gunluk (Math Program 123(2):315-338, 2010) are also derived based on MIR and they incorporate upper bounds on the integer variables. It has been shown that these inequalities are facet-defining for the mixed integer knapsack set under certain conditions and generalize several well-known valid inequalities. In this paper, we introduce new classes of valid inequalities for the mixed-integer knapsack set with bounded integer variables, which we call n-step mingling inequalities (for positive integer n). These inequalities incorporate upper bounds on integer variables into n-step MIR and, therefore, unify the concepts of n-step MIR and mingling in a single class of inequalities. Furthermore, we show that for each n, the n-step mingling inequality defines a facet for the mixed integer knapsack set under certain conditions. For n = 2, we extend the results of Atamturk and Gunluk on facet-defining properties of 2-step mingling inequalities. For n a parts per thousand yen 3, we present new facets for the mixed integer knapsack set. As a special case we also derive conditions under which the n-step MIR inequalities define facets for the mixed integer knapsack set. In addition, we show that n-step mingling can be used to generate new valid inequalities and facets based on covers and packs defined for mixed integer knapsack sets.", "paper_title": "n-step mingling inequalities: new facets for the mixed-integer knapsack set", "paper_id": "WOS:000301454100004"}
