The main idea in this approach is that the mobil node should manage the mobility for itself not the network. The network nodes provide only basic services for mobile entities: connectivity and administration. We construct a framework called the Client-based Mobility Frame System (CMFS) for this mobility environment. We developed the CMFS protocol as a solution over IPv4 and we show how to use Mobile IPv6 to realize our concept. We propose some basic mobility management solutions that can be implemented into the mobile clients and give details about a working simulation of a complete Mobility Management System. Example mobility management approaches such as the centralized- and hierarchical- or cellular-like ones are also defined and hints are given what kind of algorithms might be implemented upon the Client-based Mobility Frame System over IPv4 and IPv6 as well. We introduce some example algorithms that can work with the CMFS making mobility management efficient by minimizing signalling load on the network. In the present work modeling and detailed discussion on the parameters of the algorithms is given and comparison to existing mobility approaches and protocols is done. We prepared a simulation to test our protocol and to back up the proposals we provide the reader with simulation results. We stress that still one the most important benefit of our findings is that all the MNs can run different management strategies and can optimize mobility for themselves.", "paper_title": "Mobility management algorithms for the Client-driven Mobility Frame System - mobility from a brand new point of view", "paper_id": "WOS:000273838000001"}
