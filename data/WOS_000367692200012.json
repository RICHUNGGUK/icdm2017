The paper focuses on this proposal, and analyzes the complexity of both coherence testing and cautious reasoning under the new semantics. Some surprising results highlight similarities and differences versus mainstream stable model semantics for aggregates. Moreover, the paper reports on the design of compilation techniques for implementing the new semantics on top of existing ASP solvers, which eventually lead to realize a prototype system that allows for experimenting with Gelfond-Zhang's aggregates.", "paper_title": "Complexity and compilation of GZ-aggregates in answer set programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000367692200012"}
