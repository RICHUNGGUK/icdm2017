Since OBS still suffers high loss ratio due to the lack of buffer at the OBS core routers, we study methods to reduce the loss without using optical buffers. We consider time-slotted OBS called Slotted OBS (SOBS), where routers are synchronized and only send fixed length bursts at the beginning of time slots. Our simulation results show that SOBS reduces the packet loss probability significantly. Moreover, we show that SOBS can be implemented with little or no additional cost and has other advantages such as providing better support for Quality of Service (QoS). (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
