Mobile device service composition process includes two parts: mobile device service provisioning through device service market and mobile device resource allocation through device resource market. Interactions among mobile grid user agent, mobile device service agent and mobile device resource agent are mediated by means of market mechanisms. Mobile device service composition optimization maximizes the interests of mobile grid user agent, mobile device service agent and mobile device resource agent. Utility function is used to specify QoS requirement of mobile grid users and benefit of mobile device resource agents. The problem of services composition of mobile devices is formulated by utility optimization. The paper also presents a mobile grid services composition algorithm to maximize user QoS under energy constraint. In the simulation, the performance evaluation of proposed algorithm for services composition of mobile devices is conducted and compared with other related works. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
