However, they are very inefficient at representing glossy light transport. This is because a VPL on a glossy surface illuminates a small fraction of the scene only, and a tremendous number of VPLs might be necessary to render acceptable images. In this paper, we introduce Rich-VPLs which, in contrast to standard VPLs, represent a multitude of light paths and thus have a more widespread emission profile on glossy surfaces and in scenes with multiple primary light sources. By this, a single Rich-VPL contributes to larger portions of a scene with negligible additional shading cost. Our second contribution is a placement strategy for (Rich-) VPLs proportional to sensor importance times radiance. Although both Rich-VPLs and improved placement can be used individually, they complement each other ideally and share interim computation. Furthermore, both complement existing many-light methods, e.g. Lightcuts or the Virtual Spherical Lights method, and can improve their efficiency as well as their application for scenes with glossy materials and many primary light sources.", "paper_title": "Rich-VPLs for Improving the Versatility of Many-Light Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000358326600054"}
