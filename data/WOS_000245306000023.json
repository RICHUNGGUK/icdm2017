In this correspondence, this result is extended and the optimal tradeoff performance is derived for generalized fading channel conditions, including different fading types, nonidentical fading distributions, spatial correlation, and nonzero channel means. Our results include many known models as special cases and shed light on the effects of different channel parameters on the optimal tradeoff performance.", "paper_title": "Diversity and multiplexing tradeoff in general fading channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000245306000023"}
