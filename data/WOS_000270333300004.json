It is based on three behaviours: Wall Following, Corridor Following and Door Crossing. The system works in indoor and dynamic environments. Its performance is efficient when using available resources, allowing its adaptation to changes. The complete exploration is achieved in an autonomous way.", "paper_title": "Cooperative behaviour-based complete exploration for an autonomous robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000270333300004"}
