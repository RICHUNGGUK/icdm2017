Users can access different kinds of information through the Internet. However, the exponential growth of the Internet led to a great problem: difficult to locate relevant information. The Semantic Web is an extension of the current web system in which information is organized in a well-defined manner and for enabling computers and people to work in cooperation. Agent technology gives a new way to this intelligent web system. In this paper, we proposed an innovative agent platform - Ontia iJADE which supports the Semantic Web Service. Ontia iJADE contains an ontology Server known as intelligent Java-based ontology Server (IJAOS), which stores and manages the ontology information for agents to share and reuse.", "paper_title": "Ontia iJADE: An intelligent ontology-based agent framework for semantic web service", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600082"}
