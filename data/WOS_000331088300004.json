In contrary to traditional networks, opportunistic networks utilize the mobility of nodes to relay messages in a store-carry-forward paradigm. Thus, the relay process in opportunistic networks faces several practical challenges in terms of delay and delivery rate. In this paper, we propose a novel P2P Query algorithm, namely Betweenness Centrality Forwarding (PQBCF), for opportunistic networking. PQBCF adopts a forwarding metric called Betweenness Centrality (BC), which is borrowed from social network, to quantify the active degree of nodes in the networks. In PQBCF, nodes with a higher BC are preferable to serve as relays, leading to higher query success rate and lower query delay. A comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms reveals that PQBCF can provide better performance on both the query success Ratio and query delay, and approaches the performance of Epidemic Routing (ER) with much less resource consumption.", "paper_title": "A P2P query algorithm for opportunistic networks utilizing betweenness centrality forwarding", "paper_id": "WOS:000331088300004"}
