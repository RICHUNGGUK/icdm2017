In particular, the exploitation of manycore accelerators requires a holistic solution that simultaneously addresses time-to-response, energy efficiency and ease of programming. In this paper, we adapt the SuperMatrix runtime task scheduler for dense linear algebra algorithms to the many-threaded Intel Xeon Phi, with special emphasis on the performance and energy profile of the solution. From the performance perspective, we optimize the balance between task- and data-parallelism, reporting notable results compared with Intel MKL. From the energy-aware point of view, we propose a methodology that relies on core-level event counters and aggregated power consumption samples to obtain a task-level accounting for the energy. In addition, we introduce a blocking mechanism to reduce power and energy consumption during the idle periods inherent to task parallel executions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
