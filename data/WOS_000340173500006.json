Experiment in the field is carried out with the involvement of 15 participants using within-subject design to evaluate the newly developed earcons, spearcons, and short pulses for distance and forward-direction in pedestrian navigation. Results from the experiment suggest that spearcons are efficient in tasks completion, and it conveys distance and forward-direction information to participants more accurately compared with earcons and short pulses. Overall, participants have shown their satisfaction with spearcons as an audio feedback in pedestrian navigation.", "paper_title": "A Comparative Study of Sonification Methods to Represent Distance and Forward-Direction in Pedestrian Navigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000340173500006"}
