Such data are sometimes referred to as high-dimensional, low-sample size data. Our model assumes that each observation within a randomly selected small data set follows a mixture of C shifted and rescaled versions of an arbitrary density f. A novel kernel density estimation scheme, in conjunction with clustering methods, is applied to estimate f. Bayes information criterion and a new criterion weighted mean of within-cluster variances are used to estimate C, which is the number of mixture components or clusters. These results are applied to the multiple testing problem. The null sampling distribution of each test statistic is determined by f, and hence a bootstrap procedure that resamples from an estimate of f is used to approximate this null distribution.", "paper_title": "Bootstrapping in a high dimensional but very low-sample size problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000280055600001"}
