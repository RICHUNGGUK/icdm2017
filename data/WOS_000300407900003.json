Some recent approaches propose to perform automatic user task detection by means of classifiers using captured user context data. In this paper we improve on that by using an ontology-based user interaction context model that can be automatically populated by (1) capturing simple user interaction events on the computer desktop and (2) applying rule-based and information extraction mechanisms. We present evaluation results from a large user study we have carried out in a knowledge-intensive business environment, showing that our ontology-based approach provides new contextual features yielding good task-detection performance. We also argue that good results can be achieved by training task classifiers \"offline'' on user context data gathered in laboratory settings. Finally, we isolate a combination of contextual features that present a significantly better discriminative power than classical ones.(1)", "paper_title": "EXPLOITING THE USER INTERACTION CONTEXT FOR AUTOMATIC TASK DETECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000300407900003"}
