However, such algorithms are often ineffective to handle a large number of targets identifying each of them is too hard due to the fact that the targets usually move together and their locations may also be close to each other. This paper investigates the problem of tracking a group of targets when their motions are correlated. Specifically, we propose a family of algorithms for collaborative tracking with the help of binary proximity sensors. More specifically, our contributions include a fault-tolerant target group detection algorithm, two target group localization algorithms, and dynamic reporter node selection and redeployment control algorithms. Furthermore, we explore the fundamental limit on the accuracy of localizing a target group. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
