The search space is defined by a set of expert-specified, trusted, hierarchically-organized analog building blocks, which are organized as a parameterized context-free grammar. The search algorithm is a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm that uses an age-layered population structure to balance exploration versus exploitation. It is validated with experiments to search across > 100 000 different one-stage and two-stage opamp topologies, returning human-competitive results. The runtime is orders of magnitude faster than open-ended systems, and unlike the other evolutionary algorithm approaches, the resulting circuits are trustworthy by construction. The approach generalizes to other problem domains which have accumulated structural domain knowledge, such as robotic structures, car assemblies, and modeling biological systems.", "paper_title": "Trustworthy Genetic Programming-Based Synthesis of Analog Circuit Topologies Using Hierarchical Domain-Specific Building Blocks", "paper_id": "WOS:000293740700008"}
