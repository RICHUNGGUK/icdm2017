Here, we present DEGseq, an R package to identify differentially expressed genes or isoforms for RNA-seq data from different samples. In this package, we integrated three existing methods, and introduced two novel methods based on MA-plot to detect and visualize gene expression difference.", "paper_title": "DEGseq: an R package for identifying differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq data", "paper_id": "WOS:000273116100024"}
