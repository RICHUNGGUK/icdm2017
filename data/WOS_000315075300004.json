We show that the dependence on mu is necessary in the worst case for every algorithm whose structure resembles existing ones. As a technical tool, a new variant of Statistical Queries termed L-infinity-queries is defined. We show how to simulate L-infinity-queries using classical Statistical Queries and show that known PAC algorithms for learning PDFA are in fact statistical query algorithms. Our results include a lower bound: every algorithm to learn PDFA with queries using a reasonable tolerance must make Omega(1/mu(1-c)) queries for every c > 0. Finally, an adaptive algorithm that PAC-learns w.r.t. another measure of complexity is described. This yields better efficiency in many cases, while retaining the same inevitable worst-case behavior. Our algorithm requires fewer input parameters than previously existing ones, and has a better sample bound. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
