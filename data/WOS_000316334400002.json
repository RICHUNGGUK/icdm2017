As a generalization of the exact POMDP model, the bounded-parameter POMDP (BPOMDP) provides only upper and lower bounds on the state-transition probabilities, observation probabilities and rewards, which is particularly suitable for characterizing the situations where the underlying model is imprecisely given or time-varying. This paper presents the optimistic criterion for optimality for solving BPOMDPs, under which the optimistically optimal value function is defined. By representing a policy explicitly as a finite-state controller, we propose a policy iteration approach that is shown to converge to an -optimal policy under the optimistic optimality criterion.", "paper_title": "Policy iteration for bounded-parameter POMDPs", "paper_id": "WOS:000316334400002"}
