This leads to difficulties in model transformation, analysis, validation, verification and automatic code generation. Currently no general frameworks are available to bridge the concept-code gap rampant in design and development of complex, softwareintensive mechatronic systems called cyber-physical systems. To fill this gap and provide an alternative approach to Object Management Group's UML/SysML/OCL combination, we propose: Bond Graph based Unified Meta-Modeling Framework (BG-UMF). BG-UMF is a practical and viable alternative and uses a novel hybrid approach based on model unification and integration. The focus is on conceptual design and development of executable models for large systems. The viability of the framework is demonstrated through an application scenario: conceptual design and development of a navigation and control system for a rotor-craft UAV. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
