The model is fitted to a database comprising many directly measured walking time series, yielding a random approach to generating their artificial - yet realistic counterparts. This multi-disciplinary modelling strategy offers a radical departure from traditional Fourier-based representations of lateral walking loads towards more reliable and more realistic vibration serviceability assessment of footbridges.
