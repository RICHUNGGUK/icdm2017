It has been widely used in medicinal chemistry for drug discovery. Many QSAR techniques have been developed since Hansch's seminal work, and more are still being developed. Motivated by Hopfinger's receptor-dependent QSAR (RD-QSAR) formalism and the Lukacova-Balaz scheme to treat multimode issues, we have initiated studies that focus on a structure-based multimode QSAR (SBMM QSAR) method, where the structure of the target protein is used in characterizing the ligand, and the multimode issue of ligand binding is systematically treated with a modified Lukacova-Balaz scheme. All ligand molecules are first docked to the target binding pocket to obtain a set of aligned ligand poses. A structure-based pharmacophore concept is adopted to characterize the binding pocket. Specifically, we represent the binding pocket as a geometric grid labeled by pharmacophoric features. Each pose of the ligand is also represented as a labeled grid, where each grid point is labeled according to the atom types of nearby ligand atoms. These labeled grids or three-dimensional (3D) maps (both the receptor map (R-map) and the ligand map (L-map)) are compared to each other to derive descriptors for each pose of the ligand, resulting in a multimode structure-activity relationship (SAR) table. Iterative partial least-squares (PLS) is employed to build the QSAR models. When we applied this method to analyze PDE-4 inhibitors, predictive models have been developed, obtaining models with excellent training correlation (r(2) = 0.65-0.66), as well as test correlation (R(2) = 0.64-0.65). A comparative analysis with 4 other QSAR techniques demonstrates that this new method affords better models, in terms of the prediction power for the test set.", "paper_title": "A Novel Structure-Based Multimode QSAR Method Affords Predictive Models for Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000274626000004"}
