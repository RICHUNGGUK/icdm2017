In doing so, we sacrifice the ability of patterns that wrap onto 3D surfaces to convey shape through their structure and motion. In return, we gain several advantages, chiefly that 2D patterns are more visually abstract - a quality often sought by artists, which explains their widespread use in hand-drawn images. Extending such styles to 3D graphics presents a challenge: how should a 2D pattern move? Our solution is to transform it each frame by a 2D similarity transform that closely follows the underlying 3D shape. The resulting motion is often surprisingly effective, and has a striking cartoon quality that matches the visual style.", "paper_title": "Dynamic 2D patterns for shading 3D scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000248914000023"}
