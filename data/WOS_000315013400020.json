After decomposing the red, green and blue components of the three color images into three grayscale images, recombine them into one color image, then bitwise circularly shift each color pixel for randomly finite number of times. Finally, encrypt the shifted image by three pseudo-random sequences generated by the chaos with dynamical initial conditions, which are generated by the 256-bit long hash value that dependent on the three plain images. Numerical simulation has been performed to test the validity of the scheme, it's suitable for encrypting images in batches. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
