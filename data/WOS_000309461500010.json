Our method starts with resampling an input mesh with a vertex distribution according to a user-defined density function. The initial remeshing result is then progressively optimized by alternatively recovering the Delaunay mesh and moving each vertex to the centroid of its 1-ring neighborhood. The key to making such simple iterations work is an efficient optimization framework that combines both local and global optimization methods. Our method is parameterization-free, thus avoiding the metric distortion introduced by parameterization, and generating more well-shaped triangles. Our method guarantees that the topology of surface is preserved without requiring geodesic information. We conduct various experiments to demonstrate the simplicity, efficacy, and robustness of the presented method.", "paper_title": "Isotropic Surface Remeshing Using Constrained Centroidal Delaunay Mesh", "paper_id": "WOS:000309461500010"}
