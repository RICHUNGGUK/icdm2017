For the MinBC problem, we present two near linear time approximation algorithms to achieve almost optimal solutions, i.e., no more than OPT+2 and OPT+1 respectively, where OPT is the optimal solution. For the OMaxBC problem, we first introduce a deterministic 2-competitive greedy algorithm, and then give lower bounds for any deterministic and randomized (against adaptive offline adversary) online algorithms. The lower bounds show that our deterministic algorithm achieves the best possible competitive ratio.", "paper_title": "Almost optimal solutions for bin coloring problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000256082200002"}
