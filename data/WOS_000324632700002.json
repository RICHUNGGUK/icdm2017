Using nonlinear relative permeability functions for the host fluid and the invading fluid leads to the existence of a shock wave front, and the degree of nonlinearity of the relative permeability functions has an inverse relationship with the size of the shock wave (i.e., difference of saturation between upstream and downstream of the shock wave), whereas for linear relative permeability functions, the shock wave size approaches 0. Injection of a lower-viscosity immiscible phase such as gas or solvent into a water-wet porous medium in the presence of large capillary pressure leads to development of an extended and growing saturation transition zone that follows the discontinuous shock wave front. In this article, a semianalytical solution for the position of equisaturation contours (isosats) in the transition zone in the presence of gravity is obtained for a set of linearized relative permeability functions. The capillary (diffusive) and buoyancy terms are neglected, and the generalized convective equation for mass conservation is obtained. The set of equations is then reduced to a one-dimensional steady-state differential equation through forcing the isosat formulation to obey mass conservation. This scheme allows the isosat distribution to be solved, and the case of injection into an axisymmetric geometry for a confined planar configuration is solved and presented. A finite element model was developed to demonstrate the reasonable agreement between analytical and numerical solutions.", "paper_title": "A solution for the transition zone isosats in two-phase primary drainage in the presence of gravity", "paper_id": "WOS:000324632700002"}
