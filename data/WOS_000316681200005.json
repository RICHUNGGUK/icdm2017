The methods have been investigated in a Wizard-of-Oz approach through two consecutive studies. The first experiment aimed at collecting general opinions toward such a feature as well as preferences in terms of usability. In general, participants preferred methods that resemble already known interaction paradigms, and argued against the need of moving physically. From the comments collected in the first study, six potential indicators of preference were generated and investigated in a second experiment. The results indicate that familiarity, convenience and annoyance are strong predictors of the preference level of methods for transferring video content from a mobile- to a fixed device. A discussion and potential design guidelines are finally proposed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
