Four standardized fetal parameters are measured by the proposed segmentation system: biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference and femur length. Computerized measurements of 215 fetuses are compared with manual measurements in term of fitness analysis and difference analysis. Among 215 cases, computerized measurements of 103 fetuses within 3 days of delivery are utilized in the fetal weight estimation. The EFW based on computerized measurements and manual measurements are compared by using regression analysis, artificial neural network and support vector regression. By using different estimation methods, the computerized measurements decrease the EFW errors about 40-70 g. The lowest mean absolute percentage error of EFW decrease from 6.71% for manual measurements to 4.66% for computerized measurements. The proposed fetal ultrasound image segmentation system can provide more accurate EFW in antepartum examination.", "paper_title": "Fetal ultrasound image segmentation system and its use in fetal weight estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000261181100007"}
