InstanceRank applies a similar solution to that used by PageRank, the web pages ranking algorithm in the Google search engine. We also present ISR, an instance selection technique that uses InstanceRank. This algorithm chooses the most representative instances from a learning database. Experiments show that ISR algorithm, with InstanceRank as ranking criteria, obtains similar results in accuracy to other instance reduction techniques, noticeably reducing the size of the instance set.
