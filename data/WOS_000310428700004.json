Our work deals with the energy-consumption issue in dedicated networks with bandwidth provisioning and in-advance reservations of network equipments for Bulk Data transfers. First, we propose an end-to-end energy-cost model of such networks, which describes the energy consumed by a transfer for all the crossed equipments. This model is then used to develop a complete energy-efficient framework adapted to Bulk Data Transfers over dedicated networks. This framework enables switching unused network portions off during certain periods of time to save energy. This framework is also endowed with prediction algorithms to avoid useless switching off and with adaptive scheduling management to optimize the energy used by the transfers. Through network simulations, we show that, under given load and topology, the proposed framework can achieve 35% energy savings compared to the current approach, with no energy-management system.", "paper_title": "Energy-efficient bandwidth reservation for bulk data transfers in dedicated wired networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310428700004"}
