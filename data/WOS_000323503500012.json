Unfortunately, it is difficult to maintain a distributed model without a shared directory or structured index. In this paper, we propose a fully distributed model for federated RFID data streams. This model combines two techniques, namely, tilted time frame and histogram to represent the patterns of object flows. Our model is efficient in space and can be stored in main memory. The model is built on top of an unstructured P2P overlay. To reduce the overhead of distributed data acquisition, we further propose several algorithms that use a statistically minimum number of network calls to maintain the model. The scalability and efficiency of the proposed model are demonstrated through an extensive set of experiments.", "paper_title": "Modeling Object Flows from Distributed and Federated RFID Data Streams for Efficient Tracking and Tracing", "paper_id": "WOS:000323503500012"}
