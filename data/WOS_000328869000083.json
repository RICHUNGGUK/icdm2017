The approach is based on the determination of 'nearly' universally optimal designs, even in the case where the universally optimal design does not exist. For this purpose, a new optimality criterion which reflects the distance between a given design and an ideal universally optimal design is introduced. A necessary condition for the optimality of a given design is established. Numerical methods for constructing these designs are proposed and applied for the determination of optimal designs in a number of specific instances. The results indicate that the new 'nearly' universally optimal designs have good efficiencies with respect to common optimality criteria. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
