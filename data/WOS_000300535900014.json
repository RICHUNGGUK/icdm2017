WPR computes routes based on link states and, unlike current routing protocols, it uses two algorithms to improve communications in wireless mesh networks taking advantage of traffic concentration on links close to the network gateways. WPR introduces a controlled-flooding algorithm to reduce routing control overhead by considering the network topology similar to a tree. The main goal is to improve overall efficiency by saving network resources and avoiding network bottlenecks. In addition, WPR avoids redundant messages by selecting a subset of one-hop neighbors, the AMPR (Adapted MultiPoint Relay), needed to reach all two-hop ones. We first analyze the proposed algorithms compared with the algorithms used by OLSR for the same tasks in terms of running time, optimality, and number of routing messages. Results show that the algorithms proposed by WPR are more efficient than the algorithms used by OLSR in running time and number of routing messages. In addition, we also perform simulations to evaluate the performance of WPR. Results reveal that the aggregated throughput of WPR outperforms OLSR by up to 27% using a combination of web and backbone internal traffic despite our design assumption of traffic convergence toward gateways.
