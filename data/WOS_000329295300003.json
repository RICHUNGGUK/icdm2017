It is assumed that the conductivity coefficient varies randomly in space according to some given correlation function and is approximated using a truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion. Distinct discretizations of the deterministic and stochastic spaces are required for implementations of the stochastic FEM. In this paper, the deterministic space is discretized using classical finite elements and the stochastic space using a polynomial chaos expansion. The highly structured linear systems which result from this discretization mean that Krylov subspace iterative solvers are extremely effective. The performance of a range of preconditioned iterative methods is investigated and evaluated in terms of robustness with respect to mesh size and variability of the conductivity coefficient. An efficient symmetric block Gauss-Seidel preconditioner is proposed for problems in which the conductivity coefficient has a large standard deviation.The companion paper, herein, referred to as Part 2, considers the situation in which Gaussian random fields are transformed into lognormal ones by projecting the truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion onto a polynomial chaos basis. This results in a stochastic nonlinear problem because the random fields are represented using polynomial chaos containing terms that are generally nonlinear in the random variables.
