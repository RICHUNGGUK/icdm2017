In these networks, fundamental difference between operational methodologies of routing schemes arises due to the requirement of time-critical applications; therefore, there is a need for the design of delay-sensitive techniques. In this paper, Delay-Sensitive Depth-Based Routing (DSDBR), Delay-Sensitive Energy Efficient Depth-Based Routing (DSEEDBR), and Delay-Sensitive Adaptive Mobility of Courier nodes in Threshold-optimized Depth-based routing (DSAMCTD) protocols are proposed to empower the depth-based routing schemes. The performance of the proposed schemes is validated in UASNs. All of the three schemes formulate delay-efficient Priority Factors (PF) and Delay-Sensitive Holding time (DSHT) to minimize end-to-end delay with a small decrease in network throughput. These schemes also employ an optimal weight function (W-F) for the computation of transmission loss and speed of received signal. Furthermore, solution for delay lies in efficient data forwarding, minimal relative transmissions in low-depth region, and better forwarder selection. Simulations are performed to assess the proposed protocols and the results indicate that the three schemes largely minimize end-to-end delay along with improving the transmission loss of network.", "paper_title": "Delay-Sensitive Routing Schemes for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000353793500001"}
