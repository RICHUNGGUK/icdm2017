The proposed method provides a measure field that estimates the probability of each vertex being \"discriminative\" or \"nondiscriminative\" for a given classification task. To illustrate the applicability and generality of our framework; we use the estimated probabilities as feature scoring to define compact signatures for three different classification tasks: 1) 3D Face Recognition, 2) 3D Facial Expression Recognition, and 3) Ethnicity-based Subject Retrieval, obtaining very competitive results. The main contribution of this work lies in the development of a novel framework for feature selection in scenaria in which the most discriminative information is smoothly distributed along a lattice.", "paper_title": "3D Face Discriminant Analysis Using Gauss-Markov Posterior Marginals", "paper_id": "WOS:000314792900016"}
