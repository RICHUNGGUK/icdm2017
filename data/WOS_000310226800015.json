Taking phase diagram as the basic tool for analysis, we find that (i) the solutions of the L (0) regularization using hard thresh-olding algorithm and OMP algorithm are similar to those of the L (1) regularization; (ii) the L (q) regularization with the decreasing value of q, the Log regularization and the SCAD regularization can attain sparser solutions than the L (1) regularization; (iii) the L (1/2) regularization can be taken as a representative of the L (q) (0 < q < 1) regularizations. When 1/2 < q < 1, the L (1/2) regularization always yields the sparsest solutions and when 0 < q < 1/2 the performance of the regularizations takes no significant difference. The results of this paper provide experimental evidence for our previous work.", "paper_title": "The essential ability of sparse reconstruction of different compressive sensing strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000310226800015"}
