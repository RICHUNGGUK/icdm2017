In this paper we present a combined experience of grid application experts and bioinformatics scientists in deploying a pilot service enabling computationally efficient processing and analysis of data stemming from microarray experiments. This pilot service is accessible over the Hellenic portion of the EGEE grid and has been demonstrated in the scope of several public events. We highlight the process of grid application enablement, grid deployment challenges, as well as lessons learnt from a bi-annual effort to port and deploy a MATLAB DNA microarray application on a production grid. In addition to describing the parallelization of the application, we also emphasize on the development of a distributed federated database for storing and post-processing the results of the microarray experiments. Overall we believe that our experience could be proven valuable not only to microarray data scientists but also to other Grid users that intend to Grid-enable and deploy their applications.", "paper_title": "HECTOR: Enabling Microarray Experiments over the Hellenic Grid Infrastructure", "paper_id": "WOS:000272244900009"}
