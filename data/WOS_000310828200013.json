An essential factor is the integration gap between CBIR systems and clinical information systems. The international initiative Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) aims at improving interoperability of medical computer systems. We took into account deficiencies in THE compliance of current picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), and developed an intermediate integration scheme based on the IHE post-processing workflow integration profile (PWF) adapted to CBIR in CAD. The Image Retrieval in Medical Applications (IRMA) framework was used to apply our integration scheme exemplarily, resulting in the application called IRMAcon. The novel IRMAcon scheme provides a generic, convenient and reliable integration of CBIR systems into clinical systems and workflows. Based on the IHE PWF and designed to grow at a pace with the THE compliance of the particular PACS, it provides sustainability and fosters CBIR in CAD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
