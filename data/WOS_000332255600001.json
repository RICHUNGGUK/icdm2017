To solve this problem, it is helpful to balance network load into more nodes and links, so as to reduce network congestion. Multipath routing is a useful tool to reduce congestion, since data flow can be dispersed into multiple paths. However, most of the previous multipath routing algorithm is based on the path disjoint constraint, which leads to the lack of routing paths and the failure to disperse data flow into more links. In this paper, a directed acyclic graph based multipath routing algorithm for congestion minimization (DAGMR) is proposed, where different routing paths are confined in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) under time delay constraint. Furthermore, the data flow distribution is accomplished through partial capacity network to obtain the minimal multipath routing congestion factor. Simulation indicates that our algorithm can obtain lower congestion factor and formulates multipath routing graph with more nodes and links than algorithm with path disjoint constraint. In addition, our algorithm is a polynomial time complexity algorithm with nodes and links number of the entire network.", "paper_title": "DAG Based Multipath Routing Algorithm for Load Balancing in Machine-to-Machine Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000332255600001"}
