We present RUN, an efficient scheduler that reduces the multiprocessor problem to a series of uniprocessor problems. RUN significantly outperforms existing optimal algorithms with an upper bound of O(logm) average preemptions per job on m processors (fewer than 3 per job in all of our simulated task sets) and reduces to Partitioned EDF whenever a proper partitioning is found.", "paper_title": "Multiprocessor scheduling by reduction to uniprocessor: an original optimal approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000319774700003"}
