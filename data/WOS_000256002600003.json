The drag decomposition method decomposes total drag into wave, profile, induced and spurious drag components, the latter resulting from numerical diffusion and errors. The mesh resolution analysis is conducted by the drag decomposition method. The effect of an advanced unstructured mesh scheme of U-MUSCL reconstruction is also investigated by the drag decomposition method. The computational results show that the drag decomposition method reliably predicts drag and is capable of meaningful drag decomposition. The accuracy of drag prediction is increased by eliminating the Spurious drag component from the total drag. It is also confirmed that the physical drag components are almost independent of the mesh resolution and scheme modification.
