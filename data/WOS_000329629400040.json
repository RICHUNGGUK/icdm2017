The main goal is to perform a coverage task when the sensor effectiveness of each agent varies during the mission. It is also assumed that the agents are subject to communication delays induced by communication faults. To improve the overall performance and guarantee the collision avoidance, the guaranteed multiplicatively-weighted Voronoi (GMW-Voronoi) diagram is introduced. A distributed coverage control is then provided to drive agents in such a way that the coverage performance function is minimized over the regions assigned to agents. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by simulations.", "paper_title": "A Distributed Deployment Strategy for Multi-Agent Systems Subject to Health Degradation and Communication Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000329629400040"}
