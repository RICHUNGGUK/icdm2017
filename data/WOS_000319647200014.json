FSI results yield a more accurate representation of pressure loads acting on moving conductors than provided by the pseudo-static pressure calculation based on Bernoulli's equation, which is the current approach used in design. The results based on the proposed method are compared to those obtained using the Bernoulli load model using four natural wind records to perform a nonlinear dynamic analysis of a three-span transmission line section. The quasi-static approach significantly overestimates the conductor motion and the cable tensions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
