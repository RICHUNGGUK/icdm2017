The current system applies Information Retrieval (IR) techniques developed for collections of textual documents to nontextual corpa. SABIO integrates a fuzzy logic-based procedure for IR. Its search algorithm improves the IR efficiency and decreases the computational burden by using a fuzzy logic-based procedure for IR. This procedure is integrated in a flexible and fault-tolerant, human-reasoning-based search algorithm. The Accumulated Knowledge Set (AKS) of the system is sorted in a hierarchic multilevel tree-structure-like ontology. The objects in the AKS are represented using a novel human-reasoning-based-method. This representation takes into account the occurrence of related terms. The system uses a novel fuzzy logic-based term-weighting (TW) method. The developed fuzzy logic method improves the classical term frequencyinverse document frequency (TF/IDF) method, generally used for TW. The abovementioned system is the core of a wizard for search into the website of the University of Seville, www.us.es, which is currently in testing.", "paper_title": "SABIO: SOFT AGENT FOR EXTENDED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000317294700001"}
