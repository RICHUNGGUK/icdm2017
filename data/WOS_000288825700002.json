Moreover, the equivalences induced by those preorders do not have a finite (in)equational axiomatization either. These results are in contrast with a claim of finite axiomatizability for those semantics in the literature, which was based on the erroneous assumption that they coincide with complete trace semantics in the presence of a singleton set of actions.
