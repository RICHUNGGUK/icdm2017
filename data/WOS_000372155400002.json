By integrating heterogeneous information from various sensing data, the smart environment-aware pet care system can adaptively adjust the setting of temperature and humidity that best fits the pet through iterative slow intelligence computation. Simulations of two case studies were provided to illustrate the application of the proposed system for pets such as snakes and dogs. The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach to the design of smart pet care systems.", "paper_title": "Application of Slow Intelligence Framework for Smart Pet Care System Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000372155400002"}
