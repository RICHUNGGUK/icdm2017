This paper presents a fuzzy-timing Petri net model for updating a MOD and a method for estimating the time needed to update its database using the concept of the minimum cycle time of a Petri net. It is expected that the results of this paper are useful to study moving object system design issues, such as the trade-off between update cost and information accuracy, and how often the database can be updated, given the number of moving objects, moving object system resources, delays of various operations for updating MOD, etc.", "paper_title": "Petri-net model and minimum cycle time for updating a moving objects database", "paper_id": "WOS:000239029900005"}
