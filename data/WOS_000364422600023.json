In this paper, we focus on controlling the simulation of cumuliform cloud formation. Using a previously proposed method for controlling cloud simulation the convergence speed is very slow; therefore, it takes a long time before the clouds form the desired shapes. We improved the method and accelerated the convergence by introducing a new mechanism for controlling the amount of water vapor added. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by several examples.", "paper_title": "Controlling the Simulation of Cumuliform Clouds Based on Fluid Dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000364422600023"}
