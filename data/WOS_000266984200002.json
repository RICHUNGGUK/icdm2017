To solve the mismatch between them, utilization of available capacity can be maximized to provide \"best-fit\" service for emerging applications (e.g., eBanking, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file exchanges, etc.). To satisfy such a requirement, we propose a three-dimensional label scheduling algorithm (TD-LSA), which is a distributed scheduling approach powered by central databases. In the proposal, all connections are provisioned in three dimensions (i.e., space, time and wavelength) in a distributed way and uniquely identified by three-dimensional labels. And in this way a three-dimensional connection is more robust than a single-dimensional connection because the three-dimensional approach can avoid potential scheduling conflicts as much as possible by using central databases in a network. Thus, the central databases can reduce bandwidth consumption and offer \"best-fit\" service for three-dimensional connections. Furthermore, in order to further reduce bandwidth consumption and to match with a priority of traffic, K-least hop first path (K-LHPF) and a rescheduling mechanism are applied to our proposal. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposal achieves the expected performance gain against existing alternates.", "paper_title": "A novel distributed scheduling approach powered by central databases in optical burst networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000266984200002"}
