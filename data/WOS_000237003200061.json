Hence, for grids to become commonly accepted, also as general-purpose parallel computation platforms, Suitable parallel programming environments need to be developed. In this paper we propose an approach to realize a distributed shared memory programming environment for computational grids called GridNestStep, by adopting NestStep, a structured parallel programming language based on the Bulk Synchronous Parallel model of parallel computation.", "paper_title": "Towards a bulk-synchronous distributed shared memory programming environment for grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000237003200061"}
