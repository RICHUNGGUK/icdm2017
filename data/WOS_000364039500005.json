This problem is known to be equivalent to bounding the length of an order-s Davenport-Schinzel sequence, namely, a sequence over an n-letter alphabet that avoids alternating subsequences of the form a...b...a...b... with length s+2. These sequences were introduced by Davenport and Schinzel in 1965 to model a certain problem in differential equations and have since been applied to bound the running times of geometric algorithms, data structures, and the combinatorial complexity of geometric arrangements. Let lambda(s)(n) be the maximum length of an order-s DS sequence over n letters. What is lambda(s) asymptotically? This question has been answered satisfactorily [Hart and Sharir 1986; Agarwal et al. 1989; Klazar 1999; Nivasch 2010], when s is even or s <= 3. However, since the work of Agarwal et al. in the mid-1980s, there has been a persistent gap in our understanding of the odd orders. In this work, we effectively close the problem by establishing sharp bounds on Davenport-Schinzel sequences of every order s. Our results reveal that, contrary to one's intuition, lambda(s)(n) behaves essentially like lambda(s-1)(n) when s is odd. This refutes conjectures by Alon et al.
