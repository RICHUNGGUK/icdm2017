In this paper the Jacobian condition number is used as a performance index intended to make a better use of revolute-jointed six-degree-of-freedom serial robots in five-axis machining. This index is of the kinetostatic type, low-frequency dynamic effects not being relevant to this study. Indeed, dynamic effects can be neglected because, during machining, the robot is not working at high speed, the spindle motion affecting only the structural, high-frequency modes of the system. The condition number is known to be a measure of Jacobian invertibility: it is used here as an index to improve joint-rate distribution. A low condition number is shown to translate into a smoother joint-rate time history. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
