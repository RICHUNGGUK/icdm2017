A framework that uses adaptive learning and functional representation to construct the restricted candidate list (RCL) within a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) is put forward. An implementation of restricted regions that forbids new facilities to be located too close to the previously found facilities is also embedded into the search to build up the RCL more efficiently. The performance of this GRASP based approach is tested on three classes of instances with constant and variable capacities. Very competitive results are obtained when compared to the best known results from the literature. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
