Accordingly, in this work we focus on the design of an effective and scalable routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) framework supporting advance reservation services in wavelength-routed WDM networks crossing multiple administrative domains. Our approach is motivated by the observation that traffic in large optical networks spanning several domains is not controlled by a central authority but rather by a large number of independent entities interacting in a distributed manner and aiming at maximizing their own welfare. Due to the selfish strategic behavior of the involved entities, non-cooperative game theory plays an important role in driving our approach. Here the dominant solution concept is the notion of Nash equilibria, which are states of a system in which no participant can gain by deviating unilaterally its strategy. On this concept, we developed a selfish adaptive RWA model supporting advance reservation in large-scale optical wavelength-routed networks and developed a distributed algorithm to compute approximate equilibria in computationally feasible times. We showed how and under which conditions such approach can give rise to a stable state with satisfactory solutions and analyzed its performance and convergence features. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
