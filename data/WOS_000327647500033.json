To overcome the difficulty caused by the partial differential term, a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is proposed, and a partial differential equation technique together with a linear operator approach are also applied to obtain the delay-dependent stability criteria, which are less conservative than the existing results. Finally, simulation examples are given to verify and illustrate the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Delay-Dependent Stability Criteria for Reaction-Diffusion Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000327647500033"}
