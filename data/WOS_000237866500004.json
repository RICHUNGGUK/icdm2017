First, a granulometry is defined from the morphological opening of the texture using a convex and compact subset containing the origin as SE. Then, some usual distributional descriptors (mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis) of the granulometric size distribution are used as texture features. The main point of the paper is the choice of a good SE from the point of view of texture classification. A methodology is explained and software has been developed that helps in such a choice, for any given criterion for the quality of the classification.", "paper_title": "Selecting the structuring element for morphological texture classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000237866500004"}
