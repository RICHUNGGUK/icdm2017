The formed cellular cluster structure can balance the energy consumption, optimize the coverage area of clusters, and improve the operation efficiency. The experimental results show that CHCT can perform with higher efficiency in large-scale network deployment by comparison with the existing hierarchy.", "paper_title": "A clustering hierarchy based on cellular topology for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000277952300006"}
