The performance anomaly of Internetware services not only affects user experience, but also causes severe economic loss to service providers. Diagnosing performance anomalies has become one of the keys to improving the quality of service (QoS) of Internetware. Existing approaches create a system model to predict performance. Then, the prediction from the model is compared with the observation; a significant deviation may signal the occurrence of a performance anomaly. However, these approaches require domain knowledge and parameterization efforts. Moreover, dynamic workloads affect the accuracy of performance prediction. To address these issues, we propose a correlation analysis based approach to detecting the performance anomaly for Internetware. We use kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) to model the correlation between workloads and performance based on monitoring data. Furthermore, we detect anomalous correlation coefficients by XmR control charts, which detect the anomalous coefficient and trend without a priori knowledge. Finally, we adopt a feature selection method (Relief) to locate the anomalous metrics. We evaluated our approach on a testbed running the TPC-W industry-standard benchmark. The experimental results show that our approach is able to capture the performance anomaly, and locate the metrics relating to the cause of anomaly.", "paper_title": "Detecting performance anomaly with correlation analysis for Internetware", "paper_id": "WOS:000323665900005"}
