The user only needs to draw a one-dimensional skeleton and to specify key balls at the skeletal nodes. The system then automatically generates a quad dominant initial mesh. Further subdivision and evolution are performed to refine the initial mesh and generate a quad mesh which has good edge flow along the skeleton directions. The user can also modify and manipulate the shape by editing the skeleton and the key balls and can easily compose new shapes by cutting and pasting existing models in our system. The mesh models generated in our system greatly benefit the sculpting operators for sculpting modeling and skeleton-based animation.", "paper_title": "B-Mesh: A Modeling System for Base Meshes of 3D Articulated Shapes", "paper_id": "WOS:000283159400019"}
