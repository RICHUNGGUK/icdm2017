This class of channels includes MACs with/without common messages or with partially cooperating encoders. A construction method of code ensembles based on coset codes is proposed for these channels. Assuming joint maximum likelihood decoding, the performance of the proposed code ensemble is analyzed by deriving a lower bound on error exponents. A condition assuring that codes achieve the capacity region on average is given. It is seen that an elaborate combination of good linear codes gives capacity achieving codes for compound MACs with common messages or with partially cooperating encoders. The use of restricted ensembles with low-density parity check (LDPC) codes as component codes is also discussed. It is shown that a coset code ensemble based on nonbinary regular LDPC codes approaches the random coding exponent, and thus is capacity-achieving.", "paper_title": "Coset Codes for Compound Multiple Access Channels With Common Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000291003900020"}
