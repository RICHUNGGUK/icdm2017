Due to these superconvergence properties, DG and LDG methods have been known to provide good wave resolution properties, especially for long time integrations (Zhong and Shu, 2011) [26]. In this paper, under the assumption of uniform mesh and via Fourier approach, we observe that the error of the DG or LDG solution can be decomposed into three parts: (1) dissipation and dispersion errors of the physically relevant eigenvalue; this part of error will grow linearly in time and is of order: 2k + 1 for DG method and 2k + 2 for LDG method (2) projection error: there exists a special projection of the exact solution such that the numerical solution is much closer to this special projection than the exact solution itself; this part of error will not grow in time (3) the dissipation of non-physically relevant eigenvectors; this part of error will be damped exponentially fast with respect to the spatial mesh size Delta x. Along this line, we analyze the error for a fully discrete Runge-Kutta (RK) DG scheme. A collection of numerical examples for linear equations are presented to verify our observations above. We also provide numerical examples based on non-uniform mesh, nonlinear Burgers' equation, and high-dimensional Maxwell equations to explore superconvergence properties of DG methods in a more general setting.
