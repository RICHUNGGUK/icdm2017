Coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing technology is investigated for achieving the desired narrow channel spacings while minimizing the impact on the performance of legacy equipment. A practical implementation is evaluated using simulations. Within the analyzed configurations, a trade-off is found between time-division multiplexed (TDM)-PON and RAN performance. The optimum balance is found for additional losses in the TDM-PON path of less than 1 dB, ensuring simultaneous service to a maximum of 145 metro cells together with the PON customers and within a reach of 24 km.", "paper_title": "Decomposed Radio Access Network Over Deployed Passive Optical Networks Using Coherent Optical OFDM Transceivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000317959600010"}
