We propose a wireless 3D on-chip-network architecture for application-specific SoC design, using inductive-coupling interconnect instead of TSV for inter-layer communication. Primary design challenge of inductive-coupling 3D SoC is allocating wireless links in the 3D on-chip network effectively. We develop a design flow fully exploiting the design space brought by wireless links while providing flexible tradeoff for user's choice. Experimental results show that our design brings great improvement over uniform design and Sunfloor algorithm on latency (5% to 20%) and power consumption (10% to 45%).", "paper_title": "An Inductive-Coupling Interconnected Application-Specific 3D NoC Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000329006900038"}
