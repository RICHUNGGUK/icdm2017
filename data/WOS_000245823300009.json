It is based on the use of one of the most recent rneshless methods, the so-called natural element method. Free-surface tracking is performed by employing a particular instance of \"shape constructors\" called alpha-shapes. This means that at each time step the geometry of the domain is extracted by employing a particular member of the finite set of shapes described by the nodal cloud. The Lagrangian framework allows us to integrate the inertial terms of the Navier-Stokes equations by employing the method of characteristics which are, precisely, the nodal pathlines. A theoretical description of the method is included together with some examples showing its performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
