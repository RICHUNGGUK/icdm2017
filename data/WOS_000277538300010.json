Design/methodology/approach - The proposed approach is based on given statistics for the mathematical expectation of the spectral norm of the normalized innovation matrix of the Kalman filter. Findings - The longitudinal dynamics of an aircraft as an example is considered, and detection of various sensor faults affecting the mean and variance of the innovation sequence is examined. Research limitations/implications - A real-time detection of sensor faults affecting the mean and variance of the innovation sequence, applied to the linearized aircraft longitudinal dynamics, is examined. The non-linear longitudinal dynamics model of an aircraft is linearized. Faults affecting the covariances of the innovation sequence are not considered in the paper. Originality/value - The proposed approach permits simultaneous real-time checking of the expected value and the variance of the innovation sequence and does not need a priori information about statistical characteristics of this sequence in the failure case.", "paper_title": "Innovation approach to detect the faults in multidimensional dynamic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000277538300010"}
