Trust management plays an important role in IoT for reliable data fusion and mining, qualified services with context-awareness, and enhanced user privacy and information security. It helps people overcome perceptions of uncertainty and risk and engages in user acceptance and consumption on IoT services and applications. However, current literature still lacks a comprehensive study on trust management in IoT. In this paper, we investigate the properties of trust, propose objectives of IoT trust management, and provide a survey on the current literature advances towards trustworthy IoT. Furthermore, we discuss unsolved issues, specify research challenges and indicate future research trends by proposing a research model for holistic trust management in IoT. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
