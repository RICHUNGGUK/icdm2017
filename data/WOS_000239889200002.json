A transversal is a set of n entries, one selected from each row and each column of a Latin Square of order n such that no two entries contain the same symbol. Define T(n) to be the maximum number of transversals over all Latin squares of order n. We show that b(n)<= T(n)<= c(n)root n n! for n >= 5, where b approximate to 1.719 and c approximate to 0.614. A corollary of this result is an upper bound on the number of placements of n non-attacking queens on an n x n toroidal chess board. Some divisibility properties of the number of transversals in Latin squares based on finite groups are established. We also provide data from a computer enumeration of transversals in all Latin Squares of order at most 9, all groups of order at most 23 and all possible turn-squares of order 14.", "paper_title": "The number of transversals in a Latin square", "paper_id": "WOS:000239889200002"}
