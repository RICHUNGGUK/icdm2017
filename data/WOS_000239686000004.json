These architectures use an online algorithm to make run-time reconfiguration decisions that continually adapt the underlying architecture to match the application's current computational demand. Online architectures have several potential advantages, including better resource utilization (reduced cost), faster execution, and reduced (static) power consumption. However, to realize these benefits, online architectures must balance the overhead (reconfiguration, profiling, and decision costs) against expected gains of reconfiguration. In this article, the basic foundation of online architecture is formulated, core challenges enumerated, and results reported based on a simple prototype and trace-driven simulations. These results suggest that the overhead is manageable and that a more comprehensive investigation is worthwhile. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
