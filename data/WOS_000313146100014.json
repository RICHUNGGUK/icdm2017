In this paper, a pseudo power gating (SPG) structure using a normal logic cell is proposed to extend the power gating to an ultrafine grained region at the gate level. In the proposed method, the controlling value of a logic element is used to control the switching activity of modules computing other inputs of the element. For each element, there exists a submodule controlled by an input to the element. Power reduction is maximized by controlling the order of the submodule selection. A basic algorithm and a switching activity first algorithm have been developed to optimize the power. In this application, a steady maximum depth constraint is added to prevent the depth increase caused by the insertion of the control signal. In this work, various factors affecting the power consumption of library level circuits with the SPG are determined. In such factors, the occurrence of glitches increases the power consumption and a method to reduce the occurrence of glitches is proposed by considering the parity of inverters. The proposed SPG method was evaluated through the simulation of the netlist extracted from the layout using the VDEC Rohm 0.18 mu m process. Experiments on ISCAS'85 benchmarks show that the reduction in total power consumption achieved is 13% on average with a 2.5% circuit delay degradation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method under different primary input statistics is considered.", "paper_title": "On Gate Level Power Optimization of Combinational Circuits Using Pseudo Power Gating", "paper_id": "WOS:000313146100014"}
