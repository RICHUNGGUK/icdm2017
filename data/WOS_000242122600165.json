Most of the methods that predict side chain conformations use statistically generated data from known protein structures. It is a computationally intractable problem to search suitable side chains from all possible rotamers simultaneously using information of known protein structures. Reducing the number of possibility is a main issue to predict side chain conformation. This paper proposes an enumeration based similarity search algorithm to predict side chain conformations. By introducing \"beam search\" technique, a significant number of unrelated side chain rotamers can easily be eliminated. As a result, we can search for suitable residue side chains from all possible side chain conformations.", "paper_title": "A similarity search algorithm to predict protein structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600165"}
