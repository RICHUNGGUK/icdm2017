The diffusion of RGB-D sensors seems to provide an effective solution to such a problem. Nevertheless, the interaction with stereoscopic 3D environments, in particular in peripersonal space, requires a higher degree of precision. To this end, a reliable calibration of such sensors and an accurate estimation of the relative pose of different RGB-D and visualization devices are crucial. Here, robust and straightforward procedures to calibrate a RGB-D camera, to improve the accuracy of its 3D measurements, and to co-register different calibrated devices are proposed. Quantitative measures validate the proposed approach. Moreover, calibrated devices have been used in an augmented reality system, based on a dynamic stereoscopic rendering technique that needs accurate information about the observer's eyes position.
