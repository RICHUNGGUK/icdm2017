Software tools that bring together data on pollutant sources, their respective contributions to atmospheric concerti rations and human exposure. together with information on potential technological and other measures that may be used to reduce concentrations and their economic costs, can be used to identify cost-effective strategies for improving air quality, and hence aid policy development. The Urban Scale Integrated Assessment Model (USIAM) has been developed in this context, illustrated in this paper by application to traffic emissions which are a major contributor to exceedance of air quality objectives for fine particulate matter, PM10, in London. In such a multidisciplinary approach the aim has been to provide a tool for rapid assessment of a wide range of scenarios to identify those that are most cost effective, maintaining a balance between the level of sophistication in the model and the uncertainties and assumptions involved.
