We derive temporal logic properties which address specific behavioural questions, such as the likelihood for a species to reach a peak/deadlock state, or to exhibit monotonic/oscillatory trends. We introduce a specific modelling convention through which stochastic models of biochemical systems are made suitable to verification of the behavioural queries we define. Based on the queries we identify, we define a classification procedure which, given a stochastic model, allows for identifying meaningful qualitative behavioural trends. We illustrate the proposed query-based classification on a number of simple abstract models of biochemical systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
