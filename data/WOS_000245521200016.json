We analyze all possible singular cases of the G(1) condition that is to be met by the curve network interpolation and propose a new G(1) continuity condition using linear and quartic scalar weight functions. Using this condition, a curve network can be interpolated without modification at 4-valent nodes with two collinear tangent vectors, even in the presence of singularities. We demonstrate our approach by generating G(1) surfaces over the curve network which includes singularities at its node vertices and edges.", "paper_title": "Analysis and avoidance of singularities for local G(1) surface interpolation of Bezier curve network with 4-valent nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000245521200016"}
