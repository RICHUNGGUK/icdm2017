We show that there is no hope of finding a rho-approximation with rho < 1 + 1/(c + 4) for minimization of the makespan (resp. 1 + 1/(2c+5) for total job completion time minimization) (unless P = NP) for the case where all the tasks of the precedence graph have unit execution times, where the multiprocessor is composed of an unrestricted number of machines, and where c denotes the communication delay between two tasks i and j submitted to a precedence constraint and to be processed by two different machines. The problem becomes polynomial whenever the makespan is at most (c + 1). The (c + 2) case is still partially open. Moreover, we both define and study a new scheduling approximation to schedule unitary tasks in the presence of large communication delays. We provide a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with performance ratio 2(c+1)/3 with c >= 2. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
