Applying ideas from anisotropic regularization and diffusion, our models can better handle degraded pixels at edges. We interpret our algorithms within the framework of forward-backward splitting methods in convex analysis and prove that the conditions for ensuring their convergence are fulfilled. Numerical examples illustrate the good performance of our algorithms.", "paper_title": "Inpainting by Flexible Haar-Wavelet Shrinkage", "paper_id": "WOS:000207567500004"}
