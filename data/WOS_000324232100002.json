The objective is to find a closed walk with maximum benefit. We propose an IP formulation for the undirected MBCPP and, based on the description of its associated polyhedron, we propose a branch-and-cut algorithm and present computational results on instances with up to 1,000 vertices and 3,000 edges.", "paper_title": "A branch-and-cut algorithm for the maximum benefit Chinese postman problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000324232100002"}
