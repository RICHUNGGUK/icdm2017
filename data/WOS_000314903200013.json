In this article, we are focused on agent-based interactive systems. We first describe the agent oriented architecture used in our researches. Then we propose an evaluation approach based on three complementary techniques: assistance evaluation tool, questionnaire, and verbalization. The validation of our approach occurred within the framework of a project involving an industrial partner which is running the current urban transport network (tramway and bus) in the town of Valenciennes, France. The main results of the evaluation of an agent-based Information Assistance System (IAS) are presented. This evaluation is based on two scenarios: normal or distrupted running mode. This evaluation has been conducted in laboratory.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of an Information Assistance System Based on an Agent-based Architecture in Transportation Domain: First Results", "paper_id": "WOS:000314903200013"}
