Display fineness of an LCD panel depends on a performance metric, ratio of pixel voltage to video voltage (RPV). However, there are several other important metrics, such as area, and the best circuit cannot be decided uniquely. This paper proposes a design automation technique for a LCD column driver to provide several circuit design results with different performance so that designers can select an appropriate design among them. The proposed technique is evaluated with an actual design data, and experimental results show that the proposed method successfully performs technology migration by transistor sizing: Also, the proposed technique is experimentally verified from points of solution quality and computational time.", "paper_title": "Transistor sizing of LCD driver circuit for technology migration", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020700009"}
