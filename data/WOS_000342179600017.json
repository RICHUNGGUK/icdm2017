A novel scheme of geographical load balancing was proposed to reduce electricity bills for service providers. However, one important challenge faced by service providers has not been considered properly. In service systems, the service delay faced by consumers includes the queuing delay and the transmission delay. While existing work only consider the queuing delay, the transmission delay introduced by geographical load balancing has been overlooked. It is one of the most important factors affecting the quality of service for real-time service systems. In this paper, we take the transmission delay into our design consideration and formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with coupled constraint to achieve the optimal load balancing and energy cost management for IDCs while meeting the service-level agreements (SLA) of consumers. A novel heuristic based branch and bound with feedback (HBBF) algorithm is proposed to decouple the MINLP problem with coupled constraint efficiently. Extensive performance evaluations based on real electricity price data and site-to-site transmission delay data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Optimal Load Balancing and Energy Cost Management for Internet Data Centers in Deregulated Electricity Markets", "paper_id": "WOS:000342179600017"}
