By the \"virtual extension\", we can embed these codes into homogeneous interleaved Reed-Solomon codes. Based on this property and the collaborative decoding algorithm, a new probabilistic decoding algorithm that can correct errors up to m/m+1 (n-k) for these codes is proposed. We show that whether the new decoding algorithm fails or not is only dependent on the error. We also give an upper bound on the failure probability of the new decoding algorithm for the case s = 2. The new decoding algorithm has some advantages over some known decoding algorithms.", "paper_title": "Unique Decoding of Certain Reed-Solomon Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000367096000047"}
