GonadSAGE is the first publicly available web-based SAGE database on male gonad development that covers six male mouse embryonic gonad stages, including E10.5, E11.5, E12.5, E13.5, E15.5 and E17.5. The sequence coverage of each SAGE library is beyond 150K, 'which is the most extensive sequence-based male gonadal transcriptome to date'. An interactive web interface with customizable parameters is provided for analyzing male gonad transcriptome information. Furthermore, the data can be visualized and analyzed with the other genomic features in the UCSC genome browser. It represents an integrated platform that leads to a better understanding of male gonad development, and allows discovery of related novel targets and regulatory pathways.", "paper_title": "GonadSAGE: a comprehensive SAGE database for transcript discovery on male embryonic gonad development", "paper_id": "WOS:000274484300025"}
