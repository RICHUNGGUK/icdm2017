For production facilities that link substantially different scales, such as biofuel production facilities that connect large numbers of small bioreactors to large scale processing equipment, the ramp-up to full production may be a significant consideration in the decision on facility scale. This paper presents a modified discounted cash flow method incorporating production growth during start-up, to determine the optimal production scale of systems that may operate at less than full capacity for a substantial period of time. For a case study of ethanol produced by blue-green algae, global sensitivity analysis using Sobols method indicates how exogenous and endogenous variables, including the ramp-up rate, affect the optimal scale and financial viability of the production system. Conditional-value-at-risk minimization shows how the optimal decision depends on the risk inclination of the decision-maker; a risk-neutral decision maker would choose a basic optimal production scale of 59 million liters (ML) of ethanol per year, while a risk-averse decision-maker might prefer to choose a capacity 30% less.
