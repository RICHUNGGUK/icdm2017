However, in most realistic situations, machines may be unavailable due to maintenances, pre-schedules and so on. In this paper, we study the flexible job shop scheduling problem with availability constraints. The availability constraints are non-fixed in that the completion time of the maintenance tasks is not fixed and has to be determined during the scheduling procedure. We then propose a hybrid genetic algorithm to solve the flexible job shop scheduling problem with non-fixed availability constraints (fJSP-nfa). The genetic algorithm uses an innovative representation method and applies genetic operations in phenotype space in order to enhance the inheritability. We also define two kinds of neighbourhood for the problem based on the concept of critical path. A local search procedure is then integrated under the framework of the genetic algorithm. Representative flexible job shop scheduling benchmark problems and fJSP-nfa problems are solved in order to test the effectiveness and efficiency of the suggested methodology.", "paper_title": "Scheduling jobs and maintenances in flexible job shop with a hybrid genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000240935400011"}
