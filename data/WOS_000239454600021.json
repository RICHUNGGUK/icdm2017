In this paper, we consider the inverse bottleneck optimization problems with bound constraints on modification under weighted l(1) norm, weighted sum-Hamming distance and weighted bottleneck-Hamming distance. That is, given a feasible solution F*, we aim to modify the cost function under some measure such that F* becomes an optimal solution to the bottleneck optimization problem. We show that the inverse problem under weighted 11 norm and weighted sum-Hamming distance can be reduced to O(m) minimum cut problems, while the inverse problem under weighted bottleneck-Hamming distance can be reduced to O(log m) cut feasibility problems, where m = vertical bar E vertical bar.", "paper_title": "Inverse bottleneck optimization problems on networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454600021"}
