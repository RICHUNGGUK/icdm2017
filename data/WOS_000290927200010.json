This allowed to extract chemical information during the induction period. The substituted diphenylamines are progressively converted to a degraded form which can be followed with the chemometric analysis. When concentration of dinonyldiphenylamine is too low, the induction period ends and the oxidation of the base oils begins. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
