A sparse sequence of prescribed poses is used to guide the motion, and some of these can also be specified to be precision poses through which the motion must pass. The resultant motion is given in a sequence of refined poses. Geometric algebra is used to specify these in a way that is analogous to the use of complex numbers in an equivalent approach for free-form curves. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
