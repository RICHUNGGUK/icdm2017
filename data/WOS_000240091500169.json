The algorithm is formulated by modifying the FFCM algorithm to incorporate a gain field, which compensate for such inhomogeneities. In each iteration, we allow the gain field transforming to a gain field image and filter it using an iterative low-pass filter, and then revert the gain field image to gain field term again for the next iteration. We also use c-means algorithm initializing the centroids to further accelerate our algorithm. Our method reduces lots of executive time and will obtain a high-quality result. The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated on different magnetic resonance images.", "paper_title": "Gain field correction fast fuzzy c-means algorithm for segmenting magnetic resonance images", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500169"}
