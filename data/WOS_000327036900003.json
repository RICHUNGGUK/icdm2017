A subset I of P is called an island if there exists a convex set C such that I = P boolean AND C. In this paper we define the generalized island Johnson graph of P as the graph whose vertex consists of all islands of P of cardinality k, two of which are adjacent if their intersection consists of exactly l elements. We show that for large enough values of n, this graph is connected, and give upper and lower bounds on its diameter.", "paper_title": "On the Connectedness and Diameter of a Geometric Johnson Graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000327036900003"}
