It is shown that the Euclidean I-center of the clients may move with arbitrarily high velocity relative to the maximum client velocity. This motivates the search for strategies for moving a facility so as to closely approximate the Euclidean I-center while guaranteeing low (relative) velocity. We present lower bounds and efficient competitive algorithms for the exact and approximate maintenance of the Euclidean 1-center for a set of moving points in the plane. These results serve to accurately quantify the intrinsic velocity approximation quality tradeoff associated with the maintenance of the mobile Euclidean 1-center.", "paper_title": "Competitive algorithms for maintaining a mobile center", "paper_id": "WOS:000237835400006"}
