In this paper we focus on cloud application platforms offering their customers a range of generic built-in re-usable services. By identifying key characteristics of these complex dynamic systems, we compare cloud application platforms to distributed sensor networks, and investigate the viability of exploiting these similarities with a case study. We treat cloud data storage services as \"virtual\" sensors constantly emitting monitoring data, such as numbers of connections and storage space availability, which are then analysed by the central component of a monitoring framework so as to detect and react to SLA violations. We discuss the potential benefits, as well as some shortcomings, of adopting this approach.", "paper_title": "Towards a framework for monitoring cloud application platforms as sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345077400008"}
