The spatial approximation is based on the multipoint flux mixed finite element method, which reduces to an efficient cell-centered pressure system on general grids, including triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedra, and hexahedra. The time integration is performed by using a domain decomposition time-splitting technique combined with multiterm fractional step diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta methods. The resulting scheme is unconditionally stable and computationally efficient, as it reduces the global system to a collection of uncoupled subdomain problems that can be solved in parallel without the need for Schwarz-type iteration. Convergence analysis for both the semidiscrete and fully discrete schemes is presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
