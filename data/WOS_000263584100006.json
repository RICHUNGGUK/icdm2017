How to represent content in a specific user interface in a polite manner to users is crucial. Moreover, polite interfaces highly depend on the user's context such as personal profile, time, location and persons nearby. The aim of this paper is to propose a methodology of a context-aware polite interface. We adopted case-based reasoning with a nested Minkowski aggregation method to establish a measurement of politeness level focusing on Korean language. To demonstrate the feasibility of the method proposed in this paper, we developed a prototype system and performed an experiment using scripts. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
