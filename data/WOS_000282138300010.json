Simulational results via Iris, Glass, Vowel and Wine benchmark data sets indicate that the proposed evolutionary-based clustering algorithm is more accurate than the GA-based and PSOA-based clustering algorithms. In addition, the model evaluation results which use order information provided by an international industrial personal computer (PC) manufacturer show that the proposed algorithm is also superior to GA-based and PSOA-based clustering algorithms. Through order clustering, scheduling orders that belong to the same cluster together can reduce production time as well as machine idle time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
