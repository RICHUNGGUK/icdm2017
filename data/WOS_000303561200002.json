However, these methods do not allow 3D analysis in standing position. The aim of this study is to propose a fast and accurate 3D-reconstruction-method based on parametric models and statistical inferences from biplanar X-rays with clinical measurements' (CM) assessment in standing position for a clinical routine use. For the reproducibility study, the 95% CI was under 2.7 degrees for all lower limbs' angular measurements except for tibial torsion, femoral torsion and tibiofemoral rotation (< 5 degrees). The 95% CI were under 2.5mm for lower limbs' lengths and 1.5 to 3 degrees for the pelvis' CM. Comparisons between X-rays and CT-scan based 3D shapes in vitro showed mean differences of 1.0mm (95% CI 2.4 mm). Comparisons of 2D lower limbs' and 3D pelvis' CM between standing 'Shifted-Feet' and 'Non-Shifted-Feet' position showed means differences of 0.0 to 1.4 degrees. Significant differences were found only for pelvic obliquity and rotation. The reconstruction time was about 5 min.", "paper_title": "Fast 3D reconstruction of the lower limb using a parametric model and statistical inferences and clinical measurements calculation from biplanar X-rays", "paper_id": "WOS:000303561200002"}
