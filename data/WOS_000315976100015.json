First, a proposed optimization realizing a novel approach to topology control based a power-adaptation scheme is presented. According to the density of deployed nodes and an expected connection degree of nodes, an optimal transmission range of nodes are derived. Afterward, the transmission power is adapted to the minimum strength but sufficient to guarantee node degrees. Besides, the relationship between node distributions and reachability is studied and the proposal is applied on a hierarchical network composed of node clusters to manage transmission ranges of nodes in a cluster. The simulation results verify the performance of the proposed approach in cases of Uniform-distribution, Poisson-distribution and Exponential-distribution node deployments. Numeric results show that the proposed approach is reliable and stable. Additionally, the simulation results suggest various deployment strategies corresponding to node", "paper_title": "A Study of Adaptive Transmission Approach to Guarantee Connection Degree in Various Node Location Distributions for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000315976100015"}
