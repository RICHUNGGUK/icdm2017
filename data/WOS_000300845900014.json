In this paper, we introduce an efficient soft-input soft-output tree detection algorithm that employs a new type of look-ahead path metric in the process of branch pruning (or sorting). While conventional path metrics depend only on symbols on a visited path, the new path metric accounts for unvisited parts of the tree in advance through an unconstrained linear estimator and adds a bias term that reflects the contribution of as-yet undecided symbols. By applying the linear estimate-based look-ahead path metric to an M-algorithm that selects the best M paths for each level of the tree, we develop a new soft-input soft-output tree detector, called an improved soft-input soft-output M-algorithm (ISS-MA). Based on an analysis of the probability of correct path loss, we show that the improved path metric offers substantial performance gain over the conventional path metric. We also demonstrate through simulations that the proposed ISS-MA can be a promising candidate for soft-input soft-output detection in high-dimensional systems.", "paper_title": "Efficient Soft-Input Soft-Output Tree Detection via an Improved Path Metric", "paper_id": "WOS:000300845900014"}
