Among their advantages is included their low cost and their broad applicability. However, they also present a number of inherent vulnerabilities. This paper develops a structural methodology for risks that RFID networks face by developing a classification of RFID attacks, presenting their important features, and discussing possible countermeasures. The goal of the paper is to categorize the existing weaknesses of RFID communication so that a better understanding of RFID attacks can be achieved and subsequently more efficient and effective algorithms, techniques and procedures to combat these attacks may be developed.", "paper_title": "Classifying RFID attacks and defenses", "paper_id": "WOS:000284428000003"}
