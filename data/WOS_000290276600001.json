We argue that this question is certainly difficult. Answering it negatively would indeed imply that the constant-free versions of the algebraic complexity classes VP and VNP defined by Valiant are different. Answering this question positively would imply a transfer theorem from boolean to algebraic complexity. Our proof method relies on Lagrange interpolation and on recent results connecting the (boolean) counting hierarchy to algebraic complexity classes. As a by-product, we obtain two additional results: The constant-free, degree-unbounded version of Valiant's hypothesis VP not equal VNP implies the degree-bounded version. This result was previously known to hold for fields of positive characteristic only. If exponential sums of easy to compute polynomials can be computed efficiently, then the same is true of exponential products. We point out an application of this result to the P = NP problem in the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation over the field of complex numbers.", "paper_title": "Interpolation in Valiant's Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000290276600001"}
