Based on the new relations, a new method (Algorithm 3) is proposed to derive interval weights by transforming a multiplicative consistent interval fuzzy preference relation into an additive consistent interval fuzzy preference relation, collecting additive consistent information (Algorithm 2), transforming back into multiplicative consistent information and calculating the interval weights by Eq. (20). Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the new method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.2011 Elsevier B.V.
