During the last decade, Yang and Singh (1994) have proposed and developed an evidential. reasoning (ER) approach to deal with such MADM problems. Essentially, this approach is based on an evaluation analysis model and Dempster's rule of combination in the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory of evidence. This paper reanalyzes the ER approach explicitly in terms of D-S theory and then proposes a general scheme of attribute aggregation in MADM under uncertainty. In the spirit of such a reanalysis, previous ER algorithms are reviewed and two other aggregation schemes are discussed. Theoretically, it is shown that new aggregation schemes also satisfy the synthesis axioms, which have been recently proposed by Yang and Xu (2002) for which any rational aggregation process should grant. A numerical example traditionally examined in published sources on the ER approach is used to illustrate the discussed techniques.", "paper_title": "Multiple-attribute decision making under uncertainty: The evidential reasoning approach revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000238321700015"}
