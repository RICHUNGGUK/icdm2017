Based on a classification of simulator features proposed in the paper, we define problems that can be simulated using GSSIM and compare it to other simulation tools. We focus on an extension of our previous works including advanced workload generation methods, simulation of a network with advance reservation features, handling specific application performance models and energy efficiency modeling. Some important features of GSSIM are demonstrated by three diverse experiments conducted with the use of the tool. We also present an advanced web tool for the remote management and execution of simulation experiments, which makes GSSIM the comprehensive distributed computing simulator available on the Web.", "paper_title": "GSSIM - A tool for distributed computing experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000297862300004"}
