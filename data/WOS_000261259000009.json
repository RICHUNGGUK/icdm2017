Generating efficient safe plans is the key to evaluating queries whose data complexities are PTIME. In this paper, we propose a new approach generating efficient safe plans for queries. Our algorithm adopts effective preprocessing and multiway split techniques, thus the generating safe plans avoid unnecessary probabilistic cartesian-products and have the minimum number of probabilistic projections. Further, we extend existing transformation rules to allow the safe plans generated by the Safe-Plan algorithm [N. Dalvi, D. Suciu, Efficient query evaluation on probabilistic database. The VLDB Journal 16 (4) (2007) 523-544] and the proposed algorithm to be transformed by each other. Applying our approach through the TPC-H benchmark queries, the experiments show that the safe plans generated by our algorithm are more efficient than those generated by the Safe-Plan algorithm.
