Local protein structure prediction is receiving increased attention. One essential step of local protein structure prediction method is that the three-dimensional conformations must be compressed into one-dimensional series of letters of a structural alphabet. The traditional method assigns each structure fragment the structure alphabet that has the best local structure similarity. However, such locally optimal structure alphabet sequence does not guarantee to produce the globally optimal structure. This study presents two efficient methods trying to find the optimal structure alphabet sequence, which can model the native structures as accuracy as possible. First, a 28-letter structure alphabet is derived by Clustering fragment in Cartesian space with fragment length of seven residues. The average quantization error of the 28 letters is 0.82 angstrom in term of root mean square deviation. Then, two efficient methods are presented to encode the protein structures into series of structure alphabet letters, that is, the greedy and dynamic programming algorithm. They are tested on PDB database using the structure alphabet developed in Cartesian coordinates space (our structure alphabet) and in torsion angles space (the PB structure alphabet), respectively. The experimental results show that these two methods can find the approximately optimal structure alphabet sequences by searching a small fraction of the modeling space. The traditional local-optimization method achieves 26.27 angstrom root mean square deviations between the reconstructed structures and the native one, while the modeling accuracy is improved to 3.28 angstrom by the greedy algorithm. The results are helpful for local protein structure prediction. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
