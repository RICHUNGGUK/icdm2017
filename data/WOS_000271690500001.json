In combination with texture features of the image under investigation, this paper works on edge detection with various structuring elements (SEs) and gray-scale values. The results of the experiment are presented, and we found several advantages by using the morphological edge detection scheme for the analysis of gastric tumor pathologic cell images. Meanwhile, the results of the binary morphological edge detection are given for comparison.
