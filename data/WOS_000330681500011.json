In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a new code discriminator based on barycenter algorithm. By calculating the barycenter of code phase by multiple PN code branches' correlation results, PN code phase error can be obtained. Theoretical analysis of new discriminator's performance is given, and it is indicated that the code tracking loop using this algorithm can also solve the problems of low ranging precision and large mean deviation caused by multi-access interference. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulation and measurements and the new discriminator is used in an aerospace engineering project successfully.", "paper_title": "A new barycenter code discriminator for multi-access interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000330681500011"}
