The results indicated that argument quality, recommendation sidedness, source credibility, confirmation of prior beliefs, and recommendation ratings have a positive effect on the uncertainty reduction of consumers towards the businesses under consideration. Since uncertainty reduction has an effect on value perception, this study suggests that companies provide on-line consumer reviews on their websites to increase consumer uncertainty reduction and to improve consumer value perception of their companies.", "paper_title": "The Impact of On-Line Consumer Reviews on Value Perception: The Dual-Process Theory and Uncertainty Reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000353299700002"}
