In this situation, approximation techniques with provable guarantees, like sketches, are one possible solution. The performance of sketches depends crucially on the ability to generate particular pseudo-random numbers. In this article we investigate both theoretically and empirically the problem of generating k-wise independent pseudo-random numbers and, in particular, that of generating 3- and 4-wise independent pseudo-random numbers that are fast range-summable (i.e., they can be summed in sublinear time). Our specific contributions are: (a) we provide a thorough comparison of the various pseudo-random number generating schemes; (b) we study both theoretically and empirically the fast range-summation property of 3- and 4-wise independent generating schemes; (c) we provide algorithms for the fast range-summation of two 3-wise independent schemes, BCH and extended Hamming; and (d) we show convincing theoretical and empirical evidence that the extended Hamming scheme performs as well as any 4-wise independent scheme for estimating the size of join of two relations using AMS sketches, even though it is only 3-wise independent. We use this scheme to generate estimators that significantly outperform state-of-the-art solutions for two problems, namely, size of spatial joins and selectivity estimation.", "paper_title": "Pseudo-random number generation for sketch-based estimations", "paper_id": "WOS:000247941100004"}
