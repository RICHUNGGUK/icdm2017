These clouds are too infrastructure oriented and they lack advanced service oriented capabilities such as service elasticity, quality of service or admission control to perform a holistic management of a whole application. The deployment of complex multi-tier applications on top of IaaS infrastructures requires to provide the IaaS platforms with an extra service layer that provides advanced service management functionality.
