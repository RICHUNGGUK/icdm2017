With a small probability, a newborn from the sexual population mutates into an asexual one and vice versa. Then, the asexual population rapidly dominates the sexual one, which all but disappears. However, when an infestation by mutating genetically coup led parasites, that mimic trematodes that feed on gonads, is introduced, the outcome may be one in which both populations coevolve or one in which one of the populations overcomes the other, depending on the density of parasites on the lattice.", "paper_title": "PARASITIC INFESTATION AND CHOICE OF REPRODUCTIVE REGIMES", "paper_id": "WOS:000282814400002"}
