The proposed method uses a variational approach and combines the characteristics of a multilevel algorithm and the properties of ultrasound data in order to provide a fast and accurate deformable registration method. In contrast to previously proposed approaches, we use no feature points and no interpolation technique, but compute a dense displacement field directly. We demonstrate that this approach, although it includes solving large PDE systems, reduces the computation time if implemented using efficient numerical techniques. The performance of the algorithm is tested on multiple 3D US images of the liver. Validation is performed by simulations, similarity comparisons between original and deformed images, visual inspection of the displacement fields and visual assessment of the deformed images by physicians.", "paper_title": "Fast deformable registration of 3D-ultrasound data using a variational approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300112"}
