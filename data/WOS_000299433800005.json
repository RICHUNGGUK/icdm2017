A set of two measurements on lungs and heart were performed by the same observer. A third set was performed by a second observer. Thus, the intra- and inter-observer relative deviation of measurements was analysed. Multiple regressions were used in order to study the relationship between the CT properties (scanner, voltage, dose, pixel size, slice increment) and the relative deviation of measurements. There is a very low systematic intra- and inter-observer bias in measurements except for the volume of the heart. None of the CT data properties has a significant influence on the relative deviation of measurement. In the present paper, the measurements and 3D reconstruction protocol described can be applied to characterise the growth of the intra-thoracic organs.", "paper_title": "Reproducibility of geometrical acquisition of intra-thoracic organs of children on CT scans", "paper_id": "WOS:000299433800005"}
