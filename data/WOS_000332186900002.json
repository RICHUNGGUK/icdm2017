We focused on perceived risk in reception, understanding and action and studied two global software teams that were at different software development phases (i.e. requirements analysis versus development and maintenance). Data for this research was collected from a leading global IT consulting company and we found that instant messaging, email and teleconferencing system were frequently used by the two teams. Our results indicate that perceived risks in reception and action were encountered by members in the systems development and maintenance phase. Additionally. we also found differences on the effects of perceived risks on the use of instant messaging, email and teleconferencing system between the teams.", "paper_title": "PERCEIVED RISKS AND ICT USE", "paper_id": "WOS:000332186900002"}
