Created and implemented is a yard simulation model using a computer package for event-based simulation, SIMUL'8. The main idea behind the simulation modelling approach is to simulate the flat-shunted yard operations dividing the yard into segments so that the behaviour of each segment can be described and analyzed separately. The simulation model takes the shape of queuing network. The components of the queuing network are interconnected queuing systems that interact and influence one another, so that the global impact of freight train operations is captured. The queuing systems replicate the preliminary specified segments that consist of a set of work centres (i.e., servers) and/or storage areas (i.e., capacity limitations). This modelling approach allows us to study the processing capabilities of the yards. In the shape of \"Case Study\", we demonstrate how the proposed approach is implemented in terms of \"real world\" case. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
