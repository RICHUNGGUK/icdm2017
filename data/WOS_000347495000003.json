Each station is fed by a renewal input with general i.i.d. inter-arrival times and general i.i.d. service times (possibly different in the two stations). Then we extend the stability analysis to cascade networks with an arbitrary number N of stations and find a sufficient stability condition. In such networks, an awaiting customer from the queue j <= N - 1 jumps to station j + 1 if free, to be served there. Finally, we obtain a necessary condition for stability of the N-station cascade network, which matches the sufficient condition when N = 2. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
