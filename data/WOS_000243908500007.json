This semidefinite programming formulation can be tightened toward either chi(G) or omega(G) by adding several types of cutting planes. We explore several such strengthenings, and show that some of them can be computed with the same effort as the theta number. We also investigate computational simplifications for graphs with rich automorphism groups.", "paper_title": "Semidefinite programming relaxations for graph coloring and maximal clique problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243908500007"}
