In the proposed model, a sensor node is allowed to connect through more than one of the available gateways to the Internet. Between the source node and each gateway, a routing path with minimum link cost and maximum available bandwidth is attempted to be found. Then, considering the bandwidth demand of the flow originating from the sensor node and the available bandwidth on each optimal path, the flow traffic is allocated to appropriate gateways. Simulation results have shown that the proposed model not only prolongs network lifetime, but also improves network throughput.", "paper_title": "ROUTING BETWEEN NODES AND MULTIPLE GATEWAYS IN WIRELESS MESH SENSOR NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000299250500003"}
