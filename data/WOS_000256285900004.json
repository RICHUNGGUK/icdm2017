An iterative method for shakedown analysis, Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 2002;191:5761-92] for the shakedown analysis is used for the evaluation of the shakedown safety factor of reinforced concrete 3D frames subjected to a combination of varying loads. The FEM discretization for 3D frames is obtained subdividing the frame into rods and using a 3D beam finite element. Beam end-sections are used for checking plastic admissibility and for this reason the formulation models the interaction between the axial force and biaxial bending by a piecewise linearization of the elastic domain, for generic shape reinforced concrete sections. Concrete and steel are assumed to be elasto-plastic, and, for concrete, tensile resistance is ignored. The algorithm is described in detail and some numerical results, that show the efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed method, are reported and discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
