In this brief communication, it is shown that some scoring functions possess the likelihood property, which means that the scoring function indicates the likelihood of matching when compared to other retrieval tasks, which is potentially more useful than pure ranking although it cannot be interpreted as an actual probability. This property can be detected by using two modified effectiveness measures: entire precision and entire recall.", "paper_title": "Measuring the Likelihood Property of Scoring Functions in General Retrieval Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000266303800020"}
