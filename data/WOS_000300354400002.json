In existing security solutions, the major limitation is that no trust establishment mechanisms that adapt to rapidly changing scenarios and highly mobile environments (mainly because of key management delay, processing overhead, and changing communication peers). To address this issue, we present a policy management framework for secure data access control in vehicular networks. Our solution address two interrelated research areas to achieve efficiency and scalability for data access control and policy management in highly dynamic vehicular networks. The main contributions are in two-fold: (a) efficient key management and group-based policy enforcement using attribute-based cryptography; and (b) dynamic security policy management framework and methodology to manage credentials based on role, time, location and other situation dependent attributes. Our solution utilizes efficient attribute-based cryptography algorithm to achieve unprecedented speedups in message processing time to meet the real-time requirement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution, a systematic and comprehensive evaluation is produced to valid our proposed solution.", "paper_title": "Policy Management for Secure Data Access Control in Vehicular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000300354400002"}
