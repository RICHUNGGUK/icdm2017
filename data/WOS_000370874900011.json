Unfortunately, bare-metal instances require time-consuming or OS-specific tasks for deployment due to the lack of virtualization layers, thereby sacrificing several beneficial features of traditional IaaS clouds such as agility, elasticity, and OS transparency. We present BMcast, an OS deployment system with a special-purpose de-virtualizable virtual machine monitor (VMM) that supports quick and OS-transparent startup of bare-metal instances. BMcast performs streaming OS deployment while allowing direct access to physical hardware from the guest OS, and then disappears after completing the deployment. Quick startup of instances improves agility and elasticity significantly, and OS transparency greatly simplifies management tasks for cloud customers. Experimental results have confirmed that BMcast initiated a bare-metal instance 8.6 times faster than image copying, and database performance on BMcast during streaming OS deployment was comparable to that on a state-of-the-art VMM without performing deployment. BMcast incurred zero overhead after de-virtualization.", "paper_title": "Improving Agility and Elasticity in Bare-metal Clouds", "paper_id": "WOS:000370874900011"}
