However, it may present too many HUIs to users, which also degrades the efficiency of the mining process. To achieve high efficiency for the mining task and provide a concise mining result to users, we propose a novel framework in this paper for mining closed(+) high utility itemsets (CHUIs), which serves as a compact and lossless representation of HUIs. We propose three efficient algorithms named AprioriCH (Apriori-based algorithm for mining High utility Closed(+) itemsets), AprioriHC-D (AprioriHC algorithm with Discarding unpromising and isolated items) and CHUD (Closed(+) High Utility Itemset Discovery) to find this representation. Further, a method called DAHU (Derive All High Utility Itemsets) is proposed to recover all HUIs from the set of CHUIs without accessing the original database. Results on real and synthetic datasets show that the proposed algorithms are very efficient and that our approaches achieve a massive reduction in the number of HUIs. In addition, when all HUIs can be recovered by DAHU, the combination of CHUD and DAHU outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for mining HUIs.", "paper_title": "Efficient Algorithms for Mining the Concise and Lossless Representation of High Utility Itemsets", "paper_id": "WOS:000349621800011"}
