In the proposed scheme, the guidance law is partitioned into three stages in accordance with the relative range between the interceptor and target. Estimated line-of-sight angle, line-of-sight angle rate, line-of-sight angular acceleration and relative range are used to constitute the rule antecedent of the guidance law to shape an appropriate flight trajectory for engagement. Asymmetric membership functions and guidance rules are developed for satisfactory engagement performance and robustness. Engagement performance is well proven by extensive computer simulations.", "paper_title": "Design of a fuzzified terminal guidance law", "paper_id": "WOS:000257848300007"}
