The paper recently published by K. Zhu in the European Journal of Operational Research heavily criticizes the fuzzy approaches to AHP, claiming the fallacy of all of them. Therefore, it seems to be necessary to clarify whether the criticisms are well-founded or not. The present paper aims to rebut Zhu's claims by showing that the evidences and the reasonings in his paper are very poor and far from proving the fallacy of fuzzy AHP.", "paper_title": "A Note on the Paper \"Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process: Fallacy of the Popular Methods\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000367531700010"}
