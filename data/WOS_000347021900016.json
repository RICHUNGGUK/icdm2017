In particular, an econometric analysis on the Italian mortgage markets series from 1997:q1 to 2012:q3 is set up by involving the VAR estimation technique. Very interesting results are achieved to point out how the effects of the European Central Bank control on the Euribor transmit (i) to the behavior of interest rates term structure as well as (ii) to interest rates of contracts involved in different technical forms offered in the Italian mortgage markets.
