For its realization, cross-tier interference mitigation is an important issue. To solve this problem, we propose a joint access and power control scheme that requires limited information exchange between the femto and macro networks. Our objective is to maximize the network throughput while satisfying each user's quality of service (QoS) requirement. To accomplish this, we first introduce two distributed interference detection schemes, i.e., the femto base station and macro user equipment based schemes. Then, the proposed scheme dynamically adjusts the transmission power and makes a decision on the access mode of each femto base station. Through extensive simulations, we show that the proposed scheme outperforms earlier works in terms of the throughput and outage probability.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Access and Power Control Scheme for Interference Mitigation in Femtocell Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000366399500004"}
