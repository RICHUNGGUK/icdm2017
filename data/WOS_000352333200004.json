It has attracted a lot of attention in recent decades. Various algorithms and systems are designed for object tracking. The paper provides a systematic survey of these algorithms and systems. We first analyze the classification and the challenges of object tracking. Then, we propose a framework for tracking process, which is able to accommodate all the existing algorithms in object tracking. With the help of the framework, open issues, as well as the possible solutions are presented. Finally, based on a review of the representative object tracking systems, we summarize the design rules for tracking system.", "paper_title": "Survey of Object Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352333200004"}
