This problem received increasing interests and have been lucubrated in recent years. Regular path expression is the core of the XML query languages e.g., XPath and XQuery. Most of the state-of-the-art path-based XML indexes, therefore, hammer at how to efficiently answer the path-based XML queries. This paper surveys various approaches to indexing XML data proposed in the literature. We give a step by step analysis to show the evolution of index structures for XML path information, based on tree structures or more commonly, directed labeled graphs. For each approach, we first present the specific issue it aims to tackle, and then the proposed solution presented. Furthermore, construction, physical data storage and maintenance costs, are analyzed.", "paper_title": "Answering XML queries using path-based indexes: A survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000240715600003"}
