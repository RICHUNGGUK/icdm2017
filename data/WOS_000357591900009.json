This task involves challenges such as dealing with unconstrained stereoscopic video, non-stationary cameras, and complex indoor and outdoor dynamic scenes with multiple people. We cast the problem as a discrete labelling task involving multiple person labels, devise a suitable cost function, and optimize it efficiently. The contributions of our work are two-fold: First, we develop a segmentation model incorporating person detections and learnt articulated pose segmentation masks, as well as colour, motion, and stereo disparity cues. The model also explicitly represents depth ordering and occlusion. Second, we introduce a stereoscopic dataset with frames extracted from feature-length movies \"StreetDance 3D\" and \"Pina\". The dataset contains 587 annotated human poses, 1,158 bounding box annotations and 686 pixel-wise segmentations of people. The dataset is composed of indoor and outdoor scenes depicting multiple people with frequent occlusions. We demonstrate results on our new challenging dataset, as well as on the H2view dataset from (Sheasby et al. ACCV 2012).", "paper_title": "Pose Estimation and Segmentation of Multiple People in Stereoscopic Movies", "paper_id": "WOS:000357591900009"}
