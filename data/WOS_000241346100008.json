However, it unfortunately suffers from criticism of lacking of systematic stability analysis and controller design though it has a great success in industry applications. In the past ten years or so, prevailing research efforts on fuzzy logic control have been devoted to model-based fuzzy control systems that guarantee not only stability but also performance of closed-loop fuzzy control systems. This paper presents a survey on recent developments (or state of the art) of analysis and design of model based fuzzy control systems. Attention will be focused on stability analysis and controller design based on the so-called Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models or fuzzy dynamic models. Perspectives of model based fuzzy control in future are also discussed.", "paper_title": "A survey on analysis and design of model-based fuzzy control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241346100008"}
