Convergence of all moments is shown to hold only for a E [0, 1] (with only convergence of finite moments when alpha is an element of (1, e)). When the limit ratio is 0 or 1 for which the limit laws are both constant, we prove asymptotic normality for alpha = 0 and a \"quicksort type\" limit law for alpha = 1, the latter case having additionally a small range where there is no fixed limit law. Our tools are based on the contraction method and method of moments. Similar phenomena also hold for other classes of trees; we apply our tools to binary search trees and give a complete characterization of the profile. The profiles of these random trees represent concrete examples for which the range of convergence in distribution differs from that of convergence of all moments.", "paper_title": "Profiles of random trees: Limit theorems for random recursive trees and binary search trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000243383500007"}
