The algorithm minimizes an objective function by swapping edges and moving nodes. Numerical experiments are performed on model problems. The results illustrate that the mesh optimization algorithm can reduce the W (1,a) semi-norm of the interpolation error. For these examples, the L (2), L (a), and H (1) norms decreased also.", "paper_title": "A mesh optimization algorithm to decrease the maximum interpolation error of linear triangular finite elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000286224300002"}
