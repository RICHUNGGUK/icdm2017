For this, however, almost all of the existing methods require a perfect alignment between a gallery and a probe image. In this paper we present a pose invariant face recognition method that does not require the facial landmarks to be detected as such and is able to work with only single training image of the subject. We propose novel extensions by introducing to use a more robust feature description as opposed to pixel-based appearances. Using such features we put forward to synthesize the non-frontal views to frontal. Furthermore, using local kernel density estimation, instead of commonly used normal density assumption, is suggested to derive the prior models. Our method does not require any strict alignment between gallery and probe images which makes it particularly attractive as compared to the existing state of the art methods. Improved recognition across a wide range of poses has been achieved using these extensions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
