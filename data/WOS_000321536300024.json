In MC-IDMA system, multi-carrier is realized by orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, which can eliminate the effects of time dispersion. At the mobile station, we employ zero forcing maximum-a-posteriori and minimum mean square error MAP (MMSE/MAP) multi-user detectors (MUD) to mitigate the effects of multi stream interference and iterative chip detection to combat the effects of multiple access interference. The performance of the considered system is compared with double space-time transmit diversity (DSTTD) aided MC-IDMA system. The simulation results show that the considered scheme outperforms DSTTD MC-IDMA and MC-CDMA system with MMSE/MAP MUD in terms of achievable bit error rate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
