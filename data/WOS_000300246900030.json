We consider the setting in which the source node has instant feedback of the channel outputs of the K receivers after each transmission. The main results of this paper are: (i) The capacity region for general 1-to-3 broadcast PECs and (ii) The capacity region for two types of 1-to-K broadcast PECs: the symmetric PECs, and the spatially independent PECs with one-sided fairness constraints. This paper also develops (iii) A pair of outer and inner bounds of the capacity region for arbitrary 1-to-K broadcast PECs, which can be easily evaluated by any linear programming solver. The proposed inner bound is proven by a new class of intersession network coding schemes, termed the packet evolution schemes, which is based on the concept of code alignment in GF(q) that is in parallel with the interference alignment techniques for the Euclidean space. Extensive numerical experiments show that the outer and inner bounds meet for almost all broadcast PECs encountered in practical scenarios and thus effectively bracket the capacity of general 1-to-K broadcast PECs with COF.", "paper_title": "On the Capacity of 1-to-K Broadcast Packet Erasure Channels With Channel Output Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000300246900030"}
