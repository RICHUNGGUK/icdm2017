Furthermore, it aims to investigate how to reach break even point between transaction cost and agency cost and to further achieve the goal of cost minimization. Design/methodology/approach - This is empirical analysis of variables constructed from transaction cost theory and data obtained from two famous motor companies in Taiwan automotive industry. This study adopts the probit model and tobit regression model to test and discuss the parameters in the model to deeply realize the influence of transaction cost variables towards purchasing strategy. Findings - The findings prove the situation of multiple sourcing in supplying auto parts and demonstrate that the dimensions in transaction cost are truly important factors to affect the purchasing strategies. In addition, the empirical results show the explanatory capabilities of variables are very significant in monopoly power, steering system, electro mechanism, and other parts systems. Practical implications - The awareness on transaction cost are beneficial to partner selection of automotive companies in Taiwan. These findings also improve the quality of purchasing strategy in Taiwan automotive industry. Originality/value - This study explores the variables of transaction cost influencing purchasing strategies. In addition, the knowledge on transaction cost towards purchasing strategy helps companies enhance the quality in future purchasing strategy and select their suppliers.", "paper_title": "An empirical study of purchasing strategy in automotive industry", "paper_id": "WOS:000260522200007"}
