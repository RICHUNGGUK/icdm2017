The systematic design framework contains a generic crystallizer modelling toolbox, a tool for generation of the supersaturation set-point for supersaturation control, as well as a tool for design of a process monitoring and control system (also called Process Analytical Technology (PAT) system). This systematic design allows one to generate the necessary problem-chemical system specific model, the necessary supersaturation set-point as well as a PAT system design including implementation of monitoring tools and control strategies in order to produce the desired target product properties notably crystal size distribution (CSD) and shape for a wide range of crystallization processes. Application of the framework is highlighted through a case study involving the design of a monitoring and control system for a potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) crystallization process, where also the one-dimensional CSD and two-dimensional CSD modelling features are highlighted.
