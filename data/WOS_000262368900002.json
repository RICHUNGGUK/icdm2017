We propose an adaptation based on Van der Zwaag's definition, and prove that the resulting timed branching bisimilarity is an equivalence indeed. Furthermore, we prove that in case of a discrete time domain, Van der Zwaag's definition and our adaptation coincide. Finally, we prove that a rooted version of timed branching bisimilarity is a congruence over a basic timed process algebra containing parallelism, successful termination and deadlock.", "paper_title": "Is Timed Branching Bisimilarity a Congruence Indeed?", "paper_id": "WOS:000262368900002"}
