In order to steer a distributed dynamic system to a desired state, it often becomes necessary to have a prior control over the graph which represents the coupling among interacting agents. In this paper, a simple but compelling model of distributed dynamical systems operating over a dynamic graph is considered. The structure of the graph is assumed to be relied on the underling system's states. Then by following a proper protocol, the state-dependent dynamic graph is driven to a pre-specified structure. The main results are derived via Lasalle's Invariant Principle and numerical examples that find very good agreements with the analytical results are also included.", "paper_title": "CONTROL A STATE-DEPENDENT DYNAMIC GRAPH TO A PRE-SIPECIFIED STRUCTURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000273488700008"}
