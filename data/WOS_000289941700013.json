The fundamental knowledge of the facial skin is derived from the structure of tissue, being composed of epidermis, dermis and subcutis. The approach first defines the facial tissue depth map to measure details at various locations on the face. Each layer of skin in a wound image has been determined by hue-based segmentation. In addition, we have employed disparity parameters to realise 3D depth in order to make a wound model volumetric. Finally, we validate our methods using 3D wound simulation experiments.
