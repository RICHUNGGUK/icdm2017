In particular, we investigate the robustness of the AF-CS scheme in the presence of a group of coordinated eavesdropping nodes under the assumption that they have corrupted channel state information. In order to fulfil this assumption, we propose a channel estimation technique based on pseudorandom pilots. This technique introduces extra uncertainty only in the channel estimation of the eavesdroppers. Our simulation results evaluate the physical-layer protection as a function of the total number of coordinated eavesdroppers and the level of channel estimation distortion of the eavesdroppers. We demonstrate that a small number of eavesdroppers (small being defined later on) has a zero probability of recovering the intended signal. We also show that a very large number of eavesdropping nodes are required to perfectly recover the signal in comparison with other distributed compressed sensing schemes in the literature.", "paper_title": "Amplify-and-Forward Compressed Sensing as a Physical-Layer Secrecy Solution in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000334524300009"}
