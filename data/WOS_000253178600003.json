These techniques are classified by the parametric or information theoretic approaches they adopt. An underlying structural model common to all parametric approaches is outlined. The nature and premises of a typical information theoretic approach are stressed. Some possible application patterns for an information theoretic approach are illustrated. Composition is distinguished from decomposition by pointing out that the former is not a simple reversal of the latter. From the standpoint of application to complex systems, a general evaluation is provided. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
