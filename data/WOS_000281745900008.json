This tool acts as a guide for enabling designers to influence the emergent global behaviour of an AMAS by acting on the local behaviour of its cooperative agents. The preliminary approach proposed in this article can be seen as a feasibility study aiming at developing a textual guide by considering the principles of the AMAS theory. Simulation of the behaviour of healthy and cancerous cells is used as a base for this study. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
