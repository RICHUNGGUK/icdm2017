All methods were tested on three binary classification tasks, and their out-of-sample classification accuracies are compared. The relative performance of the methods varies considerably across subjects and classification tasks. The best overall performers were adaptive quadratic discriminant, support vector machines with RBF kernels, and generatively trained pairs of RBMs.", "paper_title": "Comparing Classification Methods for Longitudinal fMRI Studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000282820100001"}
