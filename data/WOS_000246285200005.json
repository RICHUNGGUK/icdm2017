The digital library contains four types of learning modules including textual materials, QuickTime virtual reality movies, Java simulations, and stereolithographic files of the physical models. The authors report an evaluation study on the uses of the KMODDL in two undergraduate classes. This research reveals that the users in different classes encountered different usability problems, and reported quantitatively different subjective experiences. Further, the results indicate that depending on the subject area, the two user groups preferred different types of learning modules, resulting in different uses of the available materials and different learning outcomes. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for future digital library design.", "paper_title": "One digital library, two undergraduate classes, and four learning modules: Uses of a digital library in classrooms", "paper_id": "WOS:000246285200005"}
