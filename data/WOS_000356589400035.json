We propose an algorithm that can detect major components of heart sound using Gaussian regression to the smoothed simplicity profile of a heart sound signal. The weight and spread of the Gaussians are used as features to discriminate cardiac murmurs from major components of a heart sound signal. Experimental results show that the proposed method is very promising for robust and accurate detection of major heart sound components as well as cardiac murmurs.", "paper_title": "Detection of S1/S2 Components with Extraction of Murmurs from Phonocardiogram", "paper_id": "WOS:000356589400035"}
