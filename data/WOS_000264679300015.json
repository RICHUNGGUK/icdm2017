Milne, the Volume function. We provide the expansion of Milne's volume function in the basis of monomial vector symmetric functions, and observe that only monomial functions of a particular kind appear in the expansion, the squarefree monomial functions. By means of an appropriate specialization of the vector symmetric Newton identities, we derive an inductive formula that expresses the squarefree monomial functions in the power sums basis. As a corollary, we obtain an inductive formula that writes Milne's Volume function in the power sums basis. The lattice of the sub-hypergraphs of a hypergraph appears in a natural way in this setting. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
