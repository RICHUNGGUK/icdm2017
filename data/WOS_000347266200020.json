This paper presents a modified Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) chart in order to further enhance the sensitivity of the EWMA control chart proposed by Castagliola et al. (2011). Tables are provided for the statistical properties of the new chart. Some numerical results and comparisons are given and show that the new chart has an average run length performance that is superior to some other competing procedures. A real data example from manufacturing shows that it performs quite well in applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
