Such a transfer-Hamiltonian is hoped to be as predictive as accurate, ab initio quantum chemistry for such systems. To design the Hamiltonian requires that, we investigate rigorous one-particle theories including density functional theory (DFT) and the recently proposed, correlated orbital potential (COP) approach that has been developed solely from wavefunction considerations. The latter insists upon exact, principal ionization potentials and electron affinities for a system, while DFT insists upon the exact density and the HOMO ionization. These two complementary approaches help identify the essential quantities that an exact one-particle theory of electronic structure requires. The intent, then, is to incorporate these into a simple approximation that can provide the accuracy required but at a speed four orders of magnitude faster than today's DFT. The theory is presented and its neglect of diatomic differential overlap (NDDO) realization is illustrated for select systems.", "paper_title": "Quantum mechanics at the core of multi-scale simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000240798400008"}
