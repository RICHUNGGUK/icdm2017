In general, language training needs a professional instrument to analyze speech for supporting the pronunciation of hearing impaired. However, non-professional speech spectrum equipment is very expensive and its output is not easy for hearing impaired to understand and learn. The purpose of this research is to implement a radar-graphic displaying system (RDS) to support the speech learning for hearing-impaired people at low cost and better performance. The components of RDS include a computer connects to a microphone as input device to capture the speech features; a neural network is used to extract the features for speech recognition; a radar map displays the voice message on the screen to support the hearing impaired to learn speech. A system performance evaluation of RDS was performed after the system was implemented. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
