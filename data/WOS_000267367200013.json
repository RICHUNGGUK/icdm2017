In addition, this paper presents multiplication-free sub-pixel interpolation and adaptive sub-pixel interpolation algorithms. The proposed memory reuse algorithm utilizes the position similarity of the predicted motion vectors among neighboring sub-macro blocks and the modified normalized partial distortion search algorithm uses an adaptive search range and the dynamic threshold methods. It can reduce a large number of memory access and can save power consumption by sharing the search range of the current block. In addition, simplifying weights of a sub-pixel interpolation filter can eliminate multiplications and the adaptive sub-pixel interpolation can reduce the number of sub-pixel search points, which can reduce memory access and hardware complexity. Therefore, the proposed algorithms are quite suitable for low power video compression.", "paper_title": "Low Power Complexity-Reduced ME and Interpolation Algorithms for H.264/AVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000267367200013"}
