We briefly denote such a design as a 3PDTWh( p). In this paper, we investigate the existence of a Z-cyclic 3PDTWh(p) for any prime p equivalent to 1 (mod 4) and show that such a design exists whenever p equivalent to 5, 9, 13 (mod 16) and p >= 29. This result is obtained by applying Weil's theorem. In addition, we also prove that a Z-cyclic 3PDTWh( p) exists whenever p equivalent to 1 (mod 16) and p < 10,000 except possibly for p = 257,769.", "paper_title": "Existence of Z-cyclic 3PDTWh(p) for Prime p 1 (mod 4)", "paper_id": "WOS:000249299100009"}
