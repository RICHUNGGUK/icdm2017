The inherent subjectiveness and imprecision of the selection process is modeled by using linguistic terms characterized by triangular fuzzy numbers. To avoid the complex and unreliable process of comparing fuzzy numbers usually required in fuzzy multicriteria analysis, a new algorithm is developed based on the degree of dominance and the degree of optimality concepts. A multicriteria decision support system is proposed to facilitate the evaluation and selection process. An information systems project selection problem is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Multicriteria Decision Support for Information Systems Project Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000280616500009"}
