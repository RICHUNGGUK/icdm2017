By contrast, the usual intensional uniformity conditions require that a resource-bounded machine be able to exhibit the circuits in the circuit family defining C. We say that (C, L) has the uniformity duality property if the extensionally uniform class C boolean AND L can be captured intensionally by means of adding so-called L-numerical predicates to the first-order descriptive complexity apparatus describing the connection language of the circuit family defining C. This paper exhibits positive instances and negative instances of the uniformity duality property.", "paper_title": "EXTENSIONAL UNIFORMITY FOR BOOLEAN CIRCUITS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280847900019"}
