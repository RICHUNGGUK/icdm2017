The novel spherical and hyperbolic CVT energy functions are defined, and the relationship between minimizing the energy and the CVT is proved. We also show by our experimental results that both spherical and hyperbolic CVTs have the similar property as their Euclidean counterpart where the sites are uniformly distributed with respect to given density values. As an example of the application, we utilize the CVT in universal covering space to compute uniform partitions and high-quality remeshing results for genus-0, genus-1, and high-genus (genus > 1) surfaces.
