Unlike the conventional approaches using a dedicated channel independent of the video stream, this paper proposes a novel data embedding scheme, which we refer to as SMDE (statistical modulation data embedding), to support the media-dependent approach that exploits data-dependent channel to transmit and maintain key information. Using embedded data to convey key information is able to achieve added security and reduce bandwidth resource consumption. To this end, we present some new algorithms to embed key messages. By adopting the statistical properties of host video signal, new coding approach for embedded data, and error control algorithm, the proposed SMDE scheme can provide error resilience, transparence for adaptation mechanism, high accuracy of detecting embedded data and real-time processing capability for video applications. These advantages have been demonstrated by the extensive experimental results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
