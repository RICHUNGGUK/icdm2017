Two types of varactors that have been integrated on-chip include the inversion-mode and accumulation-mode types. The inversion-mode varactor offers immunity to latch-up, but suffers from a non-linear C(V) characteristic which directly leads to a nonlinear oscillation frequency tuning curve. This paper proposes an oscillation frequency linearization technique for LC-VCO with an inversion-mode varactor. The linearity of the frequency tuning curve is improved by linearization of C(V) characteristics of the inversion-mode varactor. A new varactor configuration consisting of varactor units and resistor divider network is proposed. The single-switch integrated LC-VCO with the proposed varactor configuration is fabricated in TSMC 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. The improvement of linearity of the frequency tuning curve has been verified using mathematical models and measurement results.", "paper_title": "Linearization of oscillation frequency for integrated LC-VCO with inversion-mode varactor", "paper_id": "WOS:000293183100006"}
