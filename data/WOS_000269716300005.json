The system uses virtual machines as building blocks to construct execution environments that span multiple computing sites. Such environments can be extended to operate on cloud infrastructures, such as Amazon EC2. This article provides an abstract view of the proposed architecture and its implementation; experiments show the scalability of an InterGrid-managed infrastructure and how the system can benefit from using the cloud.", "paper_title": "Harnessing Cloud Technologies for a Virtualized Distributed Computing Infrastructure", "paper_id": "WOS:000269716300005"}
