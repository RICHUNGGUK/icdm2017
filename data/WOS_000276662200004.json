Our method generalizes some earlier methods and combines them with the recently introduced complexity notion (M) over cap (q)(l), which denotes the minimum number of multiplications needed in F-q in order to obtain the coefficients of the product of two arbitrary l-term polynomials modulo x(l) in F-q[x]. We study our method for the finite fields F(q)n, where 2 <= n <= 18 and q = 2, 3,4 and we improve or reach the currently best known bilinear complexities. We also give some applications in cryptography. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.", "paper_title": "On multiplication in finite fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000276662200004"}
