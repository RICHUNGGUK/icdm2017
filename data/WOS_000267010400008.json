These sensing devices have the opportunity of collaboration among themselves to improve the target localization and tracking accuracies. An energy-efficient collaborative target tracking paradigm is developed for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). A mutual-information-based sensor selection (MISS) algorithm is adopted for participation in the fusion process. MISS allows the sensor nodes with the highest mutual information about the target state to transmit data so that the energy consumption is reduced while the desired target position estimation accuracy is met. In addition, a novel approach to energy savings in WSNs is devised in the information-controlled transmission power (ICTP) adjustment, where nodes with more information use higher transmission powers than those that are less informative to share their target state information with the neighboring nodes. Simulations demonstrate the performance gains offered by MISS and ICTP in terms of power consumption and target localization accuracy.", "paper_title": "Information Content-Based Sensor Selection and Transmission Power Adjustment for Collaborative Target Tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000267010400008"}
