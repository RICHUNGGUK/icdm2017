Ultimately, SMT's value system-wide depends on whether users effectively employ SMT at the application level. However, predicting SMT's benefit for HPC applications is challenging; by doubling the number of threads, the application's characteristics may change. This work proposes statistical modeling techniques to predict the speedup SMT confers to HPC applications. This approach, accurate to within 8%, uses only lightweight, transparent performance monitors collected during a single run of the application.", "paper_title": "Making the Most of SMT in HPC: System- and Application-Level Perspectives", "paper_id": "WOS:000348232000025"}
