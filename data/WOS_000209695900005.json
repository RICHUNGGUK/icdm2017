The number of antennas is assumed to be arbitrary at both the transmit and receive ends and, unlike previous related work, expressions are given in terms of finite summations where all the terms are explicitly given. Both noise-limited and interference-limited systems are analyzed. Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out to validate the accuracy of the results.", "paper_title": "ASER of Rectangular MQAM in Noise-Limited and Interference-Limited MIMO MRC Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000209695900005"}
