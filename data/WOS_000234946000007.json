Each image is decomposed into coherent segments, MCM is computed for each region and the spatial relationship among them are evaluated by using a *-tree representation. The image is represented by an attributed relational graph (ARG) where nodes contain the visual feature (MCM) and edges represent spatial relationship. Principal component analysis show the usefulness of MCM as a feature. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
