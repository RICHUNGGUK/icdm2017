In order to accurately capture parasitic inductance, the proposed 2-port model accounts for surrounding ground layer configurations of the print circuit board (PCB) on which the component is mounted. Our model retains conventional modeling paradigm in which component suppliers provide their customers with simulation models characterized independently of the customers' PCB. We also present necessary corrections that compensate magnetic coupling between the separated models. Impedance and its anti-resonant frequency of two power distribution networks are experimentally analyzed being non-separated modeling as the reference. The proposed model achieved very good match with the reference result reducing 7-34% error of the conventional model to about 2%.", "paper_title": "2-Port Modeling Technique for Surface-Mount Passive Components Using Partial Inductance Concept", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701700006"}
