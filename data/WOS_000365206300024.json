The network on chip (NoC) is expected to undertake the expanding demands of the ever-increasing numbers of processing elements, while its area/power footprint remains severely constrained. Hence, low-cost NoC designs that achieve high-throughput and low-latency operation are imperative for future scalability. While the buffers of the NoC routers are key enablers of high performance, they are also major consumers of area and power. In this paper, we extend elastic buffer (EB) architectures to support multiple virtual channels (VCs), and we derive ElastiStore, a novel lightweight EB architecture that minimizes buffering requirements without sacrificing performance. ElastiStore uses just one register per VC and a shared buffer sized large enough to merely cover the round-trip time that appears either on the NoC links or due to the internal pipeline of the NoC routers. The integration of the proposed EB scheme in the NoC router enables the design of efficient architectures, which offer the same performance as baseline VC-based routers, albeit at a significantly lower cost. Cycle-accurate network simulations including both synthetic traffic patterns and real application workloads running in a full-system simulation framework verify the efficacy of the proposed architecture. Moreover, the hardware implementation results using a 45-nm standard-cell library demonstrate ElastiStore's efficiency.", "paper_title": "ElastiStore: Flexible Elastic Buffering for Virtual-Channel-Based Networks on Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000365206300024"}
