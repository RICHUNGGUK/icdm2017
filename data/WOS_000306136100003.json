Taking advantage of repeated observations or correlated phenotypes can increase this statistical power, but fitting the more complicated models required can make computation impractical. Results: In this article, we present simple methods that capitalize on the structure inherent in GWAS studies to dramatically speed up computation for a wide variety of problems, with a special focus on methods for correlated phenotypes.", "paper_title": "Fast computation for genome-wide association studies using boosted one-step statistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000306136100003"}
