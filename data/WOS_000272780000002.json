The proposed method considers an SDL model representing the requirements of a system under test and a set of modifications on this model, applies dependence analysis to identify interaction patterns related to each type of modifications, i.e., adding, deleting, and changing transitions in the SDL model, and reduces the size of a given regression test suite by examining interaction patterns covered by each test case in the test suite. Results of empirical studies are reported.
