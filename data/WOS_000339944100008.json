Properties such as the shear modulus of the damping material need to be tailored for improving the damping of the structures. This paper presents a topology optimization method for designing the microstructures in 2D, i.e., the structure of the periodic unit cell (PUC), of cellular viscoelastic materials with a prescribed shear modulus. The effective behavior of viscoelastic materials is derived through the use of a finite element based homogenization method. Only isotropic matrix material was considered and under such assumption it is found that the effective loss factor of viscoelastic material is independent of the geometrical configuration of the PUC. Based upon the idea of a Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method of topology optimization, the relative material densities of the elements of the PUC are considered as the design variables. The topology optimization problem of viscoelastic cellular material with a prescribed property and with constraints on the isotropy and volume fraction is established. The optimization problem is solved using the sequential linear programming (SLP) method. Several examples of the design optimization of viscoelastic cellular materials are presented to demonstrate the validity of the method. The effectiveness of the design method is illustrated by comparing a solid and an optimized cellular viscoelastic material as applied to a cantilever beam with the passive constrained layer damping treatment.", "paper_title": "Topology optimization of microstructures of viscoelastic damping materials for a prescribed shear modulus", "paper_id": "WOS:000339944100008"}
