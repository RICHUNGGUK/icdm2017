Liver tissue does not bear mechanical loads, and, in numerical simulation research, is typically assumed to be isotropic. Nevertheless, a typical biological soft tissue is anisotropic. In vitro uniaxial tension and compression experiments were conducted on porcine cylindrical and cubical liver tissue samples respectively assuming a simplistic architecture of liver tissue with its constituent lobule and connective tissues components. With the primary axis perpendicular to the cross sectional surface of samples, the tissue is stiffer with tensile or compressive force in the axial direction compared to that of the transverse direction. At 20% strain, about twice as much force is required to elongate a longitudinal tissue sample than that of a transverse sample. Results of the study suggest that liver tissue is transversely isotropic. A combined strain energy based constitutive equation for transversely isotropic material is proposed. The improved capability of this equation to model the experimental data compared to its previously disclosed isotropic version suggests that the assumption on the fourth invariant in the constitutive equation is probably correct and that anisotropy properties of liver tissue should be considered in surgical simulation.", "paper_title": "Transversely isotropic properties of porcine liver tissue: experiments and constitutive modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000243621200012"}
