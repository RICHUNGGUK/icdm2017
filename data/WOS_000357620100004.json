Therefore they have become one of the most severe threats on the Internet. The core component of botnets is their command and control channel. Botnets often use IRC (Internet Relay Chat) as a communication channel through which the botmaster can control the bots to launch attacks or propagate more infections. In this paper, anomaly score based botnet detection is proposed to identify the botnet activities by using the similarity measurement and the periodic characteristics of botnets. To improve the detection rate, the proposed system employs two-level correlation relating the set of hosts with same anomaly behaviors. The proposed method can differentiate the malicious network traffic generated by infected hosts (bots) from that by normal IRC clients, even in a network with only a very small number of bots. The experiment results show that, regardless the size of the botnet in a network, the proposed approach efficiently detects abnormal IRC traffic and identifies botnet activities.
