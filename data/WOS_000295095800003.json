The GQAP has numerous applications, including facility design, scheduling, and network design. In this paper, we propose several GRASP with path-relinking heuristics for the GQAP using different construction, local search, and path-relinking procedures. We introduce a novel approximate local search scheme, as well as a new variant of path-relinking that deals with infeasibilities. Extensive experiments on a large set of test instances show that the best of the proposed variants is both effective and efficient.", "paper_title": "GRASP with path-relinking for the generalized quadratic assignment problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000295095800003"}
