In contrast to regular video, in which the file content is played sequentially, our design allows multiple nonlinear video sequences of the underlying (linear) video to be stitched together and played in any personalized order, and clients can be provided multiple path choices. The design combines the ideas of HTTP-based adaptive streaming (HAS) and multi-path nonlinear video. Personalization of the content is achieved with the use of a customized metafile, which is downloaded separately from the underlying media and the manifest file that defines the HAS structure. An extension to the user interface allows path choices to be presented to and made by the user. Novel buffer management and prefetching policies are used to ensure seamless uninterrupted playback regardless of client path choices, even under scenarios in which clients defer their choices until the last possible moment. Our solution allows creative home users to easily create their own multi-path nonlinear video, opening the door to an endless possibility of new opportunities and media forms.", "paper_title": "Empowering the Creative User: Personalized HTTP-based Adaptive Streaming of Multi-path Nonlinear Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000327465900011"}
