We present the best possible bound in the case of 0-1 valued loss function. We also provide the tables where the least sample size is calculated that is necessary for obtaining the bound for a given estimation rate and reliability of estimation. For an arbitrary bounded loss function we present the optimal bound approximation with any given accuracy.", "paper_title": "Bounds for validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236576400006"}
