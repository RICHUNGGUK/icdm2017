They can be (and are being) used to monitor large unprotected areas so as to detect intruders as they cross a border or as they penetrate a protected area. We consider the problem of how to optimally move mobile sensors to the fence (perimeter) of a region delimited by a simple polygon in order to detect intruders from either entering its interior or exiting from it. We discuss several related issues and problems, propose two models, provide algorithms and analyze their optimal mobility behavior. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
