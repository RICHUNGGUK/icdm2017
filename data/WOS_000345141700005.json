While not being able to simulate sustained fluid flow, the LAG approach provided similar results as the ALE for moderate levels of compression. However, it was the stiffest approach for larger levels and had numerical issues for extreme compressions. While the ALE did not have these issues, its computing cost was very high, which would be problematic for large models. The CV approach had the lowest computing cost and seemed promising for larger compressions. However, its response was the softest and further investigations are needed to define its dependency to modelling parameters.", "paper_title": "Modelling hollow organs for impact conditions: a simplified case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000345141700005"}
