Using only the MM simulation of the original network, the sensitivities of the scattering parameters with respect to all designable parameters are obtained. The adjoint network method (ANM) is applied to the generalized scattering matrices of the different filter components. This guarantees good accuracy of the calculated sensitivities. The implementation details are discussed for N-resonator ridge waveguide filters. Excellent agreement is obtained between the sensitivities calculated using ANM and those obtained using the expensive central differences. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
