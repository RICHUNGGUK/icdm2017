In such scenarios, distributed compressed video sensing (DCVS), combining distributed video coding (DVC) and compressed sensing (CS), is developed as a novel and powerful signal-sensing and compression algorithm for video signals. In DCVS, video frames can be compressed to a few measurements in a separate manner, while the interframe correlation is explored by the joint recovery algorithm. In this paper, a new DCVS joint recovery scheme using side-information-based belief propagation (SI-BP) is proposed to exploit both the intraframe and interframe correlations, which is particularly efficient over error-prone channels. The DCVS scheme using SI-BP is designed over two frame signal models, the mixture Gaussian (MG) model and the wavelet hidden Markov tree (WHMT) model. Simulation results evaluated on two video sequences illustrate that the SI-BP-based DCVS scheme is error resilient when the measurements are transmitted through the noisy wireless channels.", "paper_title": "Distributed Compressed Video Sensing in Camera Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000313447600001"}
