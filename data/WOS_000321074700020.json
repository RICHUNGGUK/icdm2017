The approach uses dual-activity difference (DAD) maps that represent a visual and quantitative analysis of all pairwise comparisons of one, two, or more substitutions around a molecular template. Scanning the SAR of data sets using DAD maps allows the visual and quantitative identification of activity switches defined as specific substitutions that have an opposite effect on the activity of the compounds against two targets. The approach also rapidly identifies single- and double-target R-cliffs, i.e., compounds where a single or double substitution around the central scaffold dramatically modifies the activity for one or two targets, respectively. The approach introduced in this report can be applied to any analogue series with two biological activity endpoints. To illustrate the approach, we discuss the SAP. of 106 pyrrolidine bis-diketopiperazines tested against two formylpeptide receptors obtained from positional scanning deconvolution methods of mixture-based libraries.", "paper_title": "Rapid Scanning Structure-Activity Relationships in Combinatorial Data Sets: Identification of Activity Switches", "paper_id": "WOS:000321074700020"}
