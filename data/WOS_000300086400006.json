A method for constructing algorithms to resolve this problem is proposed in the case where a semigroup model of programs possesses the left cancellation property h(1)h(2) = h(1)h(3) double right arrow h(2) = h(3). The equivalence checking problem is shown to be decidable in time that polynomially depends on size of the schema being checked if the balanced semigroup model of programs possesses additionally the right cancellation property h(2)h(1) = h(3)h(1) double right arrow h(2) = h(3) .", "paper_title": "On an Equivalence Checking Technique for Algebraic Models of Programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000300086400006"}
