We show that the determinant inherits many properties of the determinant of a matrix. These properties include: solvability of polynomial systems, product formula for the determinant of a block tensor, product formula of the eigenvalues and Gersgorin's inequality. As a simple application, we show that if the leading coefficient tensor of a polynomial system is a triangular tensor with nonzero diagonal elements, then the system definitely has a solution in the complex space. We investigate the characteristic polynomial of a tensor through the determinant and the higher order traces. We show that the k-th order trace of a tensor is equal to the sum of the k-th powers of the eigenvalues of this tensor, and the coefficients of its characteristic polynomial are recursively generated by the higher order traces. Explicit formula for the second order trace of a tensor is given. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
