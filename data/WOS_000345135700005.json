They learn two hyperplanes rather than one as in usual support vector machines and often bring performance improvements. Semi-supervised learning has attracted great attention in machine learning in the last decade. Laplacian support vector machines and Laplacian twin support vector machines have been proposed in the semi-supervised learning framework. In this paper, inspired by the recent success of multi-view learning we propose multi-view Laplacian twin support vector machines, whose dual optimization problems are quadratic programming problems. We further extend them to kernel multi-view Laplacian twin support vector machines. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods are effective.", "paper_title": "Multi-view Laplacian twin support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000345135700005"}
