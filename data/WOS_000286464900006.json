For arbitrary planar graphs, I similar to(n (2)) is the established upper and lower bound on the worst-case area. A long-standing open problem is to determine for what graphs a smaller area can be achieved. We show here that series-parallel graphs can be drawn in O(n (3/2)) area, and outerplanar graphs can be drawn in O(nlog n) area, but 2-outerplanar graphs and planar graphs of proper pathwidth 3 require Omega(n (2)) area. Our drawings are visibility representations, which can be converted to polyline drawings of asymptotically the same area.", "paper_title": "Small Drawings of Outerplanar Graphs, Series-Parallel Graphs, and Other Planar Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000286464900006"}
