In this survey, we analyze the design decisions in the Internet that have created the potential for denial of service attacks. We review the state-of-art mechanisms for defending against denial of service attacks, compare the strengths and weaknesses of each proposal, and discuss potential countermeasures against each defense mechanism. We conclude by highlighting opportunities for an integrated solution to solve the problem of distributed denial of service attacks.", "paper_title": "Survey of network-based defense mechanisms countering the DoS and DDoS problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000245893300003"}
