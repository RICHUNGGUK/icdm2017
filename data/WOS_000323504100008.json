In this paper, we present an approach to model at different spatial scales, using the new concept of Hierarchically Colored Petri Nets (HCPN). We apply HCPN to model a tissue comprising multiple cells hexagonally packed in a honeycomb formation in order to describe the phenomenon of Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling in Drosophila wing. We have constructed a family of related models, permitting different hypotheses to be explored regarding the mechanisms underlying PCP. In addition our models include the effect of well-studied genetic mutations. We have applied a set of analytical techniques including clustering and model checking over time series of primary and secondary data. Our models support the interpretation of biological observations reported in the literature.", "paper_title": "Multiscale Modeling and Analysis of Planar Cell Polarity in the Drosophila Wing", "paper_id": "WOS:000323504100008"}
