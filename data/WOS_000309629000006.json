Two main features are highlighted; deformation prediction based on monitoring data at the first excavation stage and in situ Young's modulus evaluation for sand considering monitoring data at the overall excavation stages. The former tends to establish a reliable method to predict the wall deflection at the critical stage based on the data at the first stage and the latter to enrich the limited database of Young's modulus correlation for sand, specifically applicable for deep excavations analysis. The two constitutive models, linear elastic perfectly plastic and non-linear stress-strain constitutive models, were selected. The stiffness parameters of the models were discretely distributed along the subdivided soil body mesh to reflect the effect of overburden pressure on the in situ soil. In addition, relationship between Standard Penetration Test value (SPT-N value) and Young's modulus and relationships for estimating the in situ Young's modulus of the Kaohsiung sand as a function of depth were evaluated. The results greatly enhanced a framework for estimating the in situ Young's modulus of sand. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
