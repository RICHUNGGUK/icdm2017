The influence of diversity of the perception radius and initial velocity is considered by using a fuzzy-logic-based potential function. A virtual leader is introduced to direct the group to track a desired path. Then the motion of the group is examined with the velocity damping and the mass of all the agents, respectively. By LaSalle's invariant principle, not only the system stability can be guaranteed, but also the desired formation pattern without collisions with given boundary of a multi-agent system can be achieved. Numerical simulations are illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control scheme.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy control of a class of autonomous formation constrained systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000326889800010"}
