The host system is thus endowed with proactive capacities which, in turn, provide a certain environmental intelligence [ 8]. The approach consists of a modelling of contextual information which is based on Semantic Web derived technologies and a description of the structured merging in the form of decision rules. The latter serve to classify situations of interest and subsequently to trigger off the relevant actions at each moment. Elsewhere, the underlying architecture in OCP is designed so that it can function both by centralizing all the contextual information from a central server and by distributing it among consumers and producers of this type of information.", "paper_title": "Information and hybrid architecture model of the OCP contextual information management system", "paper_id": "WOS:000237295500010"}
