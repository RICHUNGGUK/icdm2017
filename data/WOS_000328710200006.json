By the Lyapunov theory and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, the neural network is proved to be globally exponentially convergent to the solution of LVI. Compared with existing neural networks for solving LVI, the proposed one features the ability of solving a class of non-monotone LVI. One numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and the satisfactory performance of the neural network. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
