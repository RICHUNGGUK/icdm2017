Assistive computing devices can help reduce nursing errors by providing timely access to client information and by assisting nurses with client monitoring, decision making, and bedside documentation. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine what assistive computing device features, functions, and input/output modalities nurses would find most useful as support for their nursing duties. Twenty nurses completed a questionnaire that examined their needs and preferences. Data analysis revealed a strong desire for capabilities related to facilitating information access and administering safe medication. The results of this study will be used to develop design criteria for an assistive computing device that will aim to improve the performance of nurses through appropriate information and data support.", "paper_title": "Assistive computing devices - A pilot study to explore nurses' preferences and needs", "paper_id": "WOS:000242190000003"}
