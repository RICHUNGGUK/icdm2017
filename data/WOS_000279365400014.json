No cryptanalytic results have been reported so far. This paper presents a differential attack to break MCS, which requires only seven chosen plaintexts. The complexity of the attack is O(N), where N is the size of plaintext. Experimental results are also given to show the real performance of the proposed attack. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
