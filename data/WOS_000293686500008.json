Personal health records (PHR) and emerging user-adopted communication tools promise to change the landscape of medication management; however, no research has been done to demonstrate how these tools might be constructed to support children with special healthcare needs. The overarching goal of the MyMediHealth project was to investigate ways in which PHRs and supported applications can improve the safety and quality of medication delivery in this population. Design approach: This project employed user-centered design to identify requirements for a child-centered medication management system. We collected information through site visits, facilitated group discussions, and iterative design sessions with adult caregivers. Once design requirements were articulated and validated, we constructed an initial prototype medication scheduler, which was evaluated by 202 parents using scripted activities completed using an online interactive prototype. The results of this analysis informed the development of a working prototype. Status: We have completed a working prototype of a scheduling system, a text-message-based alert and reminder system, and a medication administration record based on web-entered patient data. Implications: Pilot testing of the working prototype by stakeholders yielded strong endorsement and helpful feedback for future modifications, which are now underway as a part of an expanded project to test this system in a real-world environment.
