As the size of the system grows, failure rate increases. Hence for the success and deployability of such large scale systems, scalable checkpointing and recovery protocols need to be implemented. Existing checkpointing and rollback recovery protocols used for providing fault tolerance in distributed systems are not scalable to such large systems. In this paper, we address this important and timely issue and propose a scalable group-based Hybrid Optimistic checkpointing and selective Pessimistic mEssage logging (HOPE) protocol. Performance evaluation indicates, our protocol takes a balanced approach to lower checkpointing and message logging overhead and enhances scalability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
