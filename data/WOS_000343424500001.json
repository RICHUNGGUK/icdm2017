Then, two fuzzy logic controllers, one for optimized green time of traffic lights and one green phase is used for an extended time. In this system, types of sensors is video detection, they are placed strategically at incoming and outgoing legs (lines) and the controller utilize the information received from these sensors to make optimal decisions to minimize the goal function. The simulation results show that TAOSF (Traffic Actuated Optimization Signal Fuzzy control) had a great improvement in 6 different traffic conditions such as certain, uncertain, using random data, and in 4 different traffic conditions using the real case study of OSTANDARI intersection in Mashhad, Iran, in comparison with the fixed time controller, real operation of Australian SCATS (Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System) system, TASFC (Traffic Actuated Signal Fuzzy Control) system in previous work for estimation of the goal function which is minimizing the queue length and the delay time of the vehicles.", "paper_title": "Design optimization traffic light timing using the fuzzy logic at a Diphasic's Isolated intersection", "paper_id": "WOS:000343424500001"}
