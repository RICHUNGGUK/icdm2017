SL can specify properties about the memory heap of programs with singly-linked lists. Separation logic with two record fields is known to be undecidable by reduction of finite satisfiability for classical predicate logic with one binary relation. Surprisingly, we show that second-order logic is as expressive as SL and as a by-product we get undecidability of St.. This is refined by showing that SL without the separating conjunction is as expressive as SL, whence undecidable too. As a consequence, in SL the separating implication (also known as the magic wand) can simulate the separating conjunction. By contrast, we establish that SL without the magic wand is decidable, and we prove a non-elementary complexity by reduction from satisfiability for the first-order theory over finite words. This result is extended with a bounded use of the magic wand that appears in Hoare-style rules. As a generalization, it is shown that kSL, the separation logic over heaps with k >= 1 record fields, is equivalent to kSO, the second-order logic over heaps with k record fields.
