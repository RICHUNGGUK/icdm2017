Most current works solve this problem based on an idea that multiple projects can be simply emerged into a super-project in a deterministic environment, regardless of the project priority and robustness of schedules. This paper discusses the RCMPSP with priority and formulates a discrete bi-objective decision model. A modified NSGA-II based algorithm is presented to solve the model. Furthermore, we design systematic experiments to investigate the interrelationship between robustness and its related project parameters, including order strength, resource constrainedness and uncertainty level. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution algorithm and show that the three parameters indeed have evident impacts on the robustness and makespan of projects.", "paper_title": "Resource-constraint Multi-project Scheduling with Priorities and Uncertain Activity Durations", "paper_id": "WOS:000319190600001"}
