For this, the extended tangential stiffness matrices of the nonlinear frame element as well as the elastic catenary cable element are derived by adding unstrained element lengths to the unknown. A G.TCUD (generalized target configuration under dead loads) method and an unstrained element length method are then proposed to get the minimized bending moment as well as to remove both lateral and axial deformations in the main girder and the tower. Finally the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed schemes are demonstrated through two numerical examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
