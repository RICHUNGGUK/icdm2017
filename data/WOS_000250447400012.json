A new algorithm is developed to obtain the globally optimal solution for scalable source codes of convex rate-fidelity function and for a wide class of erasure channels, including channels for which the probability of losing n packets is monotonically nonincreasing in n, and independent erasure channels with packet erasure rate smaller than 0.5. This is achieved at linear space complexity and near-linear time complexity in the transmission budget, representing significant improvement over the known globally optimal algorithm. When applied to SPIHT compressed images, the results of the proposed algorithm are virtually the same as the global optima. The above success is also extended to UEP packetization of multiple scalable code streams. We improve the existing algorithms in both speed and performance.", "paper_title": "Efficient algorithms for optimal uneven protection of single and multiple scalable code streams against packet erasures", "paper_id": "WOS:000250447400012"}
