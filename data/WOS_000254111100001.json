In this paper, a new routing metric is proposed. It takes into account both energy and delay constraints. It can be used in AODV. By mathematical analysis and simulations, we have shown the efficiency of this new routing metric.", "paper_title": "A new routing metric for satisfying both energy and delay constraints in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000254111100001"}
