Surprisingly, we find that a stricter piracy policy, that increases the perceived cost to using pirated software for end-users, may in some cases lead to an increase in piracy. and a decrease in product quality. The implication for a social planner is that in a monopoly market, an increase in the policy variable, could act as a disincentive for innovation. In a competitive market an increase in the policy variable provides an incentive for innovation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
