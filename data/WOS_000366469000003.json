In this paper, we investigate the problem of saving a video streaming CDN's operating expense, including both its energy cost and the traffic cost. From our measurement study on the CDN infrastructure of Youku, which is the largest video site in China, we find that there exists an inherent conflict between improving a video streaming CDN's energy efficiency for power saving, and maintaining the CDN's ISP-friendly server selection policy. To address this problem, we propose a cost-aware capacity provisioning algorithm, which dynamically plans the service capacities of a CDN's server clusters in numerous ISPs, and optimizes its overall operating cost regarding both the energy consumptions and the cross-ISP traffics. By using the workload derived from real-world measurement and applying actual power and bandwidth price parameters, we show with experiments that our approach can significantly reduce a video streaming CDN's overall operating cost, and avoid frequent server switches effectively. To our best knowledge, this work is the first one that identifies and resolves the inherent conflict between a CDN's energy efficiency and its ISP-friendly policy.", "paper_title": "Cost-Aware Capacity Provisioning for Internet Video Streaming CDNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000366469000003"}
