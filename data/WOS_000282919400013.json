We develop two such methods. The first approach is based on Bayestan single sampling method (BSS) which is able to identify high-rate flows with user-specified false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR) However. since BSS has to record every sampled flow during the measurement period, it is not efficient for memory Therefore, the second novel approach. based on Bayesian double sampling method (BDS) is proposed BDS can remove the lowrate flows and identify the high-rate flows at the first sainpling stage which can reduce the memory cost and identification time respectively. The experimental results show that both BSS and BDS can identify high-rate flows with user-specified FPR and FNR, moreover. BDS outperforms BSS in terms of less memory cost and identification tune.", "paper_title": "IDENTIFYING HIGH-RATE FLOWS WITH USER-SPECIFIED ACCURACY", "paper_id": "WOS:000282919400013"}
