Thanks to ICTs, vessels are no longer cut off from land. The technologies in use in today's fisheries, however, remain fairly rudimentary. This article describes the use of ICTs aboard offshore fishing vessels. It relies on the concepts of 'instruments' and 'usage scheme' defined by Rabardel (Rabardel, P., 1995. Les hommes et les technologies. Paris: Armand Colin) and analyses the use of ICTs in terms of objectives, information sought and communication targets. It points to the prevalence of vessel-to-vessel interchange, and to a frequent use of ICTs to seek out and locate fish. It shows the existence of a 'key instrument', the Inmarsat standard C, and defines the way in which fishermen are organised in cognition-sharing networks.", "paper_title": "The use of information and communication technology in the sea fishing industry", "paper_id": "WOS:000278664600009"}
