Constrained optimization is conducted for maximization of modal loss factors and minimization of weight of sandwich beams and plates with elastic laminated constraining layers and a viscoelastic core, with layer thickness and material and laminate layer ply orientation angles as design variables. The problem is solved using the Direct MultiSearch (DMS) solver for derivative-free multiobjective optimization and solutions are compared with alternative ones obtained using genetic algorithms.
