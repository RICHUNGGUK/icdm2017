In particular, we introduce the notion of \"locally the same states\" (LSS) and prove that two uncorrelated LSS modes are invariant under the mode mixing, i.e. the interaction does not lead to the birth of correlations between the outgoing modes. We also study the interference of orthogonally polarized Gaussian states by means of an interferometric scheme based on a beam splitter, rotators of polarization and polarization filters.", "paper_title": "INTERFERENCE OF MULTI-MODE GAUSSIAN STATES AND \"NON APPEARANCE\" OF QUANTUM CORRELATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000316129600005"}
