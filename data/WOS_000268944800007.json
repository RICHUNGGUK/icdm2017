The design strategies of the broadside-coupling SIW directional coupler are introduced, the series connection of several directional couplers with different coupling ratio then result in a multiway power dividing/combining network. One three-way power dividing/combining network is designed and fabricated to demonstrate the validity of the proposed work, high isolation among the ports is observed.
