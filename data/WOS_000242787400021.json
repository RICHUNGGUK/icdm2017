We suppose that the flow is composed by nonmixing compressible fluids. We propose a dissipative model insuring, for the mixture, the conservation of the mass, the momentum and the total energy. Entropy balances between phases are described by additional nonconservative equations. At the limit of vanishing viscosity the model is still consistent with the entropy balances. The nonlinear projection scheme is used to preserve, at the discrete level, the main properties of the model. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed models for the multicomponent shock tube, the bubble-shock interaction and the tank filling problems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
