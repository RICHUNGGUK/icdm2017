The system consists of one-dimensional array antenna, parallel front-end and a CSOM to deal with complex texture. Experiments demonstrate that the CSOM visualizes successfully a liquid-filled small plastic bottle. The system construction is presented with the adaptive processing dynamics as well as the complex-valued inner product used for determining the winner in the CSOM. It is found that the dynamics shows a higher tolerance on the self-organization coefficient for neighbors beta, showing almost stable self-organization for changes over one order of magnitude, than on that for winners alpha.
