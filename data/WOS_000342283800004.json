Comput. Phys. 230:5957-5973, 2011) is used to survey the space of solutions of the second Painlev, equation that are real on the real axis. This includes well-known solutions such as the Hastings-McLeod and Ablowitz-Segur type of solutions, as well as some novel solutions. The speed and robustness of this pole field solver enable the exploration of pole dynamics in the complex plane as the parameter and initial conditions of the differential equation are varied. Theoretical connection formulas are also verified numerically.", "paper_title": "A Computational Exploration of the Second Painlev, Equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000342283800004"}
