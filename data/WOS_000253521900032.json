In this study, a customer utility prediction system (CUPS) is proposed. The system comprises two modules, namely design knowledge acquisition module and customer utility evaluation module. In the design knowledge acquisition module, a knowledge acquisition technique called general sorting is utilised to establish a design knowledge hierarchy (DKH), in which design options can be generated. In the same module, customer voices towards diverse design options called customer-sensitive design criteria are solicited from customer requirements. Subsequently, in the customer utility evaluation module, a measurement for customer desirability, i.e. customer utility index (CUI), is formulated using conjoint analysis (CA) technique. Finally, the rated criteria are also used as inputs to a radial basis function (RBF) neural network for in-process customer utility prediction. A case study on cellular phone design is used to illustrate the proposed approach. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
