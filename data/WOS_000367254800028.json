Our model integrates the different granularities of parallelism from vector-level parallelism to node-level parallelism into a single, unified model based on OpenACC. It allows programmers to write programs for multiple accelerators using a uniform programming model whether they are in shared or distributed memory systems. We implement a prototype of our model and evaluate its performance with a GPU-based supercomputer using three benchmark applications.", "paper_title": "An OpenACC-Based Unified Programming Model for Multi-accelerator Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000367254800028"}
