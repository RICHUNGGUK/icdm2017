We propose a mechanism that supports secure validation of routing information in the interdomain routing protocol of the Internet. Our mechanism focuses on alleviating obstacles which previously prevent the complete and correct construction of the Internet routing information. In particular, we present a registry with authorized and verifiable search (RAVS) by which routing information can be constructed securely. We give an efficient RAVS scheme and prove its securities in the random oracle model. By our scheme, the routing information can be securely stored and tested without revealing contents of registry entries and search queries. Only legal autonomous systems (ASes) can construct valid registry entries and a single compromised AS can be detected. Our experiment shows that our RAVS scheme can be implemented efficiently and the incurred overhead, in terms of time and space, is acceptable in practice.", "paper_title": "Secure interdomain routing registry", "paper_id": "WOS:000257824200015"}
