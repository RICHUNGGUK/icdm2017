Our experiments show that these features can provide high discriminative value for predicting language dominance from story retells in a Spanish-English bilingual population of children. Moreover, some of our proposed features are even more powerful than measures commonly used by clinical researchers and practitioners for analyzing spontaneous language samples of children. This study shows that the field of natural language processing has the potential to make significant contributions to communication disorders and related areas.", "paper_title": "Analyzing language samples of Spanish-English bilingual children for the automated prediction of language dominance", "paper_id": "WOS:000292277800004"}
