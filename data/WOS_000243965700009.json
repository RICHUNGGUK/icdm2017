We argue that coupling these roles impedes the deployment of new protocols and architectures, and that the future Internet should support two separate entities: infrastructure providers (who manage the physical infrastructure) and service providers (who deploy network protocols and offer end-to-end services). We present a high-level design for Cabo, an architecture that enables this separation; we also describe challenges associated with realizing this architecture.", "paper_title": "How to lease the Internet in your spare time", "paper_id": "WOS:000243965700009"}
