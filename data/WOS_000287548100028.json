Specifically, all the criticalities involved with the correct management of both single clutch and double clutch gear shifts are investigated, and a control system capable of providing good shifting performance in all operating conditions is proposed. Further, to comply with components tolerances and spreads in the production line, an automatic procedure for the end-of-line tuning of the transmission control system is proposed to objectively classify the quality of the gear shift and automatically optimize it. The suitability of the proposed approach is thoroughly tested on an instrumented vehicle. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
