Current treatment options for this condition center around the use of compression therapy delivered by bandages, medical-grade stockings, or pneumatic compression devices. While these forms of therapy can produce dramatic improvements, cost and patient compliance remain an issue. In parallel with this need, wearable, wireless health monitoring systems have recently emerged as a low-cost solution for management of chronic health conditions. To this end, researchers at the Center for Robotics and Intelligent Machines (North Carolina State University) and the Carolon Company (Rural Hall, NC) have proposed an integrated sensing and therapeutic compression module. This article will review technologies related to the design of such a device, as well as provide direction for future research.", "paper_title": "An Overview of Technologies Related to Care for Venous Leg Ulcers", "paper_id": "WOS:000275666100025"}
