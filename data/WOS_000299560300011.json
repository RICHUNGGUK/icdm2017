Most of the recently proposed Trojan detection methods are based on Trojan activation to observe either a faulty output or measurable abnormality on side-channel signals. Time to activate a hardware Trojan circuit is a major concern from the authentication standpoint. This paper analyzes time to generate a transition in functional Trojans. Transition is modeled by geometric distribution and the number of clock cycles required to generate a transition is estimated. Furthermore, a dummy scan flip-flop insertion procedure is proposed aiming at decreasing transition generation time. The procedure increases transition probabilities of nets beyond a specific threshold. The relation between circuit topology, authentication time, and the threshold is carefully studied. The simulation results on s38417 benchmark circuit demonstrate that, with a negligible area overhead, our proposed method can significantly increase Trojan activity and reduce Trojan activation time.", "paper_title": "A Novel Technique for Improving Hardware Trojan Detection and Reducing Trojan Activation Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000299560300011"}
