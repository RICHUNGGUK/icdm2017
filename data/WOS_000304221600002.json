Unlike the most previous works following the idea of co-training, in this paper we propose a new generative model for Multi-view Learning via Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis, called MVPLSA. In this model, we jointly model the co-occurrences of features and documents from different views. Specifically, in the model there are two latent variables y for the latent topic and z for the document cluster, and three visible variables d for the document, for the feature, and nu for the view label. The conditional probability p(z vertical bar d), which is independent of nu, is used as the bridge to share knowledge among multiple views. Also, we have p(y vertical bar z, nu) and p(J vertical bar y, nu), which are dependent of nu, to capture the specifical structures inside each view. Experiments are conducted on four real-world data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
