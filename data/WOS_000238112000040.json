By utilizing inequality techniques, we obtain sufficient conditions for the existence and asymptotic stability of an equilibrium point and estimate the region of existence and the attraction domain of the equilibrium point. A numerical example is given to illustrate our theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic stability of second-order discrete-time Hopfield neural networks with variable delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000040"}
