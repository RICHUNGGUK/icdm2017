In contrast to the original scheme, we provide flexible explicit controls of the shape, size, orientation and feature alignment of the quadrangular faces. We achieve this by proper selection of the optimal eigenvalue (shape), by adaption of the area term in the Laplacian operator (size), and by adding special constraints to the Laplace eigenproblem (orientation and alignment). By solving a generalized eigenproblem we can generate a scalar field on the mesh whose MorseSmale complex is of high quality and satisfies all the user requirements. The final quadrilateral mesh is generated from the MorseSmale complex by computing a globally smooth parametrization. Here we additionally introduce edge constraints to preserve user specified feature lines accurately.", "paper_title": "Spectral Quadrangulation with Orientation and Alignment Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000266986100041"}
