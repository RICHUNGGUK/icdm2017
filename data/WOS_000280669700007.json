Both types of models are widely used in practice. Design/methodology/approach - Both regime-switching models and GARCH are used in this paper to model and explain the behavior of crude oil prices in order to forecast their volatility. In regime-switching models, the oil return volatility has a dynamic process whose mean is subject to shifts, which is governed by a two-state first-order Markov process. Findings - The GARCH models are found to be very useful in modeling a unique stochastic process with conditional variance; regime-switching models have the advantage of dividing the observed stochastic behavior of a time series into several separate phases with different underlying stochastic processes. Originality/value - The regime-switching models show similar goodness-of-fit result to GARCH modeling, while has the advantage of capturing major events affecting the oil market.
