Being a roadmap method for path generation, the Voronoi tessellation is employed as a preprocessor to roughly fit a connection between the initial and goal configurations. Though the Voronoi path is safe for obstacle avoidance, its disjoint linear edges are unsatisfactory when smoothness is requested. Hence, an S V M postprocessor is proposed to make the segmented path smoother. By analogue to the Gaussian potential field, a zero-potential curve in the configuration space is thus obtained by the SVM postprocessor and forms a safe and smooth path. Due to advantages of the SVM with RBF kernel, the post-processed path has the merits of both smoothness from the Gaussian kernel basis, and wide clearance from the large-margin decision boundary. This paper adopts point configurations to represent obstacles in the working space. With additional artificial points for auxiliary constraints, the two-stage path planner is then developed. Detailed property investigations and simulated applications are also included to characterize the path planner. The results of a practical demonstration show a promising future for further applications.", "paper_title": "SAFE AND SMOOTH: MOBILE AGENT TRAJECTORY SMOOTHING BY SVM", "paper_id": "WOS:000306679700003"}
