We propose two novel algorithms for computing square roots over even field extensions of the form F-q2, with q= p(n), an odd prime and n >= 1. Both algorithms have an associate computational cost roughly equivalent to one exponentiation in F-q2. The first algorithm is devoted to the case when q equivalent to 1 mod 4, whereas the second one handles the case when q equivalent to 3 and 4. Numerical comparisons show that the two algorithms presented in this paper are competitive and in some cases more efficient than the square root methods previously known.", "paper_title": "Square Root Computation over Even Extension Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000343887700015"}
