The governing system of equations is a coupled hyperbolic-elliptic system in moving and geometrically complex domains. The numerical algorithm employs the method of front tracking and the Riemann problem for material interfaces, second order Godunov-type hyperbolic solvers, and the embedded boundary method for the elliptic problem in complex domains. The numerical algorithm has been implemented as an MHD extension of FronTier, a hydrodynamic code with free interface support. The code is applicable for numerical simulations of free surface flows of conductive liquids or weakly ionized plasmas. The code has been validated through the comparison of numerical simulations of a liquid metal jet in a non-uniform magnetic field with experiments and theory. Simulations of the Muon Collider/Neutrino Factory target have also been discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
