The operation needs to be constantly monitored to prevent any structural failures. Data acquisition should provide information on whether the operation is being executed safely. This study investigated an automated data acquisition using the Ubiquitous Sensor Network (USN) technology. State-of-the-art technologies have been integrated for collecting data in a local wireless network. An experiment on a test bed showed that data values were effectively transmitted through a local wireless network from the USN nodes to a host PC. The data were compared with allowable limits for deflection, strain, and inclination, and the comparison provided useful information on the behavior of the temporary structure. Results of the test bed and construction site experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the USN-based data acquisition system for monitoring concrete formwork operations.
