We present a language and design environment called GEZEL that can be used for the design, verification and implementation of such coprocessor-based systems. The GEZEL environment creates a platform simulator by combining a hardware simulation kernel with one or more instruction-set simulators. The hardware part of the platform is programmed in GEZEL, a deterministic, cycle-true and implementation-oriented hardware description language. GEZEL designs are scripted, allowing the hardware configuration of the platform simulator to be changed quickly without going through lengthy recompiles. For this reason, we call the environment interactive. We present the execution ladder as an optimization framework to balance interactivity against simulation speed. We demonstrate our approach using several designs including an AES encryption coprocessor and a Viterbi decoding coprocessor. We discuss the advantages of our approach as opposed to more conventional approaches using SystemC and Verilog/VHDL.", "paper_title": "An interactive codesign environment for domain-specific coprocessors", "paper_id": "WOS:000236871100005"}
