However, planning in large environments such as the civil airspace has not been addressed extensively. In this paper we apply a heuristic incremental interpolation-based search algorithm with efficient replanning capabilities to the path planning problem for a fixed-wing aircraft operating in a natural environment to plan and re-plan long flight paths. We modified the algorithm to account for the minimum turning radius and the limited flight path angles of a fixed-wing aircraft. Additionally, we present a method to consider a desired minimum cruising altitude and a post-processing algorithm to improve the path and remove unnecessary path points. These properties specific to aircraft operation could not be addressed with the original algorithm. Simulation results show that the planner produces intuitive, short paths and is capable of exploiting previous planning efforts, when unknown obstacles are encountered.", "paper_title": "Improved 3D Interpolation-Based Path Planning for a Fixed-Wing Unmanned Aircraft", "paper_id": "WOS:000342212600011"}
