Unfortunately, current WLAN standards like IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) lack this ability. Work is in progress to define an enhanced version capable of supporting QoS for multimedia traffic at the MAC layer. In this paper, we aim at gaining insight into three mechanisms to differentiate among traffic categories, i.e., differentiating the minimum contention window size, the Inter-Frame Spacing (IFS), and the length of the packet payload according to the priority of different traffic categories. We propose an analysis model to compute the throughput and packet transmission delays. In addition, we derive approximations to obtain simpler but more meaningful relationships among different parameters. Comparisons with discrete-event simulation results show that good accuracy of performance evaluation can be achieved by using the proposed analysis model.", "paper_title": "Supporting service differentiation with enhancements of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol: Models and analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000250557500007"}
