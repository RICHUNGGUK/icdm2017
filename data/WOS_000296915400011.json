Compared to the standard motion splicing problem, motion space splicing imposes new challenges as both the upper and lower body motions might not be known in advance. Our technique is the first motion (space) splicing technique that propagates temporal and spatial properties of the lower-body locomotion to the newly generated upper-body motion and vice versa. Whereas existing techniques only adapt the upper-body motion to fit the lower-body motion, our technique also adapts the lower-body locomotion based on the upper body task for a more coherent full-body motion. In this paper, we will show that our decoupled approach is able to generate high-fidelity full-body motion for interactive applications such as games.", "paper_title": "Flexible Splicing of Upper-Body Motion Spaces on Locomotion", "paper_id": "WOS:000296915400011"}
