However, absorptive capacity is necessary but not sufficient to full understanding of knowledge transfer. In this paper we argue that knowledge senders' disseminative capacity, i.e, the ability of knowledge holders to efficiently, effectively, and convincingly frame knowledge in a way that other people can Understand accurately and put into practice, plays an equally important role in knowledge transfer process. We examine this argument by employing a single-layer perceptron neural network model (SLPM) in a simulation study with two different network structures to get robust results. We demonstrate that both the disseminative capacity of knowledge senders and the absorptive capacity of knowledge recipients play important roles in knowledge transfer. Also, we found that the prominent knowledge holder plays a paramount role in knowledge transfer under quite different organizational structures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
