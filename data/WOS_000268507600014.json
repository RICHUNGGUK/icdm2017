Furthermore, we introduce the general multi-objective decision-making model under a birandom environment, and transform the birandom uncertain model into a deterministic model through an expected value operator, and some properties of the expected value model are also researched. We extend some theories of birandom variables, and especially devote ourselves to researching the expected value of two kinds of birandom variables. The expected value goal model is also proposed. In order to compute the expected value of birandom variables, birandom simulation is presented. Combined with the genetic algorithm, it is applied in dealing with objective functions and constraint functions, and to obtain the optimal solution. Finally, an application to flow shop scheduling at GEELY Haoqing automatic company is provided as an illustration. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
