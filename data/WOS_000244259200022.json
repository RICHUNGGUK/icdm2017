It can be used to reconcile a set of unrooted gene trees with a rooted species tree or a set of rooted species trees. Moreover, it computes detailed distribution of gene duplications and gene losses in a species tree. It can be used to infer optimal species phylogenies for a given set of gene trees. URec is implemented in C++ and can be easily compiled under Unix and Windows systems.", "paper_title": "URec: a system for unrooted reconciliation", "paper_id": "WOS:000244259200022"}
