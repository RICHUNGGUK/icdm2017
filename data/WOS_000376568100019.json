For ensuring secure cross domains to access resources among these computers in different domains, this paper proposes a multi-domain union authentication protocol. The protocol adopts blind signature to achieve mutual authentication among entities in different domains. This scheme overcomes the complexity of certificate transmission and the network bottlenecks in the scheme of PKI-based. It can trace the entity identity and supports two-way entities anonymous authentication, which avoid the authority counterfeiting its member to access other domain's resources. Analysis shows that its advantages on security and communication-consumption.", "paper_title": "Inter-domain Alliance Authentication Protocol Based on Blind Signature", "paper_id": "WOS:000376568100019"}
