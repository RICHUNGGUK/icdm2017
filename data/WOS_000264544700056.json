Such capabilities may include edits that both preserve existing structure as well as synthesize entirely new structures based on the extracted pattern rules. In this paper we show how to detect regular symmetries and arrangement along curved segments in vector art. We determine individual elements in the art by using the transformation similarity for sequences of sample points on the input curves. Then we detect arrangements of those elements along an arbitrary curved path. We can un-warp the arrangement path to detect symmetries near the path. We introduce novel applications inform of editing elements that are arranged along a curved path. This includes their sliding along the path, changing of their spacing, or their scale. We also allow the user to brush the elements that the system recognized along new paths.", "paper_title": "Detecting Symmetries and Curvilinear Arrangements in Vector Art", "paper_id": "WOS:000264544700056"}
