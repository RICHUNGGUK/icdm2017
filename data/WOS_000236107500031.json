Colay complementary sets have been proposed to tackle this problem. In this paper, we develop several theorems which can be used to construct Golay complementary sets and multipleshift complementary sets from Reed-Muller codes. We show that the result of Davis and Jedwab on Golay complementary sequences and those of Paterson and Schmidt on Colay complementary sets can be considered as special cases of our results.", "paper_title": "Complementary sets and Reed-Muller codes for peak-to-average power ratio reduction in OFDM", "paper_id": "WOS:000236107500031"}
