Recently Heinrich and Milla (2008) [4] presented an order optimal randomized algorithm solving this problem for gamma-smooth input data (i.e. gamma = r + rho: the r-th derivatives off satisfy a rho-Holder condition). This algorithm uses function values and values of derivatives of f. In this paper we present an order optimal randomized algorithm for the class of gamma-smooth functions that uses only values off. For this purpose we show how to obtain an order optimal randomized algorithm from an order (sub)optimal deterministic one. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
