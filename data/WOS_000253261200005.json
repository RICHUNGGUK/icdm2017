The asymptotic distribution can be used to derive asymptotic confidence intervals when AVaR,(X) is calculated by the Monte Carlo method which is adopted in many risk management systems. We study the effect of the tail behavior of the random variable X on the convergence rate and the improvement of a tail truncation method.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic distribution of the sample average value-at-risk", "paper_id": "WOS:000253261200005"}
