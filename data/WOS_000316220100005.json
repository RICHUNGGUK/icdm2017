The reason behind this fact is not farfetched-the objective of any field development exercise is to maximize the total hydrocarbon recovery, which for all intents and purposes, can be measured by an economic criterion such as the net present value of the reservoir during its estimated operational life-cycle. Since the cost of drilling and completion of wells can be significantly high (millions of dollars), there is need for some form of operational and economic justification of potential well configuration, so that the ultimate purpose of maximizing production and asset value is not defeated in the long run. The problem, however, is that well optimization problems are by no means trivial. Inherent drawbacks include the associated computational cost of evaluating the objective function, the high dimensionality of the search space, and the effects of a continuous range of geological uncertainty. In this paper, the differential evolution (DE) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms are applied to well placement problems. The results emanating from both algorithms are compared with results obtained by applying a third algorithm called hybrid particle swarm differential evolution (HPSDE)-a product of the hybridization of DE and PSO algorithms. Three cases involving the placement of vertical wells in 2-D and 3-D reservoir models are considered. In two of the three cases, a max-mean objective robust optimization was performed to address geological uncertainty arising from the mismatch between real physical reservoir and the reservoir model. We demonstrate that the performance of DE and PSO algorithms is dependent on the total number of function evaluations performed; importantly, we show that in all cases, HPSDE algorithm outperforms both DE and PSO algorithms. Based on the evidence of these findings, we hold the view that hybridized metaheuristic optimization algorithms (such as HPSDE) are applicable in this problem domain and could be potentially useful in other reservoir engineering problems.", "paper_title": "Hybrid differential evolution and particle swarm optimization for optimal well placement", "paper_id": "WOS:000316220100005"}
