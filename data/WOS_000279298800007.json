The aim of this study was to investigate, by using a model of a fiber of the AN the influence of CI stimulation settings (i.e., stimulation rate and stimulus magnitude) and fiber spontaneous activity on the enhancement of stochastic firing when CI stimuli are combined with noise. Results showed that the stimulation rate had an effect on the enhancement of stochastic firing in the AN, whereas the stimulus magnitude and the spontaneous firing rate had no influence.
