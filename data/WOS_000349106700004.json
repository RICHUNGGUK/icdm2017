We claim that the adaptation introduced by a transmission control protocol congestion control mechanism is interpretable as the self-organization of complex itinerant behavior among many quasi-attracting states. To discuss this argument quantitatively, we study the adaptation of the Internet by simulating a PSN using ns-2. Our hypothesis is that the robustness and fragility of the Internet can be attributed to the inherent dynamics of the PSN feedback mechanism called the congestion window size, or cwnd. By varying the data input into the PSN system, we demonstrate the possible self-organization of attractors in cwnd temporal dynamics and discuss the adaptability and robustness of PSNs. The present study provides an example of Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety in action.", "paper_title": "Dynamic homeostasis in packet switching networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000349106700004"}
