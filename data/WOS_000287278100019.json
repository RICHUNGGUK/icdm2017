The hybrid scheme is a combined lossless and lossy hiding with considerations on acceptable distortions. The secret data was first embedded lossless in the complex image blocks and any amounts exceeding would be lossy embedded based on optimal bitmap replacement on the smooth image blocks. The amount of hiding is adjustable based on the acceptable PSNRs. The embedded secret bits can be extracted directly from the compressed domain without the original cover image. Experimental results showed that the visual quality of reconstructed images had significantly higher PSNRs. Test results from eight images showed an average gain of 0.05 bpp in payloads. Furthermore, the recovered images showed significantly higher PSNRs for the same amount of payloads. For example, Lena showed a gain of 3.9 dB and 1.4 dB under the embedding capacity 0.2 bpp and 0.8 bpp, respectively.", "paper_title": "STEGANOGRAPHY FOR BLOCK TRUNCATION CODING COMPRESSED IMAGES USING HYBRID EMBEDDING SCHEME", "paper_id": "WOS:000287278100019"}
