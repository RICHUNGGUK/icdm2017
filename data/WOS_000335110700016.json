Meanwhile, with the help of the compression-decompression functions, we extend the local protocol and propose a global consensus algorithm for such manifolds. Furthermore, to demonstrate their effectiveness and efficiency, the global algorithm is applied to the consensus problem of rotation attitudes, together with a case simulation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
