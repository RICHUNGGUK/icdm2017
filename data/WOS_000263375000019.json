These systems are approximated by uncertain linear networked Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) models with both network-induced delay and data packet dropout. Sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of a fuzzy controllers. Then, an iterative algorithm for the controller design is proposed. A control problem of a flexible-joint robot arm system is studied to show the effectiveness of the iterative algorithm.", "paper_title": "On Designing Fuzzy Controllers for a Class of Nonlinear Networked Control Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000263375000019"}
