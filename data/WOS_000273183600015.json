As a result. a BKP equation with self-consistent Sources (ESCS) and a m-BKP ESCS are derived. It is also proved that the bilinear m-BKP ESCS constitutes a bilinear Backlund transformation for the BKP ESCS. This means that the commutativity between the source generation procedure and Backlund transformation is valid for the BKP equation. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
