Many of these grids have sought to improve efficiency by processing multiple grid projects using the same network infrastructure and grid participants. This presents challenges for integrating projects in a manner such that public acceptance is greatest. The results suggest that both the order in which the individual projects are introduced and the manner in which the projects are integrated are both important determinants of public acceptance.", "paper_title": "The impact of public grid computing portfolio composition on adoption intentions", "paper_id": "WOS:000242362800003"}
