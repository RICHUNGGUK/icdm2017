Although many detection methods have been proposed, there exist high false alarms because of the interference of fire-colored moving object in the complex environments. In this paper, a hybrid method is proposed. First, we get the set of candidate fire regions. Then these candidate fire regions are analyzed to exclude the fire-colored moving object. Our contributions are using the hidden Markov model (HMM) based on spatio-temporal feature and the variance of luminance map motivated by visual attention, and combining both for fire detection. The wrong detection can be reduced greatly. Experiment results show our proposed method has a good performance and it is robust to be used in complex environment compared with previous algorithms.
