The segmentation algorithm is based on Bayesian Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation. The advantages of this separate approach are the adaptation of the prior to the contents creation process (e. g., superimposing two handwritten pages), and the improvement of the estimation of the recto pixels through an estimation of the verso pixels covered by recto pixels; moreover, the formulation as a binary labeling problem with two hidden labels per pixels naturally leads to an efficient optimization method based on the minimum cut/maximum flow in a graph. The proposed method is evaluated on scanned document images from the 18th century, showing an improvement of character recognition results compared to other restoration methods.", "paper_title": "Document Ink Bleed-Through Removal with Two Hidden Markov Random Fields and a Single Observation Field", "paper_id": "WOS:000273609600004"}
