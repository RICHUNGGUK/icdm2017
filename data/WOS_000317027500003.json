We believe multimedia can play a key role in improving how educators acquire, master, and prepare to implement evidence-based reading instruction in any nation. One multimedia-based instructional practice, Content Acquisition Podcasts (CAPs), utilizes Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (2009) to ensure the looks and sounds of instruction help reduce extraneous cognitive load while maximizing active cognitive processes. In this empirical study, researchers randomly assigned 148 participants (education and non-education university students) to either watch a CAP or read a practitioner friendly article on PA and PA instruction. The dependent variable is an instrument that measures knowledge- and skill-based items related to PA and PA instruction. Results demonstrate a significant main effect and large effect size for the CAP group on the posttest and, several weeks later, a maintenance probe. Findings indicate that multimedia instructional tools, such as CAPs, may benefit undergraduates as they acquire necessary knowledge and skills that underwrite advanced practices for teaching students in general and special education settings.
