By numerical simulations, the flux-density relations are investigated in detail. It can be found that the flux-density curves of m-vehicle flow can be classified into two types, corresponding to small and large density regions of nm-vehicles, respectively. In small density region of nm-vehicles, the maximum flux as well as the critical density decreases with the increase of nm-vehicle density. Similar characteristics can also be found in large density region of nm-vehicles. However, compared with the former case, the maximum flux is much lower, the phase transition from free flow to congested flow becomes continuous and thus the corresponding critical points are nonexistent. The flux-density curves of nm-vehicle flow can also be classified into two types. And interestingly, the maximum flux and the corresponding density decrease first and keep constant later as the density of m-vehicle increases. Finally, the total transport capacity of the system is investigated. The results show that the maximum capacity can be reached at appropriate proportions for m-vehicles and nm-vehicles, which induces a controlling method to promote the capacity of mixed traffic flow.", "paper_title": "COMBINED CELLULAR AUTOMATON MODEL FOR MIXED TRAFFIC FLOW WITH NON-MOTORIZED VEHICLES", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612800002"}
