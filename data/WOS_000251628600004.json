In this article a model for automated planning in reactive environments, based on numerical planning, is introduced. A planner system, based on mixed integer linear programming techniques, which implements the model, is also presented. The planner is able to reason about the dynamic features of the environment and to produce solution plans, which take into account reactive devices and their causal relations with agent's goals by exploitation and avoidance techniques, to reach a given goal state. The introduction of reactive domains in planning poses some issues concerning reasoning patterns which are briefly depicted. Experiments of planning in reactive domains are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Planning in reactive environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000251628600004"}
