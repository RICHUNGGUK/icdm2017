We prove that typical unsolvable problems are decidable in infinity. We hypothesize that all undecidable problems can be reduced in infinity to each other, i.e., they are H-complete (hypercomputation complete). We propose also two other classes: U-complete (universal complete) and D-complete (diagonalization complete) that use asymptotic reduction and allow separate non-RE and RE non-recursive undecidable classes.", "paper_title": "On Hypercomputation, Universal and Diagonalization Complete Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000358735200001"}
