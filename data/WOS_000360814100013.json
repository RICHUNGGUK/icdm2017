Unlike the deblurring schemes that discard saturated regions when estimating blur kernels, this paper proposes a novel scheme to deduce blur kernels from saturated regions via a novel kernel representation and advanced algorithms. Our key technical contribution is the proposed function-form representation of blur kernels, which regularizes existing matrix-form kernels using three functional components: 1) trajectory; 2) intensity; and 3) expansion. From automatically detected saturated regions, their skeleton, brightness, and width are fitted into the corresponding three functional components of blur kernels. Such regularization significantly improves the quality of kernels deduced from saturated regions. Second, we propose an energy minimizing algorithm to select and assign the deduced function-form kernels to partitioned image regions as the initialization for non-uniform deblurring. Finally, we convert the assigned function-form kernels into matrix form for more detailed estimation in a multi-scale deconvolution. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms existing schemes on challenging real examples.", "paper_title": "Deblurring Saturated Night Image With Function-Form Kernel", "paper_id": "WOS:000360814100013"}
