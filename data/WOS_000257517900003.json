The approach is based on a method of special Grobner bases with respect to \"generalized term orders\" on N-m x Z(n) and on difference-differential modules. We define a special type of reduction for two generalized term orders in a free left module over a ring of difference-differential operators. Then the concept of relative Grobner bases w.r.t. two generalized term orders is defined. An algorithm for constructing these relative Grobner bases is presented and verified. Using relative Grobner bases, we are able to compute difference-differential dimension polynomials in two variables. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
