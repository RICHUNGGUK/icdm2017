However, when the segment fails to separate each character from the others, those methods will not function properly. Sometimes the container code characters are printed or arranged very closely, which makes it a challenge to isolate each character. To address this issue, a new framework for automatic container code recognition (ACCR) in visual images is proposed in this paper. In this framework, code-character regions are first located by applying a horizontal high-pass filter and scan line analysis. Then, character blocks are extracted from the code-character regions and further classified into two categories, i.e. single-character block and multi-character block. Finally, a segmentation-based approach is implemented for recognition of the characters in single-character blocks, and a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based method is proposed for the multi-character blocks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can successfully recognize the container code with closely arranged characters.", "paper_title": "A New Framework for Container Code Recognition by Using Segmentation-Based and HMM-Based Approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000347966200004"}
