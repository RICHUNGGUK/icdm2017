The model provides security access control to extend the search capabilities. The scalable model can integrate other ontology providing the general ontology as the transformation interface. We combine text Information Retrieval (IR) with semantic inference in the model. So it can not only search the resources and the relationships between them according to the user's privileges, but also locate the exact resource using text IR. We build a security ontology based on Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policy. A semantic search system Onto-SSSE is implemented based on the model. The system can perform some complex queries using ontology reasoning, especially about association queries such as the relationships between resources. The evaluation shows that the new system performs better than exiting methods.", "paper_title": "A semantic search conceptual model and application in security access control", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800037"}
