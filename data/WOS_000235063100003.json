By contrast, these perturbations could be eliminated when the measurements are performed in parallel, that is, when the parameters are measured simultaneously. This result confirms the existence of physical systems with the property that certain operations on them can be performed successfully in parallel but not sequentially.", "paper_title": "A parallel approach eliminates measurement perturbations in RLC circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000235063100003"}
