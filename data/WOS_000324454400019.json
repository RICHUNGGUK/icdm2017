The paper also compares the two new bibliometric measures with two existing ISI metrics, namely Total Citations and the 5-Year Impact Factor (5YIF) (including journal self citations) of a journal. It is shown that the Sciences and Social Sciences are different in terms of the strength of the relationship of journal performance metrics, although the actual relationships are very similar. Moreover, the Journal Influence and Article Influence journal performance metrics are shown to be closely related empirically to the two existing ISI metrics, and hence add little in practical usefulness to what is already known, except for eliminating the pressure arising from coercive journal self citations. These empirical results are compared with existing results in the bibliometrics literature. (C) 2013 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
