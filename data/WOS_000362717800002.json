We propose an algorithm to get a bound from below for this spectral radius in Cayley graphs with finitely many cone types (including for instance hyperbolic groups). In the genus 2 surface group, it improves by an order of magnitude the previous best bound, due to Bartholdi.", "paper_title": "A Numerical Lower Bound for the Spectral Radius of Random Walks on Surface Groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000362717800002"}
