Over the past decades, several generations of ADP design have been proposed in the literature, which have demonstrated many successful applications in various benchmarks and industrial applications. While many of the existing researches focus on multiple-inputs-single-output system with steepest descent search, in this paper we investigate a generalized multiple-input-multiple-output (GMIMO) ADP design for online learning and control, which is more applicable to a wide range of practical real-world applications. Furthermore, an improved weight-updating algorithm based on recursive Levenberg-Marquardt methods is presented and embodied in the GMIMO approach to improve its performance. Finally, we test the performance of this approach based on a practical complex system, namely, the learning and control of the tension and height of the looper system in a hot strip mill. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve effective and robust performance.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Learning and Control for MIMO System Based on Adaptive Dynamic Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000293442800012"}
