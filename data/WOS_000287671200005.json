It also improves the communication bandwidth and thereby decreases the reconfiguration time. Existing research in this field has explored two directions: efficient compression with slow decompression or fast decompression at the cost of compression efficiency. This paper proposes a novel decode-aware compression technique to improve both compression and decompression efficiencies. The three major contributions of this paper are: 1) smart placement of compressed bitstreams that can significantly decrease the overhead of decompression engine; 2) selection of profitable parameters for bitstream compression; and 3) efficient combination of bitmask-based compression and run length encoding of repetitive patterns. Our proposed technique outperforms the existing compression approaches by 15%, while our decompression hardware for variable-length coding is capable of operating at the speed closest to the best known field-programmable gate array-based decoder for fixed-length coding.", "paper_title": "Decoding-Aware Compression of FPGA Bitstreams", "paper_id": "WOS:000287671200005"}
