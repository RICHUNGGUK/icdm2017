The traditional CBR algorithm, however, is inappropriate to deal with complicated problems and therefore needs to be further revised. This study thus proposes a next-generation CBR (GCBR) model and algorithm. GCBR presents as a new problem-solving paradigm that is a case-based recommender mechanism for assisting decision making. GCBR can resolve decision-making problems by using hierarchical criteria architecture (HCA) problem representation which involves multiple decision objectives on each level of hierarchical, multiple-level decision criteria, thereby enables decision makers to identify problems more precisely. Additionally, the proposed GCBR can also provide decision makers with series of cases in support of these multiple decision-making stages. GCBR furthermore employs a genetic algorithm in its implementation in order to reduce the effort involved in case evaluation. This study found experimentally that using GCBR for making travel-planning recommendations involved approximately 80% effort than traditional CBR, and therefore concluded that GCBR should be the next generation of case-based reasoning algorithms and can be applied to actual case-based recommender mechanism implementation.
