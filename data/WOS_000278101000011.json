In this paper, we propose a method for image deblurring in tight frame domains. It is reduced to finding a sparse solution of a system of linear equations whose coefficient matrix is rectangular. Then, a modified version of the linearized Bregman iteration proposed and analyzed in [J.-F. Cai, S. Osher, and Z. Shen, Math. Comp., to appear, UCLA CAM Report (08-52), 2008; J.-F. Cai, S.

Numerical examples show that the method is very simple to implement, robust to noise, and effective for image deblurring.", "paper_title": "Linearized Bregman Iterations for Frame-Based Image Deblurring", "paper_id": "WOS:000278101000011"}
