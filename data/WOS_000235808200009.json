On the basis of matrix sum-of-squares decompositions, we suggest a systematic procedure to construct a family of linear matrix inequality relaxations for computing upper bounds on the optimal value of the corresponding robust counterpart. With a novel matrix-version of Putinar's sum-of-squares representation for positive polynomials on compact semi-algebraic sets, we prove asymptotic exactness of the relaxation family under a suitable constraint qualification. If the uncertainty region is a compact polytope, we provide a new duality proof for the validity of Putinar's constraint qualification with an a priori degree bound on the polynomial certificates. Finally, we point out the consequences of our results for constructing relaxations based on the so-called full-block S-procedure, which allows to apply recently developed tests in order to computationally verify the exactness of possibly small-sized relaxations.", "paper_title": "Matrix sum-of-squares relaxations for robust semi-definite programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000235808200009"}
