The proposed algorithm, based on a modified Lie formula, is used to convert the solution of the transmission line network into delay algebraic equations to obtain the time domain response. The proposed algorithm is not limited to fixed number of coupled RLC lines or to specific topologies and can be used to model both identical and nonidentical multiconductor lines and loads. For the example presented in this paper, the 50% delay and crosstalk using the proposed method agrees with SPICE results to within 0.75% average error.", "paper_title": "Efficient Delay and Crosstalk Modeling of RLC Interconnects Using Delay Algebraic Equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000286515100018"}
