To accurately track the phase interface location, an auxiliary, high-resolution equidistant Cartesian grid is introduced. In conjunction with a dual-layer narrow band approach, this refined level set grid method allows for parallel, efficient grid convergence and error estimation studies of the interface tracking method. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved on an unstructured flow solver grid with a novel balanced force algorithm for level set methods based on the recently proposed method by Francois et al. [M.M. Francois, SJ. Cummins, E.D. Dendy, D.B. Kothe, J.M. Sicilian, M.W. Williams, A balanced-force algorithm for continuous and sharp interfacial surface tension models within a volume tracking framework, J. Comput. Phys. 213 (2006) 141-173] for volume of fluid methods on structured grids. To minimize spurious currents, a second order converging curvature evaluation technique for level set methods is presented. The results of several different test cases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing good mass conservation properties and second order converging spurious current magnitudes.
