We derive local limit theorems for the joint distribution of the number of vertices and the number of edges in the largest component of H-d(n, p) and H-d(n, m) in the regime (d - 1) ((n)(1)(d)(-1))p > 1 + epsilon, resp. d(d - 1)m/n > 1 + epsilon, where epsilon > 0 is arbitrarily small but fixed as n -> infinity. The proofs are based on a purely probabilistic approach.", "paper_title": "Local Limit Theorems for the Giant Component of Random Hypergraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000338294000002"}
