The model is derived from first-principles and some empirical relationships. The final validated nonlinear model could provide a useful offline platform for developing control and monitoring algorithms. A new controller is designed which has a similar structure to that of Internal Model Control (IMC) with the addition of an observer whose gain is designed to minimize process and model mismatch. The observer gain is obtained by solving a multiobjective optimization problem through the application of a genetic algorithm. The controller is applied to the nonlinear model and simulation results are presented demonstrating improvements that can be achieved by the proposed controller over two existing CD controllers.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Control of a Plastic Film Manufacturing Web Process", "paper_id": "WOS:000290414000003"}
