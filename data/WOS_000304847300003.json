The contribution of this work is to develop a global exponential range observer which can be used for a larger set of camera motions than existing observers. The observer is shown to be robust against external disturbances in the sense that the observer is (sic)(p)for all p is an element of [1, infinity] stable even if the target object is moving or the camera motion is perturbed. The presented observer identifies the range provided an observability condition commonly used in literature is satisfied and is shown to be exponentially stable even if camera motion satisfies a less restrictive observability condition. A sufficient condition on the observer gain is derived to prove stability using a Lyapunov-based analysis. Experimental results are provided to show robust performance of the observer using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
