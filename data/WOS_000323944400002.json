Our LDNE method can simultaneously consider both 'locality' of locality preserving projection (LPP) and 'discrimination' of discriminant neighborhood embedding (DNE) in manifold learning. It can find an embedding that not only preserves local information to explore the intrinsic submanifold structure of data from the same class, but also enhances the discrimination among submanifolds from different classes. To investigate the performance of LDNE, we compare it with the state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction techniques such as LPP and DNE on publicly available datasets. Experimental results show that our LDNE can be an effective and robust method for classification.", "paper_title": "Locality-Based Discriminant Neighborhood Embedding", "paper_id": "WOS:000323944400002"}
