The null distribution of this test statistic is usually approximated by its limit, the asymptotic null distribution. Here We Study another way to approximate it, the bootstrap. We show that the bootstrap yields a consistent distribution estimator. We also study by Simulation the finite sample performance of the bootstrap distribution and compare it with the asymptotic approximation. From the simulations it can be concluded that it is worth calculating the bootstrap estimator. because it is more accurate than the approximation yielded by the asymptotic null distribution which, in addition, cannot always be exactly computed.
