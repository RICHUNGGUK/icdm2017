Then we show that the injectively omega(n)-automatic ordinals, where n >= 1 is an integer, are the ordinals smaller than omega(omega n). This strengthens a recent result of Schlicht and Stephan who considered in [21] the subclasses of finite word omega(n)-automatic ordinals. As a by-product we obtain that the hierarchy of injectively omega(n)-automatic structures, n >= 1, which was considered in [9], is strict.", "paper_title": "Automatic Ordinals", "paper_id": "WOS:000317541100004"}
