These characteristics pose a great challenge for data consistency management. Thus, an effective data consistency inspection method is urgently needed for the product data management of aircraft manufacturers to ensure data consistency during the entire assembly process as well as to fulfil the management acquisition requirement of civil aircraft airworthiness. Based on the development of the ARJ21 and C919 aircrafts, this article analyses the bill of material (BOM) data structures, types of data differences and causes of data discrepancies in the design and manufacture of civil aircrafts. Correspondingly, a bottom-up route-based product data conformity inspection approach for civil aircraft is proposed. The algorithm is described in detail, and the application results reveal that the approach can effectively help manufacturers spot data inconsistencies in BOMs.", "paper_title": "Research and application of bottom-up route-based product data conformity inspection approach for civil aircraft", "paper_id": "WOS:000332271300006"}
