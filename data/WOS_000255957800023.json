The probability changes are observed through the impacts of factors (population and GDP). First, the urbanization process in China can be divided into four stages under the impacts of factors: the observed probability of urbanization level decreases with the impact of each factor at the early stage of urbanization process; while the observed probability increases with the impact of each factor at the middle stage; the observed probabilities at both transition stage and late stage show slight changes under the impact of each factor. Secondly, the observed probability measurement method is also applied to investigate the urbanization development in eastern China, illustrating its general application. Finally, GDP plays a greater role on promoting urbanization development than population.", "paper_title": "Observed probability measurement for urbanization development level with errors-in-variables observation", "paper_id": "WOS:000255957800023"}
