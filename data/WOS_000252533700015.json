Each cluster is connected to the backbone through an access node (AN). A scheduler located in each AN, executes two MAC protocols, one for the intracluster traffic and the other for the intercluster traffic. In order to maintain the quality of service, the scheduler in the AN employs, priority-based queuing for the intercluster traffic on pre-assigned wavelengths. For controlling the intracluster traffic, the scheduler employs pre-transmission coordination with ranging and look-ahead functionalities in the MAC protocol. The performance of MAC protocol for intracluster traffic is evaluated through event-driven simulation, while for intercluster traffic the MAC performance is evaluated through analytical modeling of the queuing system employing two dynamic bandwidth management schemes. Performance of the intracluster MAC protocol is shown to be improved by novel use of subcarrier multiplexing on the wavelength used for the control packet transmission. A comparative study of the two intercluster schemes in terms of end-to-end delay is carried out, to understand the effect of priority queuing on the real-time and non-real-time service packets.
