In this paper, we generalize this approach for the design of model transformations: transformation rules are derived semi-automatically from an initial prototypical set of interrelated source and target models. These initial model pairs describe critical cases of the model transformation problem in a purely declarative way. The derived transformation rules can be refined later by adding further source-target model pairs. The main advantage of the approach is that transformation designers do not need to learn a new model transformation language, instead they only use the concepts of the source and target modeling languages.", "paper_title": "Model transformation by example", "paper_id": "WOS:000241450700029"}
