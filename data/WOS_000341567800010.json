These cooperative cameras can track a moving target quickly and keep the target within their viewing scope at all times by using an embedded system, which controls image processing, calculates the camera's angle of rotation, and handover protocol for the peer system. The control station controls cooperation among multiple cameras, including coordination based on spatial relationships. This paper also proposes effective deployment methods for cameras in a variety of layouts. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and performance of real-time tracking on a moving target.", "paper_title": "Active and Seamless Handover Control of Multi-Camera Systems With 1-DoF Platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000341567800010"}
