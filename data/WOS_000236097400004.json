After raising antibodies directed against histamine, they were characterized and used for ELISA measurements. The development of a quantitative method needs an optimization of both detection and derivatization step. Experimental design methodology has been applied to optimize the conditions of the detection of the derivatized histamine. Methods and results were closely related. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
