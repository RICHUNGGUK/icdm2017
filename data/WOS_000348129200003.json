The scheme is based on two novel client-side embedding techniques that are able to reliably transmit a binary fingerprint. The first one relies on standard spread-spectrum like client-side embedding, while the second one is based on an innovative client-side informed embedding technique. The proposed techniques enable secure distribution of personalized decryption keys containing the Buyer's fingerprint by means of existing asymmetric protocols, without using a trusted third party. Simulation results show that the fingerprint can be reliably recovered by using either nonblind decoding with standard embedding or blind decoding with informed embedding, and in both cases it is robust with respect to common attacks. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed scheme is the first solution addressing asymmetric fingerprinting within a client-side framework, representing a valid solution to both customer's rights and scalability issues in multimedia content distribution.", "paper_title": "TTP-Free Asymmetric Fingerprinting Based on Client Side Embedding", "paper_id": "WOS:000348129200003"}
