Compare the Internet governance ecosystem to the rainforest. The Internet has become the planet's nervous system, with global society and modern services heavily dependent on Internet connectivity.

Everyone knows the consequences of polluting the natural environment; the lesson learned is to be careful with all kinds of environmental harms, keeping real and virtual environments as healthy as possible.", "paper_title": "The Internet Governance Ecosystem and the Rainforest", "paper_id": "WOS:000351774200009"}
