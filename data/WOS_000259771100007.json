This distinction, which can be made in different representation settings, has been recently emphasized in the framework of possibility theory. where what is given as being guaranteed possible, can be a strict subset of what is considered as being not impossible. This leads to an original revision mechanism when new information is received, which turns to be at work in the version space view of learning. This enables us to stress the bipolar nature of the version space approach and to propose an extension of it with layered sets of examples and counterexamples.
