Video text can be classified into scene text and superimposed text. Most of the previous methods detect superimposed or scene text separately due to different text alignments. Moreover, because different language characters have different edge and texture features, it is very difficult to detect the multilingual text. In this paper, we first perform a detailed analysis of motion patterns of video text, and show that the superimposed and scene text exhibit different motion patterns on consecutive frames, which is insensitive to multiple language characters and multiple text alignments. Based on our analysis, we define Motion Perception Field (MPF) to represent the text motion patterns. Finally, we propose a text detection algorithms using MPF for both superimposed and scene text with multiple languages and multiple alignments. Experimental results on diverse videos demonstrate that our algorithms are robust, and outperform previous methods for detecting both superimposed and scene texts with multiple languages and multiple alignments.", "paper_title": "Detecting both superimposed and scene text with multiple languages and multiple alignments in video", "paper_id": "WOS:000337156500016"}
