Due to the advantages of path computation in multilayer and multidomain networks, especially in multiconstraint scenarios, the path computation element (PCE) has been introduced into WSONs, which provides a better approach to the solution of the RWA problem in WSONs. This paper focuses on the RWA problem in PCE-based WSONs. A PCE-based routing framework and two PCE-based routing models are first designed, and then two distributed resource reservation schemes based on forward reservation protocol (FRP) and backward reservation protocol (BRP) are proposed and simulated in a PCE-based WSON. Finally, eight PCE-based RWA schemes are proposed in WSONs, the performances of which have been investigated and validated using the discrete event simulation tool OMNeT++. Numeric results show that the RWA (first-fit) scheme has the best performance in terms of blocking probability and average delay time.", "paper_title": "Routing and Wavelength Assignment Problem in PCE-Based Wavelength-Switched Optical Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000276174900005"}
