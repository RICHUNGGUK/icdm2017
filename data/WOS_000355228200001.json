From the perspective of complexity study, this paper reviews and analyses the emergent computation of complex systems, which is intended to deepen the understanding of the mechanism for emergence phenomenon and grasp the development directions of complexity study. At first, the concept, models and research methods of emergent computation are introduced and stated. Furthermore, the layout design problems in complex engineering systems and the collective behaviour issues in complex social systems are chosen as representatives to expand the review. The generation mechanisms of emergent computation in engineering systems are expounded and the emergent computation models of collective behaviour which include synchronisation and public opinion propagation are discussed. Based on the review of research status, further analysis on the existed problems and shortcomings is made and some perspectives on the development trends of future research which relate to emergent computation of complex systems are provided.", "paper_title": "Emergent computation of complex systems: a comprehensive review", "paper_id": "WOS:000355228200001"}
