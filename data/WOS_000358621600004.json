The EMD fractal features are extracted through computing the fractal dimensions of each IMF. The novel approach is applied to the recognition of the three types of glycyrrhiza fingerprints. Experiments show that EMD fractal features have better recognition rate than that of the traditional ones in the case of concentration-change, i.e. the number of peak and peak drift of sample which has slight changes. An existing method to extract the fractal features for fingerprint of medicinal herbs based on wavelet transform, which is called fractal-wavelet features, was presented. This method has anti-jamming property against the change of samples concentration. However, the recognition rate based on fractal-wavelet features is not satisfactory when fingerprint of medicinal herbs has some slight concentrations changes, the number of peak and peak drift of samples are processed in the special situation.", "paper_title": "EMD fractal feature extraction technique in fingerprint of medicinal herbs", "paper_id": "WOS:000358621600004"}
