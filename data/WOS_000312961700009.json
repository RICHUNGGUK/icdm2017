These sensors were built as part of a system on-board that includes sensors, a Q2 microcontroller and interface circuitry. The hardware includes a PIC18 processor, a field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip and peripherals. The FPGA chip is used to interface the processor with the peripherals operating at the same clock speed. This hardware design features high-level integration, reliability, high precision and high-speed communications. The system was demonstrated using temperature and CO2 sensors. The overall system was implemented and successfully tested. The response of the multi-sensor system was agreeable with the design parameters. The system is expandable to include other sensors such as light and pressure sensors. Monitoring threshold values should add to the security features of the integrated communication system. The use of a signature detection algorithm to determine threatening situation and/or intrusion within the sittings are discussed as a potential application for home land security. The integrated system features low-power consumption (utilising the sleeping mode of the processors), high-speed communications, security and flexibility to expansion.", "paper_title": "Embedded system for sensor communication and security", "paper_id": "WOS:000312961700009"}
