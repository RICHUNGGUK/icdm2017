Positivist and interpretivist perspectives have typically dominated discussions of this important methodological issue. I provide an alternative perspective by presenting a critical realist view of generalizing from case findings. I show that critical realism represents a very different view than either positivism or interpretivism. Critical realism recognizes the role of case study research in empirical generalization, theoretical generalization, and theory testing. In contrast, the role of case study research in empirical generalization and theory testing is either ignored or neglected by interpretivism and positivism. Embracing critical realism would therefore enable researchers to more fully explore the potential for case finding generalization. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
