An analysis of the genes is a first step towards understanding the biological roles of their products and exploiting novel products. Results: A total of 45 Type I iterative PKS genes were found, 5 of which are probably pseudogenes. Catalytic domains that are homologous with known PKS sequences as well as possible novel domains were identified. The genes often occurred in clusters of 2-5 genes, where members of the cluster had very similar sequences. The D. discoideum PKS genes formed a clade distinct from fungal and bacterial genes. All nine genes examined by RT-PCR were expressed, although at different developmental stages. The promoters of PKS genes were much more divergent than the structural genes, although we have identified motifs that are unique to some PKS gene promoters.", "paper_title": "Polyketide synthase genes and the natural products potential of Dictyostelium discoideum", "paper_id": "WOS:000250673800006"}
