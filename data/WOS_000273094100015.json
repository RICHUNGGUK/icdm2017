We show how these properties can be used to drive, given a set of illuminant estimation algorithms, the selection of the best algorithm for a given image. The algorithm selection is made by a decision forest composed of several trees on the basis of the values of a set of heterogeneous features. The features represent the image content in terms of low-level visual properties. The trees are trained to select the algorithm that minimizes the expected error in illuminant estimation. We also designed a combination strategy that estimates the illuminant as a weighted sum of the different algorithms' estimations. Experimental results on the widely used Ciurea and Funt clataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
