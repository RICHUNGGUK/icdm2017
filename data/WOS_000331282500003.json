The proposed topology increases the negative resistant and enhances the start-up difficulty of the conventional Colpitts oscillator. This enables the Colpitts oscillator to operate in low-power consumption. Moreover, the differential and balanced structure helps limit even-order harmonics and degrades the common mode noise effects in output. The proposed circuit is designed using 0.18 mu m technology and is simulated under 1.8V supply voltage in advanced design system (ADS). Simulations show the output phase noise of 140 dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset frequency when the operating frequency is 1 GHz.", "paper_title": "A NEW ENHANCED DIFFERENTIAL CMOS COLPITTS OSCILLATOR", "paper_id": "WOS:000331282500003"}
