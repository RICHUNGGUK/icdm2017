Several data-centric storage techniques had been proposed to exploit data storing and retrieving, but all of them failed to effectively deal with hotspot storage due to irregular sensor deployments or data distribution. In this paper, we propose a cover-up scheme for data-centric storage in wireless sensor networks. In our scheme, the storage node generates a virtual coordinate to feign that it is far away from the hash location. A geographic routing protocol forwarding an event data to a storage node will ignore the original storage node and find a new storage node whose coordinate is the closest to the hash location. Our cover-up mechanism can adjust to another storage node dynamically when a storage node is full. Simulations have shown that our cover-up scheme can reduce the energy consumption and achieve better quality of data.", "paper_title": "A Cover-Up Scheme for Data-Centric Storage in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000269626300013"}
