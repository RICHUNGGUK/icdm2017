A comparison with the constant modulus algorithm in terms of the convergence properties is performed, and it is found that the suggested algorithm has a significantly faster convergence rate and does not have any singularity problems. We also demonstrate that the algorithm convergence is strongly dependent on the choice of starting condition and show how this can be exploited to increase the convergence rate.", "paper_title": "Convergence Comparison of the CMA and ICA for Blind Polarization Demultiplexing", "paper_id": "WOS:000291439700002"}
