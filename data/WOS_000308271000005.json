It is the key for improving recognition performance to remove as much of their adverse effects as possible. In this paper, a formalism algorithm is proposed for classification problems with class noise, which is more challenging than those with attribute noise. The proposed formalism algorithm is based on evidential reasoning theory which is a powerful tool to deal with uncertain information in multiple attribute decision analysis and many other areas. Thus, it may be more effective alternative to handle noisy label information. And then a specific algorithm-Evidential Reasoning based Classification algorithm (ERC) is derived to recognize human faces under class noise conditions. The proposed ERC algorithm is extensively evaluated on five publicly available face databases with class noise and yields good performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
