Hum. Brain Mapp. 30 (2009) 417-431, can solve the interaction among task-related components of multi-task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. However, the departure of the ideal homodynamic response function (HRF) for projection from the true HRF may worse the ICAp results. In order to improve the performance of ICAp, the deconvolved ICAp (DICAp) method is proposed. Both the simulated and real fMRI experiments demonstrate that DICAp can separate more accurate time course corresponding to each task-related components and is more powerful to detect regions activated by each task only than ICAp.
