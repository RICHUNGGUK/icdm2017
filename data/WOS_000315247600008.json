The goal function of the present optimization method is the minimization of truss weight under the required constraints. In ray optimization, each agent is modeled as a ray of light that moves in the search space in order to find the global or near-global optimum solution. Comparison of the obtained results with those of some previous studies demonstrates the efficiency of this new algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
