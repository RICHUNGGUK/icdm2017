The experiments show that by estimating the number of components using sample-based approaches based on variable dimension models the discriminating power of the estimated components is improved. Two different MCMC methods are compared to perform the segmentation of simulated magnetic resonance brain scans, the reversible jump MCMC model and the Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model. The preference given to the Dirichlet process mixture model is discussed.
