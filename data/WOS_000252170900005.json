(Inf. Comput. 184:129-146, 2003). In this paper we focus on the case where all the jobs share a common deadline. Such a problem is denoted as CD-LBSP, which has been considered by Esfahbod et al. (Algorithms and data structures. Lecture notes in computer science, vol. 2748, pp. 59-66, 2003). We first show that the worst-case ratio of the algorithm SJF (Shortest Job First) is two under the objective function [min-time-spent], and thus answer an open question posed in (Esfahbod, et al. in Algorithms and data structures. Lecture notes in computer science, vol. 2748, pp. 59-66, 2003). We further present two approximation schemes A (k) and B (k) both having worst-case ratio of k+1/k , for any given integer k > 0, under the objective functions [min-makespan] and [min-time-spent], respectively. Finally, we prove that the problem CD-LBSP remains NP-hard under several objective functions, even if all jobs share the same release time.", "paper_title": "On lazy bureaucrat scheduling with common deadlines", "paper_id": "WOS:000252170900005"}
