We use the 2-torsion points as seeds to successively perform a chain of halvings to find divisors of increasing 2-power order. The halving loop requires a solution to certain degree 16 polynomials over the base field, and the termination of the algorithm is based on the description of the graph structure of the maximal 2-subgroup. The structure of our algorithm is the natural extension of the even characteristic case.", "paper_title": "EXPLICIT 2-POWER TORSION OF GENUS 2 CURVES OVER FINITE FIELDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000277821600005"}
