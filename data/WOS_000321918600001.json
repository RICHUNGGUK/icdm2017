We review both methodological and algorithmic results, focusing on inexact graph matching procedures. We consider different classes of graphs that are roughly differentiated considering the complexity of the defined labels for both vertices and edges. Emphasis will be given to the understanding of the underlying methodological aspects of each identified research branch. A selection of inexact graph matching algorithms is proposed and synthetically described, aiming at explaining some significant instances of each graph matching methodology mainly considered in the technical literature.", "paper_title": "The graph matching problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000321918600001"}
