Motivated by the fact that diagonal images outperform the original images for conventional two-dimensional (2D) subspace learning methods such as 2D principal component analysis (2DPCA) and 2D linear discriminant analysis (2DLDA), we first propose applying diagonal images to a recently proposed 2D discriminant locality preserving projections (2D-DLPP) algorithm, and formulate the Dia-DLPP method for feature extraction of face and palmprint images. Moreover, we show that transforming an image to a diagonal image is equivalent to assigning an appropriate weight to each pixel of the original image to emphasize its different importance for recognition, which provides the rationale and superiority of using diagonal images for 20 subspace learning. Inspired by this finding, we further propose a new discriminant weighted method to explicitly calculate the discriminative score of each pixel within a face and palmprint sample to duly emphasize its different importance, and incorporate it into 2D-DLPP to formulate the W2D-DLPP method to improve the recognition performance of 2D-DLPP and Dia-DLPP. Experimental results on the widely used FERET face and PolyU palmprint databases demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
