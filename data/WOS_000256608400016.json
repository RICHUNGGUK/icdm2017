This paper proposes a new analytical model to compute message latency in a general n-dimensional torus network with an arbitrary number of virtual channels per physical channel. Unlike the previous models proposed for toroidal-based networks, this model uses a combinatorial approach to consider all different possible cases for the source-destination pairs, thus resulting in an accurate prediction. The results obtained from simulation experiments confirm that the proposed model exhibits a high degree of accuracy for various network sizes, under different operating conditions, compared to a similar model proposed very recently, which considers virtual channel utilization in the k-ary n-cube network.
