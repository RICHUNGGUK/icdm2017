In this paper we are concerned with proving the confluence of non-terminating CHR programs. For this purpose, we derive from van Oostrom's decreasing diagrams method a novel criterion on CHR critical pairs that generalizes all preexisting criteria. We subsequently improve on a result on the modularity of CHR confluence, which permits modular combinations of possibly non-terminating confluent programs, without loss of confluence.", "paper_title": "Diagrammatic confluence for Constraint Handling Rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000308365000018"}
