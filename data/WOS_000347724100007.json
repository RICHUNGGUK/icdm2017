This article presents the production cycle of an interactive medical device, namely a virtual 3D electroencephalogram, and the study conducted to measure the students' satisfaction of the learning application based on Kano's quality model. The web-based interactive learning application introduces unique elements of interactivity with the learning content, specifically designed to train biomedical engineering students at the use of the medical device. The results of a post-deployment student survey suggest that the visual and interactive features embedded in the application have the potential to induce positive satisfaction of users. The proposed approach may serve as reference for the correct design of similar learning applications not only in the biomedical engineering context but also outside the realms of engineering sciences.
