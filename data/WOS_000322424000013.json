These processes may arise in various domains such as business, healthcare, etc. In knowledge-intensive environments, it is important that APMS technology ensures error-free process execution and compliance with semantic constraints. However, most process design tools handle only syntactic constraints. This restricts their value in real-world applications considerably. This paper proposes a novel approach to check the compliance of process models against semantic constraints and the validity of process change operations using mixed-integer programming (MIP). The MIP formulation allows us to describe existential, dependency, ordering, and various other relationships among tasks along with business policies in a standard way. In addition to incorporating the semantic constraint specifications into an MIP formulation, we introduce three novel ideas in this paper: (1) the notion of degree of compliance of processes to constraints based on a penalty function, (2) the concepts of full and partial validity of change operations, and (3) the idea of compliance by compensation. Thus, compensation operations derived from compliance degree can transform a noncompliant process into a compliant one both at design and execution time. We illustrate our approach in the context of a healthcare workflow as a way to reduce medical errors and argue that it is more elegant and superior to a pure logic-based approach. Complex scenarios with multiple concurrent processes (and constraints across them) for a single patient are also considered.", "paper_title": "Flexible Process Compliance with Semantic Constraints Using Mixed-Integer Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000322424000013"}
