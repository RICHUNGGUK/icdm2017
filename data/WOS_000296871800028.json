Industrial instances of this problem require the planning of a number of production and distribution sites over a time span of several months. Temporal and spatial Lagrangean decomposition schemes can be useful for solving these types of large-scale production planning problems. In this paper we present a theoretical result on the relative size of the duality gap of the two decomposition alternatives. We also propose a methodology for exploiting the economic interpretation of the Lagrange multipliers to speed the convergence of numerical algorithms for solving the temporal and spatial Lagrangean duals. The proposed methods are applied to the multi-site multi-period planning problem in order to illustrate their computational effectiveness. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
