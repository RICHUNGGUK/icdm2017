Such a sparse solution is unique due to a well- known uniqueness theorem. Suppose now that we have somehow a solution <(s)over cap> as an estimation of s(0), and suppose that (s) over cap is only \"approximately sparse,\" that is, many of its components are very small and nearly zero, but notmathematically equal to zero. Is such a solution necessarily close to the true sparsest solution? More generally, is it possible to construct an upper bound on the estimation error parallel to(s) over cap -s(0)parallel to(2) without knowing ? The answer is positive, and in this paper, we construct such a bound based on minimal singular values of submatrices of A. We will also state a tight bound, which is more complicated, but besides being tight, enables us to study the case of random dictionaries and obtain probabilistic upper bounds. We will also study the noisy case, that is, where x = As + n. Moreover, we will see that where parallel to s(0)parallel to(0) grows, to obtain a predetermined guaranty on themaximum of parallel to(s) over cap -s(0)parallel to(2), (s) over cap is needed to be sparse with a better approximation. This can be seen as an explanation to the fact that the estimation quality of sparse recovery algorithms degrades where parallel to s(0)parallel to(0) grows.", "paper_title": "On the Error of Estimating the Sparsest Solution of Underdetermined Linear Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000297807300014"}
