Because TFT-LCD manufacturing is highly complex and requires different tools for different products, accurately estimating the cost of manufacturing TFT-LCD equipment is essential. Conventional cost estimation models include linear regression (LR), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector regression (SVR). Nevertheless, in accordance with recent evidence that a hierarchical structure outperforms a flat structure, this study proposes a hierarchical classification and regression (HCR) approach for improving the accuracy of cost predictions for TFT-LCD inspection and repair equipment. Specifically, first-level analyses by HCR classify new unknown cases into specific classes. The cases are then inputted into the corresponding prediction models for the final output. In this study, experimental results based on a real world dataset containing data for TFT-LCD equipment development projects performed by a leading Taiwan provider show that three prediction models based on HCR approach are generally comparable or better than three conventional flat models (LR. ANN, and SVR) in terms of prediction accuracy. In particular, the 4-class and 5-class support vector machines in the first-level HCR combined with individual SVR obtain the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and mean average percentage error (MAPE) rates, respectively.
