The performance of minimax robust detection is characterized by the exponential decay rate of the miss probability under a Neyman-Pearson criterion with a fixed false alarm probability, as the length of the observation interval grows without bound. A stochastic suppression condition is identified for the uncertainty set of spectral density functions, and it is established that, under the stochastic suppression condition, the resulting minimax problem possesses a saddle point, which is achievable by the likelihood ratio tests matched to a so-called suppressing power spectral density in the uncertainty set. No convexity condition on the uncertainty set is required to establish this result.", "paper_title": "On Minimax Robust Detection of Stationary Gaussian Signals in White Gaussian Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000291003900056"}
