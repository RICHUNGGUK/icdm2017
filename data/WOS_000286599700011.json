The (PCPSO)-P-2 composes a personalized e-course according to (1) whether or not the covered learning concepts of the personalized e-course meets the expected learning target of a learner, (2) whether or not the difficulty of the e-learning material matches a learner's ability, (3) the limitation of learning time for individual learners, and (4) the balance of the weight of learning concepts that are covered in a personalized e-course. (PCPSO)-P-2 can provide a truly personalized learning environment when used in conjunction with an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). When an e-course authoring tool is based on the proposed approach, the (PCPSO)-P-2 can facilitate instructors in selecting appropriate e-learning materials from a mass of candidate e-learning materials, and then saves time and effort in the e-course editing process.", "paper_title": "(PCPSO)-P-2: personalized e-course composition based on Particle Swarm Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000286599700011"}
