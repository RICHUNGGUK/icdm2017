The approximation is achieved by subspace factorization of the topic related web pages. The factorization process reveals existing association between web pages such that the closely related web pages are extracted. We vary the approximation values to identify varied degrees of relationship between web pages. Experiments on real data sets show that the proposed algorithm reduces the impact of unrelated links and therefore can be used to control spam links in web pages. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
