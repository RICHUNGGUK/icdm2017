Many techniques have been developed in an attempt to numerically determine or quantify termhood based on term characteristics. Some of the apparent shortcomings of existing techniques are the ad-hoc combination of termhood evidence, mathematically-unfounded derivation of scores and implicit assumptions concerning term characteristics. We propose a probabilistic framework for formalising and combining qualitative evidence based on explicitly defined term characteristics to produce a new termhood measure. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate consistently better precision, recall and accuracy compared to three other existing ad-hoc measures.", "paper_title": "A probabilistic framework for automatic term recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000269802800001"}
