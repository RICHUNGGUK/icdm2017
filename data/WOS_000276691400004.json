Previous work applying TLS to structural analysis has demonstrated its effectiveness in capturing simple beam deflections and modeling existing structures. This paper extends TLS to the application of damage detection and volumetric change analysis for a full-scale structural test specimen. Importantly, it provides a framework necessary for such applications, in combination with an analysis approach that does not require tedious development of complex surfaces. Intuitive slicing analysis methods are presented, which can be automated for rapid generation of results. In comparison with conventional photographic and surface analysis methods, the proposed approach proved consistent. Furthermore, the TLS data provided additional insight into geometric change not apparent using conventional methods. As with any digital record, a key benefit to the proposed approach is the resulting virtual test specimen, which is available for posttest analysis long after the original specimen is demolished. Uncertainties that can be introduced from large TLS data sets, mixed pixels and parallax in the TLS analysis are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Terrestrial Laser Scanning-Based Structural Damage Assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000276691400004"}
