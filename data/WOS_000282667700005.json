However, recently the community tends to accept that the success of the Grid is crucially based on commercial exploitation. In our vision Foster's and Kesselman's statement 'The Grid is all about sharing.' has to be extended by '... and making money out of it!'. To allow for the realization of this vision, the trustworthiness of the underlying technology needs to be ensured. This can be achieved by the use of Gridified Secure Electronic Transaction as a basic technology for trust management and secure accounting in the presented grid-based workflow. We present a framework, conceptually and technically, from the area of the Mobile-Grid, which justifies the Grid infrastructure as a viable platform to enable commercially successful business workflows.
