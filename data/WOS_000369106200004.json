Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes the motivations for establishing the RDM Service and outlines the three objectives that were set to improve data management practice within the institution. Each of the objectives are explored in turn, stating how they were addressed. Findings - A university with limited resources can operate a RDM Service that pro-actively supports researchers wishing to manage research data by monitoring evolving support needs, identifying common trends and developing resources that will reduce the time investment needed. The institution-wide survey identified a need for guidance on developing data documentation and archiving research data following project completion. Analysis of ongoing support requests identifies a need for guidance on data management plans and complying with journal sharing requirements. Research limitations/implications - The paper provides a case study of a single institution. The results may not be generally applicable to universities that support other disciplines. Practical implications - The case study may be helpful in helping other universities to establish an RDM Service using limited resources. Originality/value - The paper outlines how the evolving data management needs of public health researchers can be identified and a strategy that can be adopted by an RDM Service to efficiently address these requirements.", "paper_title": "Building a research data management service for the London school of hygiene & tropical medicine", "paper_id": "WOS:000369106200004"}
