In addition, the wavelet entropy is adopted to choose the hidden nodes in the wavelet neural network. The learning algorithm of the wavelet neural network based on wavelet entropy is proposed and discussed for data compression of fault data in power system. The simulation results show that it is feasible and valid in the end.", "paper_title": "Fault data compression of power system with wavelet neural network based on wavelet entropy", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000202"}
