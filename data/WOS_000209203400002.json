This RSPID control system comprises a self-learning PID (SPID) controller and a robust controller. The gradient descent method is utilized to derive the on-line tuning laws of SPID controller; and the H-infinity control technique is applied for the robust controller design so as to achieve robust tracking performance. Moreover, in order to achieve fast learning of PID controller, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is adopted to search the optimal learning-rates of PID adaptive gains. Finally, two nonlinear systems, a two-link manipulator and a chaotic system are examined to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed control system can achieve favorable control performance for these nonlinear systems.", "paper_title": "A robust self-learning PID control system design for nonlinear systems using a particle swarm optimization algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000209203400002"}
