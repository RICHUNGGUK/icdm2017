In this article, an efficient and effective heuristic defect-free subcrossbar extraction algorithm is proposed which improves performance by mixing the heuristics from two state-of-the-art algorithms and then is speeded up significantly by considerably reducing the number of major loops. Compared with the current most effective algorithm that improves the solution quality (i.e., size of the defect-free subcrossbar obtained) at the cost of high time complexity O(n(3)), the time complexity of the proposed heuristic algorithm is proved to be O(n(2)). Using a large set of instances of various scales and defect densities, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can offer similar high-quality solutions as the current most effective algorithm while consuming much shorter runtimes (reduced to about 1/3 to 1/5) than the current most effective algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Fast Extraction Algorithm for Defect-Free Subcrossbar in Nanoelectronic Crossbar", "paper_id": "WOS:000335920500007"}
