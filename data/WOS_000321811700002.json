The partial distance-weighted variable anti-connectivity index showed superior modelling capabilities compared with the index calculated from the complete graph, because it is capable of accounting correctly for the intramolecular interactions of unconnected vertices to specific bond strengths (active site), thereby improving the RMSCV error by about 30% (0.221 pK(a) units).", "paper_title": "Application of variable anti-connectivity index to active sites.
