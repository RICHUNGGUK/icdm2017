Based on such three typical schemes, a quantitative analysis on security is provided. The paper also discusses the simplification measures and their e r ect on security, and then the possibility to extend is proved. Finally, several conclusions about the methods to improve the security, simplify the schemes and extend to one-to-many situation are given.", "paper_title": "Improvement and extension of quantum secret sharing using orthogonal product states", "paper_id": "WOS:000337807600009"}
