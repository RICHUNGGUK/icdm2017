Rigorous analysis shows that the performance of communication from the sensor with higher noise power to the sensor with lower noise power is not always better than the performance of the reverse communication direction when the signal and sensor noises are both Gaussian. This result can be extended to a more general two-sensor tandem binary decision system without the assumption of a specific data distribution. This seems somewhat counterintuitive but has significance for optimization design of sensor communication direction. Computer experiments support our analytic results and illustrate interesting information which requires need further study.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of Communication Direction for Two-Sensor Tandem Binary Decision System", "paper_id": "WOS:000269839000033"}
