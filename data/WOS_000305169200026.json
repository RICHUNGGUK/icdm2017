By using sequences of calibration signals, we formulate a total least squares problem and transform it into an equivalent optimization problem. By exploiting the structure of the problem, analytic expressions for the optimal solution can be obtained. For illustration, two numerical results are presented.", "paper_title": "A TOTAL LEAST SQUARES TECHNIQUE FOR THE DESIGN OF A WIRELESS BEAMFORMING SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000305169200026"}
