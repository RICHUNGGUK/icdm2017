Isometries are weight-preserving module isomorphisms whereas strong isometries are, in addition, degree-preserving. Special cases of these maps are certain types of monomial transformations. We will show a form of MacWilliams Equivalence Theorem, that is, each isometry between convolutional codes is given by a monomial transformation. Examples show that strong isometries cannot be characterized this way, but special attention paid to the weight adjacency matrices allows for further descriptions. Various distance parameters appearing in the literature on convolutional codes will be discussed as well.", "paper_title": "ON ISOMETRIES FOR CONVOLUTIONAL CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000266313100006"}
