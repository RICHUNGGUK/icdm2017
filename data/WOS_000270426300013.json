Chan and Chang (2007) proposed a new scheme by Hamming code, which effectively detects and eliminates burst bit errors and the recovered pixels in detailed areas can actually gain very high clarity. In this paper, the potential weakness of the Chan-Chang scheme will be analyzed and the experimental results will show that the security problem does exist. Therefore, in order to benefit the excellent advantages of the Chan-Chang scheme, it is worthwhile to propose an improved scheme based on Hamming code to enhance security. The improved scheme not only overcomes the potential security weakness of the Chan-Chang scheme but also takes advantage of and enhances the property of (7,4) Hamming code rule. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can withstand the noise-adding attack and tampering attack. Moreover, performances of detecting and recovering are with high accuracy and good quality. It is worthwhile to note that the ability of lossless image remedy is analyzed under different tampered size and transmission error.", "paper_title": "A SECURE IMAGE AUTHENTICATION SCHEME WITH TAMPERING PROOF AND REMEDY BASED ON HAMMING CODE", "paper_id": "WOS:000270426300013"}
