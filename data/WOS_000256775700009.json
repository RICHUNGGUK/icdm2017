Even the second weight is only known for values of s being smaller than or equal to q/2. In this paper we establish the second weight for values of s being smaller than q. For s greater than (m - 1)(q - 1) we then find the first s + 1 - (m - 1)(q-1) weights. For the case m = 2 the second weight is now known for all values of s. The results are derived mainly by using Grobner basis theoretical methods.", "paper_title": "On the second weight of generalized Reed-Muller codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000256775700009"}
