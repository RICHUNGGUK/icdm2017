Many path-embedding aspects and cycle-embedding aspects, such as Hamiltonicity, Hamiltonian-connectivity, panconnectivity, bipanconnectivity, pancyclicity, vertex-pancyclicity and edge-pancyclicity, have been proposed and extensively studied. In fact, these discussions are meaningful for interconnection networks of resource-allocated systems or heterogeneous computing systems. In this paper, we propose a new cycle-embedding aspect called bipancycle-connectivity that combines the concepts of vertex-pancyclicity and bipanconnectivity. A bipartite graph is bipancycle-connected if an arbitrary pair of vertices x, y is contained by common cycles called bipanconnected cycles that include a cycle of every even length ranging from minc(x, y) to N; where minc(x, y) denotes the length of the minimum cycle that contains x and y, and N is the number of vertices. In this paper, we introduce a new graph called the cycle-of-ladders. We show that the hypercube is bipancycle-connected by presenting algorithms to embed the cycle-of-ladders into the hypercube.
