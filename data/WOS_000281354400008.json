The considered matrix equation includes some previously investigated matrix equations as its special cases. An iterative algorithm is presented for solving this class of matrix equations. When the matrix equation is consistent, a solution can be obtained within finite iteration steps for any initial values in the absence of round-off errors. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
