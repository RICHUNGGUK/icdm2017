The system performance measurement and simulation are required before the system can be deployed on a large scale. In this paper, we address performance analysis on a finite state mobile agent prototype on the basis of Virtual Hierarchical Tree Grid Organizations (VIRGO). The finite states refer to the migration, execution, and searching of the mobile agent. We introduce a novel evaluation model for the finite state mobile agent. The experimental results based on this evaluation model show that the finite mobile agents can perform well under multiple agent conditions and are superior to the traditional client/server approach.
