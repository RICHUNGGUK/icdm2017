The expressive power of FO[<, MOD] with order comparison x < y and predicates for x = i mod n has been investigated by Barrington et al. The study of FO[<, MOD]-fragments was initiated by Chaubard et al. More recently, Dartois and Paperman showed that definability in the two-variable fragment FO2[<, MOD] is decidable. In this paper we continue this line of work. We give an effective algebraic characterization of the word languages in Sigma(2)[<, MOD]. The fragment Sigma(2) consists of first-order formulas in prenex normal form with two blocks of quantifiers starting with an existential block. In addition we show that Delta(2)[<, MOD], the largest subclass of Sigma(2)[<, MOD] which is closed under negation, has the same expressive power as two-variable logic FO2[<, MOD]. This generalizes the result FO2[<] = Delta(2)[<] of Therien and Wilke to modular predicates. As a byproduct, we obtain another decidable characterization of FO2[<, MOD].", "paper_title": "ONE QUANTIFIER ALTERNATION IN FIRST-ORDER LOGIC WITH MODULAR PREDICATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000353576100001"}
