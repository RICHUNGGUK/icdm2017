By simulations, the metastable state induced by conflicts of pedestrians is observed. The system is controlled by parameters of the inflow and competitiveness of the pedestrians, and large inflow leads to a congested situation. The critical condition of the transition and mathematical expressions of outflow for both center and corner exits are theoretically derived.", "paper_title": "Analysis on a Single Segment of Evacuation Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000329378500004"}
