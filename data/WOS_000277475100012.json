Given an object as a template, we first select a set of coefficients as object features in the wavelet transform domain and then build an adaptive transform based on the selected features. The goal of the new adaptive transform is to vanish the selected features in the transform domain. After applying both non-adaptive and adaptive transforms to a given test image, the corresponding transform domain coefficients are compared for detecting the object of interest. In addition, the proposed detection algorithm is combined with the proper log-polar mapping model in the parametric template space to attain rotation/scale invariance property. Finally, we have verified the properties of our proposed algorithm with experimental results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
