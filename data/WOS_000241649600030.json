They come from the study of the arithmetically based recognition algorithm proposed by I. Debled-Rennesson and J.-P. Reveilles in 1995 [1]. We indeed exhibit the relations describing the possible changes in the parameters of the digital straight segment under investigation. This description is achieved by considering new parameters on digital segments: instead of their arithmetic description, we examine the parameters related to their combinatoric description. As a result we have a better understanding of their evolution during recognition and analytical formulas to compute them. We also show how this evolution can be projected onto the Stern-Brocot tree. These new relations have interesting consequences on the geometry of digital curves. We show how they can for instance be used to bound the slope difference between consecutive maximal segments.", "paper_title": "Revisiting digital straight segment recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241649600030"}
