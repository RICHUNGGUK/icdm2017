Here, we will demonstrate using a dielectric line with a width that is smaller than its height. Both ferrite and Si materials have been used to fabricate circuits to achieve tunable functions. Different millimeter wave components and radiating structures with this new aspect ratio have been developed, fabricated, and tested. Special emphasis has been placed on demonstrating the components and antennas' operation in the 26-35 GHz range, but the design concepts developed here can be easily extended to sub-millimeter wave frequencies.
