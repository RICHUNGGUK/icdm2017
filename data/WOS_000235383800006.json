The design of CAC algorithms for mobile cellular networks is especially challenging given the limited and highly variable resources, and the mobility of users encountered in such networks. This article provides a survey of admission control schemes for cellular networks and the research in this area. Our goal is to provide a broad classification and thorough discussion of existing CAC schemes. We classify these schemes based on factors such as deterministic/stochastic guarantees, distributed/local control and adaptivity to traffic conditions. In addition to this, we present some modeling and analysis basics to help in better understanding the performance and efficiency of admission control schemes in cellular networks. We describe several admission control schemes and compare them in terms of performance and complexity. Handoff prioritization is the common characteristic of these schemes. We survey different approaches proposed for achieving handoff prioritization with a focus on reservation schemes. Moreover, optimal and near-optimal reservation schemes are presented and discussed. Also, we overview other important schemes such as those designed for multi-service networks and hierarchical systems as well as complete knowledge schemes and those using pricing for CAC. Finally, the paper concludes on the state of cur-rent research and points out some of the key issues that need to be addressed in the context of CAC for future cellular networks.
