The model is represented using a hierarchical convolutional factor-analysis construction, with sparse factor loadings and scores. The computation of layer-dependent model parameters is implemented within a Bayesian setting, employing a Gibbs sampler and variational Bayesian (VB) analysis that explicitly exploit the convolutional nature of the expansion. To address large-scale and streaming data, an online version of VB is also developed. The number of dictionary elements at each layer is inferred from the data, based on a beta-Bernoulli implementation of the Indian buffet process. Example results are presented for several image-processing applications, with comparisons to related models in the literature.", "paper_title": "Deep Learning with Hierarchical Convolutional Factor Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000320381400006"}
