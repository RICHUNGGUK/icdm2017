Fuzzy C-means, as an effective tool to deal with PVE, however, is faced with great challenges in efficiency. Aiming at this, this paper proposes one improved FCM algorithm based on the histogram of the given image, which will be denoted as HisFCM and divided into two phases. The first phase will retrieve several intervals on which to compute cluster centroids, and the second one will perform image segmentation based on improved FCM algorithm. Compared with FCM and other improved algorithms, HisFCM is of much higher efficiency with satisfying results. Experiments on medical images show that HisFCM can achieve good segmentation results in less than 0.1 second, and can satisfy real-time requirements of medical image processing.", "paper_title": "Medical image segmentation using improved FCM", "paper_id": "WOS:000303426100007"}
