Some scholars notice that prefix caching in routers may influence the path stretch ratio and gave their different understanding on path stretch. Thus, this note studies the relationship between prefix caching and path stretch ratio, and presents quantitive results.", "paper_title": "Study on the relationship between prefix caching and path stretch ratio", "paper_id": "WOS:000358074500010"}
