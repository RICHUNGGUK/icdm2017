In contrast, we are working to develop data mining techniques to discover patterns consisting of complex relationships between entities. Our research is particularly applicable to domains in which the data is event driven, such as counter-terrorism intelligence analysis. In this paper we describe an algorithm designed to operate over relational data received from a continuous stream. Our approach includes a mechanism for summarizing discoveries from previous data increments so that the globally best patterns can be computed by examining only the new data increment. We then describe a method by which relational dependencies that span across temporal increment boundaries can be efficiently resolved so that additional pattern instances, which do not reside entirely in a single data increment, can be discovered. We also describe a method for change detection using a measure of central tendency designed for graph data. We contrast two formulations of the change detection process and demonstrate the ability to identify salient changes along meaningful dimensions and recognize trends in a relational data stream.", "paper_title": "Structure discovery in sequentially-connected data streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000243118500005"}
