For face modeling, we first generate a global model through deforming a generic model based on a set of facial landmarks. Local optimization is then performed for further enhancing the similarity between the subject and the 3D model in the non-feature regions (NFRs), eyes/nose/mouth and ears, using the proposed Point and Curve based deformation. Subsequently, this study proposes a wrinkle modeling method based on automatically extracted curves and improved shape control functions. Individual hairstyle modeling is introduced in a two-step approach that consists of hair-volume generation and individual-strand generation. Finally, several resulting 3D human models and their potential applications to portrait-based product design demonstrate the functionality of our methodology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
