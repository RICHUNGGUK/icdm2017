A delay-dependent stochastic stability condition for a fuzzy Markovian jump system with two levels of structure is obtained based on a new Lyapunov functional. The Lyapunov functional depends not only on the fuzzy basis functions but also on the system modes. Furthermore, a delay-dependent sufficient condition for the solvability of the robust stabilization problem is proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed design method. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
