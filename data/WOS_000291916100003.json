The regression model is defined by using the interval arithmetic, it considers the possibility of interval-valued disturbances, and it is less restrictive than existing models. After the theoretical formalization, the least-squares (LS) estimation of the linear model with respect to a suitable distance in the space of intervals is developed. The LS approach leads to a constrained minimization problem that is solved analytically. The strong consistency of the obtained estimators is proven. The estimation procedure is reinforced by a real-life application and some simulation studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
