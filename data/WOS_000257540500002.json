This algorithm has the same order of time and space complexities as the algorithm proposed by Durr and Hoyer, but it provides a quadratic reduction in the number of measurements. In addition to the correctness and complexity analysis of the algorithm, we present simulation results considering an NP-hard problem.", "paper_title": "A new quantum algorithm for solving the minimum searching problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000257540500002"}
