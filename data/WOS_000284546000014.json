Furthermore, an adaptive diagnosis algorithm (ADA) is also introduced to identify and diagnose the WDF for MRAM. The proposed test method can evaluate process stability and uniformity. We also develop a built-in self-test (BIST) circuit that supports the proposed WDF diagnosis test method. A 1-Mb toggle MRAM prototype chip with the proposed BIST circuit has been designed and fabricated using a special 0.15-mu m CMOS technology. The BIST circuit overhead is only about 0.05% with respect to the 1-Mb MRAM. The test time is reduced by about 30% as compared with the test method without using the decision write mechanism. The chip measurement results show the efficiency of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "Diagnosis of MRAM Write Disturbance Fault", "paper_id": "WOS:000284546000014"}
