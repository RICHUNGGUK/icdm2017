It is an endogenous substance and moreover; various pharmacological activities have been reported for isatin and its derivatives. In-vitro cytotoxic effects of the prepared isatin Schiff bases toward HeLa, LS180 and Raji human cancer cell lines has been reported in our previous work. 3-(2-(4-nitrophenyl)hydrazono) indolin-2-one was found to be the most potent one among the studied compounds (IC30 = 12.2 and 21.8 mu M in HeLa and LS-180 cell lines, respectively). Obtained biological data could be well interpreted using docking binding energies toward vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR-2); a key anticancer target being biologically investigated against various isatin derivatives. In the present work, quantum mechanical (QM) method including functional B3LYP in association with split valence basis set using polarization functions (Def2-SVP) was used to estimate individual ligand-residue interaction energies for the docked 3-(2-(4-nitrophenyl)hydrazono) indolin-2-one into VEGFR-2 active site. Results were further interpreted via calculated polarization effects induced by individual amino acids of the receptor active site. A fairly good correlation could be found between polarization effects and estimated binding energies (R-2 = 0.7227). Conformational analysis revealed that 3-(2-(4-nitrophenyl) hydrazono) indolin-2-one might not necessarily interact with the VEGFR-2 active site in its minimum energy conformation.", "paper_title": "QM study and conformational analysis of an isatin Schiff base as a potential cytotoxic agent", "paper_id": "WOS:000314051200023"}
