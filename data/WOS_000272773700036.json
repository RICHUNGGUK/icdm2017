While the AMFCC feature extraction method uses the fixed double-dynamic-range (DDR) Hamming window for higher-lag autocorrelation coefficients, which are least affected by noise, the proposed method applies a variable window, depending on the frame energy and periodicity. The performance of the proposed method is verified using an Aurora-2 task, and the results confirm a significantly improved performance under noisy conditions.", "paper_title": "Robust Feature Extraction Using Variable Window Function in Autocorrelation Domain for Speech Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000272773700036"}
