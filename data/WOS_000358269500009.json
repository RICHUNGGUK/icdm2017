Traditional trilinear mappings based on interpolation stencils are replaced with a \"cloud\"-based algorithm which retains no dependence on grid connectivity. A variable number of donor points was sourced from a single grid in the vicinity of a receptor point, permitting consistent treatment of orphan points in the data transfer method. This cloud-based interpolation methodology demonstrates the ability to preserve flow-field features for configurations both with and without adequate mesh overlap. The approach eliminates problems associated with orphan points and reduces transient conservation errors by an order of magnitude. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
