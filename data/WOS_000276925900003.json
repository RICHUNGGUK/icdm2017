It largely depends on the elicitation method and the person in charge. The model needs to be shared in order to promote multiple perspectives. This paper describes a group storytelling approach as an alternative to the traditional individual interviews to elicitate processes. Information gathering is proposed to be done through capturing the stories told by process performers, who describe their work, difficulties and suggestions. A process to abstract and transform stories into business process representations is also part of the method. A tool to support storytelling and this transformation is described as well.
