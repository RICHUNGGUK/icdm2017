The numerical predictions are compared with the field data in terms of settlements, horizontal displacements and excess pore water pressures. The repercussions of including the large displacements formulation are also studied. It is found that the analysis considering large displacements results in a decrease in settlements and an increase in the rate of excess pore pressure dissipation, both of which are related to the reduction of the thickness of a deformable layer.
