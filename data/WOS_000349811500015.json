The formal descriptions on the heredity/variation in test versions and the driving force of software testing evolution were established and then a Software Testing Evolution Process Model (STEPM) was obtained. Based on the model, the key factors of software testing quality were identified and a Software Testing Quality Framework (STQF) was purposed. A series of formal models obtained in the paper open up new research field in software engineering with wide development foreground and are expected to promote studies on the dependability of software testing, provide ways to evaluate software testing quality and establish formal basis for fully automated testing conducted by programs.", "paper_title": "Software testing evolution process model and growth of software testing quality", "paper_id": "WOS:000349811500015"}
