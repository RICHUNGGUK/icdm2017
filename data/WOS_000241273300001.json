Given two implicit algebraic surfaces, a new method based on the offset technique is presented to compute the minimum distance and a pair of points where the minimum distance occurs. The new method also works where there are an implicit algebraic surface and a parametric surface. Quadric surfaces, tori and canal surfaces are used to demonstrate our new method. When the two surfaces are a general quadric surface and a surface which is a cylinder, a cone or an elliptic paraboloid, the new method can produce two bivariate equations where the degrees are lower than those of any existing method.
