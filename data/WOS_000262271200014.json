Here we explored the thermal-stable mechanism of thermophilic nitrile hydratases (NHases) utilizing a molecular dynamic simulation. At a nanosecond timescale, profiles of root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of two thermophilic NHases, 1UGQ and 1V29, under enhancing thermal stress were carried out at 300 K. 320 K, 350 K and 370 K, respectively. Results showed that the region A1 (211-231 aa) and A2 (305-316 aa) in 1UGQ, region B1 (186-192 aa) in 1V29, and most of terminal ends in both enzymes are hyper-sensitive. Salt-bridge analyses revealed that in one hand, salt-bridges contributed to maintaining the rigid structure and stable performance of the thermophilic 1UGQ and 1V29; in the other hand, salt-bridges involved in thermal sensitive regions are relatively weak and prone to be broken at elevated temperature, thereby cannot hold the stable conformation of the spatial neighborhood. In 1V29, region A1 was stabilized by a well-organized hook-hook like Cluster with multiple salt-bridge interactions, region A2 was stabilized by two strong salt-bridge interactions of GLU52-ARG332 and GLU334-ARG332. In 1UGQ the absence of a charged residue decreased its thermal sensitivity of region B1, and the formation of a small beta-sheet containing a stable salt-bridge in C-beta-terminal significantly enhanced its thermal stability. By radius Of gyration calculation containing or eliminating the thermal sensitive regions, we quantified the contribution of thermal sensitive regions for thermal sensitivity of 1UGQ and 1V29. Consequently, we presented strategies to improve thermal stability of the industrialized mesophilic NHase by introducing stable salt-bridge interactions into its thermal sensitive regions.
