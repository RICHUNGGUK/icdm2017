New codewords are inserted in regions of the input vector space where the distortion error is highest until the desired number of codewords (or a distortion error threshold) is achieved. Adoption of the adaptive distance function greatly increases the proposed method's performance. During the incremental process, a removal-insertion technique is used to fine-tune the codebook to make the proposed method independent of initial conditions. The proposed method works better than some recently published efficient algorithms such as Enhanced LBG (Patane, & Russo, 2001) for traditional tasks: with fixed number of codewords, to find a suitable codebook to minimize distortion error. The proposed method can also be used for new tasks that are insoluble using traditional methods: with fixed distortion error, to minimize the number of codewords and find a suitable codebook. Experiments for some image compression problems indicate that the proposed method works well. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
