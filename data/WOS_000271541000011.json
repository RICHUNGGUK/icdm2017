This weak form is a mixed relationship involving the displacements and the multipliers defined on the reference contact surface of the contactor and is shown to be equivalent to the strong form of the initial/boundary value contact problem. The discretization in space by means of the finite element method is carried out on the mixed relationship in a simple way in order to obtain the semi-discrete equation system. The contact tangent stiffness is derived and numerical examples are presented to assess the efficiency of the formulation. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
