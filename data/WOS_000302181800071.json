However, some defects in optimality are shown in these regressions. In this correspondence, monotonic regression (MR) is found to be an effective correlation method in the performance assessment of IQMs. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results have proven that MR performs better than any other regression. We believe that MR could be an effective tool for performance assessment in the IQM research.", "paper_title": "Monotonic Regression: A New Way for Correlating Subjective and Objective Ratings in Image Quality Research", "paper_id": "WOS:000302181800071"}
