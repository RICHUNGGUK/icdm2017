These investments are expected to produce reduction of errors and quality improvements in data management and analysis. To sustain achievements in quality and efficiency, healthcare organizations need to be vigilant in monitoring the state of competitiveness of their platforms. In the technology post-adoption period, healthcare organizations use multiple data sources to search for technology-related information to maintain technology parity with, or dominance over their competitors. Firstly this study seeks to answer the following research question: what approaches do healthcare organizations employ with regard to managing diverse sources of data and information in order to sustain their technology competitiveness. Then as an initial step in this direction, in this paper we discuss the conceptual foundation for the phenomenon of data and information sources management capability for the proteomics domain. This is done by discussing the case of Protein Data Source Integration by Protein Ontology.", "paper_title": "Protein data sources management using semantics", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800057"}
