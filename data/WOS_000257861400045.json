However, the MFA-which basically aims at minimizing the clutter effect on radar performance-implicitly assumes the use of a least squares (LS) receiver that is optimal only when there is no clutter. This problem can be eliminated by using a more general optimal instrumental-variables (IV) receiver in lieu of the LS receiver. The IV receiver can reject clutter more efficiently than the LS receiver. Additionally, the binary sequence design problem associated with the IV approach has an interesting form.", "paper_title": "On binary probing signals and instrumental variables receivers for radar", "paper_id": "WOS:000257861400045"}
