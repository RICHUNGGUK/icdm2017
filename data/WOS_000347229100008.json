They are characterized by a large pressure drop and are composed of different phases. In the past, erosion-corrosion was measured through the use of experimental methods. Today numerical simulation models provide a more in depth look into the problem of erosion. Solid particle erosion is of major concern in the industrial engineering sector. In this study, erosion occurring in a (90)-degree elbow has been simulated. The generated two-dimensional data was done through the use of the Commercial software ANSYS Fluent. The primary idea comes from the petrochemicals industry. To overcome this problem, counter measures are proposed in this paper to the piping setup in order to protect pumps from unwanted excessive sand concentrations. Note that the physical properties of the simulated fluid mixture are taken the same as for the real-studied sample.", "paper_title": "Simulation of two-phase flow in elbow with problem solving", "paper_id": "WOS:000347229100008"}
