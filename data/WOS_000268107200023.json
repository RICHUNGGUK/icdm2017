This paper takes an important step toward fulfilling this potential through power spectrum balancing. We derive a novel algorithm called SCALE, that provides a significant performance improvement over the existing iterative water-filling (IWF) algorithm in multiuser DSL networks, doing so with comparable low complexity. The algorithm is easily distributed through measurement and limited message passing with the use of a spectrum management center. We outline how overhead can be managed, and show that in the limit of zero message-passing, performance reduces to IWF. Numerical studies indicate that SCALE converges extremely fast when applied to VDSL, with performance exceeding that of IWF in just a few iterations, and to over 90% of the final rate in under five iterations. We provide a proof to show that SCALE converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point, suggesting that it indeed has the potential to reach true global optimality. Finally, we return to the IWF problem and derive a new algorithm named SCAWF that is shown to be a very simple way to water-fill, particularly suited to the multiuser context.", "paper_title": "SCALE: A Low-Complexity Distributed Protocol for Spectrum Balancing in Multiuser DSL Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000268107200023"}
