The smart transducer concept and the IEEE 1451 standard improve the scalability of electronic devices and diminish the cost of networked transducers. This paper analyzes the use of the IEEE 1451 standard in the ITS area. A framework based on the architecture of model objects is defined to tie the IEEE 1451 standard into the description of the essential sharable elements of the sensor network. Two real developments are shown as case examples. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
