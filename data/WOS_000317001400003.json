A new robust observer technique is presented to obtain the estimates of the system states and the sensor faults simultaneously, and a fuzzy fault-tolerant control scheme is developed to guarantee the closed-loop system to be exponentially stable in mean square. Sufficient conditions are obtained for the existence of admissible controllers, and it is shown that the reachability of the sliding-mode dynamics can be guaranteed under the proposed control techniques. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the theoretic results obtained.", "paper_title": "Fault Estimation and Tolerant Control for Fuzzy Stochastic Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000317001400003"}
