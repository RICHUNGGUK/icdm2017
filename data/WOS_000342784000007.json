To achieve both a fast convergence rate and a small residual error, we use a scheme combining fast and slow AP filters, while significantly reducing the computational complexity. By employing an evolutionary method which automatically determines the update intervals, the update frequencies of the two constituent filters are significantly decreased. Experimental results show that the proposed CP-AP adaptive filter has an advantage over conventional adaptive filters with a parallel structure in that it has a similar convergence performance with a substantial reduction in the total number of updates.", "paper_title": "A Low-Complexity Complementary Pair Affine Projection Adaptive Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784000007"}
