This poses a challenge for network administrators, who need adequate tools for network management. Recent findings show that DNS can contribute valuable information on IP flows and improve traffic visibility in a computer network. In this paper, we apply these findings on DNS to propose a novel traffic classification algorithm with interesting features. We experimentally show that the information carried in domain names and port numbers is sufficient for immediate classification of a highly significant portion of the traffic. We present DNS-Class: an innovative, fast and reliable flow-based traffic classification algorithm, which on average yields 99.8% of true positives and <0.1% of false positives on real traffic traces. The algorithm can work as a major element of a modular system in a cascade architecture. Additionally, we provide an analysis on how various network protocols depend on DNS in terms of flows, packets and bytes. We release the complete source code implementing the presented system as open source.
