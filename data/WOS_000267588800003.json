To support quality of service (QoS) requirements for multimedia applications having a reliable and fair transport protocol is necessary. One of the main objectives of the transport layer in WMSNs is congestion control. We observe that the information provided may have different levels of importance and argue that sensor networks should be willing to spend more resources in disseminating packets carrying more important information. Some applications of WMSNs may need to send real time traffic toward the sink node. This real time traffic requires low latency and high reliability so that immediate remedial and defensive actions can be taken when needed. Therefore, similar to wired networks, service differentiation in wireless sensor networks is also an important issue. We present a priority-based rate control mechanism for congestion control and service differentiation in WMSNs. We distinguish high priority real time traffic from low priority non-real time traffic, and service the input traffic based on its priority. Simulation results confirm the superior performance of the proposed model with respect to delays, delay variation and loss probability. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
