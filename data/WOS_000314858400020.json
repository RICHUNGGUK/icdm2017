Real-time monitoring and control of remotely located robots allow the operators to continuously assess the risk of robot's non-repeatability. The elaborated methodology of predictive modeling on the risk of robot's non-repeatability consists of three stages: (1) regression analysis on the association between the disturbing factors and the key performance variables that influence the robot repeatability; (2) probabilistic assessment on the admissible deviations of key performance variables that simulate the robot operations as probabilities of job service without failures in the queueing system; and (3) Bayesian assessment on the risk of non-repeatability for the robot operations. The proposed methodology is expected to reduce the risk of robot's non-repeatability, which is better suited for today's networked, distributed production environment, where quality standards are stringent and customer expectations are high.
