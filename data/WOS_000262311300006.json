Little attention has been paid, however, on how to apply the association mining techniques to analyze questionnaire data. Therefore, this paper first identifies the various data types that may appear in a questionnaire. Then, we introduce the questionnaire data mining problem and define the rule patterns that can be mined from questionnaire data. A unified approach is developed based on fuzzy techniques so that all different data types can be handled in a uniform manner. After that, an algorithm is developed to discover fuzzy association rules from the questionnaire dataset. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, and the results indicate that our method is capable of finding interesting association rules that would have never been found by previous mining algorithms.
