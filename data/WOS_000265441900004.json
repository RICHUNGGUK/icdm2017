The analysis of experimentally recorded spectra was supported by quantum chemical calculations using density functional theory. The theoretically determined resonant (two-photon absorption probabilities) and non-resonant (first-order hyperpolarisability) nonlinear optical properties are also discussed, with an eye towards the performance of recently proposed long-range corrected (LRC) schemes (LC-BLYP and CAM-B3LYP functionals).", "paper_title": "Linear and nonlinear optical properties of azobenzene derivatives", "paper_id": "WOS:000265441900004"}
