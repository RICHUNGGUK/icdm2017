To remove this constraint and enable the simulation of complex parts, the computing power of high-performance computers is demanded. A further design objective is high scalability in performance and memory consumption on today's and future high-performance computing architectures to allow precise predictions of global part properties. In this work, we present a simulation tool for the crystallisation process and the parallelisation of the tool by a hybrid MPI-Pthreads approach that meets this design objective. We verify the performance and memory consumption of our parallelisation using a large simulation area of a realistic plastic component as a case study and can further predict that entire parts will also be calculable.", "paper_title": "Towards an accurate simulation of the crystallisation process in injection moulded plastic components by hybrid parallelisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000342387600008"}
