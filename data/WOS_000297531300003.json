In this perspective we propose a sequent-style natural deduction system and then the first sequent calculus for this logic. We prove its main properties like soundness, completeness and also the cut-elimination property. Finally we provide, from our calculus, the first decision procedure for IHL and then prove its decidability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
