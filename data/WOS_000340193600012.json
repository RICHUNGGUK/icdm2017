Two cases of time-varying delay, which is differentiable (Case 1) or not differentiable (Case 2), are considered. The considered nonlinear perturbations includes the norm-bounded uncertainties as a special case. Some delay-dependent stability criteria are derived by using a delay decomposition approach. In the delay decomposition approach, the entire delay interval is divided into multiple sub-intervals for which different energy functions are defined for building new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Some numerical and practical examples are given to show the effectiveness and significant improvement of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "New stability criteria for singular systems with time-varying delay and nonlinear perturbations", "paper_id": "WOS:000340193600012"}
