Such nonuniformly sampled output limits the achievable resolution of the TI-ADC. In order to correct the errors due to timing mismatches, the output of the TI-ADC is passed through a digital time-varying finite-length impulse response reconstructor. Such reconstructors convert the nonuniformly sampled output sequence to a uniformly spaced output. Since the reconstructor runs at the output rate of the TI-ADC, it is beneficial to reduce the number of coefficient multipliers in the reconstructor. Also, it is advantageous to have as few coefficient updates as possible when the timing errors change. Reconstructors that reduce the number of multipliers to be updated online do so at a cost of increased number of multiplications per corrected output sample. This paper proposes a technique which can be used to reduce the number of reconstructor coefficients that need to be updated online without increasing the number of multiplications per corrected output sample.", "paper_title": "Efficient signal reconstruction scheme for M-channel time-interleaved ADCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000326453400004"}
