Main effects plot and interaction plot are two data views often used to explore differences between mean values and interactions between the DOE parameters but they are mostly limited to two parameters. We propose a new data view, interactive interaction plot, that supports exploration and analysis of high-dimensional interactions between parameters. The data view is integrated within a coordinated multiple views system. We describe the new data view using an Olympic medals data set. We also describe a case study dealing with initial selection of hybrid vehicle components. Very positive feedback from automotive domain experts demonstrates the usefulness of the newly proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Interactive interaction plot Supporting parameter space exploration in a design phase", "paper_id": "WOS:000357487500030"}
