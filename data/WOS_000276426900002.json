Movement of fluid particles in a helical pipe has been traced CFD simulations are carried out for vertically oriented helical coils by varying coil parameters such as (i) pitch circle diameter, (ii) tube pitch and (iii) pipe diameter and their influence on heat transfer has been studied. After establishing influence of these parameters, correlations for prediction of Nusselt number has been developed. A correlation to predict the local values of Nusselt number as a function of angular location of the point is also presented (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
