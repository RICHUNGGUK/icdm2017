Indel detection using next-gen data is difficult and identification of long structural variations is extremely challenging. Results: We present Pindel, a pattern growth approach, to detect breakpoints of large deletions and medium-sized insertions from paired-end short reads. We use both simulated reads and real data to demonstrate the efficiency of the computer program and accuracy of the results.", "paper_title": "Pindel: a pattern growth approach to detect break points of large deletions and medium sized insertions from paired-end short reads", "paper_id": "WOS:000271106800026"}
