Dually, the final coalgebras can be obtained by an inverse limit process. In order to explore the limits of this method we look at Heyting algebras which have mixed rank 0-1 axiomatizations. We will see that Heyting algebras are special in that they are almost rank 1 axiomatized and can be handled by a slight variant of the rank 1 coalgebraic methods.", "paper_title": "FINITELY GENERATED FREE HEYTING ALGEBRAS VIA BIRKHOFF DUALITY AND COALGEBRA", "paper_id": "WOS:000301227100006"}
