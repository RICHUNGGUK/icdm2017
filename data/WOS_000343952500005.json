The hedonic and utilitarian value that an individual assigns to a mobile device can have a significant impact on the overall value of the device to that person. For those individuals that see the high value of the mobile devices, a high degree of opportunity for utilizing the mobile device is seen. Further, those who see the opportunities that exist with the mobile devices place an added amount of effort into using the device. In addition, it was determined that for those individuals perceiving greater control by the organization, more user adaptation effort was put forth. The impact of this organizational-level study could have an impact on the use of MDs within an organization as well as the efforts used by employees related to MD use.", "paper_title": "MOBILE DEVICE ADAPTATION EFFORTS: THE IMPACT OF HEDONIC AND UTILITARIAN VALUE", "paper_id": "WOS:000343952500005"}
