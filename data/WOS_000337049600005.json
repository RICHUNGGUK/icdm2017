An equivalent problem can be found in operations research, and it is known as scheduling tasks on unrelated parallel machines (also known as R parallel to C-max). Given this equivalence observation, we present the spanning tree decentralized task distribution algorithm (ST-DTDA), the first decentralized solution to R parallel to C-max. ST-DTDA achieves decomposition by means of the min-max algorithm, a member of the generalized distributive law family, that performs inference by message-passing along the edges of a graphical model (known as a junction tree). Specifically, ST-DTDA uses min-max to optimally solve an approximation of the original R parallel to C-max problem that results from eliminating possible agent-task allocations until it is mapped into an acyclic structure. To eliminate those allocations that are least likely to have an impact on the solution quality, ST-DTDA uses a heuristic approach. Moreover, ST-DTDA provides a per-instance approximation ratio that guarantees that the make span of its solution (optimal in the approximated R parallel to C-max problem) is not more than a factor rho times the make span of the optimal of the original problem. In our empirical evaluation of ST-DTDA, we show that ST-DTDA, with a min-regret heuristic, converges to solutions that are between 78 and 95% optimal whilst providing approximation ratios lower than 3.", "paper_title": "A Message-Passing Approach to Decentralized Parallel Machine Scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000337049600005"}
