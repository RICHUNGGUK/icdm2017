This talk presents representative algorithms for important problems in wireless sensor networks, such as data propagation and energy balance. The protocol design uses key algorithmic techniques like randomization and local optimization. Crucial performance properties of the protocols (correctness, fault-tolerance, scalability) and their trade-offs are investigated through both analytic means and large scale simulation. The experimental evaluation of algorithms for such networks is very beneficial, not only towards validating and fine-tuning algorithmic design and analysis, but also because of the ability to study the accurate impact of several important network parameters and technological details.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for wireless sensor networks: Design, analysis and experimental evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238121700001"}
