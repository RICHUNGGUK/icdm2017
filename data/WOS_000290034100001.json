One of the topics of interests in DEA is sensitivity and stability analysis of decision making units (DMUs). Due to the uncertainty of the data in real life, this paper will give some DEA models in fuzzy environment. It is followed by a series analysis of sensitivity and stability for all DMUs. Finally a numerical example will be presented to give an illustration of the sensitivity and stability analysis.", "paper_title": "Sensitivity and stability analysis in fuzzy data envelopment analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000290034100001"}
