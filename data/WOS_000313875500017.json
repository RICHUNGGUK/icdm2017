It not only allows community members to post and answer questions but also enables general users to seek information from a comprehensive set of well-answered questions. However, existing cQA forums usually provide only textual answers, which are not informative enough for many questions. In this paper, we propose a scheme that is able to enrich textual answers in cQA with appropriate media data. Our scheme consists of three components: answer medium selection, query generation for multimedia search, and multimedia data selection and presentation. This approach automatically determines which type of media information should be added for a textual answer. It then automatically collects data from the web to enrich the answer. By processing a large set of QA pairs and adding them to a pool, our approach can enable a novel multimedia question answering (MMQA) approach as users can find multimedia answers by matching their questions with those in the pool. Different from a lot of MMQA research efforts that attempt to directly answer questions with image and video data, our approach is built based on community-contributed textual answers and thus it is able to deal with more complex questions. We have conducted extensive experiments on a multi-source QA dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Beyond Text QA: Multimedia Answer Generation by Harvesting Web Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000313875500017"}
