Skin detection using color information can be a challenging task as the skin appearance in images is affected by various factors such as illumination, background, camera characteristics and ethnicity. This paper presents a method of facial skin extraction by estimating varying illumination of the image and using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) of facial images. For illumination estimation, two skin models are used. One is under normal condition and the other is under bright illumination condition. If the estimated illumination is very far from the normal image, then the given image is illumination compensated and feeds again to Gaussian Mixture Model for segmentation, which automatically segments the skin portion. Experimental results on frontal and lateral color images show the efficiency of the proposed method compared with the conventional skin color segmentation method based on GMM. Experimental results show that this method is highly applicable for practical purpose such as surgical planning.", "paper_title": "AUTOMATIC FACIAL SKIN DETECTION USING GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL UNDER VARYING ILLUMINATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000301026100008"}
