In this paper, we shall present a new architecture for ubiquitous computing environment on cloud computing platform for mobile application. Our system provides a combined architecture of ubiquitous and cloud computing which supports a powerful framework for mobile applications which requires high performance. It is composed of three layers: cloud service layer (CSL), machine to machine (M2M) service layer (MSL) and ubiquitous service layer. CSL provides an agent based processing platform for executing various distributed models, and offers on-demand VM allocation for dynamic execution of mobile processes. Also, CSL offers cloud infrastructure controller which supports a unified interface for various cloud infrastructure via cloud infrastructure interface so that mobile applications may be launched on any cloud environment. MSL is the development of the M2M and IoT open up all types of service motivated opportunities, sending increased efficiencies, well customer value and improved quality of mobile application environment. Also, we describe a soft-ware mobility model in terms of state transition and performance parameters for response time, dynamic migration, and loss ratio on cloud computing environment for mobile applications, and the experimental results show that the computation intensive cloud infrastructure on ubiquitous environment mobile applications can be executed efficiently.", "paper_title": "Cloud infrastructure for ubiquitous M2M and IoT environment mobile application", "paper_id": "WOS:000354412400010"}
