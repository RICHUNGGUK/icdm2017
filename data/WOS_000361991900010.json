Heffter arrays are useful in embedding the complete graph on an orientable surface where the embedding has the property that each edge borders exactly one s-cycle and one t-cycle. Archdeacon, Boothby and Dinitz proved that these arrays can be constructed in the case when , i.e every cell is filled. In this paper we concentrate on square arrays with empty cells where every row sum and every column sum is in . We solve most of the instances of this case.", "paper_title": "Square integer Heffter arrays with empty cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000361991900010"}
