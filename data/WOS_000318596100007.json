A forensic analyst might reveal these traces by analyzing the histogram of discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients and exploit them to identify local tampering, copy-move forgery, etc. At the same time, it has been recently shown that a knowledgeable adversary can possibly conceal the traces of JPEG compression, by adding a dithering noise signal in the DCT domain, in order to restore the histogram of the original image. In this paper, we study the processing chain that arises in the case of JPEG compression anti-forensics. We take the perspective of the forensic analyst, and we show how it is possible to counter the aforementioned anti-forensic method revealing the traces of JPEG compression, regardless of the quantization matrix being used. Tests on a large image dataset demonstrated that the proposed detector was able to achieve an average accuracy equal to 93%, rising above 99% when excluding the case of nearly lossless JPEG compression.", "paper_title": "Revealing the Traces of JPEG Compression Anti-Forensics", "paper_id": "WOS:000318596100007"}
