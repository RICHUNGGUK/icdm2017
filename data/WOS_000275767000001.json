A graph is said to be an alpha-expander if every vertex set U subset of V of size at most 1/2 vertical bar V vertical bar has a neighborhood of size at least or alpha vertical bar U vertical bar. We show that the algorithm proposed by Goldreich and Ron [9](ECCC-2000) for testing the expansion of a graph distinguishes with high probability between alpha-expanders of degree bound d and graphs which are epsilon-far from having expansion at least Omega (alpha(2)). This improves a recent result of Czumaj and Sohler [3] (FOCS-07) who showed that this algorithm can distinguish between alpha-expanders of degree bound d and graphs which are epsilon-far from having expansion at least Omega (alpha(2)/log n). It also improves a recent result of Kale and Seshadhri [12] (ECCC-2007) who showed that this algorithm can distinguish between alpha-expanders; and graphs which are epsilon-far from having expansion at least Omega (alpha(2)) with twice the maximum degree. Our methods combine the techniques of [3], [9] and [12]. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Testing the expansion of a graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000275767000001"}
