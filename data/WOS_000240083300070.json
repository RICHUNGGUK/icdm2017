First of all, according to the important factor to influence the running state by the Multifactor analyze method, we have defined and analyzed the parameter structure of the average and error for state observe values correspondence to the fault point; Simultaneous, the fitting quantitative model and error control threshold of complicated system were presented; secondly, we has given the running principium of integration system to fault detect and designed the network topological structure and the data transfer model; Finally, a simulated example have shown that the technique is effectively and exactly. The theoretical analyze indicated that the presented integration technology of Fault detect has a broad prospect for practical application.", "paper_title": "The covariance constraint control method of fault detect for complicated systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300070"}
