As one application, we completely solve the problem of deciding finiteness in this class of groups. We also present an algorithm that, given such a finite group as input, in practice successfully constructs an isomorphic copy over a finite field, and uses this copy to investigate the group's structure. Implementations of our algorithms are available in MAGMA. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
