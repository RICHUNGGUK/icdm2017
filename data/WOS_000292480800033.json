The current codebook model typically resorts to large codebook to obtain higher performance for scene categorization, which severely limits the practical applicability of the model. Our model formulates the codebook model with the theory of vector quantization, and thus uses the famous technique of classified vector quantization for scene-category modeling. The significant feature in our model is that it is beneficial for scene categorization, especially at small codebook size, while saving much computation complexity for quantization. We evaluate the proposed model on a well-known challenging scene dataset: 15 Natural Scenes. The experiments have demonstrated that our model can decrease the computation time for codebook generation. What is more, our model can get better performance for scene categorization, and the gain of performance becomes more pronounced at small codebook size.", "paper_title": "Scene Categorization with Classified Codebook Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000292480800033"}
