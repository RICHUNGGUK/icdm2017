Here, we propose a model-free dynamic-growing control architecture for parallel robots that combines the merits of self-organizing systems with those of interval type-2 fuzzy neural systems. The proposed approach is then applied experimentally to position control of a 3-PSP (Prismatic-Spherical-Prismatic) parallel robot. The proposed rule-base construction is different from most conventional self-organizing approaches by omitting the node pruning process while adding nodes more conservatively. This helps preserve valuable historical rules for when they are needed. The use of interval type-2 fuzzy logic structure also better enables coping with uncertainties in parameters, dynamics of the robot model and uncertainties in rule space. Finally, the adaptation structure allows learning and further adapts the rule base to changing environment. Multiple simulation and experimental studies confirm that the proposed approach leads to fewer rules, lower computational cost and higher accuracy when compared with two competing type-1 and type-2 fuzzy neural controllers.
