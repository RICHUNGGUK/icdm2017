As a result, several new models, i.e., expected value model, chance-constrained programming model and dependent-chance programming model, are constructed on the basis of credibility theory. After that, the crisp equivalences are also discussed for different models. In order to solve the models, hybrid intelligent algorithm is designed based on the fuzzy simulation technique and tabu search algorithm. Finally, two application results are given to show the applications of the models and algorithm. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
