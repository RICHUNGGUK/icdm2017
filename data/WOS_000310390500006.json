Unilateral motor deficits of the arm, for example, are commonly experienced poststroke. Our Augmented Reflection Technology (ART) system provides an augmented reality environment that contributes to this increasingly rich area of research. We present the current set of technological capabilities of the ART system exemplified in two experimental laboratory studies as well as a prototype system built on top of ART which \"fools the brain\" by visually amplifying user's hand movements small actual hand movements lead to perceived larger movements. We validate the usability of our system in an empirical study with forty-five non-clinical participants. In addition, we present the first qualitative evidence for the utility of our approach and system for stroke recovery and motor rehabilitation. Future uses of the system are considered by way of conclusion. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
