In this paper, we Study the effects of different node distributions oil the local throughput of the slotted ALOHA MAC protocol. The throughput achieved in a network where the nodes are distributed according, to a Poisson point process is used as a baseline performance measure for the comparison with other point distributions. We show that non-uniform random node distributions have a strong impact oil the local throughput. This has also effects oil the network capacity and performance. The results show that the node topology should he taken into account in more detailed analyses and simulations of ad hoc, sensor, and mesh networks.", "paper_title": "The Effects of Topology on the Local Throughput of Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000263985500008"}
