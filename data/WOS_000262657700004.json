The DCT based predictive coding and VLC based entropy coding greatly increase the coding efficiency, but make the compressed video stream very sensitive to transmission errors. Therefore, this paper proposes a reliable error resilient video coding and video transmission framework. In order to improve the robustness to packet loss errors, an error resilient video coding algorithm named Z-FMO is proposed. Some channel may bring random bit errors, an adaptive error concealment algorithm based on macroblock boundary gradient namely ECMBG is proposed aiming at such problem. As the indispensable part of a video transmission system, we implement an adaptive video transmission control algorithm JCBAF. Experimental results show that the proposed framework performs well both in R-D performance and subjective quality. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
