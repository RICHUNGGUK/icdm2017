We do not assume that the underlying domain is finite. Instead, we concentrate on results that hold in the most general case that the underlying domain is possibly infinite. This paper presents three fundamental representation results, each of which also provides a construction method: (i) score function-based representations, (ii) inclusion-based representations, (iii) representations by decomposition into crisp linear orders and fuzzy equivalence relations, which also facilitates a pseudo-metric-based construction.
