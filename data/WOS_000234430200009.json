For many applications, boundaries carry most of the relevant information. Reliable detection of boundaries is often hampered by limitations of the imaging process, such as blurring and noise. We present a method to identify the materials that form the boundaries. These materials are then used in a new domain that facilitates interactive and semiautomatic design of appropriate transfer functions. We also show how the obtained boundary information can be used in region- growing- based segmentation.", "paper_title": "Visualization of boundaries in volumetric data sets using LH histograms", "paper_id": "WOS:000234430200009"}
