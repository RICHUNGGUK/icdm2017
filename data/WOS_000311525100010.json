This approach describes how to provide task-specific context-free grammars for XML documents, as well as how to decompose complex processing tasks into simpler ones with attribute-grammar fragments. The result is a high-level, syntax-directed declarative specification for the processing of XML documents, which facilitates the development and maintenance of complex XML processing applications while preserving the flexibility of general-purpose XML processing models. The grammatical approach is illustrated using Chasqui, an e-learning platform for building educational digital libraries of learning objects. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
