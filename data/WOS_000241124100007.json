This study describes a methodology for detecting misassigned concepts from source systems to SNOMED CT and presents the results of applying this methodology to a subset of concepts from two standardized nursing languages, the Nursing Interventions Classification and the Nursing Outcomes Classification. The methodology is based on comparing the knowledge representations of a set of nursing concepts between source systems (nursing languages) and SNOMED CT, If any nursing concept differs in knowledge representation in the target system compared with the source system, editorial misassignment of the concept was declared and recommendations for target system developers were made. In a total of 75 nursing concepts used to test this method, five misassigned concepts (6.6%) were found in SNOMED CT. This method can be used to validate other healthcare languages.", "paper_title": "Standardized nursing language in the systematized nomenclature of medicine clinical terms - A cross-mapping validation method", "paper_id": "WOS:000241124100007"}
