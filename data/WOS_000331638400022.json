In this paper, a novel retrieval approach combined differential geometry and co-occurrence matrix is presented. Firstly, Gaussian curvature and mean curvature are utilized to represent the inherent characteristic of spatial surface, and then we use co-occurrence matrix to store the shape information of 3D images. Secondly, normalization process is applied to the co-occurrence matrix and the invariants independence of the translation, scaling, and rotation transforms are proved. In comparison with the recent methods, experiments indicate a lower computation complexity and a better retrieval rate to 3D images with slight different shape characteristic.", "paper_title": "3D image retrieval based on differential geometry and co-occurrence matrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000331638400022"}
