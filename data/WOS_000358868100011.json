We present a new interpretation of the Wedderburn rank reduction formula and its associated biconjugation process and see a more extensive result of the formula. In doing this, we propose a new formulation based on the null space transformations on rows and columns of A simultaneously, and show several matrix factorizations that can be derived from the Wedderburn rank reduction formula. We also present a generalization of the biconjugation process and compute banded and Hessenberg factorizations. Using the new formulation, we compute the WZ and ZW factorizations of a nonsingular matrix as well as the Z(T)Z and the (WW)-W-T factorizations of a symmetric positive definite matrix. Then, we develop the integer Wedderburn rank reduction formula and its integer biconjugation process and present a class of algorithms for computing all integer matrix factorizations such as the integer LU factorization and the Smith normal form of an arbitrary integer matrix.", "paper_title": "Real and integer Wedderburn rank reduction formulas for matrix decompositions", "paper_id": "WOS:000358868100011"}
