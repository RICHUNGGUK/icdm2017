We first prove that the problem 2-RSP is NP-complete, improving the previously known result that the problem 10-RSP is NP-complete. We then consider a constrained d-RSP problem in which each line-segment s in the spanning path must cover all the points in the given set that share the same line with s. We present a new parameterized algorithm with running time O-center dot((2d)(k)) for the constrained d-RSP problem, which significantly improves the previous best result and is the first parameterized algorithm of running time O-center dot(k(O(k))) for the constrained d-RSP problem for a fixed d. We show that these results can be extended to the Minimum Link-Length Rectilinear Traveling Salesman problem.", "paper_title": "On the Minimum Link-Length Rectilinear Spanning Path Problem: Complexity and Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000344990300016"}
