However, this new dimension of dynamic hardware reconfigurability has rendered existing CAD tools and platforms incapable of efficiently exploring the design space. As a solution, we proposed a novel UML-based hardware/software co-design platform (UCoP) targeting at dynamically partially reconfigurable network security systems (DPRNSS). Computation-intensive network security functions, implemented as reconfigurable hardware functions, can be configured on-demand into a DPRNSS at run-time. Thus, UCoP not only supports dynamic adaptation to different environment conditions, but also increases hardware resource utilization. UCoP supports design space exploration for reconfigurable systems in three folds. Firstly, it provides reusable models of typical reconfigurable systems that can be customized according to user applications. Secondly, UCoP provides a partially reconfigurable hardware task template, using which users can focus on their hardware designs without going through the full partial reconfiguration flow. Thirdly, UCoP provides direct interactions between UML system models and real reconfigurable hardware modules, thus allowing accurate time measurements. Compared to the existing lower-bound and synthesis-based estimation methods, the accurate time measurements using UCoP at a high abstraction level can more efficiently reduce the system development efforts.
