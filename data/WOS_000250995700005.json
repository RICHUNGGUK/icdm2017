A case study demonstrating such proofs is presented. The study shows that the stability region of the central scheme for advection-diffusion equation with Runge-Kutta time discretization is much bigger than classical stability region.", "paper_title": "Quantifier elimination supported proofs in the numerical treatment of fluid flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000250995700005"}
