Unlike other methodologies in the area, which mainly concentrate on attribute comparison, this methodology is designed to map objects of an ontology to a tree structure, restructure the tree, and rely on the tree structure to integrate ontologies through attribute comparison. The new methodology utilizes accurate matching and partial matching to group the matched objects to enhance the mapping accuracy. Once the tree structure is established, it can be reused to answer different queries. This significantly enhances its efficiency.", "paper_title": "Tree-structure Based Ontology Integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000298259200004"}
