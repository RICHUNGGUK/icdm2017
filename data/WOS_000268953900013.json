Landau's theoretical analysis [Landau L, Levich B. Dragging of a liquid by moving a plate. Acta Physicochim URSS 1942:17:42-54] provides a formula which permits the prediction of the final film thickness but only for a steady flow at small capillary numbers Ca. Unfortunately, certain more recent experimental results [Kizito J, Kamotani Y, Ostrach S. Experimental free coating flows at high capillary and Reynolds number. Exp Fluids 1999;27:235-43] have shown the formula cannot be used to predict the mean value of the thickness for several regimes at low capillary numbers. The aim of this paper is to develop a reliable numerical code to correctly predict the hydrodynamics field for this configuration. This numerical simulation requires an unsteady Navier-Stokes code using the ALE formulation and a semi-implicit front tracking method for the moving free surface. The code, developed here, uses the finite element environment Freefem++ and provides quantitative results which fit the experimental data. It also shows that the problem requires the description of two dimensionless parameters (capillary number Ca and Morton number m). Moreover, the steady state is found only for a range of parameters, Ca and m, and wavy states can produce fluctuations which can reach 10% of the mean value of the film thickness.
