Although projective dynamics is fundamentally nonlinear, its convergence behavior is similar to that of an iterative method solving a linear system. Because of that, we can estimate the \"spectral radius\" and use it in the Chebyshev approach to accelerate the convergence by at least one order of magnitude, when the global step is handled by the direct solver, the Jacobi solver, or even the Gauss-Seidel solver. Our experiment shows that the combination of the Chebyshev approach and the direct solver runs fastest on CPU, while the combination of the Chebyshev approach and the Jacobi solver outperforms any other combination on GPU, as it is highly compatible with parallel computing. Our experiment further shows position-based dynamics can be accelerated by the Chebyshev approach as well, although the effect is less obvious for tetrahedral meshes. The whole approach is simple, fast, effective, GPU-friendly, and has a small memory cost.", "paper_title": "A Chebyshev Semi-Iterative Approach for Accelerating Projective and Position-based Dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000363671200082"}
