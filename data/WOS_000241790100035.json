According to the new theory, we discover that neural coding under action of stimulation in brain is complete with way of energy coding. Due to energy coding to be able to reveal mechanism of brain information processing in physical essence, we can not only finely reappear various experimental results of neuro-electrophysiology, but also quantitatively explain the experimental results from neuroscientists at Yale University in recently by means of the principle of energy coding.", "paper_title": "A new mechanism on brain information processing - energy coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100035"}
