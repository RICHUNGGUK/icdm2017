The design of fuzzy systems has been successfully performed by applying evolutionary and, in particular, genetic algorithms, and recently, this approach has been extended by using multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, which can consider multiple conflicting objectives, instead of a single one. The hybridization between multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and fuzzy systems is currently known as multiobjective evolutionary fuzzy systems. This paper presents an overview of multiobjective evolutionary fuzzy systems, describing the main contributions on this field and providing a two-level taxonomy of the existing proposals, in order to outline a well-established framework that could help researchers who work on significant further developments. Finally, some considerations of recent trends and potential research directions are presented.", "paper_title": "A Review of the Application of Multiobjective Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems: Current Status and Further Directions", "paper_id": "WOS:000314724900004"}
