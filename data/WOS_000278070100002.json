We define a transition system of labeled processes and a transition system of labeled differential interaction nets. We prove that our translation from processes to nets is a bisimulation between these two transition systems. This shows that differential interaction nets are sufficiently expressive for representing concurrency and mobility, as formalized by the pi-calculus. Our study will concern essentially a replication-free fragment of the pi-calculus, but we shall also give indications on how to deal with a restricted form of replication.
