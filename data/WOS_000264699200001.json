For the first problem, we focus on the static 2-dimensional conflict-free (i.e., nested) filters. We design a linear space data structure with O(T (w) (n)+(log log n)(2)) query time on a RAM with word size O(w) bits where n is the number of filters in the router, w is the number of bits in an IP address and T-w (n) = O (min { log w, log w log log n/log log w, root log n/log log n}). This is the first optimal space data structure with poly-logarithmic query time for this problem. In practice, network filters often contain very few conflicts but are not completely conflict-free. Fortunately, conflicts can be resolved by adding conflict-resolving filters. Moreover, practical filters often possess another slightly different nesting property which we called 1-nestedness. We present an algorithm to resolve conflicts in a set of 1-nested filters in O(nT(w) (n) + k) time and linear space, where k is the number of filter pairs in conflict. Furthermore, we show that our data structure for the first problem can be adapted to apply on conflict-resolved 1-nested filters with the same query and space complexities.", "paper_title": "Two-Dimensional Packet Classification and Filter Conflict Resolution in the Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000264699200001"}
