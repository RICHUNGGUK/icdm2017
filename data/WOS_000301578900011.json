However, it may incur suboptimal solution since its objective function is positive semi-definite and the lack of complexity control. In order to address this shortcoming, we develop a novel SVR algorithm termed as smooth twin SVR (STSVR). The idea is to reformulate TSVR as a strongly convex problem, which results in unique global optimal solution for each subproblem. To solve the proposed optimization problem, we first adopt a smoothing technique to convert the original constrained quadratic programming problems into unconstrained minimization problems, and then use the well-known Newton-Armijo algorithm to solve the smooth TSVR. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated via experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets.", "paper_title": "Smooth twin support vector regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000301578900011"}
