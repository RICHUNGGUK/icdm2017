In some of these applications, the topology of the network is going to be dynamic: a connected system can evolve into a clustered system that presents a break of the global connectivity. Using a collector which will regularly visit the disjoint clusters enables to restore a discreet connectivity. A session layer protocol is proposed to reconstitute a consistent global information system. It enables the collector to reconstruct the communication context with the previously visited clusters, knowing they could have moved, merged, or have split. A node sensor model has been integrated into the Riverbed Opnet Modeler network simulation environment. Simulations show the benefits of the protocol, and particularly how it provides a better trajectory planning of the collector. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
