Merchants suffer great losses from credit card fraud. In this paper, we focus on \"chip and signature\" card, propose a credit card visual authentication scheme to resist lost and stolen card attack and protect the benefits of merchants. Inspired from the QR decomposition, we introduce image processing techniques to credit card transactions at POS terminals in order to ensure that the payer is the real cardholder, which gives an approach for credit card authentication. Our proposed scheme combines a one-time credit card transaction number and image processing techniques without changing the cardholders' transaction habit. We use a hash function to generate a one-time credit card transaction number with the shared secret only known to the cardholder and the bank, and a mathematical method of GF(2(8)) to solve the image problem, which will provide a math tool on image research. Analysis and comparison show that our scheme is secure in practical applications.", "paper_title": "The credit card visual authentication scheme based on GF(2(8)) field", "paper_id": "WOS:000365446600021"}
