In this paper we describe the architecture of such a system, referred to as x-Leges, highlighting its peer-to-peer architecture. The x-Leges system guarantees N autonomy of all involved organizations, (ii) the reuse of information stored in legacy systems and (iii) efficient process support and analysis.", "paper_title": "The x-Leges system: Peer-to-peer for legislative document exchange", "paper_id": "WOS:000241160200021"}
