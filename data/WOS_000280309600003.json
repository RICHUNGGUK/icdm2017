It draws on flow theory as its main theoretical foundation to understand and empirically assess the impact of flow on brand equity and behavioral intention in 3D virtual worlds. The findings suggest that the balance of skills and challenges in 3D virtual worlds influences users' flow experience, which in turn influences brand equity. Brand equity then increases behavioral intention. The authors also found that the impact of flow on behavioral intention in 3D virtual worlds is indirect because the relationship between them is mediated by brand equity. This research highlights the importance of balancing the challenges posed by 3D virtual world branding sites with the users' skills to maximize their flow experience and brand equity to increase their behavioral intention associated with the brand.", "paper_title": "Impact of Flow and Brand Equity in 3d Virtual Worlds", "paper_id": "WOS:000280309600003"}
