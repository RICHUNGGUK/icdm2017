In this paper, we apply the idea of typicality analysis from psychology and cognitive science to database query answering, and study the novel problem of answering top-k typicality queries. We model typicality in large data sets systematically. Three types of top-k typicality queries are formulated. To answer questions like \"Who are the top-k most typical NBA players?\", the measure of simple typicality is developed. To answer questions like \"Who are the top-k most typical guards distinguishing guards from other players?\", the notion of discriminative typicality is proposed. Moreover, to answer questions like \"Who are the best k typical guards in whole representing different types of guards?\", the notion of representative typicality is used. Computing the exact answer to a top-k typicality query requires quadratic time which is often too costly for online query answering on large databases. We develop a series of approximation methods for various situations: (1) the randomized tournament algorithm has linear complexity though it does not provide a theoretical guarantee on the quality of the answers; (2) the direct local typicality approximation using VP-trees provides an approximation quality guarantee; (3) a local typicality tree data structure can be exploited to index a large set of objects. Then, typicality queries can be answered efficiently with quality guarantees by a tournament method based on a Local Typicality Tree. An extensive performance study using two real data sets and a series of synthetic data sets clearly shows that top-k typicality queries are meaningful and our methods are practical.", "paper_title": "Top-k typicality queries and efficient query answering methods on large databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000266459600011"}
