The type of reactor inlet affects clearly the performance of the reactor. It was found that axial velocity distribution is more homogeneous when the reactor is operated with the tangential inlet than with the other inlets. The dispersion number (Nd) and the residence time in the reactor were obtained for each type of inlet. These parameters were used to evaluate the performance of the electrochemical reactor to reduce the Cr(VI) concentration at values lower than 05 mg/L The reactor operated with the tangential inlet had the best performance (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
