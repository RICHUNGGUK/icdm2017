Several graphical representation techniques were published in the literature. The most widely used of these is the expanded Durov diagram. The expanded Durov diagram is used to show the hydro-chemical processes occurring within different hydrogeological systems. Calculating Durov coordinates and plotting the diagram is a tedious and time consuming process especially when large number of multiple samples data sets is used. A \"DurovPlot\" program was written under DOS operating system to do the calculations, plotting and to help users of Durov Diagram to do their work fast, easy and accurate. Since the DOS operating system became obsolete which represents a great limitation, a new version called DurovPwin is designed in this study mainly to overcome any drawback of the previously expanded DurovPlot. The \"DurovPwin\" is a user friendly program with many new features such as it works under windows and uses the Dot Net framework features of compatibility and Graphical User Interface (GUI) facilities. A second new feature is adding the plot of pH and the plot of (TDS) on an arithmetic log scale. The third facility is the ability to initiate X-Y plots of any two parameters in a separate sheet. A fourth new feature is the ability to create preliminary report grouping the wells into subgroups of the nine fields of the expanded Durov diagram. Last feature is the ability to select the electrical balance tolerance and create subgroups of wells then manipulate the hydrochemistry data for each. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
