The quality of video received by each receiver can be modeled as a concave utility function of the video bitrate. We study and address the unique challenges introduced by maximizing utility in the multi-rate setting as compared to the single-rate case. We first determine an optimal set of tree structures for routing multi-rate content using scalable layered coding. We then develop Primal and Primal-dual based distributed algorithms to maximize aggregate utility of all receivers in all groups by multi-tree routing and show their convergence. These algorithms can be easily implemented and deployed on today's Internet. We have built a prototype video conferencing system to show that this approach converges to optimal bitrates to improve user experience and offers automatic adaptation to network conditions and user preferences.", "paper_title": "Optimizing Multi-Rate Peer-to-Peer Video Conferencing Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000295007300003"}
