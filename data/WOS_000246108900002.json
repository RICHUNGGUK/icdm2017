For the case of nonpreemptive service, we fully characterize the structure of the server's optimal service policy that minimizes the total average customer waiting costs. We show that the optimal service policy may never serve some classes of customers. For those classes that are served, we show that the optimal service policy is a simple static priority policy. We also derive sufficient conditions that determine the optimal priority sequence.", "paper_title": "Optimal server scheduling in nonpreemptive finite-population queueing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000246108900002"}
