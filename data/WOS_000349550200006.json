Protecting cyber-physical systems greatly depends on a deep understanding of the possible attacks and their properties. The prerequisite for quantitative and qualitative analyses of attacks is a knowledge base containing attack descriptions. The structure of the attack descriptions is the indispensable foundation of the knowledge base. This paper introduces the Cyber-Physical Attack Description Language (CP-ADL), which lays a cornerstone for the structured description of attacks on cyber-physical systems. The core of the language is a taxonomy of attacks on cyber-physical systems. The taxonomy specifies the semantically distinct aspects of attacks on cyber-physical systems that should be described. CP-ADL extends the taxonomy with the means to describe relationships between semantically distinct aspects, despite the complex relationships that exist for attacks on cyber-physical systems. The language is capable of expressing relationships between attack descriptions, including the links between attack steps and the folding of attack details. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
