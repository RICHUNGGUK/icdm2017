Whereas level set growth would use a fixed resolution voxel grid, our system extends the deformable simplicial complex (DSC), supporting new biological growth functions robustly on any surface polygonal mesh with adaptive subdivision, collision detection and topological control. We extend the DSC with temporally coherent texturing, and surface cracking with a user-controllable biological model coupled to the stresses introduced by the cambial growth model.", "paper_title": "Woodification: User-Controlled Cambial Growth Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000358326600035"}
