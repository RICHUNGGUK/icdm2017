The setup times are proportional to the length of the already processed jobs, i.e. the setup times are past-sequence-dependent (p-s-d). By the effects of learning and deterioration, we mean that the actual processing time of a job depends not only on the starting time of the job but also on its scheduled position. The article shows that the problems to minimise the makespan, sum of the kth power of completion times, total lateness and sum of earliness penalties (with common due date) are polynomially solvable under the proposed model. It further shows that the problems to minimise total weighted completion time, maximum lateness, maximum tardiness, total tardiness and total weighted earliness penalties (with common due date) are polynomially solvable under certain conditions.", "paper_title": "A generalisation model of learning and deteriorating effects on a single-machine scheduling with past-sequence-dependent setup times", "paper_id": "WOS:000308107500004"}
