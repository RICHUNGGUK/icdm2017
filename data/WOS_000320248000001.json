In this paper, we propose energy-efficient adaptive scheme for transmission (EAST) in WSNs. EAST is an IEEE 802.15.4 standard compliant. In this scheme, open-looping feedback process is used for temperature-aware link quality estimation and compensation, wherea closed-loop feedback process helps to divide network into three logical regions to minimize overhead of control packets. Threshold on transmitter power loss (RSSIloss) and current number of nodes (n(c)(t)) in each region help to adapt transmit power level (P-level) according to link quality changes due to temperature variation. Evaluation of the proposed scheme is done by considering mobile sensor nodes and reference node both static and mobile. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively adapts transmission P-level to changing link quality with less control packets overhead and energy consumption as compared to classical approach with single region in which maximum transmitter P-level assigned to compensate temperature variation.", "paper_title": "On Adaptive Energy-Efficient Transmission in WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000320248000001"}
