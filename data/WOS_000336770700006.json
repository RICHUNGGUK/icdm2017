Most training algorithms for SVM are not suitable for large datasets. Decision trees can simplify SVM training, however classification accuracy becomes lower when there are inseparable points. This paper introduces a novel method for SVM classification. A decision tree is used to detect the low entropy regions in input space, and Fisher's linear discriminant is applied to detect the data near to support vectors. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach has good classification accuracy and low standard deviation, the training is significantly faster than the other existing methods.
