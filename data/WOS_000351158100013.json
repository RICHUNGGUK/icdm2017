In order to make the implementation of the algorithm faster, our goal here is to minimize the exponent of in the case where every equation contains at most three unknowns. The main result states that if the total number of unknowns is equal to , then the best achievable exponent is between and for some positive constants and c(1) and c(2).", "paper_title": "Speeding up deciphering by hypergraph ordering", "paper_id": "WOS:000351158100013"}
