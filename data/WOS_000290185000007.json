The development is based on existing Summation-By-Parts operators and a weak interface treatment. The resulting scheme is proven to be accurate and stable. Numerical experiments verify the theoretical accuracy for smooth solutions. In addition, shock calculations are performed, using a scheme where the developed switching procedure is combined with the MUSCL technique. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
