It would be interesting to find out whether observers' judgments of the facial cues of a robot would be affected by a surrounding emotional context. This paper takes its inspiration from the contextual effects found on our interpretation of the expressions on human faces and computer avatars, and looks at the extent to which they also apply to the interpretation of the facial expressions of a mechanical robot head. The kinds of contexts that affect the recognition of robot emotional expressions, the circumstances under which such contextual effects occur, and the relationship between emotions and the surrounding situation, are observed and analyzed. Design implications for believable emotional robots are drawn. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
