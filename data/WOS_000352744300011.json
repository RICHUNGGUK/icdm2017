One of the reasons for this is that human behavior, even in short scenarios, requires the integration of multiple cognitive mechanisms that are deployed simultaneously and are interacting with each other in complex and subtle ways. In this paper we show how a simple scenario of watching television requires at least four different cognitive mechanisms: perception, narrative, premonition and confabulatory continuation. We describe the general requirements of these mechanisms and outline the techniques through which the Xapagy cognitive architecture implements them. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
