This procedure still needs to be optimized to overcome the high rate of implanted patients that do not respond to this therapy. We propose in this work a better characterization of the electro-mechanical (EM) coupling of each region of the left ventricle (LV) that could be useful to precise the best implantation site. A new descriptor is proposed with the extraction of local electro-mechanical delays. Their measurement is based on the fusion of anatomical, functional and electrical data acquired using computed tomography (CT), speckle tracking echocardiography (STE), and electro-anatomical mappings (EAM). We propose a workflow to place multimodal data in the same geometrical referential system and to extract local electro-mechanical descriptors. It implies the fusion of electrical and mechanical data on a 3D+ t anatomical model of the LV. It mainly consists in four steps: 1) the modeling of the endocardium using a dynamic surface estimated from CT images; 2) the semi-interactive registration of EAM data and CT images; 3) the automatic registration of STE data on the dynamic model, using a metric based on Fourier descriptors and dynamic time warping; 4) the temporal alignment between EAM and STE and the estimation of local electro-mechanical delays. The proposed process has been applied to real data corresponding to five patients undergoing CRT. Results show that local electro-mechanical delays provide meaningful information on the local characterization of the LV and may be useful for the optimal pacing site selection in CRT.", "paper_title": "Multimodal Registration and Data Fusion for Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000337125400013"}
