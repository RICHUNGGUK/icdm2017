This paper presents a synthetic speech detector that can be connected at the front-end or at the back-end of a standard SV system, and that will protect it from spoofing attacks coming from state-of-the-art statistical Text to Speech (TTS) systems. The system described is a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based binary classifier that uses natural and copy-synthesized signals obtained from the Wall Street Journal database to train the system models. Three different state-of-the-art vocoders are chosen and modeled using two sets of acoustic parameters: 1) relative phase shift and 2) canonical Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) parameters, as baseline. The vocoder dependency of the system and multivocoder modeling features are thoroughly studied. Additional phase-aware vocoders are also tested. Several experiments are carried out, showing that the phase-based parameters perform better and are able to cope with new unknown attacks. The final evaluations, testing synthetic TTS signals obtained from the Blizzard challenge, validate our proposal.", "paper_title": "Toward a Universal Synthetic Speech Spoofing Detection Using Phase Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000351753400004"}
