Libraries providing such features, while indispensable, are difficult to write, and often cannot be tailored or composed to meet the needs of specific users. We introduce reagents, a set of combinators for concisely expressing concurrency algorithms. Reagents scale as well as their hand-coded counterparts, while providing the composability existing libraries lack.", "paper_title": "Reagents: Expressing and Composing Fine-grained Concurrency", "paper_id": "WOS:000307582100015"}
