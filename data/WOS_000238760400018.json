In many fields, project managers get support from sophisticated decision support systems, but these haven't yet entered the software engineering mainstream. A hybrid modeling approach can quickly produce process models that can provide project managers accurate predictions, help them design the desired project trajectory, and validate process changes. The NASA Software Engineering Laboratory process provides a case study.", "paper_title": "A decision support system for software project management", "paper_id": "WOS:000238760400018"}
