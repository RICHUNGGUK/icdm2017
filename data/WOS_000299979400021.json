Modern information technology can play an important role in TPP safety assessment. The evaluation of power plant systems relies, to a large extent, on the knowledge and experience of the experts undertaking the task. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is introduced for the safety assessment of TPP since it models expertise through experience management. This paper provides a case-based approach for the Management System safety assessment decision making of TPP (MSSATPP). We introduce a case matching method named CBR-Grey, which integrates the Delphi approach and grey system theory. Based on this method, we implement a prototype of case-based knowledge system (CBRSYS-TPP) for the evaluation decision making of the panel of experts. Our experimental results based on a real-world TPP safety assessment data set show that CBRSYS-TPP has high accuracy and systematically good performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
