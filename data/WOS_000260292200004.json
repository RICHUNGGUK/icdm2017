In this paper we first obtain a relation for computing the number of common significant digits between the exact solution and a computed Solution of a one-dimensional initial-value problem obtained by using a single-step or multi-step method. In fact, by using the approximate solutions obtained with stepsizes h and h /2. the number of common significant digits between approximate solution with stepsizes h and exact solution is estimated. Then by using the stochastic arithmetic, the CESTAC method, and the CADNA library we propose an algorithm to control the round-off error effect on the Computed Solution. This method can easily apply to a system 01,11 one-dimensional initial-value problems. Finally some numerical examples are given to show the efficiency of the method. (C) 2007 IMACS.
