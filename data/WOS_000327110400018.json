Such systems can be found extensively in mechatronics and power electronic systems which exhibit self-sustained oscillations. Synchronization between two such systems is an interesting problem either theoretically or practically. Using a sliding mode control methodology, we synchronize a unidirectional coupling structure for the two chaotic systems. Numerical simulations are used to verify the theoretical analysis. Additionally, we report the robustness of the system in the presence of a noise in simulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
