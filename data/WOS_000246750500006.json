We obtain some simple criteria ensuring the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium and its global exponential stability by applying homeomorphism mapping, constructing a new Lyapunov functional and inequality techniques. These criteria are independent of delays and posses infinitely adjustable real parameters, which improve and extend some recent results [ J. Cao and M.
