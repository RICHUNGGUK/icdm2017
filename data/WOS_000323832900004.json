Previous studies on WSN topology tomography are restricted to static routing tree estimation, which is unrealistic in real-world WSN time-varying routing due to wireless channel dynamics. We study general WSN routing topology inference where routing structure is dynamic. We formulate the problem as a novel compressed sensing problem. We then devise a suite of decoding algorithms to recover the routing path of each aggregated measurement. Our approach is tested and evaluated though simulations with favorable results. WSN routing topology inference capability is essential for routing improvement, topology control, anomaly detection and load balance to enable erective network management and optimized operations of deployed WSNs.", "paper_title": "Routing Topology Inference for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000323832900004"}
