In such a context, privacy concerns are increasing and call for sophisticated solutions able to guarantee different levels of location privacy to the users. In this paper, we address this problem and present a solution based on different obfuscation operators that, when used individually or in combination, protect the privacy of the location information of users. We also introduce an adversary model and provide an analysis of the proposed obfuscation operators to evaluate their robustness against adversaries aiming to reverse the obfuscation effects to retrieve a location that better approximates the location of the users. Finally, we present some experimental results that validate our solution.", "paper_title": "An Obfuscation-Based Approach for Protecting Location Privacy", "paper_id": "WOS:000284163400002"}
