This bound improves upon the Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem bound and, for some codes, upon the Hartmann-Tzeng bound. Several Boston bounds are special cases of our bound. For some classes of codes, the bound on the minimum distance is refined. Furthermore, a quadratic-time decoding algorithm up to this new bound is developed. The determination of the error locations is based on the Euclidean algorithm and a modified Chien search. The error evaluation is done by solving a generalization of Forney's formula.", "paper_title": "Decoding Cyclic Codes up to a New Bound on the Minimum Distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000304245100046"}
