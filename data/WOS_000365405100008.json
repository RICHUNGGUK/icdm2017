This heterogeneity, stemming from actual deployments, is related to the involved data and control technologies or due to network segmentation. It is acknowledged that, in these scenarios, the deployment of a single software-defined networking (SDN) controller may not be practical or may have fundamental limitations, in terms of either scalability, complexity, or interoperability. To address this trend, and as a means to cope with the complexity growth, research in this area is considering the concept of SDN orchestration (the coordinated control of heterogeneous systems), abstraction (the selection of entity-relevant attributes), and the use of multiple controllers, commonly arranged in hierarchical or flat configurations. In this paper, we consider a hybrid approach combining elements from distributed control with elements from centralized control, relying on the concepts of abstraction and aggregation and hierarchical traffic engineering (TE). We propose a multidomain and multivendor network control architecture organized in layers, the abstract network layer and the control-specific layer, resulting in a mesh of generic SDN controllers that use generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS) protocols as their east/west interfaces (open shortest path first TE and Resource Reservation Protocol with extensions for TE as inter-SDN controller communications protocols), forming an abstracted topology. To validate the approach, and to evaluate factors such as end-to-end network service deployment delay or control overhead, the proposed architecture is implemented and validated in a control plane testbed. While emphasis is given to the control of optical (flexi-grid) networks, the proposed approach can be generalized to other transport technologies.", "paper_title": "Control and Orchestration of Multidomain Optical Networks With GMPLS as Inter-SDN Controller Communication [Invited]", "paper_id": "WOS:000365405100008"}
