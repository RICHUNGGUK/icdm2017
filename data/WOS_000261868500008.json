These activities are often partially overlapped in time and frequency, so that they are even more difficult to be separated in single-trial. Therefore, online applications based on induced brain activity require specific online processing methods to separate both activities efficiently. Here we propose a module-based methodology for the online extraction and quantification of induced brain activity during cognitive-related tasks. Further, the role of electrode montages and the minimization of the evoked activity are examined in both simulated and real data as part of the optimization process. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
