This network is used to model a real process and its weights are on-line updated using a recursive orthogonal least squares (ROLS) algorithm. The developed adaptive model is then used in model predictive control strategy, which is applied to a pilot multivariable chemical reactor. The first stage of the project, simulation study, has been investigated and is presented. The effectiveness of the adaptive control in improving the closed-loop performance has been demonstrated for process time-varying dynamics and model-process mismatch.", "paper_title": "Adaptive pseudo linear RBF model for process control", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000149"}
