For parametric spline surfaces, when constructing a multi-sided surface cap, we demonstrate a strong link between the uniform variation of the re-parameterization between (boundary) data of the joining pieces and a desirable distribution of curvature. We illustrate this interdependence between parameterization quality and surface quality by developing a G(1) bi-quintic surface cap consisting of it pieces that smoothly fills holes in a piecewise bi-cubic tensor-product spline complex. These bi-5 surface caps have arguably better shape than higher-degree, formally curvature continuous alternatives. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.
