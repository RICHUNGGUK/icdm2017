This paper formalizes the Network Control Problem (NCP) as a means of relating the field of diverse social network control subproblems. Additionally, this paper defines a novel NCP subproblem, the h-Consensus Avoidance Problem (h-CAP), as a next step towards solving the general NCP. Benchmark results for the h-CAP using Artificial Neural Networks, Evolutionary Neural Networks, and heuristic methods are presented, and interesting areas of the problem space are identified.", "paper_title": "Towards intelligent control of influence diffusion in social networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000355743100009"}
