Machine learning methods have become popular in this field. In this paper, a machine learning based P2P identification model is proposed, which combines ensemble learning with semi-supervised co-training techniques, using port-independent and payload-independent attributes. Ensemble learning can increase the flow accuracy while co-training makes full use of unlabeled samples. In the latter part of this paper, the model is used to identify hiding P2P traffics. A reasonable number of the formerly other samples are identified as P2P flows. Compared with traditional approaches, the effectiveness of our model is proved through a series of experiments from different aspects, including precision, recall and identification rate.", "paper_title": "Identifying P2P Applications Using Ensemble Learning and Co-Training", "paper_id": "WOS:000305576900008"}
