In this article, we will prove that any k-ary n-cube Q(n)(k), where n >= 2 is an integer and k >= 4 is an even integer, contains 2n mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles. More specifically, let N = vertical bar V(Q(n)(k))vertical bar v(i) is an element of V(Q(n)(k)) for 1 <= i <= N, and < v(1), v(2), ... , v(N), v(1)> be a Hamiltonian cycle of Q. We prove that Q(n)(k) contains 2n Hamiltonian cycles, denoted by C(l) := < v(1), v(l)(2) ... , v(l)(N), v(1)> for all 0 <= l <= 2n - 1, such that vi(i) not equal v(l')(i) for all 2 <= i <= N whenever l not equal l'. The result is optimal since each vertex of Q(n)(k) has exactly 2n neighbors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
