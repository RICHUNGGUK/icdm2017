We prove that free corecursive algebras are obtained as coproducts of the terminal coalgebra (considered as an algebra) and free algebras. The monad of free corecursive algebras is proved to be the free corecursive monad, where the concept of corecarsive monad is a generalization of Bigot's iterative monads, analogous to corecursive algebras generalizing completely iterative algebras. We also characterize the Eilenberg-Moore algebras for the free corecursive monad and call them Bloom algebras.", "paper_title": "CORECURSIVE ALGEBRAS, CORECURSIVE MONADS AND BLOOM MONADS", "paper_id": "WOS:000347714800020"}
