The first part of the survey addresses reliability planning problems with fault considerations related to electric distribution operations. The aim of this second part is to provide a comprehensive survey of optimization models and solution methodologies for contingency planning problems related to electric distribution operations. These problems include the restoration of service, the sequencing of switching operations, the routing of repair vehicles, the scheduling of repair crews, and the assignment of crews to repair sites.
