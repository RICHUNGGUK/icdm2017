However, one of the major challenges in deploying reliable WMNs is preventing their nodes from malicious attacks, which is of particular concern as attacks can severely degrade network performance. When a DoS attack is targeted over an entire communication path, it is called a path-based DoS attack. We study the performance impact of path-based DoS attacks by considering attack intensity, medium errors, physical diversity, collusion and hop count. We setup a wireless mesh testbed and configure a set of experiments to gather realistic measurements, and assess the effects of different factors. We find that medium errors have significant impact on the performance of WMNs when a path-based DoS attack is carried out, and the impact is exacerbated by the MAC layer retransmissions. We show that due to physical diversity, a far attacker can lead to an increased performance degradation than a close-by attacker. Additionally, we demonstrate that the joint impact of two colluding attackers is not as severe as the joint result of individual attacks. We also discuss a strategy to counter path-based DoS attacks which can potentially alleviate the impact of the attack significantly.", "paper_title": "An Experimental Study of the Performance Impact of Path-Based DoS Attacks in Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280681800008"}
