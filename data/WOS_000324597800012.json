Existing techniques of symmetry recognition, however, cannot recognize water reflection images correctly because of the complex and various distortions caused by the water wave. Hence, we propose a novel water reflection recognition technique to solve the problem. First, we construct a novel feature space composed of motion blur invariant moments in low-frequency curvelet space and of curvelet coefficients in high-frequency curvelet space. Second, we propose an efficient algorithm including two sub-algorithms: low-frequency reflection cost minimization and high-frequency curvelet coefficients discrimination to classify water reflection images and to determine the reflection axis. Through experimenting on authentic images in a series of tasks, the proposed techniques prove effective and reliable in classifying water reflection images and detecting the reflection axis, as well as in retrieving images with water reflection.", "paper_title": "Water Reflection Recognition Based on Motion Blur Invariant Moments in Curvelet Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000324597800012"}
