It also analyzed which organizational factors affect the adoption of information system in hospitals. The study included 577 hospitals in the statistical analysis. The HIS was measured by three indicators, which is based on the number of application systems in three core hospital functions (administration, management, and clinical). American Hospital Association and Dorenfest IHDS were merged to create sample data. Structural equation modeling was applied to estimate the parameters of the model. HIS is negatively associated with the total expense. However, it was not statistically significant. The internal variables of hospitals such as location, size, and system hospital variables were significantly related to the extent of HIS adoption.", "paper_title": "The relationship between healthcare information system and cost in hospital", "paper_id": "WOS:000324878400010"}
