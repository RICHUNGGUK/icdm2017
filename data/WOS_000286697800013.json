Both delay-independent and delay-dependent design criteria are presented under which the resulting estimation error system is globally asymptotically stable and a prescribed performance is guaranteed in the H(infinity) or generalized H(2) sense. It is shown that the gain matrices of the state estimator and the optimal performance indexes can be simultaneously obtained by solving convex optimization problems subject to linear matrix inequalities. It is worth noting that no slack variable is introduced in the proposed conditions, and thus the computational burden is reduced. The effectiveness of the developed results is finally demonstrated by simulation examples. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
