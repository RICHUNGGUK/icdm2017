We show how a MIMO radar imaging system can outperform a traditional radar system by reducing the number of transceiver antennas without sacrificing the image resolution. We use a minimum mean square error (MMSE) type receiver structure for this application that minimizes both interference and hardware complexity. We show how a group of sensor nodes can work together in determining one or more targets' locations. A radar image obtained from a single node can detect the presence of targets, but not provide a precise location information. However, spatially scattered group of nodes can together interpolate the targets' positions relative to them and obtain localization information. We provide an in-depth analysis of a MIMO radar system, and demonstrate the operation and utility of such target localization methods using sensor networks through simulation.", "paper_title": "MIMO Radar for Target Detection and Localization in Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000331983100010"}
