However, to the best of our knowledge, no method has been proposed for finding frequent subsequences of graphs from a set of graph sequences. In this paper, we define a novel class of graph subsequences by introducing axiomatic rules for graph transformations, their admissibility constraints, and a union graph. Then we propose an efficient approach named \"GTRACE\" for enumerating frequent transformation subsequences (FTSs) of graphs from a given set of graph sequences. The fundamental performance of the proposed method is evaluated using artificial datasets, and its practicality is confirmed by experiments using real-world datasets.", "paper_title": "GTRACE: Mining Frequent Subsequences from Graph Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000285488900014"}
