Tested on various PC's with LINUX Operating system: LINUX RAM: 120 kbytes Classification: 4.4 Nature of problem: Any integral arising in the evaluation of the two-loop sunrise Feynman diagram can be expressed in terms of a given set of Master Integrals, which should be calculated numerically. The program provides a fast and precise evaluation method of the Master Integrals for arbitrary (but not vanishing) masses and arbitrary value of the external momentum. Solution method: The integrals depend on three internal masses and the external momentum squared p(2). The method is a combination of an accelerated expansion in 1/p(2) in its (pretty largel) region of fast convergence and of a Runge-Kutta numerical solution of a system of linear differential equations. Running time: To obtain 4 Master Integrals on PC with 2 GHz processor it takes 3 mu s for series expansion with pre-calculated coefficients, 80 mu s for series expansion without pre-calculated coefficients. from a few seconds up to a few minutes for Runge-Kutta method (depending on the required accuracy and the values of the physical parameters).
