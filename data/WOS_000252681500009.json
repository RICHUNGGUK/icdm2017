We first identify three performance problems of the naive approach (i.e., SUBSKY) which can be used in processing arbitrary single-subspace skyline query. Then we propose a cell-dominance computation algorithm (i.e., CDCA) to efficiently overcome the drawbacks of SUBSKY. Specially, a novel pruning technique is used in CDCA to dramatically decrease the query time. Finally, based on the CDCA algorithm and the share mechanism between subspaces, we present and discuss the AOMSSQ algorithm and prove it sound and complete. We also present detailed theoretical analyses and extensive experiments that demonstrate our algorithms are both efficient and effective.", "paper_title": "Efficient optimization of multiple subspace skyline queries", "paper_id": "WOS:000252681500009"}
