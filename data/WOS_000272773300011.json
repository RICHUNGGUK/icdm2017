In this letter, motion-salient regions tire extracted based on the 2D log-Gabor wavelet transform of the spatio-temporal form of actions. A supervised classification technique is then used to classify the actions. The proposed method is robust to the irregular segmentation of actors. Moreover, the 2D log-Gabor wavelet permits more compact representation of actions than the recent neurobiological models using Gabor wavelet.", "paper_title": "2D Log-Gabor Wavelet Based Action Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000272773300011"}
