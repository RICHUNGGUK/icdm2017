We propose a methodology that is focused on the user while being able to improve the software development activities. The models are formally specified, avoiding a high number of errors in the application, thus reducing the problem solving time. Streets are characterized by their traffic direction, number of lanes, etc. Once the urban section is outlined, the traffic flow is automatically set up. Specialized behavior is included to model traffic lights, trucks, traffic signs, railways, etc. The basic idea is to provide a mapping into DEVS and Cell-DEVS models that can be easily executed with a simulation tool. As the modelers can focus on the problem to solve, development times for the simulators can be dramatically reduced. A front-end system allows the user to draw city sections (and then parse the drawing to create a valid ATLAS file), and an output subsystem permitting cars to be shown with realistic 3D graphics.
