In this paper, we firstly propose the notion of short strong designated verifier signature scheme, and extend it to the short identity-based strong designated verifier scheme. Then, we propose the first construction of short strong designated verifier signature scheme. We also extend our scheme to construct a short identity-based strong designated verifier signature scheme. The size of the signature of our schemes is the shortest compared to any existing schemes reported in the literature. We provide formal security proofs for our schemes based on the random oracle model. Finally, we also discuss an extension of our scheme to construct a short strong designated verifier signature without random oracle.", "paper_title": "Short (identity-based) strong designated verifier signature schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000237227700020"}
