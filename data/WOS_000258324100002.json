In general, this property cannot be applied to the control of computer systems as the measured variables are often computed over a data set, e.g., deadline miss ratio. In this paper we quantify the disturbance present in the measured variable as a function of the data set size and the sampling period, and we propose a feedback control structure that suppresses the measurement disturbance. The experiments we have carried out show that a controller using the proposed control structure outperforms a traditional control structure with regard to performance reliability.", "paper_title": "Quantifying and suppressing the measurement disturbance in feedback controlled real-time systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000258324100002"}
