In addition, there is often a strong motivation to simultaneously observe the same scene by more than one kind of sensor. How to sufficiently and effectively utilize the information captured by these different sensors is thus of considerable interest. This can be realized using video fusion, by which multiple aligned videos from different sensors are merged into a composite. In this paper, a video fusion algorithm is presented based on the 3D Surfacelet Transform (3D-ST) and the higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD). In the proposed method, input videos are first decomposed into many subbands using the 3D-ST. Then the relevant subbands from all of the input videos are merged to obtain the corresponding subbands of the intended fused video. Finally, the fused video is constructed by performing the inverse 3D-ST on the merged subband coefficients. Typically, the spatial information in the scene backgrounds and the temporal information related to moving objects are mixed together in each subband. In the proposed fusion method, the spatial and temporal information are actually first separated from each other and then merged using the HOSVD. This is different from the currently published fusion rules (e.g., spatio-temporal energy \"maximum\" or \"matching\"), which are usually just simple extensions of static image fusion rules. In these, the spatial and temporal information contained in the input videos are generally treated equally and merged by the same fusion strategy. In addition, we note that the so-called \"scene noise\" in an input video has been largely ignored by the current literature. We show that this noise can be distinguished from the spatio-temporal objects of interest in the scene and then suppressed using the HOSVD. Clearly, this would be very advantageous for a surveillance system, particularly one dealing with scenes of crowds. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fusion method exhibits a lower computational complexity than some existing published video fusion methods, such as the ones based on the structure tensor and the pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN). When the videos are noisy, a modified version of the proposed method is shown to perform better than specialized methods based on the Bivariate-Laplacian model and the PCNN. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
