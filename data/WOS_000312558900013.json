Features from ambient audio are used to generate a shared cryptographic key between devices without exchanging information about the ambient audio itself or the features utilized for the key generation process. We explore a common audio-fingerprinting approach and account for the noise in the derived fingerprints by employing error correcting codes. This fuzzy-cryptography scheme enables the adaptation of a specific value for the tolerated noise among fingerprints based on environmental conditions by altering the parameters of the error correction and the length of the audio samples utilized. In this paper, we experimentally verify the feasibility of the protocol in four different realistic settings and a laboratory experiment. The case studies include an office setting, a scenario where an attacker is capable of reproducing parts of the audio context, a setting near a traffic loaded road, and a crowded canteen environment. We apply statistical tests to show that the entropy of fingerprints based on ambient audio is high. The proposed scheme constitutes a totally unobtrusive but cryptographically strong security mechanism based on contextual information.", "paper_title": "Secure Communication Based on Ambient Audio", "paper_id": "WOS:000312558900013"}
