This solution provides nanosecond-scale synchronization between nodes and high data,rate transmission thanks to cross-layer design and the time-domain properties of UltraWide Band (UWB) modulation schemes. The high data rate is achieved through a specific implementation of a IR-UWB physical layer. Specific algorithms are also implanted into the MAC and physical layers and form a cross-layered synchronization protocol for deterministic Wireless Sensor Networks named WiDeCS (Wireless Deterministic Clock Synchronization). This protocol propagates master time reference to nodes of a cluster tree network. WiDeCS Cross layered scheme is possible thanks to flag signals rising in the physical layer. These signals, owing to the UWB time domain properties, capture precise timestamps of transmission and reception. Hardware level simulations show a clock synchronization precision of 2 ns with a 2 GHz bandwidth signal, and an ASIC demonstrator shows 374 ps synchronization precision and 677 Ps of standard deviation with the same bandwidth. In this paper, the physical layer implementation is detailed, and the cross-layered WiDeCS scheme is demonstrated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
