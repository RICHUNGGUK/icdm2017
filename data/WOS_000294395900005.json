The proposed novel real-world strategy tangibly improves surveillance performance by selecting near-optimal viewpoints along a prediction time horizon in order to maximize visibility of a human form in the presence of multiple, dynamic obstacles. Controlled experiments have demonstrated a positive relationship between system re-configurability and surveillance performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
