Relations to other variables, such as the tonality or the metric structure, are handled by training multiple HMMs or are ignored. In this paper, we propose a discriminative means of combining multiple probabilistic models of various musical variables by means of model interpolation. We evaluate our models in terms of their cross-entropy and their performance in harmonization experiments. The proposed model offered higher chord root accuracy than the reference musicological rule-based harmonizer by up to 5% absolute.", "paper_title": "Melody Harmonization With Interpolated Probabilistic Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000326310300003"}
