We simplify this mechanism and apply it to a threshold system. From view points of information quantity and estimation accuracy we show this mechanism enhances information transmission through the threshold system. In addition we extend our theory so that it could be applied to a truncation coding.", "paper_title": "Filtering for simple threshold systems: Self-tuning, mutual information and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000241305800015"}
