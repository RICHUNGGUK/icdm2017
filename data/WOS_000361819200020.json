Instead of formulating the problem with the Guassian or Laplacian CRF modeling techniques, which cannot exploit the full potential offered by the probabilistic modeling, this paper proposes a depth estimation CRF model with field of experts (FoE) as the prior. The minimum mean square error (MMSE) criteria is used to infer depth. Moreover, it is assumed that the variance of depth estimation error varies spatially in depth estimation model. This allows the proposed method to enjoy the benefits offered by the flexible prior and have the advantages of making use of the non-stationary variance probability model. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of RMSE-error and log10-error.", "paper_title": "A depth estimating method from a single image using FoE CRF", "paper_id": "WOS:000361819200020"}
