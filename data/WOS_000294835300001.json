Design/methodology/approach - Three terms from HPM solution are used. Findings The results show that this method is very effective and simple and can be applied to other nonlinear problems. Research limitations/implications - Comparison between the HPM and homotopy analysis methods for the studied problem shows a remarkable agreement and reveals that the HPM needs less work. Practical implications - It is suggested that this method should be called HPM with auxiliary parameters. This paper uses two auxiliary parameters, three or more auxiliary parameters could be used for accuracy consideration. Originality/value - In this paper, a two-parameter HPM is applied which is useful for finding an approximate analytical solution of MHD viscous flow due to a shrinking sheet.", "paper_title": "A new modified homotopy perturbation method with two free auxiliary parameters for solving MHD viscous flow due to a shrinking sheet", "paper_id": "WOS:000294835300001"}
