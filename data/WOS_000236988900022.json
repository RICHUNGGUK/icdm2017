More general methods produce curves over F-p where the bit length of p is often twice as large as that of the order r of the subgroup with embedding degree k; the best published results achieve rho = log(p)/log(r) similar to 5/4. In this paper we make the first step towards surpassing these limitations by describing a method to construct elliptic curves of prime order and embedding degree k = 12. The new curves lead to very efficient implementation: non-pairing operations need no more than F-p4 arithmetic, and pairing values can be compressed to one third of their length in a way compatible with point reduction techniques. We also discuss the role of large CM discriminants D to minimize p; in particular, for embedding degree k = 2q where q is prime we show that the ability to handle log(D)/log(r) similar to (q - 3)/(q - 1) enables building curves with rho similar to q/(q - 1).", "paper_title": "Pairing-friendly elliptic curves of prime order", "paper_id": "WOS:000236988900022"}
