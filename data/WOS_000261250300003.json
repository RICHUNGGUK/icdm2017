This paper presents an enhanced variant of light space perspective shadow maps to optimize perspective aliasing distribution in possible general cases where the light and view directions are not orthogonal. To be mathematically sound, the generalized representation of perspective aliasing errors has been derived in detail. Our experiments have shown the enhanced shadow quality using our algorithm in dynamic scenes.
