By comparing with two other models (degree-driven and cost-driven), it is shown that the cost-driven routing strategy is more complex and sensitive to traffic congestion. Another result indicates that the load distributions are determined by the connectivity distribution and route choice behaviors of the traffic network. The model thus provides useful insight for the design of traffic networks.", "paper_title": "Dynamics of routing mechanisms on traffic networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000253297900010"}
