Based on the definition of this objective function, we propose a training method in which the computational complexity is the same as that of the least mean squares (LMS) method. Simulation results indicate that our method could greatly improve the fault tolerance of RBF networks, as compared with the one trained by LMS method. Moreover, even if the tuning parameter is misspecified, the performance deviation is not significant. (C) 2011 Elsevier By.
