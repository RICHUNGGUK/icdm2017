In this study, we have developed a model to predict the stability of a guide designed to fit on a supporting bone surface, thereby providing feedback on the translational and rotational stability of the device. The method was validated by comparing different guide designs with respect to their stability on the contact surface and comparing these results to those measured with a set of experiments. This validation experiment indicates that our stability model can be used to predict the stability of the fit of a surgical guide during the preoperative design process.", "paper_title": "Preoperative analysis of the stability of fit of a patient-specific surgical guide", "paper_id": "WOS:000343244000004"}
