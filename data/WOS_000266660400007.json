The key ingredient of this method is to discretize the normalized gradient flow by Fourier spectral method in space and by semi-implicit Euler method in time. Different vortex lattice structures of condensate ground states in two-dimensional (2D) and 3D rapid rotating BECs are reported for both harmonic and harmonic-plus-quartic potentials. In addition, vortex lattices in rotating BECs with optical lattice potentials are also presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
