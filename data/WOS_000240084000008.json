In this paper, we present a generic optimal partitioning algorithm of mobile applications which tries to overcome the two obstacles. The algorithm can reallocate the components of an application among machines for saving resources according to the environment variations. For each resource, we construct a corresponding cost graph, involving computation cost, communication cost and migration cost, in the foundation of the software architecture. Based on the network flow theory, we transform the cost graph into an equivalent flow network that can be optimally cut by well-known Max-flow Min-cut algorithm. As a generic algorithm, the proposed algorithm can be applied to save network bandwidth, time or energy. In addition, it can elegantly allocate the software components among the two machines so as to balance multiple resource consumptions. The simulation results demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A generic software partitioning algorithm for pervasive computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000240084000008"}
