The Circuit Switched Tree (CST) is an important interconnect used to implement such architectures. A CST has a binary tree structure with processing elements (PEs) as leaves and switches as internal nodes. PEs communicate among themselves using the links of the tree. Key components for successful communication are scheduling individual communications and configuring the CST switches. This paper presents a scheduling and configuration algorithm for communications on a CST where conflicts necessitate multiple rounds of routing to perform all communications. The algorithm is distributed and requires only local information, yet it captures the global picture to ensure proper communication. The paper also explains how to apply the algorithm to an important class, \"well-nested communications\", for which the algorithm is optimal and efficient.", "paper_title": "Routing multiple width communications on the circuit switched tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000237139600003"}
