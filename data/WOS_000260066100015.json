Identifying gene function based on gene expression data is much easier in prokaryotes than eukaryotes due to the relatively simple structure of prokaryotes. Recent studies have shown that there is a strong learnable correlation between gene function and gene expression. In previous work, we presented novel clustering and neural network (NN) approaches for predicting mouse gene functions from gene expression. In this paper, we build on that work to significantly improve the clustering distribution and the network prediction error by using a different clustering algorithm along with a new NN training technique. Our results show that NNs can be extremely useful in this area. We present the improved results along with comparisons. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
