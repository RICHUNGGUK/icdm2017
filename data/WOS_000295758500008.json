We first assess the feasibility of relying on a tree-based topology management structure for mobile ad hoc networks and in particular for VANETs. Next, we enhance DAGRS, an existing decentralized model for enabling distributed tree management and build BODYF on it, an efficient broadcast algorithm. Several broadcasting algorithms of the state of the art are implemented in order to compare the performance of BODYF. The approach is validated by simulation through three realistic scenarios located in Luxembourg city: the city center for both pedestrian and vehicles, and a highway environment. The comparison is made in terms of the coverage achieved by the broadcasting process as well as the complexity of the messages. DAGRS/BODYF approach outperforms other existing protocols in terms of both the number of devices reached and the network use. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
