Single object tracking on monocular video streams is fairly well understood. However, when it comes to multiple objects, existing methods lack scalability and can recognize only a limited number of objects. Thanks to recent progress in feature matching, state-of-the-art image retrieval techniques can deal with millions of images. However, these methods do not focus on real-time video processing and cannot track retrieved objects. In this paper, we present a method that combines the speed and accuracy of tracking with the scalability of image retrieval. At the heart of our approach is a bi-layer clustering process that allows our system to index and retrieve objects based on tracks of features, thereby effectively summarizing the information available on multiple video frames. Dynamic learning of new viewpoints as the camera moves naturally yields the kind of robustness and reliability expected from an augmented reality engine. As a result, our system is able to track in real-time multiple objects, recognized with low delay from a database of more than 300 entries. We released the source code of our system in a package called Polyora.", "paper_title": "Dynamic learning, retrieval, and tracking to augment hundreds of photographs", "paper_id": "WOS:000340622300001"}
