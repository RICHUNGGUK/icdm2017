The main problem is to isolate all common real roots in rational rectangles, and to determine their intersection multiplicities. We present three algorithms and analyze their asymptotic bit complexity, obtaining a bound of (O) over tilde (B)(N(14)) for the purely projection-based method, and (O) over tilde (B)(N(12)) for two subresultant-based methods: this notation ignores polylogarithmic factors, where N bounds the degree, and the bitsize of the polynomials. The previous record bound was (O) over tilde (B)(N(14)). Our main tool is signed subresultant sequences. We exploit recent advances on the complexity Of univariate root isolation, and extend them to sign evaluation of bivariate polynomials over algebraic numbers, and real root counting for polynomials over an extension field. Our algorithms apply to the problem of simultaneous inequalities; they also compute the topology of real plane algebraic curves in (O) over tilde (B)(N(12)). whereas the previous bound was (O) over tilde (B)(N(14)). All algorithms have been implemented in MAPLE, ill Conjunction with numeric filtering. We compare them against FGB/RS, system solvers from SYNAPS, and MAPLE libraries INSULATE and TOP, which compute curve topology. Our software is among the most robust, and its runtimes are comparable, or within a small constant factor, with respect to the C/C++ libraries. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
