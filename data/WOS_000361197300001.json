The execution of the multimodel based algorithm consists of two phases, which are the preprocessing phase and the query processing phase. During the preprocessing phase, multiple models are constructed for each node according to their historical data. During the query processing phase, a suitable model is selected from the multiple models with the help of a sampling based algorithm, which is used to process the query. As the multimodel based algorithm needs to sample data from the network, it can waste energy more than that of the single model based algorithm in some cases, which does not sample data from the network. The cost of the multimodel based and single model based algorithm is analyzed. A cost model based algorithm is proposed to select a better algorithm to process a query from the two algorithms. Experimental results show that the cost model based algorithm can save 13.3% energy consumption more than that of the single model based algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Multimodel Based Range Query Processing Algorithm for Information Collection in CPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000361197300001"}
