In this paper, we propose the AutoAssociative Pyramidal Neural Network (AAPNet), which is an artificial neural network for one-class classification that uses autoassociative memory and receptive field concepts in its pyramidal architecture. The proposed neural network performs implicit feature extraction and learns how to reconstruct a pattern from such features. The AAPNet is evaluated using the object categorization Caltech-101 database and presents better results when compared with other state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
