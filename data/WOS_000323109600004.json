In this work, we have automatically classified normal, interictal and ictal EEG signals using the features derived from the ITD representation. The energy, fractal dimension and sample entropy features computed on ITD representation coupled with decision tree classifier has yielded an average classification accuracy of 95.67%, sensitivity and specificity of 99% and 99.5%, respectively using 10-fold cross validation scheme. With application of the nonlinear ITD representation, along with conceptual advancement and improvement of the accuracy, the developed system is clinically ready for mass screening in resource constrained and emerging economy scenarios.", "paper_title": "APPLICATION OF INTRINSIC TIME-SCALE DECOMPOSITION (ITD) TO EEG SIGNALS FOR AUTOMATED SEIZURE PREDICTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000323109600004"}
