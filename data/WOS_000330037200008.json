In the presence of opaque objects of arbitrary shape and topology, exploration is driven by minimization of residual uncertainty, that is primarily due to lack of visibility. The resulting optimal control is approximated with a computationally efficient heuristic, that is proven to complete exploration of a compact environment in a finite number of steps.", "paper_title": "Information-Seeking Control Under Visibility-Based Uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000330037200008"}
