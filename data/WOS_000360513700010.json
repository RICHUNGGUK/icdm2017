The paper refers to 3D frames subjected to complex combinations of statical and dynamical loads defined according to Eurocode rules. The yield surface of the sections is defined by its support function values associated to presso-flexural mechanisms and it is approximated as Minkowsld sum of ellipsoids. An algorithm capable of detecting the significant vertexes of the elastic envelope and suitable for use in the case of response spectrum analyses, is proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
