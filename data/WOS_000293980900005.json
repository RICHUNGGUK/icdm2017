However, when a linear array is utilized, R-MUSIC degrades severely for sources located in the vicinity of the array broadside. In this note, a measure is given to overcome this drawback.", "paper_title": "A note on \"A fast high-resolution method for bearing estimation in shallow ocean\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000293980900005"}
