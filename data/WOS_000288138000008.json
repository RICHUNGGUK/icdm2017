Cooperative communication has been proposed as an effective technique to mitigate the imperfections of the wireless medium by exploiting channel diversity and availability of neighboring nodes that can act as relays. Although numerous cooperative communication techniques have been proposed in the literature, most of them do not consider Quality of Service (QoS) issues in a wireless sensor network. In this work, we study how cooperative communication can be applied to achieve differentiated QoS in a sensor network that uses Ultra-Wideband (UWB) as its underlying PHY layer technology. SAUCeR is a slotted-aloha based ultra-wideband medium access control protocol with cooperative retransmissions that provides differentiated QoS in networks with varying traffic classes. Despite the high transmission rates provided by UWB, its impulse-based nature renders many conventional carrier sensing MAC protocols incompatible. Consequently, SAUCeR utilizes slotted-aloha to reduce packet collisions without the need for carrier sensing. Differentiated QoS is provided by allocating different resources (time slots) to varying traffic classes to segregate the contention between them. A QoS-aware cooperative retransmission technique and two distributed relay selection schemes are also introduced to improve overall traffic throughput and reduce end-to-end delay, while preventing the starvation of any traffic class.
