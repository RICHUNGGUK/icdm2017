We describe a new retrieval technique of integrating a probabilistic technique based on OkapiBM25 and a semantic analysis which based on the ontology of HowNet knowledge base and a special domain HowNet created for the restricted domain. Furthermore, we provide a method of question expansion by computing word semantic similarity. The system is first developed for a middle-size domain of sightseeing information. The experiments proved the efficiency of our method for restricted domain and it is feasible to transfer to other domains expediently using the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A new Question Answering system for Chinese restricted domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233300011"}
