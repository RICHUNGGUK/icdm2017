The proposed XY-scanner is composed of a voice coil motor (VCM) and double compound linear spring flexure guide mechanism. The challenge was to determine design variables properly while simultaneously satisfying the requirements of high resolution. long working range, high response speed, and compact size, because the relationships between the design variables and the system parameters are complex. Therefore, we developed a design that would provide the optimal tradeoff in terms of design variables. The objective was to maximize the first resonant frequencies of the XY-scanner to increase response speed while limiting the size of the scanner to 100 mm x 100 mm x 50 mm. The XY-scanner was fabricated with optimally-designed values, and its performance was evaluated. From the experimental results, the first resonant frequencies of XY-scanner were 26.68 Hz for the X-axis and 22.79 Hz for the Y-axis. The measured results of the 10 nm resolution and 2 mm working range confirmed that the designed scanner could be successfully used in precision fields requiring nanometer-level resolution and millimeter-level travel range.
