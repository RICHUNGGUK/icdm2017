We studied in particular a particular protocol that we proved to converge towards root 1/2, using weak-convergence methods for stochastic processes. In this paper, we prove that it is possible to compute root 1/2 with precision epsilon > 0 in a time polynomial in 1/epsilon using a number of agents polynomial in 1/epsilon, with individuals that can have only two states. This is established through a general result on approximation of stochastic differential equations by a stochastic Euler-like discretization algorithm, of general interest. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
