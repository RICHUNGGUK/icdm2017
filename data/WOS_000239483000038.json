The algorithm is based on a geometrical representation of M-P neuron, i.e., for each category, CWSN tries to find a set of sphere neighborhoods which cover as many positive documents as possible, and don't cover any negative documents. Each sphere neighborhood represents a covering area in the vector space and it also corresponds to a hidden neuron in the network. The experimental results show that CWSN demonstrates promising performance compared to other commonly used TC classifiers.", "paper_title": "A constructive learning algorithm for text categorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000038"}
