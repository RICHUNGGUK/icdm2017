The detector preprocesses the edge map by removing all the isolated points and conjunction points, and exploits polygonal curve to extract the elliptical arcs. A non-iterative geometric distance computation method is presented to serve a criterion which identifies the elliptical arcs belonging to the same ellipse by likelihood ratio test and fit ellipses to those merged arcs. The authors test their algorithm on both synthetic and real images, and the experimental results show a good performance of their algorithm.", "paper_title": "Effective ellipse detector with polygonal curve and likelihood ratio test", "paper_id": "WOS:000364485000015"}
