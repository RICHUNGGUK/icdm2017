A principled solution to this problem is to determine the Markov boundary of the class variable. In this paper, we propose a novel constraint-based Markov boundary discovery algorithm called MBOR with the objective of improving accuracy while still remaining scalable to very high dimensional data sets and theoretically correct under the so-called faithfulness condition. We report extensive empirical experiments on synthetic data sets scaling up to tens of thousand variables. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
