The first method makes use of the Radon transform of the measures, and the second is the solution of a convex optimization problem over the space of measures. We show several properties of these barycenters and explain their relationship. We show numerical approximation schemes based on a discrete Radon transform and on the resolution of a non-convex optimization problem. We explore the respective merits and drawbacks of each approach on applications to two image processing problems: color transfer and texture mixing.", "paper_title": "Sliced and Radon Wasserstein Barycenters of Measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000347952100002"}
