The traditional semantics is not robust because the slightest perturbation in the timing of actions may lead to completely different behaviors of the automaton. Following several recent works, we consider a relaxation of this semantics, in which guards on transitions are widened by Delta > 0 and clocks can drift by epsilon > 0. The relaxed semantics encompasses the imprecisions that are inevitably present in an implementation of a timed automaton, due to the finite precision of digital clocks. We solve the safety verification problem for this robust semantics: given a timed automaton and a set of bad states, our algorithm decides if there exist positive values for the parameters Delta and epsilon such that the timed automaton never enters the bad states under the relaxed semantics.", "paper_title": "Robust safety of timed automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000260263300003"}
