The sum Sigma(G) of grpah G is the smallest sum that can be achieved by a proper vertex coloring of G. The chromatic strength s(G) of G is the minimum number of colors that is required by a coloring with sum Sigma(G). For every k, we determine the complexity of the question \"Is s(G) <= k?\": it is coNP-complete for k = 2 and Theta(P)(2)-complete for every fixed k >= 3. We also study the complexity of the edfe coloring version of the problem, with analogous definitions for the edge sum Sigma'(G) and the chromatic edge strength s'(G). We show that for every k >= 3 it is Theta(P)(2)-complete to decide whether s'(G) <= k. As a first step of the proof, we present graphs for every r >= 3 with chromatic index r and edge strength r + 1. For some values of r, such graphs have not been known before.", "paper_title": "The complexity of chromatic strength and chromatic edge strength", "paper_id": "WOS:000235928600002"}
