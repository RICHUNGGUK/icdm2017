Traffic routing plays a critical role in determining the performance of a wireless mesh network. To investigate the best routing solution, existing work proposes to formulate the mesh network routing problem as an optimization problem. In this problem formulation, traffic demand is usually implicitly assumed as static and known a priori. Contradictorily, recent studies of wireless network traces show that the traffic demand, even being aggregated at access points, is highly dynamic and hard to estimate. Thus, in order to apply the optimization-based routing solution into practice, one must take into account the dynamic and unpredictable nature of wireless traffic demand. This paper presents an integrated framework for wireless mesh network routing under dynamic traffic demand. This framework consists of two important components: traffic estimation and routing optimization. By studying the traces collected at wireless access points, we first present a traffic estimation method which predicts future traffic demand based on its historical data using time-series analysis. This method provides not only the mean value of the future traffic demand estimation but also its statistical distribution. We further investigate the optimal routing strategies for wireless mesh network which take these two forms of traffic demand estimations as inputs. The goal is to balance the traffic load so that minimum congestion will be incurred. This routing objective could be transformed into the throughput optimization problem where the throughput of aggregated flows is maximized subject to fairness constraints that are weighted by the traffic demands. Based on linear programming, we present two routing algorithms which consider the mean value and the statistical distribution of the predicted traffic demands, respectively. The trace-driven simulation study demonstrates that our integrated traffic estimation and routing optimization framework can effectively incorporate the traffic dynamics in mesh network routing.", "paper_title": "Optimal routing for wireless mesh networks with dynamic traffic demand", "paper_id": "WOS:000257952700008"}
