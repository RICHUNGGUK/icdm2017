We regard each player as a vertex of a graph and regard each pair of players sharing a key as an edge. Consider the case where Eve knows some of the keys according to a certain probability distribution. In this paper, applying the technique of st-numbering, we propose a protocol which allows any two designated players to agree on a secret key through such a \"partially leaked key exchange graph.\" Our protocol is optimal in the sense that Eve's knowledge about the secret key agreed on by the two players is as small as possible.", "paper_title": "AN APPLICATION OF ST-NUMBERING TO SECRET KEY AGREEMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000293753200013"}
