Two key issues in overcoming this problem are how to represent the target and how to learn its appearance online. In this paper, we adopt a recent appearance model that estimates the pixel intensity histograms as well as the distribution of local standard deviations in both the foreground and background regions for robust target representation. Appearance learning is then cast as an adaptive Kalman filtering problem where the process and measurement noise variances are both unknown. We formulate this problem using both covariance matching and, for the first time in a visual tracking application, the recent autocovariance least-squares (ALS) method. Although convergence of the ALS algorithm is guaranteed only for the case of globally wide sense stationary process and measurement noises, we demonstrate for the first time that the technique can often be applied with great effectiveness under the much weaker assumption of piecewise stationarity. The performance advantages of the ALS method relative to the classical covariance matching are illustrated by means of simulated stationary and nonstationary systems. Against real data, our results show that the ALS-based algorithm outperforms the covariance matching as well as the traditional histogram similarity-based methods, achieving sub-pixel tracking accuracy against the well-known AMCOM closure sequences and the recent SENSIAC automatic target recognition dataset.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Kalman Filtering for Histogram-Based Appearance Learning in Infrared Imagery", "paper_id": "WOS:000310140700011"}
