It integrates features of region-based and edge-based segmentation techniques. This way, the model is able to fit the edges of the objects and model their inner topology. The model consists of a two dimensional mesh controlled by energy functions. The minimization of these energy functions leads to the TAN adjustment. This paper presents a new approach to the energy minimization process based on genetic algorithms (GA), that defines several suitable genetic operators for the optimization task. The results of the new GA approach are compared to the results of a greedy algorithm developed for the same task.", "paper_title": "Topological active nets optimization using genetic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700026"}
