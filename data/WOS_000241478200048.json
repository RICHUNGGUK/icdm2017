Our goal is to maximize the probability that the path length does not exceed a given threshold value (deadline). We give a surprising exact n(Theta(log n)) algorithm for the case of normally distributed edge lengths, which is based on quasi-convex maximization. We then prove average and smoothed polynomial bounds for this algorithm, which also translate to average and smoothed bounds for the parametric shortest path problem, and extend to a more general non-convex optimization setting. We also consider a number other edge length distributions, giving a range of exact and approximation schemes.", "paper_title": "Stochastic shortest paths via quasi-convex maximization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241478200048"}
