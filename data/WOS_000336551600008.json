This paper proposes a solution approach for simultaneous scheduling of campaign and short-term products in multipurpose batch plants. Regular products follow a cyclic schedule and must cover several product deliveries during the scheduling horizon, while non-regular products have a non-cyclic schedule. The proposed approach explores the Resource-Task Network (RTN) discrete-time formulation. Moreover, a rolling horizon approach, and reformulation and branching strategies have been applied to deal with the computational complexity of the scheduling problem. Real case instances of a chemical-pharmaceutical industry are solved, showing the applicability of the solution approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
