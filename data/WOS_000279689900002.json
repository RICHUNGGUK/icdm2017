The model defines the four components of unstructured data including: basic attributes, semantic characteristics, low-level features and raw data on its four facets, and the relations between these components. The internal implementation structure of the model and the data query language are designed and briefly introduced. This model provides a unified, integrated and associated description for different kinds of unstructured data, and supports intelligent data services such as associated retrieval and data mining. An example is given to demonstrate how to use the model for describing and manipulating data from a sample video base.", "paper_title": "A tetrahedral data model for unstructured data management", "paper_id": "WOS:000279689900002"}
