The graph is uniquely k-list colorable if there is a list assignment L such that vertical bar L(nu) vertical bar= k for every vertex nu and the graph has exactly one L-coloring with these lists. Mahdian and Mahmoodian [M. Mahdian, E.S. Mahmoodian, A characterization of uniquely 2-list colorable graphs, Ars Combin.51 (1999) 295-305] gave a polynomial-time characterization of uniquely 2-list colorable graphs. Answering an open question from [M. Ghebleh, E.S. Mahmoodian, On uniquely list colorable graphs, Ars Combin. 59 (2001) 307-318; M. Mahdian, E.S. Mahmoodian, A characterization of uniquely 2-list colorable graphs, Ars Combin. 51 (1999) 295-305], we show that uniquely 3-list colorable graphs are unlikely to have such a nice characterization, since recognizing these graphs is Sigma(p)(2)-complete.
