The scheme provides user anonymity, so it is possible for the user to anonymously login the remote server. Unfortunately, Mangipudi and Katti found that Yang ef al.'s scheme suffers from a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack and then proposed an improvement of Yang et al.'s scheme. However, Hsu and Chuang demonstrated that Mangipudi-Katti's scheme is Vulnerable to an identity disclosure attack, and further proposed a novel user identification scheme with key distribution preserving user anonymity for distributed computer networks. They claimed that their scheme can achieve the following advantages: (1) user anonymity, (2) key distribution, (3) mutual authentication, and (4) key confirm. In this study, the author shows that Hsu-Chuang's scheme is Vulnerable to three impersonation attacks. Then, the improvement of Hsu-Chuang's scheme is proposed.", "paper_title": "WEAKNESSES AND IMPROVEMENT OF HSU-CHUANG'S USER IDENTIFICATION SCHEME", "paper_id": "WOS:000275844300007"}
