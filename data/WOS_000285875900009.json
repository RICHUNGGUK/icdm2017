This study improves the running time of the fastest known algorithm for this problem to date, which executes in O(n (2.25)) time, or very recently, in O(n (2)log (2) n) time, by proposing an O(n (2)log n)-time algorithm.", "paper_title": "An Almost Quadratic Time Algorithm for Sparse Spliced Alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000285875900009"}
