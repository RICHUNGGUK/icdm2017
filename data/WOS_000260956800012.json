The solution is, however, nontrivial because lightweight mechanisms have to be deployed to meet the stringent resource constraints of these networks. It has been suggested that the inherent ability of human body to transfer information is a unique and resource-saving method to secure wireless communications within a BSN. For example, physiological characteristics can be captured by individual sensors of a BSN to generate entity identifiers (EIs) for identifying nodes and even securing keying materials, i.e., by a biometric approach. This studs demonstrates the performance analysis of such a biometric trait, i.e., the interpulse intervals (IPIs) of heartbeats that were calculated from electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram of 99 subjects. Based on the characteristics of IPIs, a lightweight generation scheme of EIs is proposed. Individual randomness and group similarity of the generated EIs are then evaluated. False acceptance rate and false rejection rate are also calculated to measure the effectiveness of the proposed identification system. The results suggest that the readily available IPI information can be a good source for generating EIs among BSN nodes.", "paper_title": "Using the Timing Information of Heartbeats as an Entity Identifier to Secure Body Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000260956800012"}
