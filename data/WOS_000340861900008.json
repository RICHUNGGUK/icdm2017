We here show that a semiempirical MO method corrected for dispersive interactions (PM6-DH2) can predict the adsorption energies of unsaturated hydrocarbons and the effect of substitution on these values to an accuracy comparable to DFT values and in good agreement with the experiment. The adsorption energies of TCNE, TCNQ and a number of sulfonated pyrenes are also predicted, along with the effect of hydration using the COSMO model.", "paper_title": "Accurate Prediction of Adsorption Energies on Graphene, Using a Dispersion-Corrected Semiempirical Method Including Solvation", "paper_id": "WOS:000340861900008"}
