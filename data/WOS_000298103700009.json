We show how the proposed objective can be efficiently optimized using alternating minimization. We prove that the alternating minimization procedure converges to the correct optimum and derive a simple test for convergence. In addition, we show how this approach can be scaled to solve the semi-supervised learning problem on very large data sets, for example, in one instance we use a data set with over 10(8) samples. In this context, we propose a graph node ordering algorithm that is also applicable to other graph-based semi-supervised learning approaches. We compare the proposed approach against other standard semi-supervised learning algorithms on the semi-supervised learning benchmark data sets (Chapelle et al., 2007), and other real-world tasks such as text classification on Reuters and WebKB, speech phone classification on TIMIT and Switchboard, and linguistic dialog-act tagging on Dihana and Switchboard. In each case, the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art. Lastly, we show that our objective can be generalized into a form that includes the standard squared-error loss, and we prove a geometric rate of convergence in that case.", "paper_title": "Semi-Supervised Learning with Measure Propagation", "paper_id": "WOS:000298103700009"}
