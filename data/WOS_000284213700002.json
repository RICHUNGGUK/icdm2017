Trees, in particular, have drawn the attention of researchers as the simplest of non-linear data structures. Many tree mining algorithms have been proposed in the literature and this paper surveys some of the recent work that has been performed in this area. We examine some of the most relevant tree mining algorithms and compare them in order to highlight their similarities and differences.", "paper_title": "Frequent tree pattern mining: A survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000284213700002"}
