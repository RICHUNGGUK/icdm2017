Advertising involvement is regarded as the object for this empirical study which comprehensively collects plenty of antecedents and consequences for advertising involvement. We take advantage of the fuzzy automata to develop an integrated model of advertising involvement. The results indicate that in addition to the selection of implications, a fitting model relies on the selection of compositions in the fuzzy automata. On the average, the standard composition, which is one of compositions in this study, is the most appropriate method for developing a model of advertising involvement.", "paper_title": "Using fuzzy automata to develop an integrated model for personal involvement in advertising", "paper_id": "WOS:000255333500009"}
