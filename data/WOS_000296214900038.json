Therefore, an accurate and appropriate performance evaluation is critical. As financial performance indicators reflect the competitiveness of a company, they must be carefully identified in the evaluation process. Generally, traditional accounting-based financial performance (AFP) measures are used for performance evaluation. However, these measures are not sufficient for performance evaluation solely in the modern industry time. So, value-based financial performance (VFP) measures have recently been introduced to express the company value. In this paper, we propose a new financial performance evaluation approach to rank the companies of each sector in the Turkish manufacturing industry. For this purpose, a hierarchical financial performance evaluation model is structured based on the AFP and VFP main-criteria and their sub-criteria. We use fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to determine the weights of the criteria. The companies are ranked according to their own manufacturing sector by using TOPSIS and VIKOR comparatively. The results show that the obtained ranks of the companies by these methods are almost same with respect to their own sectors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
