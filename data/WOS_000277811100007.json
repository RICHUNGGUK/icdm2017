An opportunistic MAC (OMAC) combines cross-layer design features with opportunistic scheduling scheme to achieve high system utilization while providing QoS support to various applications. A single scheduling algorithm cannot guarantee all the QoS requirements of traffics without the support of a suitable CAC and vice versa. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer MAC scheduling framework and a corresponding opportunistic scheduling algorithm in tandem with the CAC algorithm to support QoS in WiMAX point-to-multipoint (PMP) networks. Extensive experimental simulations have been carried out to evaluate the performance of our proposal. The simulation results show that our proposed solution can improve the performance of WiMAX networks in terms of packet delay, packet loss rate and throughput. The proposed CAC scheme can guarantee the admitted connections to meet their QoS requirements. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
