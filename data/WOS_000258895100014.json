Our results are based on combinatorial proofs that an n-vertex graph has O(1.7087(n)) minimal separators and O(1.8135(n)) potential maximal cliques. We also show that for the class of asteroidal triple-free graphs the running time of our algorithms can be reduced to O(1.4142(n)).", "paper_title": "Exact algorithms for treewidth and minimum fill-in", "paper_id": "WOS:000258895100014"}
