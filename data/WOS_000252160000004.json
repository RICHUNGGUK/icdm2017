The total space is endowed with a natural symplectic structure neurally implemented by long range horizontal connections. The model shows what could be the deep structure for both boundary and figure completion and for morphological structures, such as the medial axis of a shape.", "paper_title": "The symplectic structure of the primary visual cortex", "paper_id": "WOS:000252160000004"}
