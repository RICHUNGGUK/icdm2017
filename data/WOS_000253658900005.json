The signals for feedback periodically switch between the plant state and the state of a model of the plant according to whether the plant state is available from the communication network or not. The model is used to generate control signals when the plant state is not available from the network. A sufficient condition for the robust exponential stability of the closed-loop system is derived in terms of the network dwell time and the system parameters. Examples are also worked out to demonstrate numerical procedures for designing state feedback controller of the system based on the obtained results. Simulations show the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "State feedback control of networked systems with uncertain plant", "paper_id": "WOS:000253658900005"}
