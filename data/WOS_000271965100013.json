Millipede-a MEMS-based scanning-probe data-storage system. IEEE Trans Magn 2003;39(2):938-45]. In this paper, a micro X-Y stage with 6 mm x 6 mm recording media platform actuated by capacitive comb drives is designed and fabricated in a so-called \"Nanodrive\" PBSS. The developed prototype is fabricated by micromachining techniques with the integration of a 40 nm thick PolyMethyl-MethAcrylate (PMMA) recording media. Using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on the developed platform, the first two dominant in-plane resonant modes of the micro X-Y stage at 440 Hz are captured. A displacement range of up to 20 mu m can be achieved at an input driving voltage of 55 V. A Capacitive Self-Sensing Actuation (CSSA) circuit and robust decoupling control scheme are also designed for the micro X-Y stage for improved servo control.
