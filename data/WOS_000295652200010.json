The method presented is numerical and scales exponentially with the number of gates used in the approximation. However, for the specific case of arbitrary single-qubit gates and the fault-tolerant gates permitted by the concatenated 7-qubit Steane code, we find gate sequences sufficiently long and accurate to permit the fault-tolerant factoring of numbers thousands of bits long. A general scaling law of how rapidly these fault-tolerant approximations converge to arbitrary single-qubit gates is also determined.", "paper_title": "CONSTRUCTING ARBITRARY STEANE CODE SINGLE LOGICAL QUBIT FAULT-TOLERANT GATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000295652200010"}
