The method fuses two distinct and popular Monte Carlo simulation methods-Markov chain Monte Carlo and importance sampling-into a single algorithm. We show that for some applied numerical examples the proposed Markov Chain importance sampling algorithm performs better than methods based solely on importance sampling or MCMC.", "paper_title": "Markov chain importance sampling with applications to rare event probability estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000313731700011"}
