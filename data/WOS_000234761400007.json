A connected operator similar to the morphological hat-transform is defined, and two scale-space representations are built, using the curvature function as the underlying one-dimensional signal. Each peak and valley of the curvature is extracted and described by its maximum and average heights and by its extent and represents an entry in the top or bottom hat-transform scale spaces. We demonstrate object recognition based on hat-transform scale spaces for three large data sets, a set of diatom contours, the set of silhouettes from the MPEG-7 database and the set of two-dimensional views of three-dimensional objects from the COIL-20 database. Our approach outperforms other methods for which comparative results exist.", "paper_title": "Shape representation and recognition through morphological curvature scale spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000234761400007"}
