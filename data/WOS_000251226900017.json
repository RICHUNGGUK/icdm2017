A problem of QoS based service composition in MANETs is transformed into a problem of the service path discovery. We extend Dynamic Source Routing protocol to discover and compose elementary services across the network. Some message processing measures are taken to effectively reduce control overhead. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.", "paper_title": "An on-demand QoS service composition protocol for MANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000251226900017"}
