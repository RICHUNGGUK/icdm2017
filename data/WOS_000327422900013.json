More particularly, model selection via the information criteria, such as the BIC with modifications, have received considerable attention in quantitative trait loci mapping. However, such modifications often depend upon several factors, such as sample size, prior distribution, and the type of experiment, for example, backcross, intercross. These changes make it difficult to generalize the methods to all cases. The fence method avoids such limitations with a unified approach, and hence can be used more broadly. In this article, this method is studied in the case of backcross experiments throughout a series of simulation studies. The results are compared with those of the modified BIC method as well as some of the most popular shrinkage methods for model selection.", "paper_title": "Fence methods for backcross experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000327422900013"}
