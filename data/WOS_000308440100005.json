In our model, an overlay network is created by a set of non-cooperative resource providing peers, called platforms, that modify local connectivities to other platforms to maximize their own energy gains. Resource consuming peers, called agents, are simply designed to migrate platform-to-platform to find least expensive resources in the network. Computer simulations are conducted to study network structures that emerge from local interactions among a group of platforms and agents.", "paper_title": "Network Formation Games in Non-cooperative Service Overlay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000308440100005"}
