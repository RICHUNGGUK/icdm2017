However, these studies essentially can be considered as a 1-dimensional approach, because their reasoning paradigm is I-dimensional. This paper will propose a 2-dimensional (21)) approach that represents fuzzy reasoning, CBR, and EBR in a unified way. This approach also integrates many reasoning paradigms such as abduction, deduction and similarity-based reasoning into a unified treatment. The proposed approach will facilitate research and development of fuzzy reasoning, knowledge/ experience management, knowledge-based systems, and CBR.", "paper_title": "A unified 2D representation of fuzzy reasoning, CBR, and experience based reasoning", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000134"}
