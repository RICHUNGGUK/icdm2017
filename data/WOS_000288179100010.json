In this method, the surface-wave poles are first extracted using a recursive contour integration method. Then, the remainder is approximated by a series of complex exponentials using the Prony's method or the generalized pencil-of-function method (GPOF) along the extended rooftop shaped path in k(rho)-plane. Subsequently, an analytical identity is employed to obtain the new spatial-domain Green's functions. It is observed that this method can evaluate the spatial-domain Green's functions accurately and efficiently for both near and far fields. In addition, there is no erroneous results in the near-field region when z not equal z ' and rho -> 0. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
