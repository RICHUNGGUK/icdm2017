The SAX representation is used to describe the financial time series, so that, relevant patterns can be efficiently identified. The evolutionary optimization kernel is here used to identify the most relevant patterns and generate investment rules. The proposed approach was tested using real data from S&P500. The achieved results show that the proposed approach outperforms both B&H and other state-of-the-art solutions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
