Under this mechanism, players can select a source of strategy imitation from their neighbors in a biased way proportional to their ages. Tuned by a selection parameter alpha, the impact of aging on the evolution of cooperation can be very different. The numerical results show that the cooperation will be effectively promoted by adjusting the value of alpha. By examining the evolution process and spatial patterns for different values of alpha, it is found that larger alpha will effectively promote the formation of large scale of cooperator clusters. In addition, the impact of noise K on the spreading process of cooperation strategy is studied. We find that small K can make cooperation monotonously increase with alpha, while large K guarantees the optimal existence of cooperation for an intermediate alpha.", "paper_title": "AGE-RELATED PREFERENTIAL SELECTION CAN PROMOTE COOPERATION IN THE PRISONER'S DILEMMA GAME", "paper_id": "WOS:000303344600005"}
