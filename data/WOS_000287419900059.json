Yet, it is a major challenge for spatial information systems to offer tools for the analysis of motion data, thereby evolving from static to dynamic frameworks. This paper aims to contribute to this area by introducing an implementation prototype for an information system based on the Qualitative Trajectory Calculus, a spatiotemporal calculus to represent and reason about moving point objects.
