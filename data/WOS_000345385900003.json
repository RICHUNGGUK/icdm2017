This generally leads to dramatic performance degradation. To deal with this issue, we developed a relative manifold based semi-supervised dimensionality reduction (RMSSDR) approach by utilizing the relative manifold to construct a better neighborhood graph with fewer short-circuit edges. Based on the relative cognitive law and manifold distance, a relative transformation is used to construct the relative space and the relative manifold. A relative transformation can improve the ability to distinguish between data points and reduce the impact of noise such that it may be more intuitive, and the relative manifold can more truly reflect the manifold structure since data sets commonly exist in a nonlinear structure. Specifically, RMSSDR makes full use of pairwise constraints that can define the edge weights of the neighborhood graph by minimizing the local reconstruction error and can preserve the global and local geometric structures of the data set. The experimental results on face data sets demonstrate that RMSSDR is better than the current state of the art comparing methods in both performance of classification and robustness.", "paper_title": "Relative manifold based semi-supervised dimensionality reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000345385900003"}
