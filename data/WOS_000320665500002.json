We focus on algorithms based on vector quantization and describe a framework for automatic 'alternatization' of such algorithms. Our framework works in both simultaneous and sequential learning formulations and can mine an arbitrary number of alternative clusterings. We demonstrate its applicability to various clustering algorithms-k-means, spectral clustering, constrained clustering, and co-clustering-and effectiveness in mining a variety of datasets.", "paper_title": "How to \"alternatize\" a clustering algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000320665500002"}
