Euclidean fuzzy similarity enables a zero similarity calculation between an unknown odor vector and hidden unit vectors, so that the system can recognize the unknown odor. In addition, an elliptical approach for fuzziness determination is proposed. The elliptical approach can approximate an appropriate fuzziness, so that the unknown odor recognition accuracy is improved. Experiments on three datasets of three-mixture vegetal odors show that the recognition accuracy of the proposed method is 20% better than those of the conventional method. The system is very promising to be used for a real development of dog robot that enables localization and identification of dangerous natural gas.", "paper_title": "Unknown odor recognition using Euclidean Fuzzy similarity-based Self-Organized Network inspired by Immune Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000251098200004"}
