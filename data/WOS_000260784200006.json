There is a direct relationship between slab production and mechanical stone characteristics. In this process, the goal and its tolerance cannot be specified firstly due to a lack of knowledge. Therefore, the optimal system design problem for optimal slab production under soft constraints is constructed and solved in a fuzzy environment. The results show that fuzzy linear optimization is a convenient tool for optimizing slab production.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy optimization of slab production from mechanical stone properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000260784200006"}
