We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the stationary distribution to have a product-form. We also derive simpler sufficient conditions for the product-form for a restricted class of 2-d reflecting random walks. We apply these results and obtain a product-form approximation of the stationary distribution through a suitable modification of the parameters of the random walk.", "paper_title": "Product-form characterization for a two-dimensional reflecting random walk", "paper_id": "WOS:000338649400001"}
