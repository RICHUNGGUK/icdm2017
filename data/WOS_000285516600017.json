To protect against multiple concurrent potential failures and to utilize the available resources more efficiently, strategies such as backup reprovisioning (BR) rearrange backups of protected connections after one failure occurs or, more generally, whenever the network state changes, e.g., when a new request arrives or terminates. Recently, new solutions for automatized management in optical networks promise to allow customers to specify on-demand the terms of the service level agreement (SLA) to be guaranteed by the service provider. In this paper, we study different backup reprovisioning techniques able to further reduce the capacity requirements exploiting the knowledge, among the other service level specifications (SLSs), of the connection holding time.", "paper_title": "Algorithms and Models for Backup Reprovisioning in WDM Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000285516600017"}
