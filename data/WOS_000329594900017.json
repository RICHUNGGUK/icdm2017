Therefore, we design a context-aware multi-virtual architecture for WMNs to deal with the requirements of mesh clients and their applications (context can be defined as a set of requirements such as cost, security, mobility, applications' Quality-of-Service - QoS). In this approach, a WMN is split into several adaptable Virtual Networks (VNs), each one appropriate to specific levels of context. This approach requires the proper configuration of VNs' topologies and resources, and the definition of local and global (distributed) mechanisms to reconfigure VNs that best fit users' requirements. In this paper, we propose an analytical model to evaluate the impact of network virtualization and the complexity of the discovery and extension mechanisms defined for VN reconfiguration. Through a delay-based approach, we show the effectiveness of the architecture to deal with different communication requirements and with distinct scenarios for user connectivity establishment, even in the presence of user mobility or using a real WMN topology. The analytical model is compared against a simulation one, showing similar results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
