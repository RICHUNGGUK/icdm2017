Simul. 80(1) (2010b), pp. 61-73]) for the selection of the optimum number of lags in the estimated model. The asymptotic distribution of the resulting bootstrap ADF/MDIC test is established and its finite sample performance is investigated through Monte-Carlo simulations. The proposed bootstrap tests are found to have finite sample sizes that are generally much closer to their nominal values, than those tests that rely on other information criteria, like the Akaike information criterion [H. Akaike, Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle, in Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium on Information Theory, B.N. Petrov and F. Csaki, eds., Akademiai Kaido, Budapest, 1973, pp. 267-281]. The simulations reveal that the proposed procedure is quite satisfactory even for models with large negative moving average coefficients.", "paper_title": "Bootstrapping the augmented Dickey-Fuller test for unit root using the MDIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000302056900007"}
