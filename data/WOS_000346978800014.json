Concretely, based on the cut set of intuitionistic fuzzy relation, the rough set model over dual-universes in intuitionistic fuzzy approximation space is first presented. Then, some properties of the rough set model are discussed. Two extended models of the rough set model are given, and some principal results are obtained. Finally, by three-way decision theory, two examples are applied to illustrate the application of the rough set model presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "Rough set over dual-universes in intuitionistic fuzzy approximation space and its application", "paper_id": "WOS:000346978800014"}
