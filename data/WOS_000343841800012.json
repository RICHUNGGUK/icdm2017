Due to the different transmission speeds among KNX networks and the IP medium, a control mechanism to prevent the congestion of KNXnet/IP Routers has been foreseen by the KNXnet/IP standard. In this paper, the authors analyse the performance of the KNXnet/IP congestion control mechanism in terms of its impact on the loss of information exchanged between KNX devices located in different KNX networks. The main goal is to point out suitable configurations of the congestion control mechanism capable, more than others, to limit the loss of information. Performance evaluation has been realised through simulation of a Petri Net model based on Stochastic Activity Network (SAN), capable of implementing the main features of the KNXnet/IP specifications.
