In particular, satellite images contain landcover types some of which cover significantly large areas, while some (e.g., bridges and roads) occupy relatively much smaller regions. Automatically detecting regions or clusters of such widely varying sizes presents a challenging task. In this paper, a newly developed real-coded variable string length genetic fuzzy clustering technique with a new point symmetry distance is used for this purpose. The proposed algorithm is capable of automatically determining the number of segments present in an image. Here assignment of pixels to different clusters is done based on the point symmetry based distance rather than the Euclidean distance. The cluster centers are encoded in the chromosomes, and a newly developed fuzzy point symmetry distance based cluster validity index, FSym-index, is used as a measure of the validity of the corresponding partition. This validity index is able to correctly indicate presence of clusters of different sizes and shapes as long as they are internally symmetrical. The space and time complexities of the proposed algorithm are also derived. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is first demonstrated in identifying two small objects from a large background from an artificially generated image and then in identifying different landcover regions in remote sensing imagery. Results are compared with those obtained using the well known fuzzy C-means algorithm both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy symmetry based real-coded genetic clustering technique for automatic pixel classification in remote sensing imagery", "paper_id": "WOS:000259604800011"}
