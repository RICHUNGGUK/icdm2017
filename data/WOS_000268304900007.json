This method obtains source azimuths by one-dimensional search without prior knowledge of source ranges and depths. So, computational complexity of proposed method decreases exponentially compared with that of maximum likelihood (ML) and three-dimensional MUSIC. Results from simulations and lake experiments turn out to be in close agreement with theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "A fast high-resolution method for bearing estimation in shallow ocean", "paper_id": "WOS:000268304900007"}
