The circuit is designed in a 0.18-um CMOS technology and operated on a 1.8-V supply voltage. The VCRO have a tuning range of 730 MHz to 1.43 GHz and good tuning linearity. Between 0 V and 1.1 V of control voltage, the gain of VCRO is around -620 MHz/V. At 900 MHz, the phase noise of the VCRO is -106.1 dBc/Hz at 600-KHz frequency offset with power consumption of 65.5 mW.", "paper_title": "A low-phase-noise 900-MHz CMOS ring oscillator with quadrature output", "paper_id": "WOS:000239755000004"}
