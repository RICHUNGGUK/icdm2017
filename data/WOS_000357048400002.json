However, they lack considerations of the label frequency of the word (i.e., the number of labels containing the word), which is crucial for classification. To address this problem, we investigate the L-LDA model and then propose an extension, namely centroid prior topic model (CTPM). Class-feature-centroid (CFC) suggests a discriminative label-word vector that takes the label frequency of the word into account. CPTM uses this CFC vector as prior for label-word distributions. Extensive experiments on the Yahoo! dataset have been conducted to evaluate our algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that CPTM outperforms the existing multi-label classification algorithms on AUC, Macro-F1 and Micro-F1. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
