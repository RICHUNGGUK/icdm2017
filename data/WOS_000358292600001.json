The demand distribution is known to be multimodal in the sense that there are spatially separated clusters of probability mass but otherwise lacks a complete description. We assume that the newsvendor hedges against distributional ambiguity by minimizing the worst-case risk of the order portfolio over all distributions that are compatible with the given modality information. We demonstrate that the resulting distributionally robust optimization problem is -hard but admits an efficient numerical solution in quadratic decision rules. This approximation is conservative and computationally tractable. Moreover, it achieves a high level of accuracy in numerical tests. We further demonstrate that disregarding ambiguity or multimodality can lead to unstable solutions that perform poorly in stress test experiments.", "paper_title": "Distributionally robust multi-item newsvendor problems with multimodal demand distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000358292600001"}
