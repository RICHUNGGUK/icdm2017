A job's turnaround time consists of two parts: queue waiting time and actual execution time, which in a heterogeneous grid environment, are severely affected by the resource fragmentation and speed heterogeneity factors. Most existing processor allocation methods focus on one of these two factors only. This paper proposes processor allocation methods, which consider both resource fragmentation and speed heterogeneity, to improve system performance of heterogeneous grids. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted to show that the proposed methods can effectively deliver better performance under most resource and workload conditions.", "paper_title": "Improving grid performance through processor allocation considering both speed heterogeneity and resource fragmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000303463200004"}
