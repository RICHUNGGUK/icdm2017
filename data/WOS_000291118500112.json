To find an effective stocking policy for this system, a mathematical model with the objective of minimizing the total annual inventory investment subject to constraints on the average annual order frequency, expected number of backorders, and budget is formulated. The mathematical model of the problem at hand is shown to be nonlinear integer-programming and hence a parameter-tuned genetic algorithm is proposed to solve it efficiently. A numerical example is provided at the end to illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
