The sample mixture brings complication in data analysis and results in biased findings if not correctly accounted for. Estimating tumor purity is of great interest, and a number of methods have been developed using gene expression, copy number variation or point mutation data. Results: We discover that in cancer samples, the distributions of data from Illumina Infinium 450 k methylation microarray are highly correlated with tumor purities. We develop a simple but effective method to estimate purities from the microarray data. Analyses of the Cancer Genome Atlas lung cancer data demonstrate favorable performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Predicting tumor purity from methylation microarray data", "paper_id": "WOS:000365134400001"}
