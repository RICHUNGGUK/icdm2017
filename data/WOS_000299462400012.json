Design/methodology/approach - Mathematical analysis is employed. Findings - The VPP, logically stronger, is more fundamental. Maxwell's tensor derives from it, under further restrictive assumptions, and hence, its range of applicability is limited. In particular, it fails to deal with some aspects of magnetostriction. Originality/value - The paper shows that when magnetic constitutive laws depend, locally, on strain, the body force is not, as a rule, the divergence of the Maxwell tensor. People who intend to compute forces this way should be wary of that.", "paper_title": "Virtual power principle and Maxwell's tensor: which comes first?", "paper_id": "WOS:000299462400012"}
