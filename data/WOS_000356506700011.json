The distributed delays are assumed to be constant and prescribed. Since a positive-definite quadratic functional does not necessarily require all the involved symmetric matrices to be positive definite, it is important for constructing relaxed Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, which generally lead to less conservative stability criteria. Based on this fact and using two kinds of integral inequalities, a new delay-dependent condition is obtained, which ensures that the distributed delay neural network under consideration is globally asymptotically stable. This stability criterion is then improved by applying the delay partitioning technique. Two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the advantage of the presented stability criteria.", "paper_title": "Stability Analysis of Distributed Delay Neural Networks Based on Relaxed Lyapunov-Krasovskii Functionals", "paper_id": "WOS:000356506700011"}
