It is required to analyze spatio-temporal data and trajectories for moving object management. In this paper, we proposed a novel index structure for spatio-temporal aggregation of trajectory in a constrained network, named aCN-RB-tree. It manages aggregation values of trajectories using a constraint network-based index and it also supports direction of trajectory. An aCN-RB-tree consists of an aR-tree in its center and an extended B-tree. In this structure, an aR-tree is similar to a Min/Max R-tree, which stores the child nodes' max aggregation value in the parent node. Also, the proposed index structure is based on a constrained network structure such as a FNR-tree, so that it can decrease the dead space of index nodes. Each leaf node of an aR-tree has an extended B-tree which can store timestamp-based aggregation values. As it considers the direction of trajectory, the extended B-tree has a structure with direction. So this kind of aCN-RB-tree index can support efficient search for trajectory and traffic zone. The aCN-RB-tree can find a moving object trajectory in a given time interval efficiently. It can support traffic management systems and mining systems in ubiquitous environments.", "paper_title": "aCN-RB-tree: Constrained Network-Based Index for Spatio-Temporal Aggregation of Moving Object Trajectory", "paper_id": "WOS:000271597800007"}
