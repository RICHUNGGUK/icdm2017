This analytical capability needs to be enhanced with tools capable of dealing with big data sets without making the analytical process an arduous task. Clustering is usually used in the data analysis process, as this technique does not require any prior knowledge about the data. However, clustering algorithms usually require one or more input parameters that influence the clustering process and the results that can be obtained. This work analyses the relation between the three input parameters of the SNN (Shared Nearest Neighbor) clustering algorithm, providing a comprehensive understanding of the relationships that were identified between k, Eps and MinPts, the algorithm's input parameters. Moreover, this work also proposes specific guidelines for the definition of the appropriate input parameters, optimizing the processing time, as the number of trials needed to achieve appropriate results can be substantial reduced.", "paper_title": "Understanding the SNN Input Parameters and How They Affect the Clustering Results", "paper_id": "WOS:000358073100002"}
