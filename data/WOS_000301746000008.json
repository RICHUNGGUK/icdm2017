Considering the specific characteristics of reactive jammer nodes, a new scheme to deactivate them by efficiently identifying all trigger nodes, whose transmissions invoke the jammer nodes, has been proposed and developed. Such a trigger-identification procedure can work as an application-layer service and benefit many existing reactive-jamming defending schemes. In this paper, on the one hand, we leverage several optimization problems to provide a complete trigger-identification service framework for unreliable wireless sensor networks. On the other hand, we provide an improved algorithm with regard to two sophisticated jamming models, in order to enhance its robustness for various network scenarios. Theoretical analysis and simulation results are included to validate the performance of this framework.", "paper_title": "A Trigger Identification Service for Defending Reactive Jammers in WSN", "paper_id": "WOS:000301746000008"}
