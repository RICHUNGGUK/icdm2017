The proposed model is used to obtain the optimal control law for the input circuit solving the linear-quadratic problem. Design/methodology/approach - A strongly coupled field-circuit model of the stepper motor is presented. Also, the method of the optimal control that minimizes the power loss in the motor windings is proposed. Findings - The proposed optimal control method can be applied to the electrical machines connected to the electronic converters. Calculated control signals may be used to obtain the optimal waveforms of the input voltages at each phase of the analyzed machine. Originality/value - The paper examines the application of the presented control method to minimize the power loss in the stator windings of the four-phased variable reluctance stepper motor.", "paper_title": "Modeling and optimal control of variable reluctance stepper motor", "paper_id": "WOS:000289045400019"}
