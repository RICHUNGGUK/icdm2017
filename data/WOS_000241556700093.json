This integrated method is motivated by the observation of the reciprocity between registration and segmentation in 4D time-series images. Fully automated Fourier-based registration with sub-voxel accuracy and semi-automated time-series segmentation were intertwined to improve the accuracy in a multi-step fashion. We have tested our algorithm on several real patient data sets. Clinical validation showed remarkable and consistent agreement between the proposed method and manual segmentation by experts.", "paper_title": "Integrated four dimensional registration and segmentation of dynamic renal MR images", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700093"}
