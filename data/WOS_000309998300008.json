An index of phase synchronisation of gestures was chosen as coordination metric. The sonifications are implemented as three prototype applications exploiting mobile devices: Sync'n'Moog, Sync'n'Move, and Sync'n'Mood. Sync'n'Moog sonifies the phase synchronisation index by acting directly on the audio signal and applying a nonlinear time-varying filtering technique. Sync'n'Move intervenes on the multi-track music content by making the single instruments emerge and hide. Sync'n'Mood manipulates the affective features of the music performance. The three sonifications were also tested against a condition without sonification.", "paper_title": "Interactive sonification of synchronisation of motoric behaviour in social active listening to music with mobile devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000309998300008"}
