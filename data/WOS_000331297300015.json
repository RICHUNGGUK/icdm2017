A random variable obeying the Bernoulli distribution is introduced to account for the probabilistic infinite distributed delays. The stochastic Rice fading model is employed to simultaneously describe the phenomena of random time delays and channel fadings via setting different values of the channel coefficients. The aim of this paper is to design an H-infinity output-feedback fuzzy controller such that the closed-loop Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy control system is exponentially mean-square stable, and the disturbance rejection attenuation is constrained to a given level by means of the H-infinity performance index. Intensive analysis is carried out to obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of desired output-feedback controllers, ensuring both the exponential mean-square stability and the prescribed H-infinity performance. The cone-complementarity linearization algorithm is utilized to cast the controller design problem into a sequential minimization: one that is solvable by the semi-definite programming method. A simulation result is exploited to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed design technique.", "paper_title": "H-infinity Fuzzy Control With Randomly Occurring Infinite Distributed Delays and Channel Fadings", "paper_id": "WOS:000331297300015"}
