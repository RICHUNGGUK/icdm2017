Designing such an algorithm, that is, as less dissipative as possible while being simple, for the resolution of variable density Navier-Stokes equations is the aim of the present work. The developed numerical scheme, based on a pressure correction technique, uses a Crank-Nicolson time discretization and a staggered space discretization relying on the Rannacher-Turek finite element. For the inertia term in the momentum balance equation, we propose a finite volume discretization, for which we derive a discrete analogue of the continuous kinetic energy local conservation identity. Contrary to what was obtained for the backward Euler discretization, the dissipation defect term associated to the Crank-Nicolson scheme is second order in time. This behavior is evidenced by numerical simulations.
