Outlier detection is a solution to ensure the quality of sensor data. An effective and efficient outlier detection technique for WSNs not only identifies outliers in a distributed and online manner with high detection accuracy and low false alarm, but also satisfies WSN constraints in terms of communication, computational and memory complexity. In this paper, we take into account the correlation between sensor data attributes and propose two distributed and online outlier detection techniques based on a hyperellipsoidal one-class support vector machine (SVM). We also take advantage of the theory of spatio-temporal correlation to identify outliers and update the ellipsoidal SVM-based model representing the changed normal behavior of sensor data for further outlier identification. Simulation results show that our adaptive ellipsoidal SVM-based outlier detection technique achieves better detection accuracy and lower false alarm as compared to existing SVM-based techniques designed for WSNs.
