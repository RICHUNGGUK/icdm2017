The fluid model incorporates two important features previously isolated from system performance models, user settings with multiple groups and inter-group data exchange induced by the choking algorithm. Our numerical results point out some key parameters of performance, such as the staying time of seeders. Generally, selfish behavior does not receive equal performance degradation, and in some scenarios users have strong incentives of free-riding. We also find content delivery can be greatly deterred when malicious free-riders are overwhelming. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
