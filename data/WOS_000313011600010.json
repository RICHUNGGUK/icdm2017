It has been applied successfully in many real-world applications. Fuzzy c-means is one of the most popular fuzzy clustering methods because it produces reasonable results and its implementation is straightforward. One problem with all fuzzy clustering algorithms such as fuzzy c-means is that some data points which are assigned to some clusters have low membership values. It is possible that many samples may be assigned to a cluster with low-confidence. In this paper, an efficient and noise-aware implementation of support vector machines, namely relaxed constraints support vector machines, is used to solve the mentioned problem and improve the performance of fuzzy c-means algorithm. First, fuzzy c-means partitions data into appropriate clusters. Then, the samples with high membership values in each cluster are selected for training a multi-class relaxed constraints support vector machine classifier. Finally, the class labels of the remaining data points are predicted by the latter classifier. The performance of the proposed clustering method is evaluated by quantitative measures such as cluster entropy and Minkowski scores. Experimental results on real-life data sets show the superiority of the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
