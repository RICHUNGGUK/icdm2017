The first stage is to cluster image blocks in a joint contrast-energy feature space into three constituent groups. To achieve this, we make use of a normal mixture-based model along with standard expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm at two consecutive levels of block size. To avoid the common problem of local optima experienced in many models, an ensemble EM clustering algorithm is proposed. As a result, relevant blocks closely conforming to image objects are extracted. In stage two, a binary saliency map is constructed from the relevant blocks at the pixel level, which is based on difference of Gaussian (DOG) and binarization methods. Then, a set of morphological operations is employed to create the region-of-interest (ROI) from the map. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves an F-measure of 91.3% and is computationally 3 times faster than the existing state-of-the-art approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
