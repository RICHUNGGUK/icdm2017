CamShift is incorporated into the probabilistic framework of particle filter as an optimization scheme for proposal distribution. Meanwhile, in the context of particle filter, the scale adaptation of CamShift is improved and the computation complexity is reduced. It is demonstrated through several real tracking tasks that the new method performs better than baseline trackers in both tracking robustness and computational efficiency. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
