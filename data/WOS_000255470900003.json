We use our distributed collaborative fillering (CF) algorithm based on a P2P overlay network, of autonomous agents. Experiments show that OUT proposed scheme is more scalable than traditional centralized CF filtering systems and alleviates the sparsity problem in distributed CF.", "paper_title": "Collaborative web agent based on friend network", "paper_id": "WOS:000255470900003"}
