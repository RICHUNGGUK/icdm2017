The so-called birandorn variable is a measurable mapping from a probability space to a collection of random variables. Based on this definition, the expected value operator of birandom variable and chance measures of birandom event are further introduced. As a generalized scenario of stochastic programming, a spectrum of birandont programming models are developed to deal with birandom systems. To solve the proposed models, birandom simulations are presented and then a hybrid intelligent algorithm is designed by embedding neural networks into genetic algorithm. Finally, some numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
