We extend to this setting classical algorithms for Fuchsian groups with parabolic transformations, such as the flip flop algorithm known for the modular group SL(2, Z) and whose roots go back to [9]. The research has been partially motivated by the need to design more efficient codes for wireless transmission data and for the study of Maass waveforms under a computational point of view.", "paper_title": "A REDUCTION POINT ALGORITHM FOR COCOMPACT FUCHSIAN GROUPS AND APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000336142900008"}
