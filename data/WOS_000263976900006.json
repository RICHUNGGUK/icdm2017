Current DBC solutions for OLAP query processing provide for intra-query parallelism only, at the cost of full replication of the database. In this paper, we propose more efficient distributed database design alternatives which combine physical/virtual partitioning with partial replication. We also propose a new load balancing strategy that takes advantage of an adaptive virtual partitioning to redistribute the load to the replicas. Our experimental validation is based on the implementation of our solution on the SmaQSS DBC middleware prototype. Our experimental results using the TPC-H benchmark and a 32-node cluster show very good speedup.", "paper_title": "Parallel OLAP query processing in database clusters with data replication", "paper_id": "WOS:000263976900006"}
