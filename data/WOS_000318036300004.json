Decoupled motion control, which allows one user to manipulate a haptic interface to control only one-dimensional movement of an avatar, is presented as a new type haptic-based cooperation among multiple users. Users respectively move an avatar along one coordinate axis so that the motion of the avatar is the synthesis of movements along all axes. It is different from previous haptic cooperation where all users can apply forces on an avatar along any direction to move it, the motion of which completely depends on the resultant force. A novel concept of movement feedback is put forward where one user can sense other users' hand motions through his or her own haptic interface. The concept can also be explained wherein one person who is required to move a virtual object along only one axis can also feel the motions of the virtual object along other axes. Movement feedback, which is a feeling of motion, differs from force feedback, such as gravity, collision force and resistance. A spring-damper force model is proposed for the computation of motion feedback to implement movement transmission among users through haptic devices. Experimental results validate that movement feedback is beneficial for performance enhancement of such kind of haptic-based cooperation, and the effect of movement feedback in performance improvement is also evaluated by all subjects.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Networked multiplayer cooperative interaction using decoupled motion control method in a shared virtual environment with haptic, visual and movementfeedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000318036300004"}
