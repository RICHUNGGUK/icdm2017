The associated estimation problem can typically be reduced to solving a set of fixed-point equations in the form of a \"natural-parameter homotopy.\" This paper applies a homotopy method to track a continuous path of solutions, starting from a local supervised solution (lambda = 0) to a local unsupervised solution (lambda = 1). The homotopy method is guaranteed to track with probability one from lambda = 0 to lambda = 1 if the lambda = 0 solution is unique; this condition is not satisfied for the HMM since the maximum likelihood supervised solution (lambda = 0) is characterized by many local optima. A modified form of the homotopy map for HMMs assures a track from lambda = 0 to lambda = 1. Following this track leads to a formulation for selecting lambda is an element of [0, 1) for a semisupervised solution and it also provides a tool for selection from among multiple local-optimal supervised solutions. The results of applying the proposed method to measured and synthetic sequential data verify its robustness and feasibility compared to the conventional EM approach for semisupervised HMM training.", "paper_title": "Semisupervised Learning of Hidden Markov Models via a Homotopy Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000261846800006"}
