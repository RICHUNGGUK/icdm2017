The problems of paper triage tags, which are widely used at disaster scenes, include an inability to show the current priorities of casualties and a failure to collect the physiological conditions of the casualties. To save lives, this paper proposes an electronic triage system that consists of two types of electronic triage tags and an electronic triage server. The electronic triage tag continuously monitors the vital signs of casualties and transmits them to the electronic triage server, and the electronic triage system shows the current priorities of the casualties. Experimental results show that our proposed electronic triage system can save more lives than paper triage tags.", "paper_title": "Electronic triage system for continuously monitoring casualties at disaster scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000209332300003"}
