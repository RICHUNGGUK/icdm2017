The system is based on phase locking a high frequency signal transmitted from the medical instrument's tip to a reference signal. Displacement measurement is established having the loop open, in order to get a low frequency voltage representing the medical instrument's movement; therefore, positioning is established by means of conventional measuring techniques. The voltage-controlled oscillator stage of the phase-locked loop (PLL), combined to an appropriate antenna, comprises the associated transmitter located inside the medical instrument tip. All the other low frequency PLL components, low noise amplifier and mixer, are located outside the human body, forming the receiver part of the system. The operating details of the proposed system were coded in Verilog-AMS. Simulation results indicate robust medical instrument tracking in 1-D. Experimental evaluation of the proposed position tracking system is also presented. The experiments described in this paper are based on a transmitter moving opposite a stationary receiver performing either constant velocity or uniformly accelerated movement, and also together with two stationary receivers performing constant velocity movement again. This latter setup is implemented in order to demonstrate the prototype's accuracy for planar (2-D) motion measurements. Error analysis and time-domain analysis are presented for system performance characterization. Furthermore, preliminary experimental assessment using a saline solution container to more closely approximate the human body as a radio frequency wave transmission medium has proved the system's capability of operating underneath the skin.", "paper_title": "Experimental Evaluation of an Invasive Medical Instrument Based on a Displacement Measurement System", "paper_id": "WOS:000360791200020"}
