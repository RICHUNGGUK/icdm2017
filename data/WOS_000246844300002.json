The developed system consists of a CAD (computer aided design) system enhanced with intuitive designer-oriented interaction tools and modalities. The system requirements have been defined on the basis of the observation of designers during their daily work, and translating the way they model shapes using hands and craft tools into specifications for the modelling system based on haptic tools.", "paper_title": "Touch and design: novel haptic interfaces for the generation of high quality surfaces for industrial design", "paper_id": "WOS:000246844300002"}
