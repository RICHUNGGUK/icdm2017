However, humans may perceive a video as near duplicate from a semantic perspective as well. In this paper, we propose concept-based near-duplicate video clip (CBNDVC) detection technique for novelty re-ranking. We identify \"semantic NDVC\", making use of the semantic features (events/concepts) and re-rank the top results to increase the content as well as semantic novelty. Videos are represented as a multivariate time series of confidence values of relevant concepts and thereafter discovery of CBNDVC clusters is achieved by conceptual clustering. Obtained results show higher precision and recall from the user's perspective.", "paper_title": "Concept-based near-duplicate video clip detection for novelty re-ranking of web video search results", "paper_id": "WOS:000305557500004"}
