These include engineering-level simulations for predicting the performance and engagement-level simulations for examining the effectiveness of certain tactics. For this reason, a tactics manager that can change the behavior of a simulation model according to tactics defined outside the model is needed. This paper describes a tactics manager that supports a scripting language that can represent various tactics and can help users to easily define external input tactics. Python and Lua, representative scripting languages, are compared and analyzed from the viewpoint of a tactics manager, and a tactics manager using those script languages is implemented. A target motion analysis simulation of the engagement between a submarine and a surface ship is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the tactics manager. We generated a simulation model based on the Discrete Event System Specification formalism and provided it with an interface to the tactics manager. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
