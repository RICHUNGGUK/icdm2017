Non-reactive collisions are modeled by multiparticle collision dynamics that conserves mass, momentum and energy. Reactive collisions are described by birth-death stochastic processes. The dynamics is governed by a Markov chain in the full phase space of the system, which reduces to mass action rate laws in the mean field limit. Simulations on the Selkov model are carried out to illustrate the simulation method. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
