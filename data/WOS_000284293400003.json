By incorporating a surfactant in the phosphor mixture, a uniform coating could be achieved by drop-casting. The resulting hybrid device exhibited white light emission, with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage, CIE (x, y) coordinates of x = 0.32, y = 0.35. No significant change in these coordinates was observed for current densities in the range 25-510 A m(-2). The maximum power efficiencies of the white device was 2.3 lm W-1 at a brightness of 254 cd m(-2). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
