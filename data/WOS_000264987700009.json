We show that the differences between the notions are due to conditioning on sets of (lower, and in some cases upper) probability zero. Next, we characterise the range of coherent extensions in the finite case, proving that the greatest coherent extensions can always be calculated using the notion of regular extension, and we discuss the extensions of our results to infinite spaces.
