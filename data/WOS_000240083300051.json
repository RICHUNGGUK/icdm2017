This assistance services system is divided into three layers: the bottom is a description layer, which describes agent services and domain ontology by self-defined Ontology Based Knowledge Representation Language (OKRL); the middle is a support layer, which provides management mechanism to organize middle agent nodes and information repository of assistant services for upper layer; the top is assistant services layer, which provides services for registration, advisement and matchmaking of agent services. The growth mechanism and joint matchmaking process of middle agents, which realizes self-organising characteristic for agent assistant system, are also discussed in this paper. Finally, this paper gives evaluation and conclusion.", "paper_title": "A self-organising agent assistant system", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300051"}
