True 3D interaction with haptic feedback is used to facilitate initialization, i.e., seeding of a fast marching algorithm. Four users initialized 52 datasets and the mean interaction time was 40 seconds. The segmentation accuracy was verified by a radiologist. Volume measurements and segmentation precision show that the method has a high reproducibility.", "paper_title": "Fast and robust semi-automatic liver segmentation with haptic interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700095"}
