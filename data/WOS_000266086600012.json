Unlike other existing models, our system is fast adaptable to different application domains and it is highly interpretable. This will provide specialists with a tool to easily test their hypotheses about the most suitable emotional attitude for an agent in a specific domain. it also provides emotional stability and dynamic and automatic behavior orientation, which will result in the design of more believable conversational agents that behave as humans do.
