Selection of the most similar mother wavelet function has been a challenge for the application of wavelet transform in signal processing. This paper introduces Daubechies 44 (db44) as the most similar mother wavelet function across a variety of biological signals. Three-hundred and twenty four potential mother wavelet functions were selected and investigated in the search for the most similar function. The algorithms were validated by three categories of biological signals: forearm electromyographic (EMG), electroencephalographic (EEG), and vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA). Surface and intramuscular EMG signals were collected from multiple locations on the upper forearm of subjects during ten hand motions. EEG was recorded from three monopolar Ag-AgCl electrodes (Pz, POz, and Oz) during visual stimulus presentation. VPA, a useful source for female sexuality research, were recorded during a study of alcohol and stimuli on sexual behaviors. In this research, after extensive studies on mother wavelet functions, results show that db44 has the most similarity across these classes of biosignals.
