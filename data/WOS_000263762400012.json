The conditional edge- fault Hamiltonicity of a Hamiltonian graph G is the largest k such that after removing k faulty edges from G, provided that each node is incident to at least two fault-free edges, the resulting graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle. In this paper, we sketch common properties of a class of networks, called Matching Composition Networks (MCNs), such that the conditional edge- fault Hamiltonicity of MCNs can be determined from the obtained properties. We then apply our technical theorems to determine conditional edge- fault Hamiltonicities of several multiprocessor systems, including n-dimensional crossed cubes, n-dimensional twisted cubes, n-dimensional locally twisted cubes, n-dimensional generalized twisted cubes, and n-dimensional hyper Petersen networks. Moreover, we also demonstrate that our technical theorems can be applied to network construction.", "paper_title": "Conditional Edge-Fault Hamiltonicity of Matching Composition Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000263762400012"}
