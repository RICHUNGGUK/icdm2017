Reuse of requirements improves the productivity and quality of software process and products. This can be facilitated by Semantic Web technologies. We describe till ontology-based framework for representing and reusing security requirements based oil risk analysis. A risk analysis ontology and a requirement ontology have been developed and combined to represent reusable security requirements formally and to improve security in IS by detecting incompleteness and inconsistency and achieving semantic processing in requirements analysis. This extensible framework is the basis oil which to elaborate a \"lightweight\" method to elicit and specify security requirements, based oil security standards.", "paper_title": "Modelling Reusable Security Requirements based on an Ontology Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000267833400004"}
