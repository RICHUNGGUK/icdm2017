This paper explores energy efficiency for systems equipped with PCI-Express devices, which are designed for low power consumption and high performance, compared to corresponding PCI devices. We propose dynamic power management mechanism and a management policy for energy-efficient considerations. A case study for a variable-bit-rate local-area network device under the PCI-Express specification is exploited to provide supports for dynamic packet transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism and policy would reduce the system energy consumption substantially.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Considerations on a Variable-Bitrate PCI-Express Device", "paper_id": "WOS:000275890400006"}
