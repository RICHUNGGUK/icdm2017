The meta level provides basic integration operators to the domain engineer to create integration options for specific domains. Based on semantic relationships between nodes of two business processes these integration options are executed and transform parts of the business processes. The outcome of the model transformation is an integrated business process. Because of the arbitrary combination of basic integration operators, a potentially infinite set of integration options may be applicable, and some of these may lead to an incorrect business process. We analyse our framework according to a set of consistency criteria and propose verification and validation mechanisms to keep the integrated model consistent.", "paper_title": "Verification of business process integration options", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137100035"}
