We build up on existing estimates and refine them. We show that the attack complexity is slightly lower than estimated in all published work to date. We point out that it is more accurate to consider probabilities instead of conditions.", "paper_title": "The impact of carries on the complexity of collision attacks on SHA-1", "paper_id": "WOS:000239471600018"}
