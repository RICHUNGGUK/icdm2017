Existed approaches rarely consider the issue of luminance consistency. In this paper, an image composition method with salience preservation is proposed, which focuses on how to achieve the luminance consistency. Our method includes salience determination, whitepoint correction and luminance adjustment. Salience depends not only on luminance, but also on chrominance, an approach fully exploiting the difference of luminance and chrominance is suggested. A whitepoint correction schema by aligning the principle color axes is presented. Meanwhile, the luminance consistency composition is formulated as a nonlinear optimization with respect to the salience constraint, hence the composition could achieve the consistent luminance and preserve the appropriate salience.", "paper_title": "Salience-preserving image composition with luminance consistency", "paper_id": "WOS:000240262900033"}
