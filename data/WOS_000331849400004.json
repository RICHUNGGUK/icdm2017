More exactly, to propose and test an integrative theoretical model that allows to determine the relative influence of the determining factors (external influences, ease of use, attitude, usefulness, trust and risk) for the acceptance of a new m-payment system and to analyze the eventual moderating effect of the gender of the consumer in the use of these tools. Design/methodology/approach - To carry out this research, a web experiment based on a general population sample was put in place, in order to analyze the proposed behavioral model towards a new m-payment system. Findings - The empirical results show that the proposed behavioral model was appropriately adjusted, thus proving that the gender of the user introduces significant differences in the proposed relationships between ease of use and usefulness of the new system, between usefulness, attitude and intention to use, as well as between users' trust and a favorable attitude towards its use. Practical implications - The conclusions and implications for management provide alternatives and segmentation strategies to consolidate this new business opportunity under the new technological developments. Originality/value - This paper is a pioneer study about the acceptance of m-payment, analyzing at the same time the importance of the moderation effect of users' gender.", "paper_title": "Role of gender on acceptance of mobile payment", "paper_id": "WOS:000331849400004"}
