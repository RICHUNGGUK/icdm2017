This model is superior to CA because of its ability to learn and is also superior to single LA because it is a collection of LAs which can interact with each other. The basic idea of CLA is to use LA to adjust the state transition probability of stochastic CA. Recently, various types of CLA such as synchronous, asynchronous, and open CLAs have been introduced. In some applications such as cellular networks, we need to have a model of CLA for which multiple LAs reside in each cell. In this paper, we study a CLA model for which each cell has several LAs. It is shown that, for a class of rules called commutative rules, the CLA model converges to a stable and compatible configuration. Two applications of this new model such as channel assignment in cellular mobile networks and function optimization are also given. For both applications, it has been shown through computer simulations that CLA-based solutions produce better results.", "paper_title": "Cellular Learning Automata With Multiple Learning Automata in Each Cell and Its Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000271440600006"}
