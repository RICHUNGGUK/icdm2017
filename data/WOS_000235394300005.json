An algebraic relationship between the Markov basis for a table with structural zeros and the corresponding complete table is proved. In order to find the relevant Markov basis, it is enough to eliminate the indeterminates associated with the structural zeros from the toric ideal for the complete table. Moreover, we use this result for the computation of Markov bases for some classical log-linear models, such as quasi-independence and quasi-symmetry, and computations in the multi-way setting are presented.
