This paper firstly designs a distributed computing architecture and builds a computing environment based on Grid technologies. Then a distributed computing service for neural networks based on a genetic algorithm and a modified BP algorithm is designed and developed to rapidly and accurately building a fittest neural network for flood peak forecasting. Finally, a distributed computing prototype system is developed and implemented on a case study of the flood prevention in Shenzhen city, China. The experiment result shows that the scheme addressed in the paper is efficient and feasible.", "paper_title": "Distributed computing service for neural networks and its application to flood peak forecasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100098"}
