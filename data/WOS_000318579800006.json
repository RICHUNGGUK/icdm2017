A real-time routing protocol for MWSN is an exciting area of research because messages in the network are delivered according to their end-to-end deadlines (packet lifetime) while sensor nodes are mobile. This paper proposes an enhanced real-time with load distribution (ERTLD) routing protocol for MWSN which is based on our previous routing protocol RTLD. ERTLD utilized corona mechanism and optimal forwarding metrics to forward the data packet in MWSN. It computes the optimal forwarding node based on RSSI, remaining battery level of sensor nodes and packet delay over one-hop. ERTLD ensures high packet delivery ratio and experiences minimum end-to-end delay in WSN and MWSN compared to baseline routing protocol. In this paper we consider a highly dynamic wireless sensor network system in which the sensor nodes and the base station (sink) are mobile. ERTLD has been successfully studied and verified through simulation experiment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
