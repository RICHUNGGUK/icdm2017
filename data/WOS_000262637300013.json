We explore the use of non-parametric models for partially ranked data and derive computationally efficient procedures for their use for large n. The derivations are largely possible through combinatorial and algebraic manipulations based on the lattice of partial rankings. A bias-variance analysis and an experimental study demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Non-Parametric Modeling of Partially Ranked Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000262637300013"}
