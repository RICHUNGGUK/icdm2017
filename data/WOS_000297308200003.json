The growing foreign presence in Shanghai was found to be related to two different policy regimes: Pudong development area foreign enterprise clustering period after China opened Pudong, and \"deposit-loan-match principle\" implementing period after China joined WTO. The current location pattern was found to be correlated to deposit potential in each district. It is evident that the foreign bank location decisions were influenced by those of domestic banks while the reverse did not hold. These findings provide a valuable platform for theoretical modeling and further analysis.", "paper_title": "LOCATION DYNAMICS OF FOREIGN BANKING IN SHANGHAI FROM 1990 TO 2009", "paper_id": "WOS:000297308200003"}
