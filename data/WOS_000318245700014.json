Rods are thin objects such as ropes and hairs that can be abstracted as one-dimensional structures. Development of a real-time physical model that can produce visually convincing animation of thin rods has been a challenging problem in computer graphics. We adopt continuum mechanics to formulate the governing equation, and develop a modal warping technique for rods to integrate the governing equation in real-time; This is a novel extension of the previous modal warping techniques developed for solids and shells. Experimental results show that the proposed method runs in real-time even for large meshes and it can simulate large bending and/or twisting deformations.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Simulation of Thin Rod", "paper_id": "WOS:000318245700014"}
