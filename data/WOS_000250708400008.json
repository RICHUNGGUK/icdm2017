The main challenge arises from the fact that the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) of a L3-VPN usually only specify the maximum ingress and egress traffic rate, and provide no point-to-point traffic matrix information (i.e., a hose-model VPN). Conventional restoration and traffic engineering techniques do not apply to this type of traffic model. In this paper, we present a restoration network architecture and present two algorithms for solving the routing problem of this type of restoration networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed restoration architecture by comparing the throughput performance with other approaches. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
