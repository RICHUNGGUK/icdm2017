The project was launched in 2005 and the package is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network since February 2006. The current version of the package contains functions for use in the fields of loss distributions modeling, risk theory ( including ruin theory), simulation of compound hierarchical models and credibility theory. This paper presents in detail but with few technical terms the most recent version of the package.", "paper_title": "actuar: An R package for actuarial science", "paper_id": "WOS:000254620000001"}
