However, such networks present designers with a large number of design parameters and decisions, many of which are critical to the efficient operation of over-all on-chip system To aid the design process of complex systems-on-chip, this paper presents a NoC simulation environment that has been developed and implemented using the SystemC transaction-level modeling language. The simulation environment consists of on-chip components as well as traffic generators, which can generate various types of traffic patterns The simulation environment has also been integrated with the NoC topology generation tool being developed in our group A set of simulation results demonstrates the types of parameters that can affect the performance of on-chip systems, including topology variations, network latency and achievable throughput These results also verify the modeling capabilities of the proposed simulation environment.
