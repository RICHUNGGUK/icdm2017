In this paper, a notion of morphological covering rough set is introduced by means of combining rough set with fundamental morphological operators. The focus of this paper is on constructing a covering and a pair of morphological rough approximation operators. The issue on reduction of a morphological covering is explored and the procedure for generating the reduction is presented. Necessary and sufficient conditions on characterization of the reduction are proved.", "paper_title": "Reduction of morphological covering rough sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000030"}
