These applications require adaptive statistical techniques in order to detect and isolate process abnormalities. A novel approach is introduced for monitoring schemes in the setting of image data when the quality is associated with uniform pixel gray-scales. The proposed approach requires the definition of a statistic which takes into account both the spatial dependency and the changes in local variability. An application on paper surface demonstrates how the monitoring scheme performs in practical applications. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
