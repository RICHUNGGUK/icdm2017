The half-region depth provides a simple and natural criterion to measure the centrality of a function within a sample of curves. It has computational advantages relative to other concepts of depth previously proposed in the literature which makes it applicable to the analysis of high-dimensional data. Based on this depth a sample of curves can be ordered from the center-outward and order statistics can be defined. The properties of the half-region depth, such as consistency and uniform convergence, are established. A simulation study shows the robustness of this new definition of depth when the curves are contaminated. Finally, real data examples are analyzed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
