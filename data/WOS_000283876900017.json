By using block pulse functions and their operational matrix of integration, a first kind integral equations system can be reduced to a linear system of algebraic equations. The coefficient matrix of this system is a block matrix with lower triangular blocks. Numerical examples show that the approximate solutions have a good degree of accuracy.", "paper_title": "Numerical solution of an integral equations system of the first kind by using an operational matrix with block pulse functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000283876900017"}
