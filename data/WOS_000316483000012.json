The most common approach to this end is based on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. The new service providers are manifesting great interest not only for classical multimedia applications, like video streaming and video on demand, but also for multi-party games, private video-chat rooms, videoconference and real-time video teaching, usually containing a small number of high-interactive group members. The target of this paper is to define a multipoint multimedia communication platform for such kind of applications, accounting both peer set variation (peer arrivals and departures) and peer bandwidth modifications. In addition, a revenue model for providers of this kind of services is proposed to allow them to design their networks in order to maximize their revenue while satisfying user requirements in terms of both admission rejection probability and perceived quality on the received video stream.", "paper_title": "A comprehensive platform to manage peer churn and bandwidth fluctuations in real-time multimedia P2P networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000316483000012"}
