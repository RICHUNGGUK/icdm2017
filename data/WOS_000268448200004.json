This method first represents a given signal in the time-scale domain through CWT and then maps the resulted wavelet coefficients into the polar diagram using the given potential periods. Transient features would thus be synchronously enhanced at a certain area if the mapping time period matches that of the transient vibrations. The simulation study and the applications in the gearbox and bearing fault diagnosis verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting the periodical transient vibrations.", "paper_title": "SYNCHRONOUS ENHANCEMENT OF PERIODIC TRANSIENTS ON POLAR DIAGRAM FOR MACHINE FAULT DIAGNOSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000268448200004"}
