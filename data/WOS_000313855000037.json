The proposed framework considers the presence of three kinds of states in a generic system model: states that can easily be measured in real time and in-situ, states that are difficult to measure online but can be measured offline to generate training data, and states that cannot be measured at all. The motivation for such a categorization of state variables comes from a wide class of problems in the manufacturing and chemical industries, wherein certain states are not measurable without expensive equipments or offline analysis while some other states may not be accessible at all. The framework makes use of a recurrent neural network for modeling the hidden dynamics of the system from available measurements and uses this model along with a non-linear observer to augment the information provided by the measured variables. The performance of the proposed method is verified on a synthetic problem as well as a benchmark simulation problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
