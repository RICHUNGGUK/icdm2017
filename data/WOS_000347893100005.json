To decrease the development time, a driver interface in ROS was created so as to provide hardware abstraction and intuitive operation mode, thus allowing researchers to focus essentially in their main research motivation, e.g., search and rescue, multi-robot surveillance or swarm robotics. Moreover, the full integration in ROS provided by the driver enables the use of several tools for data analysis, easiness of interaction between multiple robots, use of different sensors and teleoperation devices, thereby targeting engineering education. To validate the approach, diverse experimental tests were conducted using different Arduino-based robotic platforms.", "paper_title": "Integrating Arduino-Based Educational Mobile Robots in ROS", "paper_id": "WOS:000347893100005"}
