This technique is both self-contained and fully-automatic in the sense that it does not rely on separate analyzes or human involvement. We show how to integrate lookahead widening into existing analyzers with minimal effort. Experimental results indicate that the technique is able to achieve sizable precision improvements at reasonable costs.", "paper_title": "Lookahead widening", "paper_id": "WOS:000240257000039"}
