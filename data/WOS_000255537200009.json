In this paper, we propose a random fuzzy multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming model for the SCN design problem of Luzhou Co., Ltd. which is representative in the industry of Chinese liquor. By the expected value operator and chance constraint operator, the model has been transformed into a deterministic multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming model. Then, we use spanning tree-based genetic algorithms (st-GA) by the Prufer number representation to find the SCN to satisfy the demand imposed by customers with minimum total cost and maximum customer services for multiobjective SCN design problem of this company under condition of random fuzzy customers demand and transportation cost between facilities. Furthermore, the efficacy and the efficiency of this method are demonstrated by the comparison between its numerical experiment results and those of tradition matrix-based genetic algorithm.
