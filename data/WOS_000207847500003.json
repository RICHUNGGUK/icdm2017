However, when students return to their original group to share with teammates what they have learned in their expert groups, they may need to review the records of the previous discussion in order to integrate and share the key ideas arising from that discussion. Paper-and-pencil records often do not meet students' needs for sharing and discussion, thereby affecting the efficacy and efficiency of the learning and knowledge-building (KB) processes. Group Scribbles (GS) is an activity tool that enables the collaborative generation, collection, and aggregation of ideas through a shared space. The aim of this study is to deploy GS with Tablet PCs to facilitate 12 graduate school students doing cooperative learning by the jigsaw method and to examine how GS supports KB deeper understanding through interactive questioning, dialogue, and continuous improvement of ideas. Results of this exploratory study suggest that a GS-mediated cooperative learning jigsaw model could positively benefit students in their interaction and KB processes.", "paper_title": "Group Scribbles to Support Knowledge Building in Jigsaw Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000207847500003"}
