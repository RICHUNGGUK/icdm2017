With a computer search we are able to prove that for any related-key differential characteristic on full-round PRESENT - 80, the probability of the characteristic only in the 64-bit state is not higher than 2(-64). To overcome the exponential (in the state and key sizes) computational complexity of the search we use truncated differences, however as the key schedule is not nibble oriented, we switch to actual differences and apply early abort techniques to prune the tree-based search. With a new method called extended split approach we are able to make the whole search feasible and we implement and run it in real time. Our approach targets the PRESENT - 80 cipher however, with small modifications can be reused for other lightweight ciphers as well.", "paper_title": "The resistance of PRESENT-80 against related-key differential attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000343877700001"}
