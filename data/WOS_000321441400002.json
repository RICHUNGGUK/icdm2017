The model is based on an implicit temperature ordering and the \"transshipment model\" proposed by Papoulias and Grossmann (1983). It is supplemented with a set of logical relationships related to the relative position of the inlet temperatures of process streams and the dynamic temperature intervals. In the extreme situation of fixed inlet and outlet temperatures, the model reduces to the \"transshipment model\". Several examples with fixed and variable temperatures are presented to illustrate the model's performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
