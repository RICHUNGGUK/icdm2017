The Taylor series least-square method is used for approximation of spatial derivatives at each node which leads to a central difference discretization. Several convergence acceleration techniques such as local time stepping, enthalpy damping and residual smoothing are adopted in this approach. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated by flow computations around single and multi-element airfoils at subsonic, transonic and supersonic flow conditions. Results are presented which indicate good agreements with other reliable finite-volume results. The computational time is considerably reduced when using the proposed mesh-less method compared with the explicit mesh-less and finite-volume schemes using the same point distributions.
