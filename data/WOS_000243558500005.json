In the proposed adaptive QoS controller, resource utilization is assigned to each task through an online search for the fair QoS level based on the errors between the current QoS levels and their average. The proposed controller eliminates the need for precise detection of the consumption functions as in conventional feedback control methods. The computational complexity of the proposed method is also very low compared to straightforward methods solving a nonlinear problem.", "paper_title": "Adaptive resource allocation control for fair QoS management", "paper_id": "WOS:000243558500005"}
