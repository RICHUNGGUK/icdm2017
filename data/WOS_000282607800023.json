Based on the chaotic system theory, this paper proposes new PSO method that uses chaotic mappings for parameter adaptation of Wavelet v-support vector machine (Wv-SVM). Since chaotic mapping enjoys certainty, ergodicity and the stochastic property, the proposed PSO introduces chaos mapping using logistic mapping sequences which increases its convergence rate and resulting precision. The simulation results show the parameter selection of Wv-SVM model can be solved with high search efficiency and solution accuracy under the proposed PSO method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
