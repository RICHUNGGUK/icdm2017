The results show that the computational complexity of the SPDS algorithm in every searching process is only relative to the amount of samples and the neurons of the output layer, so the SPDS algorithm can effectively reduce the computational complexity. We select three kinds of samples to make comparative study for different training algorithms. These samples include the N-hypercube vertexes samples, the Archimedes spirals samples and the binary nonlinear continuous mapping samples. We use different algorithms to train these samples, and these algorithms include the proposed SPDS algorithm, and Traingdx, Traincgf and Truinlm which are provided by Matlab. Results of numerical experiments show that the convergence rate and the stability of the SPDS algorithm am satisfactory.", "paper_title": "A SINGLE PARAMETER DYNAMIC SEARCHING ALGORITHM FOR MULTI-LAYER NEURAL NETWORKS (PART II)", "paper_id": "WOS:000260923100016"}
