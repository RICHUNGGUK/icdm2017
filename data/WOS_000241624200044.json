This paper presents a context-based formalism-Context-SHOIQ(D+) DL which is under the frame of SHOIQ(D+) DL, a kind of description logic, from the category theory point of view. The core part of the proposed formalism is a categorial context based on the SHOIQ(D+) DL, that captures and explicitly represents the information about contexts. Additionally, this paper presents some meta languages about reasoning and knowledge representation, finally discusses context-aware migration between different scenes with the categorial Context-SHOIQ(D+)DL.", "paper_title": "Using categorial Context-SHOIQ(D+)DL to migrate between the context-aware scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624200044"}
