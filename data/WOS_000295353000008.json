Most of the investigations of stress peen forming are empirical and experimental. In this paper, a three step numerical model that can simulate this process was developed. First, an implicit Finite Element Analysis (FEA) with ANSYS where a prebending moment along the spanwise direction of the component was performed. Then, an explicit FEA with LS-DYNA simulating shot impacts on the pre-stressed component was executed in order to obtain the resulting stresses inside the component. Finally, an implicit FEA with ANSYS was performed for calculating the arc heights and the curvature radii of the component in chordwise and spanwise directions. Numerical analysis of the process shows that the prebending moments have an influence not only on the residual stress profiles but also on the curvatures of the deformed component in chordwise and spanwise directions. This model was used to establish a relationship between the prebending moment and the resulting arc heights and residual stress profiles. The numerical strategies developed in this paper supply a useful tool for studying and optimizing the stress peening process. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
