The removal is based on a risk-ratio-based criterion and can be supported by our previously developed data mining methods and medical experts. A series of experiments in which two domain experts decided exceptional patients to be removed show that our proposed method is effective and promising from various viewpoints such as obtaining new hypotheses and improving skills of domain experts. Another series of experiments in which exceptional patients were removed automatically led us to a rediscovery of a piece of knowledge, which had been reported in an article of a medical journal as the main result of the article.", "paper_title": "Spiral removal of exceptional patients for mining chronic hepatitis data", "paper_id": "WOS:000247858300004"}
