By embedding the input models into coarse tetrahedral control meshes, this paper develops a unified framework to discuss two useful editing operations: interactive deformation and deformation transfer. First, a new rigidity energy is proposed to make the tetrahedral control mesh deform as rigidly as possible, which yields intuitive detail and volume preservation even under large deformations. And an error-driven refinement approach is presented to further improve the deformation result. Then, based on this deformation scheme, a volumetric correspondence method is introduced to perform the deformation transfer task between the tetrahedral control meshes of the source and target models, which greatly lessens the burden of the user. Experimental results show our algorithm is effective, easy to control, supports various shape representations, and Well transfers deformations between non-homeomorphous models.
