The proposed method provides a better representation of GSAP, resulting in improved decision performance for speech and noise segments by the use of a TE operator which is employed to suppress the influence of noise signals. The performance of our approach is evaluated by objective tests under various environments, and it is found that the suggested method yields better results than conventional schemes.", "paper_title": "Voice Activity Detection Using Global Speech Absence Probability Based on Teager Energy for Speech Enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000310397700024"}
