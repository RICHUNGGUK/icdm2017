The model constitutes the starting point for an information system capable of managing documental streams integrating and processing different Multimedia data types and providing facilities for indexing, storage and retrieval, together with long-term preservation strategies. We have implemented a prototypal version of file system that realises the described Information Retrieval and Presentation tasks for juridical documents.", "paper_title": "A system for semantic retrieval and long-term preservation of multimedia documents in the e-government domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000274874000002"}
