This method includes three steps. The first step is to find out the four vertexes of ROI (Regions Of Interest); the second is a geometric transform to form an upright image of ROI; the third is to restore a bilevel image of the upright image. This work is distinguished by a key contribution, which is used to find the four vertexes of ROI by using an integrated feature. The integrated feature is composed of simple rectangle features, which are selected by the AdaBoost algorithm. To calculate these simple rectangle features rapidly, the image representation called \"Integral Image\" is used.", "paper_title": "A method for 2D bar code recognition by using rectangle features to allocate vertexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036000009"}
