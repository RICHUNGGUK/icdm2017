As usual, we denote their Minkowski sum by A + B. How small can A + B be, given the cardinalities of A and B? We give a tight answer to this question. Our bound is attained when both A and B are unions of cosets of a certain subgroup of Z(2)(n). These cosets are arranged as Hamming balls, the smaller of which has radius 1. By similar methods, we re-prove the Freiman-Ruzsa theorem in Z(2)(n), with an optimal upper bound. Denote by F(K) the maximal spanning constant vertical bar < A >vertical bar/vertical bar A vertical bar over all subsets A subset of Z(2)(n) with doubling constant vertical bar A + A vertical bar/vertical bar A vertical bar <= K. We explicitly calculate F(K), and in particular show that 4(K)/4K <= F(K) center dot (1 + o(1)) <= 4(K)/2K. This improves the estimate F(K) = poly(K)4(K), found recently by Green and Tao [17] and by Konyagin [23].", "paper_title": "On Sums of Generating Sets in Z(2)(n)", "paper_id": "WOS:000309680500007"}
