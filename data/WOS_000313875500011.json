Most studies on image retargeting focus on shape preservation, but they do not fully consider the preservation of structure lines, which are sensitive to human visual system. In this paper, a patch-based retargeting scheme with an extended significance measurement is introduced to preserve shapes of both visually salient objects and structure lines while minimizing visual distortions. In the proposed scheme, a similarity transformation constraint is used to force visually salient content to undergo as-rigid-as-possible deformation, while an optimization process is performed to smoothly propagate distortions. These processes enable our approach to yield pleasing content-aware warping and retargeting. Experimental results and a user study show that our results are better than those generated by state-of-the-art approaches.", "paper_title": "Patch-Based Image Warping for Content-Aware Retargeting", "paper_id": "WOS:000313875500011"}
