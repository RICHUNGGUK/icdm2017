The proposed amplifier has the benefit of delivering the same performance while consuming half the power compared to the conventional RtR amplifier. This is achieved by recycling the bias current of idle devices, which results in an enhanced transconductance, gain and slew rate. The proposed amplifier was implemented in CSMC standard 0.18 um CMOS process. Simulation results show that the proposed amplifier achieves 10.2 MHz unity-gain bandwidth, 59.4 dB DC gain, 4.8 V/us slew rate and less than 8% deviation in transconductance, but the power consumption reduced by 50% compared to the conventional RtR amplifier with the same design specifications.", "paper_title": "A LOW POWER CURRENT RECYCLING CONSTANT-g(m) RAIL-TO-RAIL OTA", "paper_id": "WOS:000332115500007"}
