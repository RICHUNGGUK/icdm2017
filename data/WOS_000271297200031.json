This experience shows that attempting to define LOs from strictly technical or industrial parameters might be limiting in the context of educational institutions, since teachers are developing and using LOs effectively. despite their little adherence to prescriptive definitions. Yet it is important to support teachers in order to take advantage of the interactive and multimedia potentialities afforded by this technology, instead of using it mostly for delivering static content.
