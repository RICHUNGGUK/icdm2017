Using a local density approximation and a generalised gradient approximation, we calculated the equilibrium structural parameters and elastic constants C ijkl . At present, there is no experimental data for these elastic constants C ijkl for comparison. Besides the elastic constants, we also present the calculated macroscopic mechanical parameters, namely the bulk modulus (K), the shear modulus (G) and Young's modulus (E). The values of these moduli are found to be in good agreement with available experimental data. Our results imply that the mechanical stability of struvite is limited by the shear modulus, G. The study also explores the energy-band structure to understand the obtained values of the elastic constants.", "paper_title": "Ab initio predictions of structural and elastic properties of struvite: contribution to urinary stone research", "paper_id": "WOS:000315719300007"}
