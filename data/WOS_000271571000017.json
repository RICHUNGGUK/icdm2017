Thus, to approximate the human subjective decision making process, it would be more suitable to apply fuzzy measures, where it is not necessary to assume additivity and independence among decision making criteria. In this paper, an intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet integral is proposed for multiple criteria decision making, where interactions phenomena among the decision making criteria are considered. First, we introduced two operational laws on intuitionistic fuzzy values. Then, based on these operational laws. intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet integral operator is proposed. Moreover. some of its properties are investigated. It is shown that the intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet integral operator can be represented by some special t-norms and t-conorms, and it is also a generalization of the intuitionistic fuzzy OWA operator and intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging operator. Further, the procedure and algorithm of multicriteria decision making based on intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet integral operator is given under uncertain environment. Finally, a practical example is provided to illustrate the developed approaches. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
