We examine the alternative of sound property-oriented semantics for such specifications, and study their relationship to model-class semantics. An exact correspondence between the two (completeness) is not achievable in general. We show through general results on property-oriented semantics that the semantics arising from the standard proof system is the strongest sound and compositional property-oriented semantics in a wide class of such semantics. We also sharpen one of the conditions that does guarantee completeness and show that it is a necessary condition.", "paper_title": "Property-oriented semantics of structured specifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000343643500005"}
