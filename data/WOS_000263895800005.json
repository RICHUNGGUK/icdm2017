Among different criteria used for this purpose, the minimum evolution criterion is an optimality based criterion aiming to rebuild PT characterized by a minimal length. This problem is known to be NP-hard. We introduce in this article some mixed integer programming models, and we also study possible cuts and lower bounds for the optimal value. So far, the number of sequences that can be involved in optimal phylogenetic reconstruction is still limited to 10. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
