We ground our approach in the recent literature on the often unintended shortcomings exhibited by healthcare information systems and propose a lightweight method to support the phases of requirement elicitation and functional design. We then discuss the main requirements expressed in our recent research activity and provide examples of how to address them in terms of modular and reusable design solutions.", "paper_title": "Remain Faithful to the Earth!: Reporting Experiences of Artifact-Centered Design in Healthcare", "paper_id": "WOS:000296511000002"}
