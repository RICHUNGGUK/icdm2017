In this article, we utilize the C-OWA operator to derive the priority vector of an interval fuzzy preference relation and then develop a practical approach to solving the decision-making problem with interval fuzzy preference relation. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the practicability and efficiency of the developed approach.
