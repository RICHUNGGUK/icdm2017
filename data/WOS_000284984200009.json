Besides the generality of the model which makes it suitable to be used for any product graph, experimental (simulation) results show that the proposed model exhibits high accuracy even in heavy traffic and saturation region, where other models have severe problems to predict the performance of the network. Most popular interconnection network can be defined as a Cartesian product of two or more networks including the mesh, hypercube, and torus networks. Torus and mesh networks are the most popular topologies used in recent supercomputing parallel machines. They have been widely used for realizing on-chip network in recent on-chip multicore and multiprocessors system. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.
