OTP authentication schemes have developed based on time synchronization or one-way hash functions, although they can be trouble some and they have a high computational complexity. The current paper provides secure authentication for low-power wireless devices and other applications requiring authentication that is secure against passive attacks based on replaying captured and reusable passwords. In addition, our scheme highly minimizes the computational and transmission complexity and solves time or sequence synchronization problems by applying non-group cellular automata, based on the non-reversibility and uniqueness of the state configuration.", "paper_title": "Non-group cellular automata based one time password authentication scheme in wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240059200009"}
