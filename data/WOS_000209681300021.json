This paper investigates how the relative performance of MU-MIMO and SU-MIMO is affected by 1) different Doppler spectra, and 2) high-order prediction methods for channel estimation. Simulation results reveal that the often-used Jakes-Clarke spectrum is the worst case for MU performance. By evaluating the impact of other Doppler spectra and high-order channel prediction on MU-MIMO performance, we demonstrate that MU can tolerate larger CSI delays and retain its theoretical advantage over SU in practice.", "paper_title": "Multi-User and Single-User Throughputs for Downlink MIMO Channels with Outdated Channel State Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681300021"}
