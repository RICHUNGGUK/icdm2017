The phenols show toxicity to fast growing cells. Using CEBEs of four distinguished carbon atoms in the phenyl ring and oxygen atom in -OH of the phenols, the compounds were well separated and grouped by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Using three out of the five CEBEs, together with sigma(+) and log P of the phenols as descriptor, we established a QSAR model with Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression which resulted in Q(2)=0.914. CEBE values when used together with traditionally used descriptors such as log P and sigma(+) turned out to be useful descriptors in modeling the activity (QSAR) of the compounds with PLS.", "paper_title": "Core electron binding energy (CEBE) as descriptors in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis of cytotoxicities of a series of simple phenols", "paper_id": "WOS:000245374600008"}
