Our aim is to use a simple and accurate representation of the source terms in order to simulate practical shallow water flows without relying on upwind discretization or Riemann problem solvers. We validate the algorithm on problems where analytical solutions are available. The numerical results are in good agreement with analytical solutions. Furthermore, we test the method on a practical problem by simulating mean flow in the Strait of Gibraltar. The main focus is to examine the performance of the LB method for complex geometries with irregular bathymetry. The results demonstrate its ability to capture the main flow features.
