A top-down guidance learned from training images is used to guide patch sampling towards informative regions. Experiment results show that this approach achieved noticeable improvement over baseline patch sampling strategies for the classification of both object categories and scene categories.", "paper_title": "Incorporating Top-Down Guidance for Extracting Informative Patches for Image Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000301614700022"}
