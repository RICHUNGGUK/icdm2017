In an archaeological setting, a practical acquisition system for routine use on every artifact and fragment would open new possibilities for archiving, analysis, and dissemination. We present an inexpensive system for acquiring all three types of information, and associated metadata, for small objects such as fragments of wall paintings. The acquisition system requires minimal supervision, so that a single, non-expert user can scan at least 10 fragments per hour. To achieve this performance. we introduce new algorithms to robustly and automatically align range scans, register 2-D scans to 3-D geometry, and compute normals from 2-D scans. As an illustrative application, we present a novel 3-D matching algorithm that efficiently searches for matching fragments using the scanned geometry.", "paper_title": "A system for high-volume acquisition and matching of fresco fragments: Reassembling theran wall paintings", "paper_id": "WOS:000258262000073"}
