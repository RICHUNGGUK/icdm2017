This system uses expert neural network predictors, each corresponding to a specific range of source elevation. The outputs of the expert predictors are combined using a weighting mechanism and a nonlinear fusion system. Using this prediction methodology the computational intractability of traditional acoustic propagation models is eliminated. The proposed system is tested on a synthetically generated acoustic data set for a wide range of geometric, source, environmental, and operational conditions. The results show a significant improvement in both accuracy and reliability over a benchmark prediction system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
