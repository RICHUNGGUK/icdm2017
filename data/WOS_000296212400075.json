The first NN identifier uses the output signals from the actual system for the system identification. The on-line update laws for dynamic neural networks have been developed using the Lyapunov function and singularly perturbed techniques. In the second NN identifier, all the output signals from nonlinear system are replaced with the state variables of the neuron networks. The on-line identification algorithm with dead-zone function is proposed to improve nonlinear system identification performance. Compared with other dynamic neural network identification methods, the proposed identification methods exhibit improved identification performance. Three examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
