We propose an alternative functional that is independent of parameterization; it is a geometric functional given in terms of the surfaces representing the data and image in the feature space. The I\"-convergence technique is combined with the minimal surfaces theory to yield a global generalization of the Mumford-Shah segmentation function.", "paper_title": "Geometric Approach to Measure-Based Metric in Image Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000263392200007"}
