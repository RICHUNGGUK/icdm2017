This study proposes a novel efficient proxy signature scheme for mobile devices using bilinear pairings. The computational cost of the proposed signature scheme is extremely low, and the length of the proposed signature is limited. In addition, our scheme does not require a special hash function, namely the Map-To-Point hash function. We also show that the proposed scheme is secure against adaptive chosen message attacks under a random oracle.", "paper_title": "Efficient Proxy Signature Scheme for Mobile Devices Using Bilinear Pairings", "paper_id": "WOS:000328565800002"}
