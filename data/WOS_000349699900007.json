Recent experimental techniques revealed that the majority of mammalian genomes and other complex organisms are in fact transcribed into non-coding RNAs. Typically, non-coding RNAs are small nucleotide sequences that are not transcribed into proteins and have a profound regulatory role. Present advances in computational biosciences linked their abnormal functionality to many diseases and re-stated the principles of basic therapeutic strategies. The effective identification of non-coding RNAs and their biological role emerges as a new and challenging bioinformatics problem. ncRNAclass ( http://biotools.ceid.upatras.gr/ncrnaclass/) is a web platform that allows for efficient computation of a set of features that can describe effectively the broad class of non-coding RNAs. Moreover, it enables the calculation of features that include information about the targeting behavior of miRNAs. The tool operates under a user-friendly interface and its pilot implementation incorporates prediction models for the well-known class of microRNAs and for prediction their mRNA targets. The prediction models are based on two novel evolutionary Machine Learning algorithms that achieve very high classification performance in comparison with existing methods. The platform is also equipped with a data warehouse, with manually curated sequences, that enables fast information retrieval and data mining utilities.", "paper_title": "ncRNAclass: A Web Platform for Non-Coding RNA Feature Calculation and MicroRNAs and Targets Prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000349699900007"}
