We show that when plugging in the well-known simple evolutionary multi-objective optimizer (SEMO) as a subprocedure into APS, c-dominance has to be used to achieve fast convergence to the Pareto front. Two general theorems are presented indicating how runtime complexity results for APS can be derived from corresponding results for SEMO. This may be a starting point for the runtime analysis of evolutionary SMOCO algorithms.", "paper_title": "Runtime Analysis of an Evolutionary Algorithm for Stochastic Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000306767200003"}
