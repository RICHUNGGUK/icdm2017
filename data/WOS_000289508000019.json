There is a lot of variability in the intensity pattern in the magnetic resonance (MR) image data due to various reasons. For example a T2 weighted image of same patient can be generated by different pulse sequence (Spin Echo, Fast Spin Echo, Inversion recovery, etc.) or on different MR system (1T, 1.5T, 3T, system, etc.) or using different RF coil system. Hence, there is a need for an adaptive scheme for segmentation, which can be modified depending on the imaging scheme and nature of the MR images. This paper proposes a scheme to automatically generate fuzzy rules for MR image segmentation to classify tissue. The scheme is based on hybrid approach of two popular genetic algorithm based machine learning (GBML) techniques, Michigan and Pittsburg approach. The proposed method uses a training data set generated from manual segmented images with the help of an expert in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Features from image histogram and spatial neighbourhood of pixels have been used in fuzzy rules. The method is tested for classifying brain T2 weighted 2-D axial images acquired by different pulse sequences into three primary tissue types: white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebro spinal fluid (CSF). Results were matched with manual segmentation by experts. The performance of our scheme was comparable. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
