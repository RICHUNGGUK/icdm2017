Until now, nondestructive techniques, such as half-cell potential and polarization resistance, have been widely available in the world. The former provides information on the probability of corrosion while the latter is associated with information concerning corrosion rates. Inversion by the boundary element method (IBEM) was developed for considering concrete resistivity. The applicability of the procedure was examined through a numerical analysis and electrolytic tests for RC slabs. A distribution in such concrete resistivity is relatively inhomogeneous including cracks on the surface of slabs. Regarding cracks in concrete, the relative coefficient of concrete resistance was introduced to perform its analysis. Further, the procedure will be developed to identify the corroded region visually using 3-D VRML.", "paper_title": "Analysis on IBEM for consideration on reinforced concrete slab resistance", "paper_id": "WOS:000261488400003"}
