The PL algorithm is a laxity based algorithm and ensures execution of a task with approximate proportional fairness at each task's period. Existing optimal algorithms on multiprocessors may cause excessive scheduling decisions and preemptions or may not be applied in a discrete environment. The proposed algorithm can be applied in a discrete environment and reduce the number of scheduling decisions and preemptions compared with a Pfair algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
