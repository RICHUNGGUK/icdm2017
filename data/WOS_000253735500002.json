This paper addresses three strategic challenges arising out of the need of creating this new environment. The first of these is the challenge for more inclusive models of governance given that SDI formulation and implementation involve a very large number of stakeholders from all levels of government as well as the private sector and academia. The second concerns the promotion of data sharing between different kinds of organization. In some cases, this may require new forms of organization to carry out these tasks. The third challenge relates to the establishment of enabling platforms to facilitate access to spatial data and the delivery of data-related services.", "paper_title": "Spatially enabling governments through SDI implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000253735500002"}
