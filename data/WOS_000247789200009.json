This paper presents distributed simulators for nuclear power plants with communication based on Real-time CORBA, a middleware for real-time systems. The simulators are used to train power plant operators safely. They are based on a complex architecture of simulation models with real-time constraints involving many different applications that allow full scope simulation of the control room of a nuclear power plant. The use of Real-time CORBA in the simulators allows us to obtain platform and language independence, reusable components and the control of real-time properties. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V..
