However, the state-of-the-art pattern-based clustering methods are inefficient and provide no metric to measure the clustering quality. This paper presents a new pattern-based subspace clustering method, which can tackle the problems mentioned above. Observing the analogy between mining frequent itemsets and discovering subspace clusters, we apply pattern tree - a structure used in frequent itemsets mining to determining the target subspaces by scanning the database once, which can be done efficiently in large datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a general clustering quality evaluation model to guide the identifying of meaningful clusters. The proposed new method enables the users to set flexibly proper quality-control parameters to meet different needs. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that our method outperforms the existing methods in both efficiency and effectiveness. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
