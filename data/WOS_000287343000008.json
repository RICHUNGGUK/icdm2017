However, current home networks have a variety of transmission control information media, such as WLAN, Zigbee, ECHONET, and LonWorks, resulting in an issue of interoperability of different network protocols. To solve this problem, this study proposes a OSGi-based service architecture for Cyber-Physical Home Control Systems, which supports service-oriented control methods. Users can control appliances in the physical environment by intuitive operation through a virtual home on the network. When the state or location of any appliance in the physical environment changes, the virtual context can enact timely changes, accordingly. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
