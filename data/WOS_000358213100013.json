Interagent interaction rules are uncertain but satisfy the standard sector condition with known sector bounds; both the agent's model and interaction topology are time-invariant. A novel frequency-domain criterion for consensus is offered that is similar to and extends the classical Popov's absolute stability criterion.", "paper_title": "Popov-Type Criterion for Consensus in Nonlinearly Coupled Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000358213100013"}
