Basically, Fountain code and video codec II 264 are tightly coupled to efficiently use the path diversity over existing heterogeneous wireless networks Finally, the proposed system is implemented and tested real environments", "paper_title": "FOUNTAIN CODE BASED VIRTUAL PATH FOR VIDEO TRANSMISSION OVER HETEROGENEOUS WIRELESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000275768200004"}
