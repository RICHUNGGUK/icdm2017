It presents a powerful decomposition algorithm of such systems. Our methods are based on the witness principle whose theoretical background is recalled in a first step. A method to generate a witness is then explained. We show that having a witness can be used to incrementally detect over-constrainedness and thus to compute a well-constrained boundary system. An algorithm is introduced to check if anchoring a given subset of the coordinates brings the number of solutions to a finite number. An algorithm to efficiently identify all maximal well-constrained parts of a geometric constraint system is described. This allows us to design a powerful algorithm of decomposition, called W-decomposition, which is able to identify all well-constrained subsystems: it manages to decompose systems which were not decomposable by classic combinatorial methods.
