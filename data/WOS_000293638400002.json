In this paper, we propose a random walk based approach to process the Gaussian kernel similarity matrix. In this method, the pair-wise similarity between two data points is not only related to the two points, but also related to their neighbors. As a result, the new similarity matrix is closer to the ideal matrix which can provide the best clustering result. We give a theoretical analysis of the similarity matrix and apply this similarity matrix to spectral clustering. We also propose a method to handle noisy items which may cause deterioration of clustering performance. Experimental results on real-world data sets show that the proposed spectral clustering algorithm significantly outperforms existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "An improved spectral clustering algorithm based on random walk", "paper_id": "WOS:000293638400002"}
