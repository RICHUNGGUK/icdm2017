But this improvement in accuracy is not easy to achieve due to the great amount of data which makes difficult any treatment over it and it's redundancies. To solve this problem, a pick selection based on principal component analysis has been adopted in order to make the mandatory feature selection over the different channels. In this paper, the capability to retrieve the temperature profile in a combustion environment using neural networks jointly with this spectral high resolution feature selection method is studied.", "paper_title": "Spectral high resolution feature selection for retrieval of combustion temperature profiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900091"}
