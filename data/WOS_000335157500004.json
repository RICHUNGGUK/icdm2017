The proposed phase shifter has achieved a phase-shifting range of with a resolution over 40 to 50-GHz. Thanks to the careful dimension designs of digitally controlled gain stage in the programmable weighted combiner, the active phase shifter achieves root-mean-square phase and gain errors of and 1.25-dB at 45-GHz, respectively. The measurement results also show that the input and output return losses are better than 7-dB from 40 to 50-GHz.
