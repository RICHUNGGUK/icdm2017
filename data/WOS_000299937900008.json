We provide a detailed geometrical description relevant to the construction of the Jacobian matrix containing the dependencies of the visual features on the robot joint angles. This matrix embodies the forward kinematics model. To obtain an autonomous control system invariant to world position, we define the ground reference system relative to the basic support points. The control of the robot is computed by the inversion of the forward kinematics model, with two corrections. First, to preserve the ground reference system we must correct the motion of the supporting points. Second, we test a stability condition to avoid the robot to move into unstable configurations. We have tested the approach on a controlled environment to assess its real life performance. The experimental results show the robustness of the approach.", "paper_title": "Visual Servoing of Legged Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000299937900008"}
