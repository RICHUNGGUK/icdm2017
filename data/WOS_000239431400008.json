The coordinators are always active, while the ordinary nodes are power managed using Bernoulli scheduling of the duration of sleep and service periods. The coordinator of one cluster switches periodically to the other cluster and out of it, thus performing the bridging function. The delivery of data to the network sink is accomplished either using the CSMA-CA mechanism, or through guaranteed time slots (GTS). We develop the queueing model of this network, including the MAC and physical layer, and analyze its performance. While the packet delays and throughput in the CSMA-CA regime are comparable to that obtained with GTS access, the latter is preferable on account of the more balanced power consumption between the two clusters, thus extending the useful lifetime of the entire network.", "paper_title": "Faster lanes, longer lifetimes: Activity management in interconnected 802.15.4 sensor clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000239431400008"}
