By assuming that users are selfish, rational, and have privately known cost of participating in the referrals, we design a novel truthful efficient mechanism in which an expert-finding query will be relayed by intermediate users. When receiving a referral request, a participant will locally choose among her neighbors some user to relay the request. In our mechanism, several closely coupled methods are carefully designed to improve the performance of distributed search, including, profile matching, social acquaintance prediction, score function for locally choosing relay neighbors, and budget estimation. We conduct extensive experiments on several data sets of online social networks. The extensive study of our mechanism shows that the success rate of our mechanism is about 90 percent in finding closely matched experts using only local search and limited budget, which significantly improves the previously best rate 20 percent. The overall cost of finding an expert by our truthful mechanism is about 20 percent of the untruthful methods, e.g., the method that always selects high-degree neighbors. The median length of social referral chains is 6 using our localized search decision, which surprisingly matches the well-known small-world phenomenon of global social structures.", "paper_title": "Mechanism Design for Finding Experts Using Locally Constructed Social Referral Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000358226400020"}
