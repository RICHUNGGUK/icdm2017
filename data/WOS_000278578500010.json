A data rate control mechanism is derived for the case where the uplink channel provides real-time services and the traffic rate parameter remains constant. This paper shows that the common queuing scheduling algorithms have some bandwidth allocation fairness problems for the real-time polling service (rtPS) in the MAC layer. In other words, the use of a VBR for the rtPS by a WiMAX system results in additional access latency jitter and bandwidth allocation disorder in the transmitted multimedia streams during the regular time interval polling of subscribe stations (SSs) for the contention bandwidth request period. However, the proposed scheduling algorithm solves these SSs contending with bandwidth resource allocation problems based on an extended rtPS (ertPS) of quality-of-service (QoS) pre-programming for a ranging response non-contention polling period. The adopted bandwidth allocation of max-min fairness queue scheduling uses a time constraint condition to transmit real-time multimedia VBR streaming in an IEEE 802.16 broadband wireless environment. In addition, we use the ns-2 simulation tool to compare the capacity of multimedia VBR stream and show that the proposed ertPS scheduling algorithm outperforms other rtPS scheduling algorithms.
