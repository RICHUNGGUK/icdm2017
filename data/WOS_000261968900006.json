The method is specifically designed for reconstructing scenes with high geometric complexity or fine-scale texture. To achieve this, we introduce the confocal constancy property, which states that as the lens aperture varies, the pixel intensity of a visible in-focus scene point will vary in a scene-independent way, that can be predicted by prior radiometric lens calibration. The only requirement is that incoming radiance within the cone subtended by the largest aperture is nearly constant. First, we develop a detailed lens model that factors out the distortions in high resolution SLR cameras (12MP or more) with large-aperture lenses (e.g., f1.2). This allows us to assemble an AxF aperture-focus image (AFI) for each pixel, that collects the undistorted measurements over all A apertures and F focus settings. In the AFI representation, confocal constancy reduces to color comparisons within regions of the AFI, and leads to focus metrics that can be evaluated separately for each pixel. We propose two such metrics and present initial reconstruction results for complex scenes, as well as for a scene with known ground-truth shape.", "paper_title": "Confocal Stereo", "paper_id": "WOS:000261968900006"}
