A number of approximation algorithms for constructing a small CDS in unit disk graphs have been proposed in the literature. The majority of these algorithms follow a general two-phased approach. The first phase constructs a dominating set, and the second phase selects additional nodes to interconnect the nodes in the dominating set. In the performance analyses of these two-phased algorithms, the relation between the independence number alpha and the connected domination number gamma (c) of a unit-disk graph plays the key role. The best-known relation between them is alpha <= 32/3 gamma(c) + 1. In this paper, we prove that alpha <= 3.4306 gamma(c) +4.8185. This relation leads to tighter upper bounds on the approximation ratios of two approximation algorithms proposed in the literature.", "paper_title": "Tighter Approximation Bounds for Minimum CDS in Unit Disk Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000296284800012"}
