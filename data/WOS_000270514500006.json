However, studies on consumer psychology have indicated that customer preferences are often unstable and developed over time. Therefore, we assert that it is necessary to observe the degree to which customer preferences are developed since effectiveness of recommendations is affected by customers' preference development. This study presents a scheme to identify the status of customers' preference development and analyzes the influences of customer preference development on the effectiveness of various recommendation strategies.
