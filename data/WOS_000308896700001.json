Design/methodology/approach - The force characteristics of the drive have been simulated in a finite element (FE) approach. Additionally the coppler losses within the motor coils have been predicted based on the FE-simulation. Both results are compared to laboratory measurements of a prototype to validate the design. Findings - The presented results show a good correlation between simulation and measurement and proof the applicability of the new design drive system. Research limitations/implications - The used hydraulic models of the cardiovasular system used as a load for the device are not fully validated with data from living organisms. Therefore, further in vivo trials are needed. Originality/value - The high force density of the drive allows its integration into a fully implantable, total artificial heart, in order to significantly improve durability. This hopefully will extend the indication for artificial hearts as alternatives to transplantation.", "paper_title": "Validation of the electromagnetic design of a total artificial heart under physical load conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000308896700001"}
