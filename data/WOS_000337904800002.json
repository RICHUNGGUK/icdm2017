One key issue of ISFR is how to effectively and efficiently represent the query face image set using the gallery face image sets. The set-to-set distance-based methods ignore the relationship between gallery sets, whereas representing the query set images individually over the gallery sets ignores the correlation between query set images. In this paper, we propose a novel image set-based collaborative representation and classification method for ISFR. By modeling the query set as a convex or regularized hull, we represent this hull collaboratively over all the gallery sets. With the resolved representation coefficients, the distance between the query set and each gallery set can then be calculated for classification. The proposed model naturally and effectively extends the image-based collaborative representation to an image set based one, and our extensive experiments on benchmark ISFR databases show the superiority of the proposed method to state-of-the-art ISFR methods under different set sizes in terms of both recognition rate and efficiency.", "paper_title": "Image Set-Based Collaborative Representation for Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000337904800002"}
