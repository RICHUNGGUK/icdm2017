We use the notion of additive relation borrowed from homological algebra to give a convenient framework in which all diagrams have a semantic value. We give a sound system of Hoare-style rules for the block diagram constructors that singles out a tractable subset of the block diagram language in which all diagrams represent total functions. We show these rules in action on some simple examples from a variety of applications domains.", "paper_title": "A Hoare logic for linear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000318568700002"}
