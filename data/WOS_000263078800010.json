The algorithm is constructed by combining four strategies, that can evaluate the number of CVCs more strictly compared with the previous approach. By using our method, we found some DVs that have 57 (or 59) essential CVCs for 1st (or 2nd) block. in the case if we assume that we can modify messages up to step 25, which we have not confirmed the practicability of the assumption.", "paper_title": "A Strict Evaluation on the Number of Conditions for SHA-1 Collision Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000263078800010"}
