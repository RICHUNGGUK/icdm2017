It is shown that: (i) a smoother and more realistic profile of beam's rotations is obtained at the damaged locations; (ii) independently of support restraints and damage scenarios, only four boundary conditions are required, meaning that the computational effort does not increase with the number of cracks; (iii) the microstructural effects become significant when the modal wave lengths are less then about forty times the HGE length-scale parameters.
