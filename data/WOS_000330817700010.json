The algorithm reduces construction of a parsing table to computing multiple products of Boolean matrices of various sizes. Its time complexity on an input string of length n is 0(BMM(n)logn), where BMM(n) is the number of operations needed to multiply two Boolean matrices of size n x n, which is O(n(omega)) with omega < 2.373 as per the current knowledge. A parse tree can be constructed in time MM(n) log(0(1))n (where MM(n) is the complexity of multiplying two integer matrices), by applying a known efficient procedure for determining witnesses for Boolean matrix multiplication. The algorithm has a succinct proof of correctness and is ready to be implemented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
