In this paper, we revisit this known characterization and restate it using a new idea of GOB designs. This newly introduced combinatorial structure simplifies the characterization, and enables us to extend Johansson's well-known family of optimal authentication codes with arbitration to any finite projective spaces with dimension greater than or equal to 3.", "paper_title": "GOB designs for authentication codes with arbitration", "paper_id": "WOS:000239889200004"}
