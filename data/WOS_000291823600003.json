We show the equivalence of this scheme to a special case of iterated adaptive filtering. By determining the diffusion tensor field from an autocorrelation estimate, we obtain an evolution equation that is computed from a scalar product of diffusion tensor and the image Hessian. We propose further a set of filters to approximate the Hessian on a minimized spatial support. On standard benchmarks, the resulting method performs favorable in many cases, in particular at low noise levels. In a GPU implementation, video real-time performance is easily achieved.", "paper_title": "Autocorrelation-Driven Diffusion Filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000291823600003"}
