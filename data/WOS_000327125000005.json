Then, we construct new cubature rules for 3D integrals, based on spline quasi-interpolants expressed as linear combinations of scaled translates of B and local linear functionals. We give weights and nodes of the above rules and we analyse their properties. Finally, some numerical tests and comparisons with other known integration formulas are presented.", "paper_title": "Numerical integration based on trivariate C (2) quartic spline quasi-interpolants", "paper_id": "WOS:000327125000005"}
