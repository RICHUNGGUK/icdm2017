The results indicated that individuals who had only recently learned to use the DSS were confused or restricted by the set of functions provided by the system and did not plan well for their use of the DSS. Those who had previous knowledge of the system exhibited more focused and efficient problem-solving behavior. Our findings suggested that problem-solving strategies depended significantly on the user's level of system expertise. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
