During the last thirty years the problem has been studied extensively and optimal algorithms in many classical models of computation are known. In 1988, Mehlhorn et al. [K. Mehlhorn, S. Naher, H. Alt, A lower bound on the complexity of the union-split-find problem, SIAM J. Comput. 17 (6) (1988) 1093-1102] showed an amortized lower bound of Omega(log log n) in the pointer machine model. We give a different proof for this bound which sheds new light on the question of how much power the adversary actually needs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
