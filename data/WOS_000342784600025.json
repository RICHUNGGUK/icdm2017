Although it is known that high-performance speech recognition systems depend on a superior speech database used in the training stage, due to the lack of such an appropriate database, previous reports on Filipino speech recognition had to contend with serious data sparsity issues. In this paper we alleviate such sparsity through appropriate data analysis that makes the evaluation results more reliable. The best system is identified through its low word-error rate to a cross-validation set containing almost three hours of unknown speech data. Language-dependent problems are discussed, and their impact on accuracy was analyzed. The approach is currently data driven, however it serves as a competent baseline model for succeeding future developments.", "paper_title": "Open Domain Continuous Filipino Speech Recognition: Challenges and Baseline Experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784600025"}
