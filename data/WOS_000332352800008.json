Energy problem is one of the important problems influencing the complete application. Sensor nodes use batteries as power source and have quite limit lifetime. So, efficiency of energy management becomes a key requirement in wireless sensor network design. Based on particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization, a comprehensive algorithm with weight analysis has been proposed in the paper. In the algorithm, optimization method would be firstly used to determine the nodes number; then, particle swarm optimization would be used to divide the networks into some clusters; finally, ant colony optimization is used to require the best transmission path and select the cluster head. The simulation results show that the new algorithm has higher energy efficiency and balanced energy consumption. It can extend the network lifetime.", "paper_title": "Comprehensive Energy Efficient Algorithm for WSN", "paper_id": "WOS:000332352800008"}
