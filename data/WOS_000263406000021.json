Many of these packages fail to account for expression correlation between transcripts, with a resultant inflation in Type I error. Array permutation and other resampling-based approaches have been proposed as solutions to this problem. SAFEGUI provides a user-friendly graphical interface for the assessment of categorical significance in microarray studies, while properly accounting for the effects of correlations among genes. SAFEGUI incorporates both permutation and more recently proposed bootstrap algorithms that are demonstrated to be more powerful in detecting differential expression across categories of genes.", "paper_title": "SAFEGUI: resampling-based tests of categorical significance in gene expression data made easy", "paper_id": "WOS:000263406000021"}
