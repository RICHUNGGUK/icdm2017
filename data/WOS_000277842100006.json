However, there is no efficient model for path compression techniques. This paper analyzed the principles and characteristics of path compression algorithms and proposed dynamic model which provided theoretical basis to improve or propose path compression algorithms. This model took the mobility and expansibility of Ad Hoc networks into account and was efficient to analyze or evaluate path compression algorithms. The quantitative relationship and probability expression for pivotal compression events were given based on the model. The simulation results of SHORT (self-healing and optimizing routing techniques) and PCA (path compression algorithm) show that it is a correct and efficient dynamic model for path compression. Finally, some suggestions and application scenarios about the model were proposed. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
