We give new space/time tradeoffs over previous work on geometric queries such as dominance and rectangle visibility, and on semigroup and group queries such as sum, average, variance, minimum and maximum. We also introduce new solutions to queries less frequently considered in the literature such as two-dimensional quantiles, majorities, successor/predecessor, mode, and various top-k queries, considering static and dynamic scenarios.
