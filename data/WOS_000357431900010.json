It aims to establish a typology of the external variables and a typology of the events from their mutual relationships. In order to do so, the influence of external variables on the lexical choices is untangled cancelling the associations among them, and to avoid the instability issued from multicollinearity, they are substituted by their principal components. The CaGalt function, implemented in the FactoMineR package, provides numerous numerical and graphical outputs. Confidence ellipses are also provided to validate and improve the representation of words and variables. Although this methodology was developed mainly to give an answer to the problem of analyzing open-ended questions, it can be applied to any kind of frequency/contingency table with external variables.", "paper_title": "Correspondence Analysis on Generalised Aggregated Lexical Tables (CA-GALT) in the FactoMineR Package", "paper_id": "WOS:000357431900010"}
