Traditional approaches to storing, querying, and reasoning fall short when faced with web-scale data. We present a system that combines the computational power of large clusters for enabling large-scale reasoning and data access with an efficient data structure for storing and querying the accessed data on a traditional personal computer or other resource-constrained device. We present results of using this system to load the 2009 Billion Triples Challenge dataset, materialize RDFS inferences, extract an \"interesting\" subset of the data using a large cluster, and further analyze the extracted data using a personal computer, all in the order of tens of minutes.
