In addition to power-consuming appliances, we adopt a photovoltaic (PV) panel as a power-producing appliance that acts as a micro-grid. An appliance operation is modeled in terms of uninterruptible sequence phases, given in a load demand profile with a goal of minimizing electricity cost fulfilling duration, energy requirement, and user preference constraints. An optimization algorithm, which can provide a schedule for smart home appliance usage, is proposed based on the mixed-integer programming technique. Simulation results demonstrate the utility of our proposed solution for appliance scheduling. We further show that adding a PV system in the home results in the reduction of electricity bills and the export of energy to the national grid in times when solar energy production is more than the demand of the home.", "paper_title": "Appliance Scheduling Optimization in Smart Home Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200167"}
