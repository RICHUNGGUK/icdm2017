We identify major techniques in opinion retrieval and group them into four popular categories. We describe the state-of-the-art techniques for each category and emphasize on their performance and limitations. We then summarize with a performance comparison table for the techniques on different datasets. Finally, we highlight possible future research directions that can help solve existing challenges in opinion retrieval.", "paper_title": "Performance and trends in recent opinion retrieval techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000351436200003"}
