However, there is little research on the impact of quality-of-service (QoS) constraints on two-way MIMO relay systems, which greatly affects the user experience. In this letter, we propose a transceiver design for two-way MIMO relay systems which minimizes the total network transmission power subjecting to QoS constraints expressed as upper-bounds on the mean-squared error (MSE) of the signal waveform estimation at both destinations. An iterative algorithm is developed to optimize the source, relay, and receive matrices. Simulation results demonstrate the fast convergence of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Joint Transceiver Optimization for Two-Way MIMO Relay Systems With MSE Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681700017"}
