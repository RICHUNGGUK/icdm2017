For formulas of size at most cn, our algorithm runs in time for some constant mu (c) > 0. As a byproduct of the running time analysis of our algorithm, we obtain strong average-case hardness of affine extractors for linear-sized formulas over the full binary basis.", "paper_title": "A satisfiability algorithm and average-case hardness for formulas over the full binary basis", "paper_id": "WOS:000319168000003"}
