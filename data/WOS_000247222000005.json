The proper application of cross-validation is summarized and applied to both the model selection and verification steps, with comparison to the use of a holdout sample. Implementation of the evaluation of a model's predictive ability at the correct point in the procedure is emphasized. A recent regression methodology, the elastic net, is shown to produce a reduced set of predictors while retaining predictive ability. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
