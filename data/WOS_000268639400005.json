The consequence of the new NR circuit in the CDA is significant improvement of bandwidth (similar to 15%) with no degradation in gain. In addition, the simplicity of the NR circuit makes it amenable to MMIC technology and moreover for broadband applications.", "paper_title": "A new negative resistance circuit and an application for loss compensation in a distributed amplifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000268639400005"}
