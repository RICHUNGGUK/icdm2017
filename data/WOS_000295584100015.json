Theoretical analysis is given on convergence properties of the proposed ZNN model. For comparative purposes, the conventional gradient neural network is developed and exploited for solving online time-varying linear inequalities as well. Computer simulation results further verify and demonstrate the efficacy, novelty, and superiority of such a ZNN model and its method for solving time-varying linear inequalities.", "paper_title": "Zhang Neural Network Versus Gradient Neural Network for Solving Time-Varying Linear Inequalities", "paper_id": "WOS:000295584100015"}
