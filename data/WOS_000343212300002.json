Monotonic convergence of the resulting ILC process is studied, and a sufficient condition within an H-infinity-based framework is developed. It is shown that under this framework, delay-dependent conditions can be obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), together with formulas for gain matrices design. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the robust H-infinity-based approach to ILC designed via LMIs.", "paper_title": "H-infinity approach to monotonically convergent ILC for uncertain time-varying delay systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000343212300002"}
