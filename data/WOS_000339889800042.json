The harmonic constraint is particularly effective for tonal instruments because each note is associated with a unique basis. The monophonic constraint is implemented by enforcing single-non-zero gains per instrument in the factorization process. The proposed method uses previously trained instrument models with a supervised procedure. Both constraints (harmonic and monophonic) are implemented in a deterministic manner. The proposed method has been tested for two audio signal applications, Sound Source Separation and Automatic Music Transcription. Comparison with other state-of-the-art methods using a dataset of polyphonic mixtures composed of monophonic sources has produced competitive and promising results.", "paper_title": "Monophonic constrained non-negative sparse coding using instrument models for audio separation and transcription of monophonic source-based polyphonic mixtures", "paper_id": "WOS:000339889800042"}
