Some sufficient conditions are provided for checking stability and Hopf bifurcation. The particular attention is focused on the change of the stability as the bifurcation parameter tau increased. The computer simulations are provided to verify the efficiency of the theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
