During the collaboration, a lot of information related to software development, including communication and coordination information of developers, can be recorded in software repositories. The information can be employed to construct Developer Social Networks (DSNs) for facilitating tasks in software engineering. In this paper, we survey recent advances of DSNs and examine three fundamental steps of DSNs, namely construction, analysis, and applications. We summarize the state-of-the-art methods in the three steps and investigate the relationships among them. Furthermore, we discuss the main issues and point out the future opportunities in the study of DSNs.", "paper_title": "Developer social networks in software engineering: construction, analysis, and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000346238500018"}
