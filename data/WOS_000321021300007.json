Most existing works assume that the monitoring area is infinite or large enough so that the boundary effect can be ignored, which in practice leads to coverage holes. In order to detect and eliminate the boundary effect, extra deployment work is required which leads to high cost in human resources, materials and time. In this paper, we propose a growth rings like deployment (GRLD) scheme to achieve both coverage and connectivity without boundary effects. GRLD is designed to be suitable for different relationships of the communication radius and sensing radius of sensors. We prove that GRLD can guarantee full coverage of the area and connectivity of the network. Sensor density of GRLD is derived in theory to assess its efficiency and the accuracy is verified by simulation results. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate GRLD's performance compared with existing popular deployment patterns, in terms of sensor density, efficiency on eliminating boundary effects and flexibility to different relationships of the communication radius and sensing radius of sensors.", "paper_title": "A Deterministic Sensor Placement Scheme for Full Coverage and Connectivity Without Boundary Effect in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000321021300007"}
