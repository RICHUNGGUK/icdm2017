The model consists of a deterministic biochemical network coupled to stochastic activation of CaMKII The results suggest that CaMKII holoenzyme activity is non-linear and dependent on the holoenzyme configuration of isoforms. This is especially pronounced in situations with a high-dephosphorylation rate of CaMKII. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
