The extension allows for fully automatic and accurate treatment of path constraints in case of relatively coarse discretizations of the control while maintaining a prescribed resolution of the system dynamics. It is based on a reduction principle from classical theory of semi-infinite programming. On the basis of these theoretical foundations the minima tracking algorithm is designed. We theoretically and numerically compare this method with a sampling technique. The numerical test case is a well-known, difficult space shuttle reentry benchmark problem.", "paper_title": "A minima tracking variant of semi-infinite programming for the treatment of path constraints within direct solution of optimal control problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000263717600006"}
