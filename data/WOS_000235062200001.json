A decomposition method with wide applicability is Benders' decomposition, which has been applied to both stochastic programming as well as integer programming problems. However, this method of decomposition relies on convexity of the value function of linear programming subproblems. This paper is devoted to a class of problems in which the second-stage subproblem(s) may impose integer restrictions on some variables. The value function of such integer subproblem(s) is not convex, and new approaches must be designed. In this paper, we discuss alternative decomposition methods in which the second-stage integer subproblems are solved using branch-and-cut methods. One of the main advantages of our decomposition scheme is that Stochastic Mixed-Integer Programming (SMIP) problems can be solved by dividing a large problem into smaller MIP subproblems that can be solved in parallel. This paper lays the foundation for such decomposition methods for two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programs.", "paper_title": "Decomposition with branch-and-cut approaches for two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000235062200001"}
