It consists of four major steps: camera calibration, volumetric model reconstruction, surface modeling and texture mapping. A novel online scale factor estimation is developed to enhance the accuracy of the coplanar camera calibration. For the volumetric modeling, the voting-based shape-from-silhouette first generates a coarse model, which is then refined by the photo-consistency check using the novel 3D voxel mask. Our scheme can handle concave surface in a sophisticated way. Finally, the surface model is formed with the original images mapped. 3D models of some test objects are presented.", "paper_title": "Volumetric model reconstruction from unrestricted camera views based on the photo-consistency of 3D voxel mask", "paper_id": "WOS:000239729300003"}
