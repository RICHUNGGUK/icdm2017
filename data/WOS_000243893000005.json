The zero phase-field contour is used to implicitly track the sharp interface on a fixed grid. The phase-field propagation equation is derived from an interface advection equation by expressing the interface normal and curvature in terms of a hyperbolic tangent phase-field profile across the interface. In addition to normal interface motion driven by a given interface speed or by interface curvature, interface advection by an arbitrary external velocity field is also considered. In the absence of curvature-driven interface motion, a previously developed counter term is used in the phase-field equation to cancel out such motion. Various modifications of the phase-field equation, including nonlinear preconditioning, are also investigated. The accuracy of the present method is demonstrated in several numerical examples for a variety of interface motions and shapes that include singularities, such as sharp corners and topology changes. Good convergence with respect to the grid spacing is obtained. Mass conservation is achieved without the use of separate re-initialization schemes or Lagrangian marker particles. Similarities with and differences to other interface tracking approaches are emphasized. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
