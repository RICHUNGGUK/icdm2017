A thorough understanding of the characteristics of IEEE 802.11 DCF is therefore a research focus. DCF assumes the binary exponential backoff algorithm (BEBA) [D. Bertsekas, R. Gallager, Data Networks, Prentice Hall, 1992]. Several existing models that characterize BEBA as a p-persistent scheme have ignored several subtle protocol details. This has practically constrained the models from being applied in a broader range of configurations, e.g., small contention window, and from being further extended, e.g., 802.11e EDCA. In this paper, we develop an analytical model that captures the subtlety, and faithfully describes the channel activities as governed by DCF. Based on the devised model, we perform a rigorous analysis on the saturation throughput performance in a single-hop WLAN. We show that the stochastic property of the backoff time, r, may substantially impact the system performance. For example, setting the range of r to [1, CW] instead of [0, CW-1], can degrade the system throughput considerably. We also identify, by clearly defining and thus being able to differentiate the two terms, attempt probability and transmission probability, an erroneous extension made to Bianchi's model [G. Bianchi, Performance analysis of the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function, IEEE JSAC, 18(3) (2000) 535-547]. All the findings are corroborated by ns-2 simulation. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
