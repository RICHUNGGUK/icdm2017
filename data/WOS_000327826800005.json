Many studies show that network coding can improve flow throughput only if an appropriate routing algorithm is used to identify paths with coding opportunities. Nevertheless, a good routing mechanism is very difficult to develop. Existing solutions either do not estimate the path bandwidth precisely enough or cannot identify the best path in some situations. In this paper, we describe our coding-aware routing protocol that provides a better path bandwidth estimate and is able to identify high throughput paths. Extensive NS2 simulations show that our protocol outperforms existing mechanisms. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
