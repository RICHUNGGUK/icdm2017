The adaptation of content, for various network and terminal capabilities - as well as for different user preferences, is a key feature that needs to be investigated. Current state-of-the art research of the adaptation shows promising results for specific tasks and limited types of content, but is still not well-suited for massive heterogeneous environments. In this research, we present a method for transmitting adapted three-dimensional content to multiple target devices. This paper presents some theoretical and practical methods for adapting three-dimensional content, which includes shapes and animation. We also discuss practical details of the integration of our methods into MPEG-21 and MPEG-4 architectures.", "paper_title": "Device-based decision-making for adaptation of three-dimensional content", "paper_id": "WOS:000237468500006"}
