Failure modes, however, rely only on specific components rather than the system architecture, and therefore could be reused in different FMEAs. A novel ontology-based method, to recognize and reuse specific failure modes in existing databases, is provided here, and a light weight tool is developed for this method. The method and the tool can also be used in other fields with similar scenarios.", "paper_title": "Ontology-Based Reuse of Failure Modes in Existing Databases for FMEA: Methodology and Tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000321467700018"}
