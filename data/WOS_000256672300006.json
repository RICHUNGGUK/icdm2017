We show that, when the provers are allowed to coordinate their behavior using a shared entangled quantum state, a perfect parallel repetition theorem holds in the following sense. The prover's optimal success probability for simultaneously playing a collection of XOR proof systems is exactly the product of the individual optimal success probabilities. This property is remarkable in view of the fact that, in the classical case (where the provers can only utilize classical information), it does not hold. The theorem is proved by analyzing parities of XOR proof systems using semidefinite programming techniques, which we then relate to parallel repetitions of XOR games via Fourier analysis.", "paper_title": "Perfect parallel repetition theorem for quantum XOR proof systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000256672300006"}
