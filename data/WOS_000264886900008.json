As the development and efficient usage of different architectures are highly dependent on the quality of their documentation, there is an evident need for practical means for AD evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a question framework for AD quality evaluation. The framework was developed in a joint study with industry and validated by the industry experts. This framework can be used as a practical tool for evaluating and further developing the quality of the AD within organisations.", "paper_title": "Question framework for architectural description quality evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000264886900008"}
