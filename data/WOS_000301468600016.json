However, the proxy cannot access the plaintext. Due to its transformation property, proxy re-encryption can be used in many applications, such as encrypted email forwarding. Some of these applications require that the underlying PRE scheme is CCA-secure and key-private. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing PRE schemes satisfy this security requirement in the standard model. In this paper, based on the 5-Extended Decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption and Decision Diffie-Hellman assumption, we propose the first- such PRE scheme, which solves an open problem left by Ateniese et al.
