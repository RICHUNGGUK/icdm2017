Each process of electric arc furnace steel making is assigned to be an agent, which works independently whilst coordinates and cooperates with other acquaintance agents. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is used to generate agents' knowledge bases. Contract net protocol is used as negotiation protocol in the proposed multi-agent system. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
