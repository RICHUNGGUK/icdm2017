Compared to previous methods, our approach is more simple and advantageous in eliminating visual seams that may exist in each tile of previous methods, especially to those samples that have elaborate features or distinct colors. Texture tiles generated by our approach can be regarded as single-colored tiles on each orthogonal direction border, which make them easier for tiling. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Synthesis texture by tiling s-tiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300043"}
