Moment invariants that are customized to the specific problem can be constructed by means of normalization. In this paper, we calculate general TRS (translation, rotation, and scaling) moment invariants for two-dimensional vector fields. As an example, we show explicitly how to customize the result for the detection of flow field patterns. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.
