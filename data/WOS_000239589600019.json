We then introduce a graphical model for harmonization of melodies that considers every structural components in chord notation. We show empirically that root notes progressions exhibit global dependencies that can be better captured with a tree structure related to the meter than with a simple dynamical HMM that concentrates on local dependencies. However, a local model seems to be sufficient for generating proper harmonizations when root notes progressions are provided. The trained probabilistic models can be sampled to generate very interesting chord progressions given other polyphonic music components such as melody or root note progressions.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic melodic harmonization", "paper_id": "WOS:000239589600019"}
