We present an optimal O(n log n) algorithm for minimizing the maximum earliness on a single machine with job rejection. Our algorithm also solves the bi-criteria scheduling problem is which the objective is to simultaneously minimize the maximum earliness of the scheduled jobs and the total rejection cost of the rejected jobs. We also show that the optimal pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for the total tardiness problem with job rejection can be used to solve the corresponding total earliness problem with job rejection.
