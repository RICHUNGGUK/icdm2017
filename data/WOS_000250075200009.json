We examine the workflow in container transportation and then develop mathematical models integrating the various operating and design characteristics of the containers. Several types of formulations are developed utilizing the standard formulations of well known TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) and VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem). Heuristic algorithms are also presented to solve the models. An example problem is illustrated to explain how to apply the models to the real world through the data set collected from a container trucking company in Korea. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
