This is important both for artistic purposes and viewing comfort, but is tedious or even intractable to achieve manually. We analyse typical features of real hand-colored animations and propose an algorithm that tries to mimic them using only static examples of drawing media. We apply the algorithm to various animations using different drawing media and compare the quality of synthetic results with real artwork. To verify our method perceptually, we conducted experiments confirming that our method delivers distinguishable noise levels and reduces eye strain. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of our method to mask imperfections such as shower-door artifacts.", "paper_title": "Color Me Noisy: Example-based Rendering of Hand-colored Animations with Temporal Noise Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000340598800001"}
