We present an approach to support individualized access to web contents from vehicular ad hoc networks, based on a virtualization layer that engages the mobile nodes in collaboration to emulate a reliable infrastructure of stationary virtual nodes. We prove by simulation experiments that this approach achieves better performance than reference works in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
