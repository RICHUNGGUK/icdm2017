We take into account disparity, motion in depth, motion on the screen plane, and the spatial frequency of luminance contrast. We further derive a comfort metric to predict the comfort of short stereoscopic videos. We validate it on both controlled scenes and real videos available on the internet, and show how all the factors we take into account, as well as their interactions, affect viewing comfort. Last, we propose various applications that can benefit from our comfort measurements and metric.", "paper_title": "A Metric of Visual Comfort for Stereoscopic Motion", "paper_id": "WOS:000326923200066"}
