Major issues of the project were: (1) managing numerous physicians spread nationwide; (2) tracking and storing the physician's entire process (from his/her enrolment to his/her lifelong follow-up); (3) creating a collaborative technique for processing an evaluation program; (4) enhancing exchanges between participants; (5) proposing effective implementation of the assessment. Methods: As faculty members with experience in distance learning, we considered the digital/electronic portfolio to be one of the most suitable techniques to support such a project. Due to the lack of methods and tools to meet users' expectations, the decision was made to prototype a new and innovative assessment environment. A team was formed to complete the design phase within 6 months (information content, roles and functions). Implementation of the prototype, which includes tests, was also planned over a 6-month period. The methodology involves two approaches: one concerns business process modelling; the other is related to object-oriented methods for design and implementation. Results: This primary work was aimed at describing a specific object, the evaluation program, which can be shared between players within a web-based collaborative platform. Four types of players were identified: (1) physicians enrolled into the assessment program; (2) tutors assigned to follow physicians' assessment process; (3) program directors who manage the content of the assessment program and the application of follow-up rules; (4) supervisors who administrate the global system. The evaluation program is composed of a set of actions, which has to be performed by the physicians. These actions are directly related to the activities of the business processes to which the candidate belongs. For each action, elements of proof have to be uploaded by the physician, according to a predefined schedule. The status of this object and its changes are followed and managed by a workflow engine. Implementation of the system required an object-oriented content management system (Zope/Plone). Conclusion: The object-oriented approach helped us to focus on the topic of interest, the assessment program, without being concerned by the whole environment.
