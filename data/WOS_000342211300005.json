In order to enhance the data retrieval process, current infrastructures usually offer a catalog service. Nevertheless, such catalog services still have important limitations that make it difficult for users to find the geospatial data that they are interested in. Some current catalog drawbacks include the use of a single record to describe all the feature types offered by a service, the lack of formal means to describe the semantics of the underlying data, and the lack of an effective ranking metric to organize the results retrieved from a query. Aiming to overcome these limitations, this article proposes SESDI (Semantically-Enabled Spatial Data Infrastructures), which is framework that reuses techniques of classic information retrieval to improve geographic data retrieval in a SDI. Moreover, the framework proposes several ranking metrics to solve spatial, semantic, temporal and multidimensional queries.", "paper_title": "Improving geographic information retrieval in spatial data infrastructures", "paper_id": "WOS:000342211300005"}
