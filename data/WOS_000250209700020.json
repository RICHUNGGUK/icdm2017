Vortex method calculations were accelerated by the use of a fast multipole method for periodic boundary conditions. The core spreading method and particle strength exchange were selected as the viscous diffusion scheme. The effect of spatial resolution was examined along with Reynolds number dependence and the effect of spatial adaption of elements. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
