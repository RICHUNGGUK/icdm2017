The proposed approach shows that much better results are achieved if the distance between the pattern of frame-wise distances of two gesture sequences with a third (anchor) sequence from the modelbase is considered. Such a measure is called as conditional distance and these distance pattern are referred to as \"warp vectors\". If these warp vectors are similar, then so are the sequences; if not, they are dissimilar. At the algorithmic core, there are two dynamic time warping processes, one to compute the warp vectors with the anchor sequences and the other to compare these warp vectors. In order to reduce the complexity a speedup strategy is proposed by pre-selecting \"good\" anchor sequences. Conditional distance is used for individual and sentence level gesture matching. Both single and multiple subject datasets are used. Experiments show improved performance above 82% spanning 179 classes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
