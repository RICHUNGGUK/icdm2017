Since the active suspension system has nonlinear and time-varying characteristics, it is difficult to establish an accurate dynamic model for designing a model-based controller. Here, a functional approximation (FA) based adaptive sliding controller with fuzzy compensation is proposed for an active suspension system. The FA technique is employed to represent the unknown functions, which releases the model-based requirement of the sliding mode control. In addition, a fuzzy control scheme with online learning ability is employed to compensate for the modeling error of the FA with finite number of terms for reducing the implementation difficulty. To guarantee the control system stability, the update laws of the coefficients in the approximation function and the fuzzy tuning parameters are derived from the Lyapunov theorem. The proposed controller is employed on a quarter-car active suspension system. The simulation results and experimental results show that the proposed controller can suppress the oscillation amplitude of the sprung mass effectively. To evaluate the performance improvement of inducing a fuzzy compensator in this FA adaptive controller, the dynamic responses of the proposed hybrid controller are compared with those of FA-based adaptive sliding controller only.", "paper_title": "New model-free adaptive sliding controller for active suspension system", "paper_id": "WOS:000251516400006"}
