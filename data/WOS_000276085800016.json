It can be considered as an improvement of the classical nearest neighbor classification rules. Besides the concept of neighbors, the notion of district, a larger set into which the data will be projected, is introduced. Then a one-dimensional kNN method is applied to the projected data on randomly selected directions. This method, which is more accurate to handle high-dimensional data, has some robustness properties. The procedure is also universally consistent. Moreover, the method is challenged with the Isolet data set where a very high classification score is obtained. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
