Radio resource allocation is the technique that assigns to each user in the system a subset of the available radio resources (mainly power and bandwidth) according to a certain optimality criterion on the basis of the experienced link quality. In this paper we address the problem of resource allocation in the downlink of a multi-cellular OFDMA system. The allocation problem is formulated with the goal of minimizing the transmitted power subject to individual rate constraint for each user. Exact and heuristic algorithms are proposed for the both the single-cell and the multi-cell scenario. In particular, we show that in the single-cell scenario the allocation problem can be efficiently solved following a network flow approach. In the multi-cell scenario we assume that all cells use the same frequencies and therefore the allocation problem is complicated by the presence of strong multiple access interference. We prove that the problem is strongly NP-hard, and we present an exact approach based on an MILP formulation. We also propose two heuristic algorithms designed to be simple and fast. All algorithms are tested and evaluated through an experimental campaign on simulated instances. Experimental results show that, although suboptimal, a Lagrangian-based heuristic consisting in solving a series of minimum network cost flow problems is attractive for practical implementation, both for the quality of the solutions and for the small computational times.
