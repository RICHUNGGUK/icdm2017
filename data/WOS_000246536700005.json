A discrepancy between numerical and experimental data was observed near the stall regime for the airfoil NACA64(A)-006 which is a thin airfoil stall type. The reason of this discrepancy and one possible way for improvement of the numerical model are discussed here. It is shown that the use of the Baldwin-Lomax model in the RANS region improves the DES results in this case. If the relevant factors (grid density, time step, turbulence model, etc.) are appropriately taken into account, the DES approach could reliably predict stall aerodynamical characteristics.
