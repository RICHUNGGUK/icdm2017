Based on the structural analysis of fuzzy sets, we present an \"isotropism\" assumption. Under this assumption we achieved the following insights: (1) the uniqueness of a fuzzy measure being isotropic on a finite complete semi-ordered set; (2) the necessary and sufficient condition of the isomorphism for fuzzy measure functions in fuzzy mathematics; (3) the necessary and sufficient condition that fuzzy measures have fuzzy and granular monotonicity; (4) under a certain assumption, the analytic expression for fuzzy measures. The results clarify the relationship between fuzzy measures and granular computing, reveal the essence of fuzzy measures, and provide a simple way of constructing fuzzy measures.", "paper_title": "The structural analysis of fuzzy measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000286497800004"}
