This paper describes the basic Flooding Peer-to-Peer network search method, followed by analysis of several new search methods pros and cons, and then further analysis of these algorithms is proposed based on a cache-based search algorithm: When a node of the remaining load capacity is high, it will become the center node, and form a joint topology area with the nearby nodes together, then the center node and ordinary nodes also need to store the index cache, at the local region the overheating resources will be copied to the local (that is, the contents cache). The simulation shows that the algorithm can effectively improve the hit rates of resources searching, reduce the query delay.", "paper_title": "A cache-based search algorithm in unstructured P2P networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000311507600004"}
