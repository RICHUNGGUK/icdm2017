On one hand, fuzzy scheme takes into account discrete and continuous classes through the modeling of hidden data imprecision and on the other hand, Markovian Bayesian scheme models the uncertainty on the observed data. A non-stationary fuzzy Markov chain model is proposed in an unsupervised way, based on a recent Markov triplet approach. The method is compared with the stationary fuzzy Markovian chain model. Both stationary and non-stationary methods are enriched with a parameterized joint density, which governs the attractiveness of the neighbored states. Segmentation task is processed with Bayesian tools, such as the well known MPM (Mode of Posterior Marginals) criterion. To validate both models, we perform and compare the segmentation on synthetic images and raw optical patterns which present diffuse structures. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
