Design/methodology/approach - Survey data collected from 497 mobile value-added service consumers were examined using structural equation modeling to validate the research model. Findings - The results indicate that the mobile service attributes of personalization, identifiability, and perceived enjoyment have significant positive influences on the key brand equity factors, including brand loyalty, perceived quality, brand awareness, and brand associations. Additionally, the results confirm the significance of all four of the brand equity factors in interpreting consumer purchase intention in the context of mobile value-added service consumption. Practical implications - The research results provide insights into how mobile value-added services may be better designed and delivered to enhance brand equity and, in turn, profits. Originality/value - While the market potential of mobile value-added services and the importance of brand equity have both been widely recognized, the development and empirical validation of a model that specifically depicts the determinants of mobile value-added service consumption from a brand-equity perspective has not yet been undertaken. Consequently, this study investigates the relationships among key m-commerce attributes, core brand-equity components, and consumer behaviors. The research results have extended the application and advanced the understanding of previous mobile-commerce and brand-equity theories in the context of mobile value-added service consumption.", "paper_title": "Factors influencing mobile services adoption: a brand-equity perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000303299600002"}
