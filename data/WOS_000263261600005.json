The proposed scheme takes advantage of frequency diversity to dynamically allocate a suitable number of bits/per symbol on subcarriers of each user based on the transmitting objectives such as the required transmission rate and BER. A suboptimal solution to the problem of the bit allocation on subcarriers for each user is derived by minimizing the interference power from each user. Then an algorithm for adjusting the number of allocated bits is used to further reduce the interference without changing the total transmitted data rate. The performance obtained by minimizing the interference resulting from each user is studied in terms of BER, transmission data rate and the system capacity supporting multiple users. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms those reported previously.", "paper_title": "New adaptive bit allocation algorithms for multiuser OFDM/CDMA systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000263261600005"}
