This enables CDU part of the planning models to be as accurate as the RTO models, instead of using standard CDU modes of operation. The model includes mass and energy balances and statistical models relating crude distillation curve points, tower operating variables and tray temperatures to product distillation curves. Hybrid model of a sample CDU shows excellent agreement with property predictions from the rigorous model; RMSE of points on the product distillation curves is typically less than 0.5% of the rigorous model predictions. Optimization of the hybrid model via SLP converged to a better point than equation-oriented AspenPlus. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
