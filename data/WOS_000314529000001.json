These quantities are of interest in recently-popular problems such as matrix completion and Nystrom-based low-rank matrix approximation as well as in large-scale statistical data analysis applications more generally; moreover, they are of interest since they define the key structural nonuniformity that must be dealt with in developing fast randomized matrix algorithms. Our main result is a randomized algorithm that takes as input an arbitrary n x d matrix A, with n >> d, and that returns as output relative-error approximations to a l l n of the statistical leverage scores. The proposed algorithm runs (under assumptions on the precise values of n and d) in O(nd log n) time, as opposed to the O (n d 2) time required by the naive algorithm that involves computing an orthogonal basis for the range of A. Our analysis may be viewed in terms of computing a relative-error approximation to an under constrained least-squares approximation problem, or, relatedly, it may be viewed as an application of Johnson-Lindenstrauss type ideas. Several practically-important extensions of our basic result are also described, including the approximation of so-called cross-leverage scores, the extension of these ideas to matrices with n approximate to d, and the extension to streaming environments.", "paper_title": "Fast Approximation of Matrix Coherence and Statistical Leverage", "paper_id": "WOS:000314529000001"}
