Some examples of real-time processing of 2D and 3D images are described. In particular, we discuss the noise model and objective criteria that can be applied to characterize the performance of the processing algorithms. Several proposed algorithms based on RM approach are compared with other known ones, demonstrating the advantages in noise suppressing and preservation of fine image details and edges. A number of 2D and 3D image denoising filters are implemented on DSP, realizing real-time mode in the image processing. The performances of the proposed processing algorithms and the known ones are discussed and evaluated here.", "paper_title": "Real-time 2D-3D filtering using order statistics based algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000208118600002"}
