The support flow and the correspondence measure between nodes are defined and estimated by analyzing the distribution of the attribute vectors in the relation vector space. And then the candidate subgraphs are extracted and ordered according to the correspondence measure. Missing nodes for each candidates are identified by the iterative voting scheme through an error analysis, and then the final subgraph matching is carried out effectively by excluding them. Experimental results on the synthetic ARGs demonstrate that the proposed SARG matching algorithm is quite robust and efficient even in the noisy environment. Comparative evaluation results also show that it gives superior performance compared to other conventional graph matching approaches.", "paper_title": "A novel stochastic attributed relational graph matching based on relation vector space analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100089"}
