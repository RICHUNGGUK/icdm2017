The measurement noise and imperfections in mathematical modeling are treated as Gaussian white noise processes. The system states are augmented by response gradients with respect to system parameters and an extended set of equations in the state space is formulated. These equations are cast in the form of Ito's stochastic differential equations and measured data are assimilated into this model using Monte Carlo based Bayesian filtering tools. Illustrative examples include a few low dimensional dynamical systems with cubic and hereditary nonlinearities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
