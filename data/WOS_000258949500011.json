It utilizes current density vector measurements which can be made using a magnetic resonance imager (MRI) (Scott et al, 1991). CDII is based on a simple mathematical expression for del sigma/sigma = del ln sigma, the gradient of the logarithm of the conductivity sigma at each point in a region where two current density vectors J(1) and J(2) have been measured and J(1) x J(2) not equal 0. From the calculated del ln sigma and a priori knowledge of the conductivity at the boundary, the logarithm of the conductivity In or is integrated by two different methods to produce an image of the conductivity or in the region of interest. The CDII technique was tested on three different conductivity phantoms. Much emphasis has been placed on the experimental validation of CDII results against direct bench measurements by commercial LCR meters before and after CDII was performed.", "paper_title": "Current density impedance imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000258949500011"}
