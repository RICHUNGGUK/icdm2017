A 3-quasigroup is called 2-idempotent if it satisfies the generalized idempotent law: q(x, x, y) = q(x, y, x) = q(y, x, x) = y. A conjugation of a 3-quasigroup, considered as an OA(3, 4, n), (N, B), is a permutation of the coordinate positions applied to the 4-tuples of B. The subgroup of conjugations under which (N, B) is invariant is called the conjugate invariant subgroup of (N, B). In this paper, we will complete the existence proof of the last undetermined infinite class of 2-idempotent 3-quasigroups of order n, n 1 (mod 4) and n > 9, with a conjugate invariant subgroup consisting of a single cycle of length four.", "paper_title": "2-idempotent 3-quasigroups with a conjugate invariant subgroup consisting of a single cycle of length four", "paper_id": "WOS:000254957800005"}
