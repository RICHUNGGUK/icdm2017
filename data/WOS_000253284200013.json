We consider the class of simple Parry numbers such that d(beta)(1)=0.k(1)(d - 1)k(d) with d is an element of N, d >= 2 and k(1 >=)k(d)>= 1. We prove that these elements define Rauzy fractals that are stable under a central symmetry. We use this result to compute, for several cases of cubic Pisot units, the maximal length among the lengths of the finite beta-fractional parts of sums of two beta-integers, denoted by L-circle plus. In particular, we prove that L-circle plus=5 in the Tribonacci case.", "paper_title": "Computation of L-circle plus for several cubic Pisot numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000253284200013"}
