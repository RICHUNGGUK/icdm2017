The reliance on this biochemical knowledge has the drawback that some of the assumptions (specific kinetics of the reaction system, unknown dynamics and values of the model parameters) may not be valid for all the metabolic possible states of the network. In this uncertainty context, the combined use of fundamental knowledge and data measured in the fermentation that describe the behaviour of the microorganism in the manufacturing process is paramount to overcome this problem. In this paper, a grey modelling approach is presented combining data-driven and first principles information at different scales, developed for Pichia pastoris cultures grown on different carbon sources. This approach will allow us to relate patterns of recombinant protein production to intracellular metabolic states and correlate intra and extracellular reactions in order to understand how the internal state of the cells determines the observed behaviour in P. pastoris cultivations.
