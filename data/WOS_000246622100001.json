Czumaj et al. [A. Czumaj, C. Sohler, M. Ziegler, Testing Euclidean Minimum Spanning Trees in the plane, Unpublished, Part II of ESA 2000 paper, downloaded from http://web.njit.edu/similar to czumaj/] gave a 1-sided-error non-adaptive property-tester for this task of query complexity (O) over tilde(root n). We show that every non-adaptive (not necessarily 1-sided-error) property-tester for this task has a query complexity of Omega(root n), implying that the test in [A. Czumaj, C. Sohler, M. Ziegler, Testing Euclidean Minimum Spanning Trees in the plane, Unpublished, Part 11 of ESA 2000 paper, downloaded from http://web.njit.edu/similar to czumaj/] is of asymptotically optimal complexity. We further prove that every adaptive property-tester has query complexity of Omega(n(1/3)). Those lower bounds hold even when the input graph is promised to be a bounded degree tree.
