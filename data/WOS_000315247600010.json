In the FE model, elements of the order of I mm in size are employed. The concrete is simulated using the orthogonal fixed smeared crack model while the FRP and the adhesive are treated as linear brittle-cracking materials. The FE model is calibrated and verified using results of well-documented bonded joint tests. Using the verified FE model, the failure process of NSM FRP strip-to-concrete bonded joints is carefully studied; furthermore, the local bond stress distributions and the bond-slip relationships are extracted and analyzed. This 3-D meso-scale FE model offers a powerful tool for deployment in further investigations to establish bond-slip models and bond strength models for NSM FRP strip-to-concrete bonded interfaces. While the present study is focused on NSM FRP strips, the proposed modeling approach is generally applicable to NSM FRP bars of other cross-sectional shapes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
