It can be used to integrate topology optimization into CAD/CAM manufacturing systems, and that is indeed the main motivation of the work. The software is very versatile and allows to solve the interoperability issue between numeric is the IGES translator code lacking in most used numerical computation software packages.", "paper_title": "Integration of topology optimized designs into CAD/CAM via an IGES translator", "paper_id": "WOS:000349395800013"}
