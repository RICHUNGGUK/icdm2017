Editors have not been alone in this endeavour, other actors in the information chain have also played their part. This article aims to examine the databases (indexing and abstracting services, directories, catalogues and electronic journal portals) produced in Latin America between 1970 and 2009. Design/methodology/approach - The paper begins with an historical review of the relevant regional initiatives and leads up to an assessment of the present day situation by analysing the contribution made by the databases in the identification, register, visibility, access and use of Latin American scholarly journals. Findings - The creation of Latin American databases has improved communication and knowledge on publications in the region as useful additions to the scant information provided by international sources. The recent adherence to the principles of the Open Access movement has also potentially improved the visibility and access to publications from the region. Originality/value - This is the first study to analyse the development of Latin American databases over a period of some 40 years.", "paper_title": "Latin American scholarly journal databases: a look back to the way forward", "paper_id": "WOS:000299980600003"}
