Being different from the traditional VOF methods that require a geometrical reconstruction and identify the interface by a discontinuous Heaviside function, the present method makes use of the hyperbolic tangent function (known as one of the sigmoid type functions) in the tangent of hyperbola interface capturing (THINC) method [F. Xiao, Y. Honma, K. Kono, A simple algebraic interface capturing scheme using hyperbolic tangent function, Int. J. Numer. Methods Fluids 48 (2005) 1023-1040] to retrieve the interface in an algebraic way from the volume-fraction data of multi-component materials. Instead of the 1D reconstruction in the original THINC method, a multi-dimensional hyperbolic tangent function is employed in the present new approach. The present scheme resolves moving interface with geometric faithfulness and compact thickness, and has at least the following advantages: (1) the geometric reconstruction is not required in constructing piecewise approximate functions; (2) besides a piecewise linear interface, curved (quadratic) surface can be easily constructed as well; and (3) the continuous multi-dimensional hyperbolic tangent function allows the direct calculations of derivatives and normal vectors. Numerical benchmark tests including transport of moving interface and incompressible interfacial flows are presented to validate the numerical accuracy for interface capturing and to show the capability for practical problems such as a stationary circular droplet, a drop oscillation, a shear-induced drop deformation and a rising bubble.
