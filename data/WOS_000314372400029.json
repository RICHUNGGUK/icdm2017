One important effect that can be modeled in potential flow is the blade-tower interaction. This paper focuses on how tower interference may be modeled for upwind-oriented turbines. A review of 2D and 3D models is given, and an incorrect formulation in a previously implemented 3D model is identified. A generalized and correct 3D model is proposed, and compared to two commonly used 2D models. The models are compared in terms of stagnation point location, and induced velocity. The vertical velocity component near the top of the tower is analyzed for the 3D model. The 3D model is contrasted with the 2D model in terms of the computational requirements, implementation and induced velocity field. Conclusions are drawn regarding the relevance of 3D modeling in the tower top region. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
