Such systems inherently consist of a large number of components, which operate in a large shared state space interacting with it in highly dynamic and unpredictable ways. Optimising access to the shared state space is crucial for achieving efficient simulation executions. Data accesses may take two forms: locating data according to a set of attribute value ranges (range query) or locating a particular state variable from the given identifier (ID query and update). This paper proposes two alternative routing approaches, namely the address-based approach, which locates data according to their address information, and the range-based approach, whose operation is based on looking up attribute value range information along the paths to the destinations. The two algorithms are discussed and analysed in the context of PDES-MAS, a framework for the distributed simulation of multi-agent systems, which uses a hierarchical infrastructure to manage the shared state space. The paper introduces a generic meta-simulation framework which is used to perform a quantitative comparative analysis of the proposed algorithms under various circumstances. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
