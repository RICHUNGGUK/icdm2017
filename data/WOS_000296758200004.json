This method is more than competitive in terms of computational times and size of the instances that have been optimally solved. In particular, problems of a size larger than the largest ones considered in the literature up to now are solved exactly in this paper.", "paper_title": "Solving Large p-Median Problems with a Radius Formulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000296758200004"}
