However, the variety of feature contributions, which exerts different saliency on recognition, is usually ignored. This paper proposes a new sparse facial feature description model based on salience evaluation of regions and features, which not only considers the contributions of different face regions, but also distinguishes that of different features in the same region. Specifically, the structured sparse learning scheme is employed as the salience evaluation method to encourage sparsity at both the group and individual levels for balancing regions and features. Therefore, the new facial feature description model is obtained by combining the salience evaluation method with region-based features. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves better performance with much lower feature dimensionality.", "paper_title": "New Sparse Facial Feature Description Model Based on Salience Evaluation of Regions and Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000357830200010"}
