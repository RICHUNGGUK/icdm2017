At the core of the push for mobile broadband convergence is a user-centric model for next-generation networks that are envisioned to provide an array services \"anytime, anywhere\" reliably and cost-effectively. Solutions for this problem will undoubtedly require a cross-layer approach that considers everything from physical layer parameters, to scheduling and routing protocols. In this paper, we focus on heterogeneous fixed broadband topologies and study physical-layer convergence of optical and wireless networks. We adopt a point-to-point architecture and present a performance analysis of a multiple-input, multiple output (MIMO) hybrid RF/optical wireless system that implements the physical layer of the IEEE 802.16d WiMAX standard. The key technique of interest is multi-subcarrier modulation of OFDM signals on the optical carrier. Average power efficiency, atmospheric turbulence, adaptive modulation, receiver noise, as well as cross-layer protocol design are considered. Expressions for average symbol error rate are derived and evaluated to determine system performance. We thus assess optical wireless technology as a potential distributor of WiMAX traffic and highlight the MIMO advantage in such a hybrid system.", "paper_title": "A MIMO architecture for IEEE 802.16d (WiMAX) heterogeneous wireless access using optical wireless technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000238120800040"}
