Computer-Aided Design 2008;40(3):381-95] is a fast surface flattening approach, which presents a very important property of length-preservation on feature curves. The global scheme of WireWarping formulates the warping problem into an optimization in angle space and solves it by using Newton's method. However, some diverging examples were found in our recent tests. This technical note presents a least-norm solution in terms of angle-error for the global WireWarping. The experimental tests show that the least-norm solution is more robust than the Newton's algorithm. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
