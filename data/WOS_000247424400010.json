An overview of the newly proposed immersed continuum method in conjunction with the traditional immersed boundary method will also be presented. As a key ingredient of the fully implicit time integration, a matrix-free combination of Newton-Raphson iteration and GMRES iterative linear solver is proposed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
