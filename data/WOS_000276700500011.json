Firstly, EEG signals are represented as third order tensors in the spatial-spectral-temporal domain by wavelet transform. Then, a regularized tensor discriminant analysis (RTDA) algorithm is proposed for a multi-way discriminative subspace extraction from tensor-represented EEG data. Unlike the conventional wavelet transform method, the proposed scheme includes the structural information in multi-channel time-varying EEG spectrums endorsed by tensor representation, and improves the performance for EEG classification. Compared with the common spatial pattern (CSP, the most successful algorithm in BCI) in the applications to two classes of datasets, the proposed scheme has the following advantages: (1) an optimal multi-way discriminative subspace can be extracted, obtaining significant spatial-spectral-temporal patterns for EEG classification; (2) the proposed scheme can identify discriminative characteristics robustly, and works well without prior neurophysiologic knowledge. This is a valuable property for developing new paradigms in BCI whose discriminative neural correlates are not known and (3) the proposed scheme is able to find the most significant channels for classification, and can be applied to channel selection in BCI. Computer simulations show that the number of used channels can be reduced to 2 in two datasets with very little loss in performance. Therefore, it has great potential for the practical application of BCI. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
