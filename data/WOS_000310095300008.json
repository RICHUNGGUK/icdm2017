A subset D subset of V is a distance k-dominating set of G if for every u is an element of V. there exists a vertex v is an element of D such that d(G)(u, v) <= k, where d(G)(u, v) is the distance between u and v in G. A set D subset of V is a distance k-paired-dominating set of G if D is a distance k-dominating set and the induced subgraph G[D] contains a perfect matching. Given a graph G = (V, E) and a fixed integer k > 0, the MIN DISTANCE k-PAIRED-DOM SET problem is to find a minimum cardinality distance k-paired-dominating set of G. In this paper, we show that the decision version of MIN DISTANCE k-PAIRED-DOM SET iS NP-complete for undirected path graphs. This strengthens the complexity of decision version Of MIN DISTANCE k-PAIRED-DOM SET problem in chordal graphs. We show that for a given graph G, unless NP subset of DTIME (n(0)((log) (log) (n)) MIN DISTANCE k-PAIRED-Dom SET problem cannot be approximated within a factor of (1 -epsilon ) In n for any epsilon > 0, where n is the number of vertices in G. We also show that MIN DISTANCE k-PAIRED-DOM SET problem is APX-complete for graphs with degree bounded by 3. On the positive side, we present a linear time algorithm to compute the minimum cardinality of a distance k-paired-dominating set of a strongly chordal graph G if a strong elimination ordering of G is provided. We show that for a given graph G, MIN DISTANCE k-PAIRED-DOM SET problem can be approximated with an approximation factor of 1 + In 2 + k . In(Delta(G)), where Delta(G) denotes the maximum degree of G.
