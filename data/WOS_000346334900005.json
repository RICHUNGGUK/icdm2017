Project planners face complicated multivariate, time-cost-resource optimization (TCRO) problems, which require simultaneous minimization of total project duration and total project cost, while considering issues related to optimal resource allocation and leveling. The authors present a shuffled frog-leaping model to solve complex TCRO problems in construction project planning. The proposed model is different from existing optimization models in construction project planning. The proposed shuffled frog-leaping model considers the simultaneous optimization of three important objective functions in project planning: (1) minimizing total project duration, (2) total project cost, and (3) total variation of resource allocation. This model finds optimal Pareto fronts of project planning solutions in the three-dimensional space of total project duration, total project cost, and total variation of resource allocation. The proposed model is flexible to allow for activity splitting in project planning. Project activities can be interrupted and project resources can be reallocated to find more appropriate project planning solutions. The shuffled frog-leaping model is applied to solve two optimization problems, which are found in the construction project planning literature. It is shown that the proposed shuffled frog-leaping model is superior to the existing optimization algorithms to find better project planning solutions with less total project duration, less total project cost, and less total variation of resource allocation.
