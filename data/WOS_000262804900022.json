Several new sufficient conditions are presented to ensure global exponential stability of delayed bi-directional associative memory neural networks based on the Lyapunov functional method as well as linear matrix inequality technique. To the best of our knowledge, few reports about such \"linearization\" approach to exponential stability analysis for delayed neural network models have been presented in literature. The method, called parameterized first-order model transformation, is used to transform neural networks. The obtained conditions show to be less conservative and restrictive than that reported in the literature. Two numerical simulations are also given to illustrate the efficiency of our result.
