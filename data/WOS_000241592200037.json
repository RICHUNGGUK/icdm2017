A generalized Rake receiver for Spreading-IFDMA is proposed in this paper, which combines jointly derepetition, equalization, and de-spreading processing. Similar to the conventional CDMA systems, the guard interval in Spreading-IFDMA symbols is not necessary, which means that spectrum efficiency can be further improved over IFDMA systems. With digital simulations and performance analysis, the proposed generalized Rake receiver demonstrates better BER performance, robustness, and lower computational complexity.", "paper_title": "Generalized rake receiver for spreading-IFDMA systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241592200037"}
