This paper presents a new open source software system, the sorted pulse data software library (SPDLib), that provides a processing framework based on an implementation of a new file format for the storage of discrete-return and waveform LiDAR data from terrestrial, airborne and space borne platforms. A python binding and a visualisation tool (SPD Points Viewer), which build on top of the SPDLib and SPD file format have also been provided. The software and source code have recently been made freely available and can be accessed online through an open source code repository. Future developments will focus on the development of advanced waveform processing functionality and optimising 10 performance.
