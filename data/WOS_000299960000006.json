Using absorptive capacity theory and data envelopment analysis, we view organizational transformation in Enterprise Resource Planning absorption as an economic production process. Despite converging Enterprise Resource Planning saturation levels, the data identifies gaps in absorption levels and performance. Organizations in transition face greater challenges, engage more in phased Enterprise Resource Planning absorptions, and expect higher levels of external support.", "paper_title": "Contrasting ERP Absorption Between Transition and Developed Economies From Central and Eastern Europe (CEE)", "paper_id": "WOS:000299960000006"}
