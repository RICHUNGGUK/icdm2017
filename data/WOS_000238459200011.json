An interesting property of this approach is that it constitutes a practical implementation of the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle that aims at minimizing a bound on the generalization error of a model, rather than minimizing the mean square error over control points. Computer simulation results indicate that this new approach can remove geometric deformation and adapt to correct the errors induced by inaccuracy location of control points. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
