Narrowing has been widely used in different contexts, ranging from theorem proving (e.g., protocol verification) to language design (e.g., it forms the basis of functional logic languages). Surprisingly, the termination of narrowing has been mostly overlooked. In this work, we present a novel approach for analyzing the termination of narrowing in left-linear constructor systems-a widely accepted class of systems-that allows us to reuse existing methods in the literature on termination of rewriting.", "paper_title": "Termination of narrowing via termination of rewriting", "paper_id": "WOS:000275892000001"}
