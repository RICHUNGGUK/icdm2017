Most existing modeling techniques are deficient in successfully addressing many aspects in terms of the application of realistic forces on the movement of mobile nodes (MNs), the interaction of MNs within a group, and collision avoidance within a group and with environmental obstacles. The results obtained through experiments show that in terms of connectivity metrics, such as link duration, BFBIGM performs around 50% better in comparison to the popular existing mobility models like Random Waypoint (RWP) Model (Johnson et al. in Ad hoc networking, Addison-Wesley, Menlo Park, pp. 139-172,2001) and the Reference Point Group Mobility (RPGM) Model (Hong et al. in: Proceedings of the 2nd ACM international workshop on modeling, analysis and simulation of wireless and mobile systems, Seattle, WA, pp. 53-60,1999).", "paper_title": "Bio-inspired group mobility model for mobile ad hoc networks based on bird-flocking behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000300245700009"}
