However, the k-means algorithm is developed for numerical data only. It is not suitable for the clustering of non-numerical data. K-modes algorithm has been developed for clustering categorical objects by extending from the k-means algorithm. However, no one applies this technique for classification of categorical data. In this paper, the k-modes algorithm is introduced for the classification of categorical objects based on Soybean and Nursery databases. Especially, a genetic algorithm is proposed for designing the dissimilarity measure termed Genetic Distance Measure (GDM) such that the performance of the K-modes algorithm may be improved by 10% and 76% for Soybean and Nursery databases compared with the conventional k-modes algorithm.", "paper_title": "Genetic distance measure for K-modes algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000242255200004"}
