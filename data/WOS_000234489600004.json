A conversation is a global sequence of messages exchanged among peers participating in a composite Web service. Interestingly, conversation behavior differs significantly for synchronous and asynchronous communication, even if peers' local behaviors remain the same. The authors use synchronizability and realizability analysis techniques to analyze conversations in the presence of asynchronous communication. With these analyses, they can use model checking to automatically verify conversation behavior for bottom-up and top-down Web service specifications.", "paper_title": "Analyzing conversations of Web services", "paper_id": "WOS:000234489600004"}
