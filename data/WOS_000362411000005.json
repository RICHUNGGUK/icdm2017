In this paper, we analyze the scale-space behavior with the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) operator on a planar curve which constructs Laplacian Scale Space (LSS). The analytical expression of a Laplacian Scale-Space map (LSS map) is obtained, demonstrating the Laplacian Scale-Space behavior of the planar curve corners, based on a newly defined unified corner model. With this formula, some Laplacian Scale-Space behavior is summarized. Although LSS demonstrates some similarities to Curvature Scale Space (CSS), there are still some differences. First, no new extreme points are generated in the LSS. Second, the behavior of different cases of a corner model is consistent and simple. This makes it easy to trace the corner in a scale space. At last, the behavior of LSS is verified in an experiment on a digital curve.", "paper_title": "Laplacian Scale-Space Behavior of Planar Curve Corners", "paper_id": "WOS:000362411000005"}
