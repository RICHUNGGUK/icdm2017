While the need to integrate processes and role-based access control (RBAC) models has been repeatedly identified in research and practice, standard process modeling languages do not provide corresponding language elements. Objective: In this paper, we are concerned with the definition of an integrated approach for modeling processes and process-related RBAC models - including roles, role hierarchies, statically and dynamically mutual exclusive tasks, as well as binding of duty constraints on tasks. Method: We specify a formal metamodel for process-related RBAC models. Based on this formal model, we define a domain-specific extension for a standard modeling language. Results: Our formal metamodel is generic and can be used to extend arbitrary process modeling languages. To demonstrate our approach, we present a corresponding extension for UML2 activity models. The name of our extension is Business Activities. Moreover, we implemented a library and runtime engine that can manage Business Activity runtime models and enforce the different policies and constraints in a software system. Conclusion: The definition of process-related RBAC models at the modeling-level is an important prerequisite for the thorough implementation and enforcement of corresponding policies and constraints in a software system. We identified the need for modeling support of process-related RBAC models from our experience in real-world role engineering projects and case studies. The Business Activities approach presented in this paper is successfully applied in role engineering projects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
