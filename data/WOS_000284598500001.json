This package contains tools for performing three different but related algorithms to compute the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of the survival function in the presence of random truncation. More precisely, the package implements the algorithms proposed by Efron and Petrosian (1999) and Shen (2008), for analyzing randomly one-sided and two-sided (i.e., doubly) truncated data. These algorithms and some recent extensions are briefly reviewed. Two real data sets are used to show how DTDA package works in practice.", "paper_title": "DTDA: An R Package to Analyze Randomly Truncated Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000284598500001"}
