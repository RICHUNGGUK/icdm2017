However, the lack of geospatial awareness is a limitation and in spite of some developments like open L-systems, that introduced the ability to communicate with the environment, there was a need for more flexibility. This paper presents Geospatial L-systems, a new extension of L-systems that incorporates geospatial awareness, and shows an application in the area of expeditious modelling of urban environments. A modelling system, named XL3D, generates virtual urban environments automatically from a XML based document that contains a modelling specification and accesses data sources in an interoperable way. The integration of geospatial L-systems in this modelling system has increased the potential for automation and the potential to generate virtual urban environments with a higher level of detail and visual fidelity, with a lower level of complexity of the modelling processes. These facts are shown in a case study where a virtual urban environment, taken from an area in the Porto downtown, is generated by this solution.", "paper_title": "Expeditious modelling of virtual urban environments with geospatial L-systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000251667500005"}
