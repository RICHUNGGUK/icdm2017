This paper considers the allocation problem of multimedia objects in multi-powermode storage systems, where the objects are distributed among multi-powermode storages based on the access pattern to the objects. We design an underlying infrastructure of storage system and propose a dynamic multimedia object allocation policy based on the designed infrastructure, which integrate and prove the optimality of the proposed policy.
