Therefore, there seems to be a real need for an analytical review of recent developments in the data fusion domain. This paper proposes a comprehensive review of the data fusion state of the art, exploring its conceptualizations, benefits, and challenging aspects, as well as existing methodologies. In addition, several future directions of research in the data fusion community are highlighted and described. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
