As the electronics industry attempts to integrate environmental practices and move in the direction of environmental sustain ability, managers should consider to extending their efforts for enhancing environmental practices, green product and process designs by using their strategic orientations on green innovation in network relationship problems. However, few studies have discussed this issue or proposed strategic orientations to help improve green innovation performance in fuzzy environment. The purpose of this study is to address this problem, using the novel method of new fuzzy hybrid MCDM (multiple criteria decision-making), including new fuzzy DEMATEL (fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory), fuzzy DANP (fuzzy DEMATEL-based ANP) and VIKOR, to examine the interdependent and feedback problems among various dimensions/criteria of environmental strategic orientations. An empirical case of electronics industry as example is illustrated to show the proposed new methods and ultimately to present the best improvement strategies for decision-makers to achieve aspiration level.", "paper_title": "Environmental Strategic Orientations for Improving Green Innovation Performance in Fuzzy Environment - Using New Fuzzy Hybrid MCDM Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000326065100005"}
