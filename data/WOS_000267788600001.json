Instead of the standard assumption that customers perform independent abandonments, we consider situations where customers abandon the system simultaneously. This is, for example, the case in remote systems where customers may decide to abandon the system, when a transport facility becomes available.", "paper_title": "Synchronized reneging in queueing systems with vacations", "paper_id": "WOS:000267788600001"}
