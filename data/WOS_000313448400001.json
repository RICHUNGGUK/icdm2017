Such data represent objects of a certain type, connected to other types of data, the features, so that the overall data schema forms a star structure of inter-relationships. Co-clustering these data involves the specification of many parameters, such as the number of clusters for the object dimension and for all the features domains. In this paper we present a novel co-clustering algorithm for heterogeneous star-structured data that is parameter-less. This means that it does not require either the number of row clusters or the number of column clusters for the given feature spaces. Our approach optimizes the Goodman-Kruskal's tau, a measure for cross-association in contingency tables that evaluates the strength of the relationship between two categorical variables. We extend tau to evaluate co-clustering solutions and in particular we apply it in a higher dimensional setting. We propose the algorithm CoStar which optimizes tau by a local search approach. We assess the performance of CoStar on publicly available datasets from the textual and image domains using objective external criteria. The results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for the co-clustering of heterogeneous data, while it remains computationally efficient.", "paper_title": "Parameter-less co-clustering for star-structured heterogeneous data", "paper_id": "WOS:000313448400001"}
