So, considering two regular 3D-curves f(0)(t) and f(1)(t), our purpose is to construct a surface which interpolates these two curves in such a way that these two curves are geodesics on this surface. This will be accomplished using Hermite interpolation. For a real surface, it will be shown that geodesics can be acquired using a ribbon of micro-sensors. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
