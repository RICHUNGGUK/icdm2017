In this article, we have proposed a real time anomaly detection for H.264 compressed video streams utilizing pre-encoded motion vectors (MVs). The proposed work is principally motivated by the observation that MVs have distinct characteristics during anomaly than usual. Our observation shows that H.264 MV magnitude and orientation contain relevant information which can be used to model the usual behavior (UB) effectively. This is subsequently extended to detect abnormality/anomaly based on the probability of occurrence of a behavior. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated and bench-marked on UMN and Ped anomaly detection video datasets, with a detection rate of 70 frames per sec resulting in 90x and 250x speedup, along with on-par detection accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "Anomaly detection in compressed H.264/AVC video", "paper_id": "WOS:000365446600007"}
