Ordered coloring (also known as vertex ranking) has applications, among other areas, in efficient solving of sparse linear systems of equations and scheduling parallel assembly of products. Our main technical results improve upper and lower bounds for the ordered chromatic number of grids and related graphs. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
