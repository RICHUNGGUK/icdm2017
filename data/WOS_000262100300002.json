Both upper and lower decision makers, termed as leader and follower, try to optimize their own objectives in solution procedure but are affected by those of the other levels. When a bilevel decision model is built with fuzzy coefficients and the leader and/or follower have goals for their objectives, we call it fuzzy goal bilevel (FGBL) decision problem. This paper first proposes a lambda-cut set based FGBL model. A programmable lambda-cut approximate algorithm is then presented in detail. Based on this algorithm, a FGBL software system is developed to reach solutions for FGBL decision problems. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the application of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A lambda-CUT APPROXIMATE ALGORITHM FOR GOAL-BASED BILEVEL RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000262100300002"}
