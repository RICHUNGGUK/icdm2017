Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) NoCs based on Non-Uniform Cache Access (NUCA) are analyzed. We present results using a full system simulator with realistic workloads. Experiments show the average network latencies in two 3D NoCs are reduced by 28% and 34% respectively, comparing with 20 design. It is also shown that heat dissipation is a trade-off in improving performance of 3D chips. Our analysis and experiment results provide a guideline to design efficient 3D NoCs for data parallel H.264 coding applications. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.
