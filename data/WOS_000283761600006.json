It is shown that a second-order approximation of the fluid velocity field is required to adequately capture the spatial derivatives of the rate-of-strain tensor. To circumvent this limitation, a shear-rate smoothing procedure is introduced, thereby allowing the use of lower-order approximations for the fluid phase. Numerical experiments comparing the convergence and CPU cost of the different tetrahedral interpolation bases are presented.
