The time derivative of the Stokes equation is discretized with the second order backward differentiation formula. For the induced steady Stokes equation, a projection method is used to split it into velocity and pressure. Fourth-order finite differences for partial derivatives are used to the boundary value problems for the velocity and the pressure. Also, finite linear systems for Poisson equations and Helmholtz equations are solved with a matrix-diagonalization technique. For characteristic curves satisfying highly nonlinear self-consistent initial value problems, the departure points are solved with an error correction strategy having a temporal convergence of order two. The constructed algorithm turns out to be completely iteration free. In particular, the suggested algorithm possesses a good behavior of the total energy conservation compared to existing methods. To assess the effectiveness of the method, two-dimensional lid-driven cavity problems with large different Reynolds numbers are solved. The doubly periodic shear layer flows are also used to assess the efficiency of the algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
