The continual increases in size, data generating rates, and connectivity of sensor networks present significant scale and complexity challenges. Traditional schemes of information management are no longer applicable in such a scenario. Hence, an elastic resource allocation strategy is introduced which is a novel management technique based on elastic computing. With the discussion of the challenges of implementing real-time and high-performance information management in an elastic manner, an air pollution monitoring system, called EIMAP, was designed with a four-layer hierarchical structure. The core technique of EIMAP is the elastic resource provision scheduler, which models the constraint satisfaction problem by minimizing the use of resources for collecting information for a defined quality threshold. Simulation results show that the EIMAP system has high performance in resource provision and scalability. The experiment of pollution cloud dispersion tracking presents a case study of the system implementation.", "paper_title": "Elastic Information Management for Air Pollution Monitoring in Large-Scale M2M Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000329705400001"}
