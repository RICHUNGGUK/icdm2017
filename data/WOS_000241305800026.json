The resulting p(2)-ary LCZ sequence set can be viewed as the generalization of the optimal quaternary LCZ sequence set by Kim, Jang, No, and Chung in respect of the alphabet size. This generalization becomes possible due to a completely new proof comprising any prime p. Under this proof, the quaternary case can be considered as a specific example for p = 2.", "paper_title": "A new construction of optimal p(2)-ary low correlation zone sequences using unified sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000241305800026"}
