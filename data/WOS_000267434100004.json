The proposed scheme uses external stimulus to excite specific emotions in human subjects whose facial expressions are analyzed by segmenting and localizing the individual frames into regions of interest. Selected facial features such as eye opening, mouth opening, and the length of eyebrow constriction are extracted from the localized regions, fuzzified, and mapped onto an emotion space by employing Mamdani-type relational models. A scheme for the validation of the system parameters is also presented. This paper also provides a fuzzy scheme for controlling the transition of emotion dynamics toward a desired state. Experimental results and computer simulations indicate that the proposed scheme for emotion recognition and control is simple and robust, with good accuracy.", "paper_title": "Emotion Recognition From Facial Expressions and Its Control Using Fuzzy Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000267434100004"}
