Evolved game players are able to hold their own-and often win-against human or human-based competitors. This paper has a twofold objective: first, to review our recent results of applying genetic programming in the domain of games; second, to formulate the merits of genetic programming in acting as a tool for developing strategies in general, and to discuss the possible design of a strategizing machine.", "paper_title": "Designing an evolutionary strategizing machine for game playing and beyond", "paper_id": "WOS:000247644800014"}
