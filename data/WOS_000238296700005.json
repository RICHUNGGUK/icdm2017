This paper proposes ICAM, Integrated Cellular and Ad hoc Multicast, to increase 3G multicast throughput through opportunistic use of ad hoc relays. In ICAM, a 3G base station delivers packets to proxy mobile devices with better 3G channel quality. The proxy then forwards the packets to the receivers through an IEEE 802.11-based ad hoc network. In this paper, we first propose a localized greedy algorithm that discovers for each multicast receiver the proxy with the highest 3G downlink channel rate. We discover that due to capacity limitations and interference of the ad hoc relay network, maximizing the 3G downlink data rate of each multicast receiver's proxy does not lead to maximum throughput for the multicast group. We then show that the optimal ICAM problem is NP-hard, and derive a polynomial- time 4-approximation algorithm for the construction of the multicast forest. This bound holds when the underlying wireless MAC supports broadcast or unicast, single rate or multiple rates (4(1+epsilon) approximation scheme for the latter), and even when there are multiple simultaneous multicast sessions. Through both analysis and simulations, we show that our algorithms achieve throughput gains up to 840 percent for 3G downlink multicast with modest overhead on the 3G uplink.", "paper_title": "ICAM: integrated cellular and ad hoc multicast", "paper_id": "WOS:000238296700005"}
