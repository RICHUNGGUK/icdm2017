Design/methodology/approach - The paper discusses the concept. Findings - Elsewhere it is shown that in the framework of ZFC, various countable infinite sets are all self-contradicting non-sets. In this paper, the authors will generalize the concept of Cauchy theater, and establish the concept of transfinite Cauchy theaters. After that, employing a new method, they will prove that various uncountable infinite sets, as studied in naive set theory and modem axiomatic set theory, are also self-contradicting non-sets. Originality/value - The concept of general Cauchy theater is introduced.", "paper_title": "Modern system of mathematics and general Cauchy theater in its theoretical foundation", "paper_id": "WOS:000256048100009"}
