Our system F-n is general, with no further assumptions. In particular, our algorithm Successfully treats multiple zeros directly in such systems. A key idea is to introduce evaluation hounds and sleeve bounds. We also present a much more efficient algorithm for zero-dimensional triangular systems without multiple roots. We implemented Our algorithms, and promising experimental results are shown. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
