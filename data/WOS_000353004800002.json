Free energies of the entire reaction were calculated for enzyme deacylation by water and hydrogen peroxide that represented hydrolysis and perhydrolysis reactions, respectively. The calculations displayed that a stepwise mechanism there was with the enzyme-product complex being a deep minimum on the free energy surfaces of both of two reactions. The tetrahedral intermediate formation was the rate-determining step of all reactions, which needed 8.1 to 10.5 kcal mol(-1) for activation in different reactions. In the second stage of the reaction, fewer free energy barriers, between 4.7 and 5.9 kcal mol(-1), were identified to enable the proton transfer from His224 to Ser105 and the breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate. These calculated activation free energies approved theoretical possibility of both of two reactions for two substrates. Finally, an applied tool examined the interactions role in the stability and energy levels of different chemical species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
