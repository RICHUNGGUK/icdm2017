The checking sequence is only checked for security by analyzing quantum secure direct communication proposed before. The novel protocol codes the checking sequence which is added the certain meaning in addition to security checks, named the protocol of the sub-step secret transmitting order of particles using the checking sequence coded. Through analysis by synthesis the novel protocol has higher security and reliability.", "paper_title": "Quantum Secure Direct Communication Using Checking Sequence Coded", "paper_id": "WOS:000369384200030"}
