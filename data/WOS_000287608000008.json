Let T(f) be the order of f, i.e., the period of the sequence f, f((2)), f((3)), f((4))... of compositional iterates. A closely related number, B(f) = the product of the lengths of the cycles of f, has previously been used as an approximation for T. This paper proves that the average values of these two quantities are quite different. The expected value of T is 1/n(n) Sigma(f is an element of Omega n) T(f) = exp(k(0) root n/log(2) =n(1 + o(1)), where k(0) is a complicated but explicitly defined constant that is approximately 3.36.
