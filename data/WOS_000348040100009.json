With respect to multi-attribute group decision making problem, we then give an approach to derive the relative importance weights of experts. This approach takes into account decision information from three aspects: the uncertainty degrees of individual expert's assessing information for alternatives, the similarity degree of the assessing information for alternatives provided by individual expert, and the similarity degree of the individual expert's assessing information to all the others'. Finally, we establish a method for handling multi-attribute group decision making problem with Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy information, and adopt an illustrative example to demonstrate its rationality and effectiveness.", "paper_title": "An Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attribute group decision making method based on entropy and similarity measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000348040100009"}
