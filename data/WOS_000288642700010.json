The whole heart model comprises ten Tusscher's ventricular and Nygren's atrial cell models, the anatomical and electrophysiological model descriptions of the atria (introduced by Harrild et al.) and ventricle (given by Winslow et al.), and the mechanical model of the periodical cardiac contraction and resting phenomena proposed by Moireau et al. During the propagation of the depolarization wave, the kinetic, compositional and rotational anisotropy is handled by the tissue, organ and torso model. The applied patient specific parameters were determined by an evolutionary computation method. An intensive parameter reduction was performed using the abstract formulation of the searching space. This patient specific parameter representation enables the adjustment of deformable model parameters in real-time. The validation process was performed using simultaneously measured ECG and ultrasound image records that were compared with simulated signals and shapes using an abstract, parameterized evaluation criterion.
