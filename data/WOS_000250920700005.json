The objective measurement of blocking artifacts plays an important role in the design, optimization, and assessment of image and video coding systems. This paper presents a new algorithm for measuring blocking artifacts in images and videos. Instead of using the traditional pixel discontinuity along the block boundary, we use the edge directional information of the images. The new algorithm does not need the exact location of the block boundary thus is invariant to the displacement, rotation and scaling of the images. Experiments on various still images and videos show that the new blockiness measure is very efficient in terms of computational complexity and memory usage, and can produce blocking artifacts measurement consistent with subjective rating.", "paper_title": "Using edge direction information for measuring blocking artifacts of images", "paper_id": "WOS:000250920700005"}
