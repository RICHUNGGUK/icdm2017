In this paper we continue the study of confluent graphs, introducing strongly confluent graphs and tree-confluent graphs. We show that strongly confluent graphs can be recognized in NP (the complexity of recognizing confluent graphs remains open). We also give a natural elimination ordering characterization of tree-confluent graphs, and we show that this class coincides with the (6,2)-chordal bipartite graphs. Finally, we define outerconfluent graphs and identify the bipartite permutation graphs as a natural subclass.", "paper_title": "Train tracks and confluent drawings", "paper_id": "WOS:000245123200009"}
