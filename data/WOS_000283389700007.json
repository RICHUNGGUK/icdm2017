Currently, there is no fuzzy IBE scheme available that is fully CCA2 seem e in the standard model. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy IBE scheme which achieves IND-FID-CCA2 security in the standard model with a tight reduction. Moreover, the size of public parameters is independent of the number of attributes associated with an identity.", "paper_title": "New Fuzzy Identity-Based Encryption in the Standard Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000283389700007"}
