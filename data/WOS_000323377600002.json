One such problem is aboutness: How do texts relate to the world? In response to this problem, philosophers of history have developed theories of colligation describing how authors bind together phenomena under organizing concepts.

This theory points to a broad vision of the future of information organization and some specific challenges to be met.", "paper_title": "Information organization and the philosophy of history", "paper_id": "WOS:000323377600002"}
