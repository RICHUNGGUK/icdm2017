The publications of a random sample of UK research-active academics for each of the years 2003 and 2008-were collected and analysed to gather data regarding referencing practices, along with any identifiable trends between the 2 years. References were categorised by type of material to show the proportions of each type used. Comparisons between the 2 years showed that the use of journal articles had increased. There was also an increase in the average number of publications per author. A large number of authors had no publications in the target years.", "paper_title": "What do UK academics cite?
