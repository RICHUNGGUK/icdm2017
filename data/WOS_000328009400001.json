The primary focus of this investigation is to examine task framing (either utilitarian or hedonic) and length of viewing time (unlimited or 5 s) as conditions that influence user website perceptions and viewing behavior. Whether a task is framed as either hedonic or utilitarian received limited support. However, viewing time does make a difference and unconstrained viewing versus 5 s of viewing time results in higher levels of perceived involvement, enjoyment, trust, and effectiveness. In addition, eye-tracking results indicate that users tend to focus more on hedonic zones versus utilitarian zones (i.e. exhibit higher number of fixations and longer viewing times). Interview data provide additional support and insights. In sum, these findings contribute to understanding the complex and dynamic perceptions of online shoppers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
