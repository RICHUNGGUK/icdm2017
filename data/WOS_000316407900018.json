It is shown that if the fading coefficient of the channel between the transmitter and the receiver can be predicted more accurately from its infinite past than the fading coefficient of the channel between the relay and the receiver, then at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the relay does not increase capacity. It is further shown that if the fading coefficient of the channel between the transmitter and the relay can be predicted more accurately from its infinite past than the fading coefficient of the channel between the relay and the receiver, then at high SNR, one can achieve communication rates that are within one bit of the capacity of the multiple-input single-output fading channel that results when the transmitter and the relay can cooperate.", "paper_title": "On Noncoherent Fading Relay Channels at High Signal-to-Noise Ratio", "paper_id": "WOS:000316407900018"}
