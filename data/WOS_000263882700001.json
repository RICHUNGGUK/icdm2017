An eightfold cross-validation was performed to estimate the classification error: 63 predictive variables were entered into the model fitting. The random forest allows to automatically classify 45% of subjects with a classification error lower than 5%, while the corresponding error is 31% for the multilogit model. The performance of the former classifier is appealing, indicating a potential drop of manually checked cases from 1750 to 960 per incidence year with a moderate error rate. This result suggests to refine the approach and extend it to other categories of manually treated cases. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
