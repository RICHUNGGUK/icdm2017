This paper focuses on the trends of coupling and its effects on dynamic circuits. It presents closed form analytical solutions for noise, as well as noise tolerance metrics for dynamic circuits. These solutions are within 5% of dynamic simulations. It is shown that not all scaling trends are negative for noise, and that the scaling down of supply voltage and increasing frequency, help improve certain aspects of the noise immunity of dynamic circuits. Most of the works treated the noise immunity and the noise content separately. This paper introduces an analysis of noise seatability by looking at the noise immunity and the noise content simultaneously.", "paper_title": "Realistic scalability of noise in dynamic circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000239405100008"}
