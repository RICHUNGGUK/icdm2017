The proposed mechanism, called FLC-VFS, regulates the influence of VFS adaptation when the training data from a new speaker is inadequate, specifically by taking the amount of adaptation data into account at the stage of transfer vectors interpolation, and thus ensures the robustness of VFS adaptation against data scarcity. The proposed mechanism is conceptually simple and effective. Experimental results indicate that FLC-VFS outperforms conventional VFS, particularly when the adaptation data are scarce.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Logic Based Control for VFS Speaker adaptation", "paper_id": "WOS:000262693400009"}
