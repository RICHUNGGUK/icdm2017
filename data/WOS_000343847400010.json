Timoshenko beam model which includes the effect of gyroscopic moments is employed for modeling rotor segments. Instead of applying FEM, sub-segment Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) are obtained analytically, and sub-segment FRFs obtained are coupled by using receptance coupling method. Bearing properties are included into system dynamics by employing structural modification techniques. The proposed analytical model is verified by using FEM approach. It is shown that using analytical model and receptance coupling, compared with FEM, reduces computational time drastically without losing accuracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
