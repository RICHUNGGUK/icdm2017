The implemented prototype service currently provides access to native wordnets as well as to a bilingual concept dictionary. This paper thus describes slight revisions that were made to the Wordnet-LMF specifications to model and accommodate a non-wordnet-native bilingual concept dictionary.", "paper_title": "LMF-aware Web services for accessing semantic lexicons", "paper_id": "WOS:000309134500005"}
