We show the NP-hardness of the problem and present a polynomial-time algorithm when k < n/4, in which n is number of vertices. In addition, we design a 2-approximation algorithm and a branching algorithm for finding an optimal solution. By experiments on random graphs, we show that the exact algorithm is much more efficient than a trivial one.", "paper_title": "On the Min-Max 2-Cluster Editing Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000327280200004"}
