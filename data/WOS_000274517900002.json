Design/methodology/approach - 3D FE models of electrical machines are considered. The model consists of FE equations for the magnetic field, equations describing eddy currents and equations, which describe the currents in the machine windings. The FE equations are further coupled by the electromagnetic torque to the differential equation of motion. In the presented field-circuit model, the flux linkages with the windings are expressed by two components. Attention is paid to the description of machine winding. Both scalar and vector potential formulations are analysed. The FE equations are derived by using the notation of circuit theory. The methods of movement simulation and torque calculation in FE models are discussed. Findings - Proposed circuit description of electromagnetic field in electrical machines conforms to the applied method of electric and magnetic circuit analysis. The advantage of the presented description is that the equations of field model can be easy associated with the other equations of the electric drive system. Originality/value - The applied analogies between the FE formulation and the equivalent magnetic and electric network, models help formulate efficient field models of electrical machines. The developed models after coupling to the models of supply and control system can be successfully used in the analysis and design electric drives.", "paper_title": "Field and field-circuit models of electrical machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000274517900002"}
