As accurate coverage of the tissue with a sufficiently large electric field presents one of the most important conditions for successful electroporation, applications based on electroporation would greatly benefit with a method of monitoring the electric field, especially if it could be done during the treatment. As the membrane electroporation is a consequence of an induced transmembrane potential which is directly proportional to the local electric field, we propose current density imaging (CDI) and magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) techniques to measure the electric field distribution during electroporation. The experimental part of the study employs CDI with short high-voltage pulses, while the theoretical part of the study is based on numerical simulations of MREIT. A good agreement between experimental and numerical results was obtained, suggesting that CDI and MREIT can be used to determine the electric field during electric pulse delivery and that both of the methods can be of significant help in planning and monitoring of future electroporation based clinical applications.", "paper_title": "Magnetic Resonance Electrical Impedance Tomography for Monitoring Electric Field Distribution During Tissue Electroporation", "paper_id": "WOS:000295511400005"}
