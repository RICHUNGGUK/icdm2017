Visual feedback in such systems is essential and should make maximal use of natural hand- eye coordination. This paper describes a new method of visual feedback for scaled teleoperation in which the operator manipulates the handle of a remote tool in the presence of a registered virtual image of the target in real time. The method adapts a concept already used successfully in a new medical device called the Sonic Flashlight, which permits direct in situ visualization of ultrasound during invasive procedures. The Sonic Flashlight uses a flat-panel monitor and a half- silvered mirror to merge the visual outer surface of a patient with a simultaneous ultrasound scan of the patient's interior. Adapting the concept to scaled teleoperation involves removing the imaging device and the target to a remote location and adding a master- slave control device. This permits the operator to see his hands, along with what appears to be the tool, and the target, merged in a workspace that preserves natural hand- eye coordination. Three functioning prototypes are described, one based on ultrasound and two on light microscopy. The limitations and potential of the new approach are discussed.", "paper_title": "Optical merger of direct vision with virtual images for scaled teleoperation", "paper_id": "WOS:000234430200015"}
