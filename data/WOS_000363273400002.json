Datacenter owners are beginning to use renewable energy as extra supply for the devices. In this paper, we design a green-aware power management strategy for such datacenters powered by sustainable energy sources, considering the power consumption of both IT functional devices and cooling devices. Specifically, we make use of energy-aware methods to formulate an overall optimization problem, and try to solve it by combining heuristic and statistical searching approaches. The ultimate objective is to utilize green energy sufficiently while keeping the demand of applications deployed inside the datacenter at an acceptable level. Performance evaluation and simulation experiments are designed upon a simulated testbed, with realistic workload traces and solar energy generation considered, in order to validate the feasibility of our approach. Results show that it can significantly improve the green energy utilization, and achieve the highest overall revenues for the resource provider. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
