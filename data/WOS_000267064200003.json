Basically, a driving-point immittance including reactive constant elements is carried out in such a way that provides the transmission zeros. The reactive constant elements are introduced into the synthesis for two reasons. The first is to consider the possibility of the asymmetric position of transmission zeros in the real frequency axis. The second one is to obtain canonical forms, i.e. networks with the minimum number of elements in the case of symmetrical responses. To validate the proposed method, a filter with asymmetrical response has been synthesized, comparing different. topologies for its use in multiplexers. This fact is illustrated with a Ku-band elliptic response diplexer designed in H-plane rectangular waveguide. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
