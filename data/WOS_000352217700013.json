We successfully designed, constructed, and tested a cellular memory inverter in the bacterium Escherichia coli in a predictable way. We selected isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) as the input and green fluorescent protein (GFP) as the output. We selected negative regulation of lac operon and excision function of Cre recombinase as computing tools. The GFP can express and produce output without IPTG. The input, IPTG, can induce the expression of Cre recombinase. The Cre recombinase can excise the GFP gene between site lox71 and site lox66, and hence turn off the output. We also selected ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to predict the dynamic behaviors for the precise design and implementation of the inverter. We used sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), colony Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and fluorescent quantitative analysis techniques to verify the function of our inverter. The study provides a new biological memory computing system. The Cre recombinase functions used here should be useful in the construction of biological memory computing systems.", "paper_title": "Rational construction of a cellular memory inverter", "paper_id": "WOS:000352217700013"}
