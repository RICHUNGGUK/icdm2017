The experiment consists of a four wavelength-division-multiplexed channel system operating on a WiMax frequency band and employing an orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing modulation at 625 Mbits/s per channel, transmission of the data over 20 km of optical fiber, and active switching in a 1 x 16 active optical switch. The results show a negligible power penalty on each channel for both the best and the worst case in terms of inter-channel crosstalk. The presented system is highly scalable both in terms of port count and throughput, a desirable feature in highly branched access networks, and is modulation-and frequency-band independent.", "paper_title": "Optical Switching for Dynamic Distribution of Wireless-Over-Fiber Signals in Active Optical Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000307836800006"}
