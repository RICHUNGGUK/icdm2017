A joint optimization problem is formulated for relay selection, subcarrier assignment and power allocation. Since the formulated primal problem is nondeterministic polynomial time-complete, we make continuous relaxation and solve the dual problem by Lagrangian dual decomposition method. A near-optimal solution is obtained using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides superior system throughput and much better fairness among users comparing with a heuristic algorithm.", "paper_title": "Proportional-Fair Downlink Resource Allocation in OFDMA-Based Relay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000299025200010"}
