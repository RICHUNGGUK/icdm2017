This paper will provide a meaningful shadow based multiple gray level visual cryptography without size expansion (MSML) method. This method not only creates a reconstructed secret image with multiple-gray levels and without size expansion, but the created shadow images also appear similar to the cover images specified by the user. Moreover, a user can adjust the qualities of the reconstructed secret image and the shadow images according to his requirements.", "paper_title": "MEANINGFUL SHADOW BASED MULTIPLE GRAY LEVEL VISUAL CRYPTOGRAPHY WITHOUT SIZE EXPANSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000288522600034"}
