Links between various data sources play a key role insofar as they allow software applications (e.g., browsers, search engines) to operate over the aggregated data space as if it was a unique local database. In this new data space, where DBpedia, a data set including structured information from Wikipedia, seems to be the central hub, we analyzed and highlighted outgoing links from this hub in an effort to discover broken links. The paper reports on an experiment to examine the causes of broken links and proposes some treatments for solving this problem.", "paper_title": "Analyzing Broken Links on the Web of Data: An Experiment With DBpedia", "paper_id": "WOS:000339066500014"}
