The inner product defined by the neural response leads to a similarity measure between functions which we call the derived kernel. Based on a hierarchical architecture, we give a recursive definition of the neural response and associated derived kernel. The derived kernel can be used in a variety of application domains such as classification of images, strings of text and genomics data.", "paper_title": "Mathematics of the Neural Response", "paper_id": "WOS:000273809600004"}
