The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in communication and performance among student teachers, who participated in the TECA during a year-long clinical experience and those who did not. Overall, performance scores were higher among students in the TECA; planning scores were higher at a statistically significant level. Communication reports suggest that online discussions through both public and private channels contributed to these results. Findings were consistent with prior studies of the TECA and supported the efficacy of key design elements. Implications for teacher education and the design of TECAs are discussed.
