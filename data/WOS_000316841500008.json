Managing these business process models becomes a complex task when organizations integrate collaborative networks and set up several cross-organizational collaborations. This paper presents a distributed repository that provides the functionalities required to manage conceptual business process models involved in cross-organizational collaborations. A service-oriented architecture is proposed for the distributed repository. This architecture enables organizations to access a global repository for managing collaborative networks, cross-organizational collaborations, and their CBP models. Organizations can also maintain local repositories of IBP models, which are synchronized and consistent with CBP models, while preserving their private aspects. By using verification methods and a model-driven architecture method, the distributed repository provides services that support the synchronization, consistency and interoperability requirements for CBP and IBP models. A case study is presented along with an implementation of the distributed repository. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
