For a geometric graph G on a point set P and a region F, we define G circle minus F to be what remains of G after the vertices and edges of G intersecting F have been removed. A C-fault tolerant t-spanner is a geometric graph G on P such that for any convex region F, the graph G circle minus F is a t-spanner for G(c) (P) circle minus F, where G(c) (P) circle minus F, where G(c) (P) is the complete geometric graph on P. We prove that any set P of n points admits a C-fault tolerant (1+epsilon)-spanner of size O (n log n) for any constant epsilon > 0; if adding Steiner points is allowed, then the size of the spanner reduces to O (n), and for several special cases, we show how to obtain region-fault tolerant spanners of O (n) size without using Steiner points. We also consider fault-tolerant geodesic t -spanners: this is a variant where, for any disk D, the distance in G circle minus D between any two points u, v is an element of P\\D is at most t times the geodesic distance between u and v in R(2) \\ D. We prove that for any P, we can add O(n) Steiner points to obtain a fault-tolerant geodesic (1+epsilon)-spanner of size O (n).", "paper_title": "Region-Fault Tolerant Geometric Spanners", "paper_id": "WOS:000264602600004"}
