A graph G = (V, E) is said to be an (unpartitioned) probe block graph if there exist an independent set N subset of V and some set E' subset of ((N)(2)) such that the graph G' = (V, E boolean OR E') is a block graph; if such an independent set N is given, G is called a partitioned probe block graph. In this note we give good characterizations for probe block graphs, in both unpartitioned and partitioned cases. As a result, partitioned and unpartitioned probe block graphs can be recognized in linear time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
