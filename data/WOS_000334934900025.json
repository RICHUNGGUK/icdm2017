Calculations predict that the carboxyl group in the acceptor moiety adopts an adequate orientation for an efficient anchoring on the semiconductor TiO2 surface. The carboxylic acid group holds a negative charge twice larger than the cyano moiety that favors the electron injection to the semiconductor. Time-dependent calculations allow for the assignment of the absorption bands in the UV-vis spectrum of exTTF-TCF and confirm the presence of two low-lying charge-transfer electronic transitions that account for the moderately-intense absorption in the 450-800 nm range. The striking optical absorption properties of exTTF-TCF are preserved for the carboxylic analogues. Finally, periodic calculations show relevant topological differences between the carboxylic derivatives anchored on the TiO2 surface, which would notably influence in the power conversion efficiency of a dye-sensitized solar cell.", "paper_title": "Theoretical insight on novel donor-acceptor exTTF-based dyes for dye-sensitized solar cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000334934900025"}
