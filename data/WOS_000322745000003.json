Item sets are moved in two baskets hanging on a rope and pulley. To guarantee stability of the system, the weight difference between the contents of the two baskets must always stay below a given threshold. We prove that it is -complete to decide whether some given initial situation of the underlying discrete system can lead to a given goal situation. Furthermore we identify several polynomially solvable special cases of this reachability problem, and we also settle the computational complexity of a number of related questions.", "paper_title": "Motion Planning with Pulley, Rope, and Baskets", "paper_id": "WOS:000322745000003"}
