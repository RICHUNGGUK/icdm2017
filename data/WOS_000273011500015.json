In the Quantum Monte Carlo method, the properties of a system of atoms, such as the ground-state energies, are averaged over a number of iterations. Our framework is aimed at accelerating the computations in each iteration of the QMC application by offloading the calculation of properties, namely energy and trial wave function, onto reconfigurable hardware. This gives a user tile capability to run simulations for a large number of iterations, thereby reducing the statistical uncertainty in the properties, and for larger clusters. This framework is designed to run oil the Cray XD1 high performance reconfigurable computing platform, which exploits the coarse-grained parallelism of the processor along with the fine-grained parallelism of the reconfigurable computing devices available in the form of fieldprogrammable gate arrays. In this paper, we illustrate the functioning of the framework, which can be used to calculate the energies for a model cluster of helium atoms. In addition, we present the capabilities of the framework that allow the user to vary the chemical identities of the simulated atoms.

We use the compute node with the Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA Operating system: Red Hat Enterprise Linux OS Has the code been vectorlsed or parallelized?: Yes Classification: 6.1 Nature of problem: Quantum Monte Carlo is a practical method to solve the Schr6clinger equation for large many-body systems and obtain the ground-state properties of such systems. This method involves the sampling of a number of configurations of atoms and averaging tile properties of the configurations over a number of iterations. We are interested in applying the QMC method to obtain tile energy and other properties of highly quantum clusters, such as inert gas clusters. Solution method: The proposed framework provides a combined hardware-software approach, in which the QMC simulation is performed on the host processor, with the computationally intensive functions such as energy and trial wave function computations mapped onto the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) logic device attached as a co-processor to the host processor. We perform the QMC simulation for a number of iterations as in the case of our original software QMC approach, to reduce the statistical uncertainty of the results. However, our proposed HAQMC framework accelerates each iteration of the simulation, by significantly reducing the time taken to calculate the ground-state properties of the configurations of atoms, thereby accelerating the overall QMC simulation. We provide a generic interpolation framework that can be extended to study a variety of pure and doped atomic clusters, irrespective of the chemical identities of the atoms. For the FPGA implementation of the properties, we use a two-region approach for accurately computing the properties over the entire domain. employ deep pipelines and fixed-point for all our calculations guaranteeing the accuracy required for our simulation.
