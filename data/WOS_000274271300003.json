It is suitable for traffic sources requiring either a minimum or a prescribed QoS provision, and at the same time provides a fair resource allocation. Practical system constraints such as limitations on transmission power and modulation and coding schemes are considered in this framework. Moreover, it is analytically shown to be more energy efficient than the opportunistic power control. Two algorithms of this class are described and have their performance confronted with opportunistic algorithms.
