Quantum information in our case is encoded in spin degrees of freedom of the electron-pairs which construct a decoherence-free subspace. We design building blocks for two noncommutable single-logic-qubit gates and a logic controlled phase gate, based on which a universal and scalable quantum information processing robust to dephasing is available in a deterministic way.", "paper_title": "Universal quantum computation with electronic qubits in decoherence-free subspace", "paper_id": "WOS:000251978500007"}
