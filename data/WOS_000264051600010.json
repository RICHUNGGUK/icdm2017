This causes problems in image segmentation for the quantitative analysis and detection of cancer. To overcome this problem, unlike previous methods that use pixel distributions, we propose a new homogeneity measure based on the distribution of the objects that we define to represent tissue components. Using this measure, we demonstrate a new object-oriented segmentation algorithm. Working with colon biopsy images, we show that this algorithm segments the cancerous and normal regions with 94.89 percent accuracy on the average and significantly improves the segmentation accuracy compared to its pixel-based counterpart.
