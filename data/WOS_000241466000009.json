The descriptors in this study were calculated by the software CODESSA. HM was used both for preselecting molecular descriptors and for developing the linear model. Logarithms of the maximum steady-state flux (J) values are correlated with four descriptors, with a squared correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.844 and root-mean-square error of 0.438, respectively. These four theoretical molecular descriptors are count of H-acceptor sites, gravitation index, H-donors charged surface area, and weighted positive-charged partial surface area. The rationality of the descriptors was evaluated by similarity analysis, while the stability and validity of the model was evaluated by validation. This paper provides a simple and straightforward way to predict the log J values of the drugs from their structures alone and gives some insight into structural features related to the penetration of drugs.", "paper_title": "QSAR prediction of the penetration of drugs across a polydimethylsiloxane membrane", "paper_id": "WOS:000241466000009"}
