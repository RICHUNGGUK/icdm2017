Among the indirect or parametric methods available, one is based on the \"mechanical\" concept of constitutive relation error estimator introduced in order to quantify the quality of finite element analyses. In the case of uncertain measurements obtained from a family of quasi-identical structures, parameters need to be modeled randomly. In this paper, we consider the case of complex engineering structures with numerous stochastic variables. Polynomial chaos expansion and reduced bases are used to solve the stochastic problems involved in the calculation of the error. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
