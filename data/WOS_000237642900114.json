This paper presents a Stochastic Petri Nets (SPN) model that can be used to evaluate the performance of the object-based storage. But the problem of state space's explosion of SPN limits its ability to analyze complex and large-scale systems. An approximate analysis technique is proposed to replace the complexity model with the performance equivalence simplification model. This simplified model was used to validate the both well scalability and high performance of the OBS as the number of clients and OSD nodes increase.", "paper_title": "An approximate analytic performance model of object-based storage", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900114"}
