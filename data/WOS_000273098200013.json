The modulator is composed by two \"balanced-load\" biphase modulators. The balanced load is a novel principle allowing a topological simplification of commonly adopted vector modulator schemes: seven couplers are used instead of the 9 ones in traditional reflection-type modulators, with comparable performance. The measured results of monolithic 45-65 GHz test vehicles of the methodology for both biphase and vector modulators, are presented. (c) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
