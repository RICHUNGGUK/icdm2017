It is worth noting that goal orientation is an increasingly recognized paradigm for eliciting, modeling, specifying, and analyzing software requirements. However, it is not clear how goal models are related to architectural models. In this paper we present an approach based on model transformations to derive architectural structural specifications from system goals. The source and target languages are respectively the i* (iStar) modeling language and the Acme architectural description language. A real case study is used to show the feasibility of our approach.
