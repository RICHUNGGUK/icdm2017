The stationary distribution has a product form only in a very limited number of particular cases when queue capacity is finite, and numerical algorithms are intractable due to the cardinality of the state space. Moreover, closed networks do not exhibit any monotonic property enabling efficient CFFP. We derive a bounding chain for the CFFP algorithm for closed queueing networks. This bounding chain is based on a compact representation of sets of states that enables exact sampling from the stationary distribution without considering all initial conditions in the CFFP. The coupling time of the bounding chain is almost surely finite, and numerical experiments show that it is close to the coupling time of the exact chain. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
