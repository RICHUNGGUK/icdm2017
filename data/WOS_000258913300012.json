Being reversible, the original data and the embedded data should be completely restored. Difference expansion transform is a remarkable breakthrough in reversible data-hiding schemes. The difference expansion method achieves high embedding capacity and keeps distortion low. This paper shows that the difference expansion method with the simplified location map and new expandability can achieve more embedding capacity while keeping the distortion at the same level as the original expansion method. Performance of the proposed scheme in this paper is shown to be better than the original difference expansion scheme by Tian and its improved version by Kamstra and Heijmans. This improvement can be possible by exploiting the quasi-Laplace distribution of the difference values.", "paper_title": "A novel difference expansion transform for reversible data embedding", "paper_id": "WOS:000258913300012"}
