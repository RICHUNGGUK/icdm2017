Classically they are run with perfect synchrony; i.e., the local rule is applied to each cell at each time step. A possible modification of the updating scheme consists in applying the rule with a fixed probability, called the synchrony rate. It has been shown in a previous work that varying the synchrony rate continuously could produce a discontinuity in the behaviour of the cellular automaton. This works aims at investigating the nature of this change of behaviour using intensive numerical simulations. We apply a two-step protocol to show that the phenomenon is a phase transition whose critical exponents are in good agreement with the predicted values of directed percolation.", "paper_title": "Directed percolation phenomena in asynchronous elementary cellular automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000241484300075"}
