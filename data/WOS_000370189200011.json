After need analysis of human-computer interaction under the vehicle platform, the framework of intelligent human-computer interface is established, various modules and workflows in the system are designed, and the reasoning feature based on fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) is implemented. The on-vehicle intelligent human-computer interface could help users to complete the interactive operation which is unrelated to the driving operations. Furthermore, the system could analyze the whole information and predict the information required by the user. At last, it could display the information on the interface. So, the on-vehicle intelligent human-computer interface could not only meet the user's demand for secondary interactive tasks, but also could ensure the driving performance and safety.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation of Intelligent Event-Driven Human-Computer Interface on Vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000370189200011"}
