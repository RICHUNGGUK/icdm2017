The underlying idea of the method is the correct local construction near the interface which incorporates the jump conditions. The method, which is very easy to implement, is based on finite difference discretization. The main ingredients of the proposed method comprise (i) an adaptive-order strategy of using interpolating polynomials of different orders on different sides of interfaces, which avoids the singularity of the local linear system and enables us to handle complex interfaces; (ii) when the interface condition involves the eigenvalue, the original problem is reduced to a quadratic eigenvalue problem by introducing an auxiliary variable and an interfacial operator on the interface; (iii) the auxiliary variable is discretized uniformly on the interface, the rest of variables are discretized on an underlying rectangular grid, and a proper interpolation between these two grids are designed to reduce the number of stencil points. Several examples are tested to show the robustness and accuracy of the schemes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
