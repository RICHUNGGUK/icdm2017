The matrix decomposition problem is crucial for improving the \"step-and-shoot\" delivery efficiency in Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy, which aims to deliver a highly conformal radiation dose to a target tumor while sparing the surrounding normal tissues. Our algorithm is based on a non-trivial graph construction scheme, which enables us to formulate the decomposition problem as computing a minimum s-t cut in a 3-D geometric multi-pillar graph. Experiments on randomly generated intensity map matrices and on clinical data demonstrated the efficiency of our algorithm.", "paper_title": "The matrix orthogonal decomposition problem in intensity-modulated radiation therapy", "paper_id": "WOS:000240077300018"}
