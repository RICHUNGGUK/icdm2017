However, security professionals will readily admit that without safe practices by users, no amount or type of technology will be effective at preventing unauthorized intrusions. By paralleling the practices of information security and health prevention, a rationale for employing constructs from existing models of health behavior is established. A comprehensive and parsimonious model (the Security Belief Model) is developed to explain information security behavior intentions. The model is tested empirically based on a sample of 237 Indian professionals. The results of the empirical study indicate general support for the model, particularly including severity, susceptibility, benefits, and a cue to action as antecedents to the intention to perform preventive information security behaviors. The paper also discusses implications of the model and results for practitioners and possibilities for future research are included.", "paper_title": "Explaining Users' Security Behaviors with the Security Belief Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000343389000002"}
