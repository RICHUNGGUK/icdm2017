Color is used to guide attention via a top-down category-specific attention map in the top-down color attention (CA) method. To uniformly highlight the entire object, our color attention map is reconstructed based on the estimated object patches. The object patches consist of strong patches and false weak patches whose contextual color attention values are beyond the optimal threshold of class-specific contextual color attention. The color attention map constructed by the object color histogram is then used to weight the local shape for object recognition. Extensive experiments are conducted to show that our method can provide stateof-the-art results on several challenging datasets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
