First, we propose a design scheme for binary LCZ sequence sets with parameters (2(n+1) - 2, M, L, 2). In this scheme, we can freely set the LCZ length L and the resulting LCZ sequence sets have the size M, which is almost optimal with respect to Tang, Fan, and Matsufuji bound. Second, given a q-ary LCZ sequence set with parameters (N, M, L, epsilon) and even q, we construct another q-ary LCZ sequence set with parameters (2N,2M,L,2 epsilon) or (2N, 2M, L - 1, 2 epsilon). Especially, the new set with parameters (2N, 2M, L, 2) can be optimal in terms of the set size if a q-ary optimal LCZ sequence set with parameters (N, M, L, 1) is used.", "paper_title": "New design of low-correlation zone sequence sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000240776500020"}
