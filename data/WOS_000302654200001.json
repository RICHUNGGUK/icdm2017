It aims to enhance the coverage, per user throughput of IEEE 802.16e. Comparing with a base station (BS), RS does not need a wireline backhaul and has much lower hardware complexity. Moreover, using RSs can significantly reduce the deployment cost of the system. Unfortunately, there are some tradeoffs in the case of multi-hop RSs. Subscriber stations (SSs), located in a long distance, are suffered from the bottleneck of multi-hop, throughput degradation, and increasing of end-to-end delay. This paper proposes a network coding-based relay scheme for multi-hop relay networks, called NC-BR. It allows RSs to combine two wireless backhaul transmissions into one using the network coding technique. This paper also proposes an improved OFDMA frame structure design for the multi-hop relay network. This technique provides higher utilization for the relay zone by reorganizing the RSs transmission sequence. The analysis and simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme can enhance the throughput gain up to 140% and reduce the end-to-end delay by up to 83%. The simulation results also show that the proposed scheme can reduce the jitter by up to 58%.", "paper_title": "An Unbound Network Coding for Extended IEEE 802.16j Multihop Relay Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000302654200001"}
