The tool is based on a Tabu Search (TS) and the Nelder-Mead Downhill Simplex (NMDS) method. The local optima that result from the TS are fine-tuned with NMDS to reduce the required number of simulations. The tool has been applied to find the total refrigerant flow rate, composition and the refrigerant suction and condenser pressures that minimize the energy requirements of a Prico process. The main strength of this method is that it has a high probability of obtaining a better solution with significantly fewer simulation runs than other metaheuristic methods. Also, by changing the TS step size it is possible to influence the initial search pattern, thereby taking advantage of already gained process knowledge to decrease the optimization time. The method is general and can be applied to other processes modelled in Aspen HYSYS. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
