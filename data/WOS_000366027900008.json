Video affective content analysis can be divided into two approaches: direct and implicit. Direct approaches infer the affective content of videos directly from related audiovisual features. Implicit approaches, on the other hand, detect affective content from videos based on an automatic analysis of a user's spontaneous response while consuming the videos. This paper first proposes a general framework for video affective content analysis, which includes video content, emotional descriptors, and users' spontaneous nonverbal responses, as well as the relationships between the three. Then, we survey current research in both direct and implicit video affective content analysis, with a focus on direct video affective content analysis. Lastly, we identify several challenges in this field and put forward recommendations for future research.", "paper_title": "Video Affective Content Analysis: A Survey of State-of-the-Art Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000366027900008"}
