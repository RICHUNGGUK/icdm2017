By studying the distribution of the eigenvalues of the characteristic equation, we drive the critical values where Bogdanov-Takens (B-T) bifurcation and zero-Hopf bifurcation occur. The versal unfoldings of the normal forms at the singularity of B-T and a pure imaginary and a zero eigenvalue singularity are given, respectively. Some numerical simulations verify the theoretical results. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.
