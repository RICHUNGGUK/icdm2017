Good linearity is achieved in the proposed power and area efficient ADC without the use of resistors for compensation. The circuit performance was analyzed theoretically and verified experimentally. The measured DNL is within +/- 0.25 LSB and INL +/- 0.15 LSB. It occupies an area of 0.009 mm(2). With a sampling rate of 4 MHz, the ADC consumes 14 mu W with an ENOB of 4.1 and voltage sensing range from 0.87 V to 1.32 V.", "paper_title": "A POWER AND AREA EFFICIENT 65 nm CMOS DELAY-LINE ADC FOR ON-CHIP VOLTAGE SENSING", "paper_id": "WOS:000327669200015"}
