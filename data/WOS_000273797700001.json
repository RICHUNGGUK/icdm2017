The research objectives are (1) to examine neural networks, specifically Kohonen's self-organising maps (SOM), as an alternative to traditional statistical segmentation methods (hierarchical and non-hierarchical cluster analysis) and (2) to identify segments in the mature market which may direct its targeting. The results show the superiority of non-hierarchical clustering and SOM over hierarchical clustering, and demonstrate their complementary nature. In addition, significant segments with particular characteristics are found in the mature market.", "paper_title": "Mature market segmentation: a comparison of artificial neural networks and traditional methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000273797700001"}
