One of the most important issues in cooperative optimization algorithms is the task of decomposition. Decomposition decision regarding variable interdependencies plays a significant role in the algorithm's performance. Algorithms that do not consider variable interdependencies often lose their effectiveness and advantages when applied to solve nonseparable problems. In this paper, we propose a cooperative particle swarm optimizer with statistical variable interdependence learning (CPSO-SL). A statistical model is proposed to explore the interdependencies among variables. With these interdependencies, the algorithm partitions large scale problems into overlapping small scale subproblems. Moreover, a CPSO framework is proposed to optimize the subproblems cooperatively. Finally, theoretical analysis is presented for further understanding of the proposed CPSO-SL Simulated experiments were conducted on 10 classical benchmarks, 10 rotated classical benchmarks, and 10 CEC2005 benchmarks. The results demonstrate the performance of CPSO-SL in solving both separable and nonseparable problems, as compared with the performance of other recent cooperative optimization algorithms.
