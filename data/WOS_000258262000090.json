In our approach, a 3D input model is organized into an explosion graph that encodes how parts explode with respect to each other. We present an automatic method for computing explosion graphs that takes into account part hierarchies in the input models and handles common classes of interlocking parts. Our system also includes an interface that allows users to interactively explore our exploded views using both direct controls and higher-level interaction modes.", "paper_title": "Automated generation of interactive 3D exploded view diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000258262000090"}
