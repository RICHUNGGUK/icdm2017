Open-ended evolution was applied in the experiments, first. Many different behaviours were observed, which were very similar to those in nature, for instance: the escape of herbivore from predators, making herbivores route towards plants or a pursuit of predators after herbivores. Another interesting behaviour was grouping of predators around plants, where the probability of meeting herbivores is greater than in other places. But open-ended evolution and complex vision system of animal were not sufficient to observe flocking behaviour. The advanced behaviour such as creation of flocks appeared as a result of steered evolution. (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.
