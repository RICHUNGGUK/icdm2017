However, due to interoperability issues, the main problems of distributed data and information management across AEC companies and projects are yet to be overcome. This paper presents the Cloud-Marketplace concept, which expands on earlier developments combining BIM, SOA, Cloud Computing, and e-marketplaces in order to create interoperable communities of e-platforms. The Vortaway case study is described to demonstrate the validation of the concept in simple AEC e-procurement processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
