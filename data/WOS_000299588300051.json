The CFS signature is seen as one of the candidates of quantum immune signatures. In this letter, we show that the CFS signature is susceptible to both strong-key substitution attacks and weak-key substitution attacks. We also discuss potential countermeasures.", "paper_title": "Key Substitution Attacks on the CFS Signature", "paper_id": "WOS:000299588300051"}
