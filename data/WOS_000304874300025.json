A common-mode-sensing-and-input-interchanged OTA-sharing technique is proposed to address the non-resetting and successive-stage crosstalk issues in conventional OTA-sharing technique. Speed options of 5-45 MS/s are available with scalable power obtained by adjusting the bias currents for OTAs, comparators, and reference buffers, etc., or the global bias current. The measured signal-to-distortion-and-noise ratio is in range of 62.5-69.2 dB, and the peak spurious free dynamic range is 80.7 dB for all speed options, while the figure-of-merit is in the range of 0.26-0.49 pJ/conversion.
