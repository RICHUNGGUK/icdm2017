It is known that the problem of testing 1-planarity of a graph is NP-complete. In this paper, we study outer-1-planar graphs. A graph is outer-1-planar if it has an embedding in which every vertex is on the outer face and each edge has at most one crossing. We present a linear time algorithm to test whether a given graph is outer-1-planar. The algorithm can be used to produce an outer-1-planar embedding in linear time if it exists.", "paper_title": "A Linear-Time Algorithm for Testing Outer-1-Planarity", "paper_id": "WOS:000356461400007"}
