Current research in the field of business and information systems engineering (BISE), however, is primarily technology-or practice-oriented and concerned with the construction and validation of prototypes, whereas little attention is paid to theoretical insights into organizational phenomena and relationships. In this paper, we argue that paying more attention to organization theory would provide valuable guidance in addressing the close links between ICS on the one hand, and organizational systems on the other. To support our argument, we refer to selected theoretical perspectives and highlight their potential relevance to the BISE field.", "paper_title": "The Relevance of Organization Theory to the Field of Business and Information Systems Engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000270290800008"}
