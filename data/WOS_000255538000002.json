The system embeds a multi-criteria decision model and machine learning methods, and is designed to evaluate a partner's supply capability that can change over time and to maximize revenue with different procurement conditions across time periods. We apply the system to the procurement and management of the agricultural industry. The results are compared with real-world auction markets. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
