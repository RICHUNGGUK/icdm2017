Lee has found wide applications and frequent implementations in software packages. Later, several modifications have been introduced in order to improve its performance. In this paper we propose some new modifications trying to combine advantages of the original sigma and local statistic Lee filter as well as to ensure the filter robustness with respect to impulse noise. The basic performance characteristics of the proposed hybrid sigma filter are studied for cases of pure multiplicative noise. The comparison to some other well known filters is performed. A real life example of the designed filter application to side-look radar image is given.", "paper_title": "Hybrid sigma filter for processing images corrupted by multiplicative noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100005"}
