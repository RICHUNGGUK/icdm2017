Liu and Hai (Liu, F.H.F. and Hai, H.L., 2005. The voting analytic hierarchy process method for selecting supplier. International Journal of Production Economics, 97, 308-317) proposed a voting analytic hierarchy process method for selecting suppliers. Despite its many advantages, Liu and Hai's model (LH-model) has some shortcomings. In this article, the authors present an extended version of the LH-model for multi-criteria supplier selection problem. An illustrative example is presented to compare the authors' model and the LH-model.", "paper_title": "An improved voting analytic hierarchy process-data envelopment analysis methodology for suppliers selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000287695000001"}
