Subpopulations also often exist and contribute to heterogeneity in the data. In this paper, we propose a mixture of generalized latent variable models (GLVMs) to handle mixed types of heterogeneous data. Different link functions are specified to model data of multiple types. A Bayesian approach, together with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, is used to conduct the analysis. A modified DIC is used for model selection of mixture components in the GLVMs. A simulation study shows that our proposed methodology performs satisfactorily. An application of mixture GLVM to a data set from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth (NLSY) is presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
