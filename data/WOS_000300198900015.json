As a prerequisite of entering clinical use, its parameters need to be adjusted properly so that the procedure gives satisfactory results with limited computational resources and time available. This contribution introduces the principles of the method and reports on the results of extensive computational studies aimed at finding optimal settings of the numerical scheme and model parameters with respect to visualization purposes. Total variation is used as a measure of visual quality of the produced images. Further, we provide evidence that using the algorithm is fully feasible on state of the art hardware. Finally, high resolution visualizations based on real data are demonstrated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
