Design/methodology/approach - An adaptive mutation factor and attractive/repulsive phases guided by population diversity are used within the framework of DE algorithms. Findings - The paper shows that the combined use of adaptive mutation factors and population diversity in order to guide the attractive/repulsive behavior of DE algorithms can provide high-quality solutions with small standard deviation on the selected benchmark problem. Research limitations/implications - Although the chosen benchmark is considered to be representative of typical electromagnetic problems, different test cases may give less satisfactory results. Practical implications - The proposed approach appears to be an efficient general purpose stochastic optimizer for electromagnetic design problems. Originality/value - This paper introduces the use of population diversity in order to guide the attractive/repulsive behavior of DE algorithms.", "paper_title": "Electromagnetic optimization based on an improved diversity-guided differential evolution approach and adaptive mutation factor", "paper_id": "WOS:000270210500002"}
