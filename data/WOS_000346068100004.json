Design/methodology/approach - Sample data for this study were collected from students enrolled in a comprehensive university in Taiwan. A total of 600 questionnaires were distributed in the campus library, and 525 (87.5 percent) usable questionnaires were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) in this study. Findings - Findings show that the proposed research model integrating ECM, TAM, and updated DeLone and McLean IS success model has good explanatory power for quality antecedents of users' continuance intention of the digital library. Information relevance, system accessibility, and technical support play key roles in explaining users' continuance intention of the digital library via their beliefs. Originality/value - This study's empirical evidence on capturing ECM, TAM, and updated DeLone and McLean IS success model reveals deep insights into quality evaluation for users' continuance intention of the digital library. Especially, this study additionally contributes to the identification of interface features that may lead to users' continuance intention of the digital library.", "paper_title": "Why do users intend to continue using the digital library?
