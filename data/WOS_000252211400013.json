The algorithm is based on discrete wavelet transform and communication model with side information. The algorithm uses a suitable scale factor to scale a host image, constructs cosets for embedding a watermark according to the scale version of the host image. Our scheme makes a tradeoff between imperceptibility and robustness while achieving large watermark capacity. The extraction algorithm is a blind detection algorithm which retrieves the watermark without the host image. In this paper, we also propose a new method that encrypts a watermark by hyperchaotic sequences to overcome the drawback of chaotic sequences which key space is smaller than that of hyperchaotic sequences and improve the algorithm security. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm possesses good imperceptibility, large capacity, and robustness against general signal processing attacks.", "paper_title": "A blind watermarking algorithm based on hyperchaos and coset by quantizing wavelet transform coefficients", "paper_id": "WOS:000252211400013"}
