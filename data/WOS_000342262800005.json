For NSPDSs with Poisson noise, the robust H-infinity control design needs to solve a complex Hamilton-Jacobi integral inequality (HJII) for robust control despite random external disturbance. In general, it is very difficult to solve the nonlinear partial differential HJII. In order to simplify the design procedure, a fuzzy stochastic partial differential system is proposed to approximate the NSPDS based on fuzzy interpolation approach. Then a fuzzy stochastic spatial state space model is developed to represent the fuzzy stochastic partial differential system via the semi-discretization finite difference scheme and the Kronecker product. Based on this model the robust H-infinity control design is proposed to achieve the robust control of NSPDSs via solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) instead of an HMI. The proposed robust fuzzy H-infinity controller has an efficient ability to attenuate the effect of spatio-temporal external disturbance on the controlled output of NSPDSs from the area energy point of view. Finally, a robust H-infinity control of the nervous system is given to confirm the control performance of the proposed robust control design method for NSPDSs with Poisson noise.
