From the UML system specification, they produce a generalized stochastic Petri net (GSPN) performance model for assessing an FT application's QoS via stochastic analysis. The ArgoSPE tool provides support for the proposed technique, helping to automatically produce the GSPN model.", "paper_title": "QoS assessment via stochastic analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000237731900005"}
