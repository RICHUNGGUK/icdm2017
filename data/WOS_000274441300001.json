All messages must be successfully received by their intended receivers, and the confidential messages must be kept as secret as possible from non-intended recipients. Various scenarios are considered in the context of two-user broadcast channels, for which known results on the secrecy capacity region are reviewed and corresponding coding schemes for achieving rates in these regions are described.
