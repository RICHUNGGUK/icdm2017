The acidic titratable residues pKa prediction and the ligand binding poses investigation in two systems (pH 7 and pH 5) are studied by constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) and molecular docking methods. Research results reveal that the change of the protonation states would disrupt some important H-bonds, such as Asp 66-Asp 70, Glu 105-Asn 102, etc. The cleavage of these H-bonds leads to the movement of the relative position of hydrophobic tunnel, N- and C- termini loops and pH-sensing triad (His23-Tyr54-Val125) in acid solution. Ligand MOP has lower affinity and shows different binding poses to protein CquiOBP1 at pH 5. This ligand may be released from another tunnel between helices alpha 3 and alpha 4 in acidic environment. However, it would bind to the protein with high affinity in neutral environment. This work could provide more penetrating understanding of the pH-induced ligand-releasing mechanism.", "paper_title": "Constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) and molecular docking studies of CquiOBP1 pH-induced ligand releasing mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000315349800032"}
