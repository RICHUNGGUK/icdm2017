James Currie (2008) [2] showed that for each sparse set A and every subset P subset of A there exists a ternary square-free word w(P) such that a palindrome of length three starts at position i is an element of A in w(P) if and only if i is an element of P. We provide a simpler proof of this result that also works for shorter distances between the positions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
