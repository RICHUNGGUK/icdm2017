Segmentation is traditionally done by linear interpolation in order to guarantee the continuity of the reconstructed time series. The interpolation-based segmentation methods may perform poorly for data with a level of noise because interpolation is noise sensitive. To handle the problem, this paper establishes an explicit expression for segmentation from a compact representation for piecewise linear functions using hinging hyperplanes. This expression enables the use of regression to obtain a continuous reconstructed signal and, as a consequence, application of advanced techniques in segmentation. In this paper, a least squares support vector machine with lasso using a hinging feature map is given and analyzed, based on which a segmentation algorithm and its online version are established. Numerical experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of our methods compared to existing segmentation algorithms.", "paper_title": "Hinging Hyperplanes for Time-Series Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000322039500009"}
