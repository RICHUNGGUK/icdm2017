This allows us to give a compact representation of them, and to describe the set of C-infinity-words through an infinite directed acyclic graph G. This graph is defined by a map acting on the frontiers of C-infinity-words. We show that this map can be defined recursively and with no explicit reference to C-infinity-words. We then show that some important conjectures on C-infinity-words follow from analogous statements on the structure of the graph G. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
