The modified genetic algorithm in which crossover and mutation are performed conditionally instead of probabilistically has higher global and local search ability and is more easily applied to a problem than the conventional genetic algorithms. Three optimization problems are used to test the performances of the modified genetic algorithm. Experimental studies show that the modified genetic algorithm produces better results over the conventional one and other methods.", "paper_title": "A genetic algorithm with conditional crossover and mutation operators and its application to combinatorial optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243703300033"}
