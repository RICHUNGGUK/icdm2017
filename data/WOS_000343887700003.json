In comparison to previous work, we propose and explore the impact of hot-data access, sibling-link updates, and different workload types to a tree index structure over flash memory. In particular, a flash-friendly - tree, referred to as an Adaptive Durable - tree, is proposed to not only improve the endurance but also the performance of a tree index structure. The capability of the proposed methodology and index design is evaluated through a series of experiments, in which significant improvement on endurance was achieved in comparison to previous reports on the subject.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Endurance-Aware B+-Tree for Flash Memory Storage Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000343887700003"}
