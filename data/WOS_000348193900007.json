The two common factors that are generally concerned with such models are the size of the training dataset and the selection of different examples in the training set. The representational power (RP) of an example-based model is its capability to depict a new 3D face for a given 2D face image. The RP of the model can be increased by correspondingly increasing the number of training samples. In this contribution, a novel approach is proposed to increase the RP of the 3D face reconstruction model by deforming a set of examples in the training dataset. A PCA-based 3D face model is adapted for each new near frontal input face image to reconstruct the 3D face shape. Further an extended Tikhonov regularisation method has been employed to reconstruct 3D face shapes from a set of facial points. The results justify that the proposed adaptive PCA-based model considerably improves the RP of the standard PCA-based model and outperforms it with a 95% confidence level.", "paper_title": "Adaptive face modelling for reconstructing 3D face shapes from single 2D images", "paper_id": "WOS:000348193900007"}
