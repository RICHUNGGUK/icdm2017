In this paper, we propose a very fast multi-people tracking algorithm designed to be applied on mobile service robots. Our approach exploits RGB-D data and can run in real-time at very high frame rate on a standard laptop without the need for a GPU implementation. It also features a novel depth-based sub-clustering method which allows to detect people within groups or even standing near walls. Moreover, for limiting drifts and track ID switches, an online learning appearance classifier is proposed featuring a three-term joint likelihood. We compared the performances of our system with a number of state-of-the-art tracking algorithms on two public datasets acquired with three static Kinects and a moving stereo pair, respectively. In order to validate the 3D accuracy of our system, we created a new dataset in which RGB-D data are acquired by a moving robot. We made publicly available this dataset which is not only annotated by hand, but the ground-truth position of people and robot are acquired with a motion capture system in order to evaluate tracking accuracy and precision in 3D coordinates. Results of experiments on these datasets are presented, showing that, even without the need for a GPU, our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and superior speed.", "paper_title": "Fast RGB-D people tracking for service robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000340409000001"}
