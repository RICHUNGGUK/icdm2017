In this paper, we present a co-synthesis approach targeting MPSoCs and distributed memory multiprocessor architectures for high performance embedded applications. Our co-synthesis approach produces pipelined multiprocessor architectures consisting of heterogeneous processing elements connected by a point-to-point communication structure. The co-synthesis process consists of four distinct phases; processing element selection for addition to the system, pipelined task allocation, scheduling and a regular interconnection topology mapping. Initially, an irregular topology is generated that is mapped to a regular architecture. Our co-synthesis methodology performs system partitioning and produces an irregular topology multiprocessor system. It also generates an optimal (or sub-optimal) regular topology architecture after considering some of the well-known regular topologies like mesh, hypercube, tree, etc. The co-synthesis method is demonstrated by exploring embedded architectures for MPEG encoder and artificially generated application task graphs representing complex embedded systems.", "paper_title": "CAD tool for hardware software co-synthesis of heterogeneous multiple processor embedded architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000261375300003"}
