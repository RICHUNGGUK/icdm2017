Working with inductive Turing machines of various orders [1] instead of classical computations, we propose a class of inductive complexity classes for mathematical statements which generalise the previous method. In particular, the new method is capable to classify Pi(2)-statements. As illustrations, we evaluate the inductive complexity of the Collatz and twin prime conjecture - statements which cannot not be evaluated with the original method.", "paper_title": "INDUCTIVE COMPLEXITY MEASURES FOR MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000322770800005"}
