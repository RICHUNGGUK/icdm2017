We study the continuous collision detection (CCD) problem of a special type of CQM objects which are commonly used in CAD/CAM, with their boundary surfaces intersect only in straight line segments or conic curve segments. We derive algebraic formulations and compute numerically the first contact time instants and the contact points of two moving CQMs in R-3. Since it is difficult to process CCD of two CQMs in a direct manner because they are composed of semi-algebraic varieties, we break down the problem into subproblems of solving CCD of pairs of boundary elements of the CQMs. We present procedures to solve CCD of different types of boundary element pairs in different dimensions. Some CCD problems are reduced to their equivalents in a lower dimensional setting, where they can be solved more efficiently. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
