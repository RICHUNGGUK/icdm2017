Like many existing results, the controller optimizes an infinite-horizon objective function respecting input constraint. The infinite-horizon control moves are parameterized as a free control move followed by an output feedback based on the prespecified state estimator. While the use of a free control move is well practiced in the existing research works of model predictive control (MPC), it was not previously applied in the output feedback MPC when: 1) the future model parameters are uncertain; and 2) the recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability are guaranteed. A key point for us to overcome this difficulty is to introduce a formula for refreshing the bound of the estimation error. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed output feedback controller.", "paper_title": "Output Feedback Predictive Control With One Free Control Move for Nonlinear Systems Represented by a Takagi-Sugeno Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000334178800002"}
