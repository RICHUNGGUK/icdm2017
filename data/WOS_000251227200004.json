However, it is not efficient to directly apply Doppler diversity into Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) systems because Inter-Carrier-Interference (ICI) increases with the artificial frequency shifts in diversity branches. In this paper, a novel Doppler diversity scheme in MC-CDMA with Three Zero Correlation Zones (T-ZCZ) sequences is proposed to further improve the performance of Doppler diversity. Particularly, zero correlation zones a re employed in frequency domain for ICI cancelation caused by Doppler spread, which confirms the validity of the contribution to the wideband wireless communications in high speed mobile environment.", "paper_title": "Doppler diversity in MC-CDMA systems with T-ZCZ sequences for Doppler spread cancelation", "paper_id": "WOS:000251227200004"}
