Bilayer LDPC codes are devised to approach the theoretically promised rate of the DF relaying strategy by incorporating relay-generated parity bits in specially designed bilayer graphical code structures. While conventional LDPC codes are sensitively tuned to operate efficiently at a certain channel parameter, the proposed bilayer LDPC codes are capable of working at two different channel parameters and two different rates: that at the relay and at the destination. To analyze the performance of bilayer LDPC codes, bilayer density evolution is devised as an extension of the standard density evolution algorithm. Based on bilayer density evolution, a design methodology is developed for the bilayer codes in which the degree distribution is iteratively improved using linear programming. Further, in order to approach to the theoretical DF rate for a wide range of channel parameters, this paper proposes two different forms of bilayer codes: the bilayer-expurgated and bilayer-lengthened codes. It is demonstrated that the rate of a properly designed bilayer LDPC code can closely approach the theoretical DF limit. Finally, it is shown that a generalized version of the proposed bilayer code construction is applicable to relay networks with multiple relays.", "paper_title": "Bilayer low-density parity-check codes for decode-and-forward in relay channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000249774000024"}
