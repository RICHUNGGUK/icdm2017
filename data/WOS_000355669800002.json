We introduce Reconfiguration Data Flow Graph, a hierarchical graph structure enabling reconfigurable designs to be synthesised in three steps: function analysis, configuration organisation, and runtime solution generation. The synthesised reconfigurable designs are dynamically evaluated and selected under various runtime conditions. Three applications-barrier option pricing, particle filter, and reverse time migration-are used in evaluating the proposed approach. The runtime solutions approximate their theoretical performance by eliminating idle functions and are 1.31 to 2.19 times faster than optimised static designs. FPGA designs developed with the proposed approach are up to 43.8 times faster than optimised CPU reference designs and 1.55 times faster than optimised GPU designs.", "paper_title": "Automating Elimination of Idle Functions by Runtime Reconfiguration", "paper_id": "WOS:000355669800002"}
