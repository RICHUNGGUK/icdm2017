It supports PCTL and CSL model checking, and their reward extensions. Distinguishing features of MRMC are its support for computing time- and reward-bounded reachability probabilities, (property-driven) bisimulation minimization, and precise on-the-fly steady-state detection. Recent tool features include time-bounded reachability analysis for continuous-time Markov decision processes (CTMDPs) and CSL model checking by discrete-event simulation. This paper presents the tool's current status and its implementation details. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
