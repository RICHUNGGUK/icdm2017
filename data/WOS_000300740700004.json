A pseudo-polynomial time solution algorithm is proposed for a special case of this problem. Moreover, we present a new graphical algorithm for another special case, which corresponds to the classical problem of minimizing the weighted number of tardy jobs on a single machine. The latter algorithm improves the complexity of an existing pseudo-polynomial algorithm by Lawler. Computational results are presented for both special cases considered. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
