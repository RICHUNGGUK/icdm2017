We propose a stress test procedure for a set of feature selection methods. This procedure generates test data sets with various configurations of the target vector and features. This procedure provides more complex investigations of feature selection methods than procedures described in papers previously. A number of some multicollinear features are inserted in every configuration. A feature selection method results in a set of selected features for a given test data set. To compare given feature selection methods the procedure uses several quality measures. A criterion of the selected feature redundancy is proposed. This criterion estimates the number of multicollinear features among the selected ones. To detect multicollinearity it uses the eigensystem of the parameter covariance matrix. In computational experiments we consider the following illustrative methods: Lasso, ElasticNet, LARS, Ridge, Stepwise and Genetic algorithms and determine the best one, which solves the multicollinearity problem for every considered data set configuration.
