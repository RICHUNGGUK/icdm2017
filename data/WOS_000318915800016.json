This service tends to be invisible from users in everyday life. Ubiquitous computing uses sensors extensively to provide important information such that applications can adjust their behavior. A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been applied to implement such an architecture. To ensure continuous service, a dynamic N threshold power saving method for WSN is developed. A threshold N has been derived to obtain minimum power consumption for the sensor node while considering each different data arrival rate. We proposed a theoretical analysis regarding the probability variation for each state considering different arrival rate, service rate and collision probability. Several experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our research. Our method can be applied to prolong the service time of a ubiquitous computing network to cope with the network disconnection issue. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
