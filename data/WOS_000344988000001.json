It has been shown that FLDA is asymptotically Bayes optimal under the homoscedastic Gaussian assumption. However, this classical result has the following two major limitations: 1) it holds only for a fixed dimensionality D, and thus does not apply when D and the training sample size N are proportionally large; 2) it does not provide a quantitative description on how the generalization ability of FLDA is affected by D and N. In this paper, we present an asymptotic generalization analysis of FLDA based on random matrix theory, in a setting where both D and N increase and D/N --> gamma is an element of vertical bar 0, 1). The obtained lower bound of the generalization discrimination power overcomes both limitations of the classical result, i.e., it is applicable when D and N are proportionally large and provides a quantitative description of the generalization ability of FLDA in terms of the ratio gamma = D/N and the population discrimination power. Besides, the discrimination power bound also leads to an upper bound on the generalization error of binary-classification with FLDA.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic Generalization Bound of Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000344988000001"}
