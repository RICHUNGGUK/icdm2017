Ethernet architectures based on routing over a virtual topology in which turns are prohibited offer improved performance over spanning tree, although in some cases suffer from excessive computational complexity. Up/Down routing is a turn prohibition algorithm with low computational complexity. In this paper we propose HURBA, a new layer-two architecture that improves Up/Down routing performance due to an optimization based on the use of hierarchical addressing, while preserving the computational complexity of Up/Down. The resulting architecture requires zero-configuration, uses the same frame format as Ethernet, allows upgrades by software update, and is compatible with 802.1D bridges by means of encapsulation. HURP protocol builds automatically a core with the interconnected HURP routing bridges and the standard bridges get connected to the edges in standard spanning trees. Simulations show that the performance of HURP, evaluated over various combinations of network topology and size, is close to the one of shortest path, is consistently better than that of Up/Down, and is equal or better than Turn Prohibition, with the advantage of having a lower complexity.
