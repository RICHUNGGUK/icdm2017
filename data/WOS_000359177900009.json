They require users to disclose almost all their personal information. Organizations on the other hand will collect, process, and store a huge amount of this information, which results in a greater risk of information disclosure. Enforcing personal information protection in databases requires controlled access to systems and resources and is only granted to authorized users. Previous research on purpose-based access control does not fully support personal data protection, especially users' rights and less user participation towards their personal data once it is released via web applications. This paper formulates a solution to control access while ensuring that personal data is protected and that users have full control over their own data This model, which implements two-phase security involving user authentication using personal credential and data authorization based on purpose, is presented. The purpose of this model is to protect personal information that has been collected via web-based applications by using data access control.", "paper_title": "CREDENTIAL PURPOSE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000359177900009"}
