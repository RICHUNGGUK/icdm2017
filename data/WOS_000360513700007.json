So-called column strips and cable strips model the towers and cables respectively. Also, the structural interactions between different components can be considered in the analysis by defining so-called transition sections. The static and free vibration analyses are performed for Kap Shui Mun Bridge by the integrated finite strip method. The numerical results are verified against other methods. The proposed solution proves to be very efficient in yielding accurate results, in a minimum amount of time while the convergence of the method is still very high. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
