For overcoming this limit in applications this paper presents a pose-free face swapping method based on personalized 3D face modeling. By using a deformable 3D shape morphable model, a photo-realistic 3D face is reconstructed from a single frontal view image. With the aid of the generated 3D face, a virtual source image of the person with the same pose as the target face can be rendered, which is used as a source image for face swapping. To solve the problem of illumination difference between the target face and the source face, a color transfer merging method is proposed. It outperforms the original color transfer method in dealing with the illumination gap problem. An experiment shows that the proposed face reconstruction method is fast and efficient. In addition, we have conducted experiments of face swapping in a variety of scenarios such as children's story book, role play, and face de-identification stripping facial information used for identification, and promising results have been obtained.", "paper_title": "Pose-Free Face Swapping Based on a Deformable 3D Shape Morphable Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000331344100013"}
