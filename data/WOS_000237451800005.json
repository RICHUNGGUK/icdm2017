Multiple clusterings are performed on random subspaces, approximately preserving the distances between the projected data, and then they are combined using a pairwise similarity matrix; in this way the accuracy of each \"base\" clustering is maintained, and the diversity between them is improved. The proposed approach is effective for clustering problems characterized by high dimensional data, as shown by our preliminary experimental results.", "paper_title": "Ensembles based on random projections to improve the accuracy of clustering algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000237451800005"}
