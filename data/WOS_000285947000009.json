Nevertheless, high-frequency large-signal measurement systems are very expensive, have limited frequency, and, moreover, when the identification of a nonlinear model is the measurement purpose, reactive parasitic elements tend to hide the most important nonlinearity source: the \"intrinsic drain current source\". In order to overcome these problems, an alternative nonlinear measurement setup based on large-signal sinusoidal excitation at low-frequency (e.g., a few megahertz) is here proposed to characterize the intrinsic electron device behavior. Different experimental examples, carried out on both field-effect and bipolar transistors, are here provided in order to clearly demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed electron-device characterization technique.
