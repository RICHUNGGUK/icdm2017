SM is an optimization method well suited for very costly problems to find an improved design with fulfilled constraints. The SM technique use less costly models, which complements the correct models. The theory is established and compared to the corrected RSM. A multipoint version of SM is presented, where a separate evaluation is done in each iteration to improve the mapping function. Using this additional evaluation to update the mapping function, generally, the number of iterations to find the optimum solution can be reduced. Thus, the elapsed time to solve the optimization problem can be reduced if a parallel computer is utilized. Finally, one engineering optimization problem is solved to illustrate the application of SM in vehicle crashworthiness structural optimization.", "paper_title": "A multipoint version of space mapping optimization applied to vehicle crashworthiness design", "paper_id": "WOS:000234753100005"}
