Existing convergecast solutions have focused on reducing latency and energy consumption. However, a good design should be compliant to standards, in addition to considering these factors. Based on this observation, this paper defines a minimum delay beacon scheduling problem for quick convergecast in ZigBee tree-based wireless sensor networks and proves that this problem is NP-complete. Our formulation is compliant with the low-power design of IEEE 802.15.4. We then propose optimal solutions for special cases and heuristic algorithms for general cases. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can indeed achieve quick convergecast. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
