A stable integral sliding surface is first constructed. An adaptive control technique is used to adapt the unknown upper bounds of perturbations. Furthermore, adaptive variable structure controllers are employed such that the switched delay system containing perturbations with unknown upper bounds tracks the reference model under arbitrary switching signals. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.", "paper_title": "Model reference adaptive integral sliding mode control for switched delay systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000258427400018"}
