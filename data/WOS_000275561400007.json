A step-by-step time-domain solution procedure is established, based on the convolution between the Green functions of the problem and the vector of external loads. The Green functions are implicitly calculated in the frequency domain. The accuracy is significantly improved when compared with traditional direct integration methods, or with other methods based on the Green approach. This is due to the accurate calculation of the Green functions in the frequency domain, and to enhancements in the representation of the convolution integral. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
