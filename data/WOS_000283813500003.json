To complement existing solutions to this problem, the Multi-Point Relays (MPR) selection has recently been advocated as a promising technique that has an additional feature of reducing the number of redundant re-transmission occurring in the network. This paper continuous on the investigation of an existing MPR-based solution, arguing that by considering a cost factor as an additional decision parameter in selecting the MPR nodes, the enhanced MPR selection algorithm leads to less packet loss in the network. Simulation experiments are presented to validate the stated goal, using the average packet loss ratio as the performance metric.", "paper_title": "An enhanced MPR-based solution for flooding of broadcast messages in OLSR wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000283813500003"}
