Grammatical inference is the process of learning a grammar from the set of positive and optionally negative sentences. Learning general context-free grammars is still considered a hard problem in machine learning and is not completely solved yet. The main contribution of the paper is a newly developed memetic algorithm, which is a population-based evolutionary algorithm enhanced with local search and a generalization process. The learning process is incremental since a new grammar is obtained from the current grammar and false negative samples, which are not parsed by the current grammar. Despite being incremental, the learning process is not sensitive to the order of samples. All important parts of this algorithm are explained and discussed. Finally, a case study of a domain specific language for rendering graphical objects is used to show the applicability of this approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
