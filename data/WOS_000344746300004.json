Our starting observation is that enumerative MIP methods naturally tend to explore a neighborhood around the solution of a relaxation. A better heuristic performance can however be expected by searching a neighborhood of an integer solution-a result that we obtain by just modifying the objective function of the problem at hand. The relationship of this approach with primal integer methods is also addressed. Promising computational results on different proof-of-concept implementations are presented, suggesting that proximity search can be quite effective in quickly refining a given feasible solution. This is particularly true when a sequence of similar MIPs has to be solved as, e.g., in a column-generation setting.", "paper_title": "Proximity search for 0-1 mixed-integer convex programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000344746300004"}
