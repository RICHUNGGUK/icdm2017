Decision support systems are quantitative tools for managers to evaluate outcomes of their policies prior to implementation. Our fishery model considers multiple stocks and fisheries simultaneously in balancing catch among targeted and protected fish abundances. Since in the Northeastern US multispecies fishery the distribution of abundance, catch-per-unit-effort and bycatch vary geographically, we focus oil a spatial management approach to address their spatial variability. The core component of this DSS applies operations research techniques of simulation and optimization to determine the optimal inter-annual and intra-annual fishing plans in terms of fishing efforts in each sub-area and the time period. The result is the recommended amount to catch from each fish species at each sub-area at any time period so that while management objectives for sustainability of fish stocks are satisfied, the value of landings is maximized. The graphical user interface of the proposed DSS helps users to define inputs, to set constraints and sub-area boundaries, and to visualize the outcomes. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
