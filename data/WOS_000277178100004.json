Several approaches have been proposed for reasoning on default theories. This paper focuses on a possibilistic approach, and more precisely on the MSP-entailment (where MSP stands for Minimum Specificity Principle) from default theories which is equivalent to System P augmented by rational monotony. In order to make this entailment tractable from a computational point of view, we propose here a compilation of default theories with respect to a target compilation language. This allows us to provide polynomial algorithms to derive efficiently the MSP-conclusions of a compiled default theory. Moreover, the proposed compilation is qualified to be flexible since it efficiently takes advantage of any classical compiler and generally provides a low recompilation cost when updating a compiled default theory.", "paper_title": "A New Default Theories Compilation for MSP-Entailment", "paper_id": "WOS:000277178100004"}
