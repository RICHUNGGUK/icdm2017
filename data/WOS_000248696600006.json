A phase-compensating single layer lens and a quarter-wave phase-compensating multilayer dielectric lens, which uses four types of materials and a zoned structure, was designed using GP. The dielectric lens shape was designed using GP strategy, with a random initial shape, to compensate for the phase error of the multilayer dielectric lens and to achieve the required performance. Standard GP (SGP) and hierarchical fair competition genetic programming (HFC-GP) was applied to obtain the solution. The results show that this novel method of microwave lens shape design using GP is both accurate and stable. In addition, the simulation results of using high frequency simulation software (HFSS) are illustrated and compared.
