The scheduling problem is considered as a network utility maximization (NUM) problem subject to link rate constraints. By jointly taking into account of the link scheduling and the statistical variations of signal and interference power, the convex sets for the NUM are derived. Two types of non-deterministic fading channels (i.e., Rayleigh fading channel and Ricean fading channel) are characterized into our NUM models as examples. To solve the convex optimization problem, the subgradient projection method based on dual decomposition is employed. Then, a heuristic algorithm is designed for the TDM mode wireless multi-hop networks by minimizing the discrepancy between the expected network cost and the optimal one in each timeslot. At last, the source-destination session rate and network utility are evaluated in a dedicated wireless multi-hop network scenario. The numerical results demonstrate that the session rates convergence and the network utility is improved by our proposed scheme. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
