An upgraded HOPR is being developed with the goal of handling 100 Gbps optical packets with a high energy efficiency of 90 mW/Gbps and low latency of less than 100 ns. The architecture of HOPR and its enabling technologies are reviewed, including a label processor, optical switch, and optoelectronic shared buffer. We also explain the concept and operation mechanisms of both the data and control planes in the hybrid OPS/OCS/VOCS torus network. The performance of these three transmission modes is evaluated by numerical simulations for a network composed of 4096 HOPRs.", "paper_title": "Torus Data Center Network With Smart Flow Control Enabled by Hybrid Optoelectronic Routers", "paper_id": "WOS:000367820900004"}
