We demonstrate how the simplicial homology of a shape can be effectively expressed in terms of the homology of its sub-components. The proposed algorithm retrieves the complete homological information of an input shape including the Betti numbers, the torsion coefficients and the representative homology generators. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm based on the constructive Mayer-Vietoris sequence, which relates the homology of a topological space to the homologies of its sub-spaces, i.e. the sub-components of the input shape and their intersections. We demonstrate the validity of our approach through a specific shape decomposition, based only on topological properties, which minimizes the size of the intersections between the sub-components and increases the efficiency of the algorithm.
