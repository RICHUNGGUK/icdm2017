Findings from the 2002 Computer Crime and Security Survey show an upward trend that demonstrates a need for a timely review of existing approaches to fighting this new phenomenon in the information age. In this paper, we define different types of cybercrime and review previous research and current status of fighting cybercrime in different countries that rely on legal, organizational, and technological approaches. We focus on a case study of fighting cybercrime in Taiwan and discuss problems faced. Finally, we propose several recommendations to advance the work of fighting cybercrime. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.
