The corresponding distance transform algorithm is similar in its form to classical propagation-based algorithms, but the more variable distance increments are either stored in look-up-tables or computed on-the-fly. These distances and distance transform extend neighborhood-sequence distances, chamfer distances and generalized distances based on Minkowski sums. We introduce algorithms to compute a translated version of a neighborhood sequence distance map both for periodic and aperiodic sequences and a method to derive the centered distance map. A decomposition of the grid neighbors, in Z(2) and Z(3), allows to significantly decrease the number of displacement vectors needed for the distance transform. Overall, the distance transform can be computed with minimal delay, without the need to wait for the whole input image before beginning to provide the result image. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
