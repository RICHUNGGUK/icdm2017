How many edges of G can be packed with edge-disjoint copies of K(k)? More specifically, let f(k)(n, m) be the largest integer t such that, for any graph with n vertices, rn edges, and independence number 2, at least t edges can be packed with edge-disjoint copies of Kk. Turan's theorem together with Wilson's Theorem assert that f(k)(n, m) = (1 - o(1))n(2)/4 if m approximate to n(2)/4. A conjecture of Erdos states that f(3)(n,m) >= (1 -o(1))n(2)/4- for all plausible in. For any epsilon approximate to 0, this conjecture was open even if 4 m <= n(2) (1/4 + epsilon). Generally, f(k)(n, m) maybe significantly smaller than n(2)/4. Indeed,fork = 7itis 4 easy to show that f(7)(n,m) <= 21/90 n(2) for m approximate to 0.3n(2.) Nevertheless, we prove the following result. For every k >= 3 there exists gamma > 0 such that if m <= n(2) (1/4 + gamma) then f(k)(n, m) >= (1 - o(1)) n(2)/4 4 T. In the special case k = 3 we obtain the reasonable bound gamma >= 10(-4). In particular, the above conjecture of Erdos holds whenever G has fewer than 0.2501n(2) edges.", "paper_title": "Packing cliques in graphs with independence number 2", "paper_id": "WOS:000249255900010"}
