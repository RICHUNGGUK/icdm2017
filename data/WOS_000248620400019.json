Based on a simulation test for the reported algorithms, we classified and implemented three main statistical methods consisting of the z-statistic, gene permutation and sample permutation for ten gene set categories including Gene Ontology (GO) for human, mouse, rat and yeast. This tool identifies significantly altered gene sets scored by z-statistics and P-values from the z-test or permutation test and provides q-values and Bonferroni P-values to correct multiple hypothesis testing. GAzer allows users to observe changes in expression of each gene in a gene set or to see the significance of the gene sets containing a gene(s) of interest, thus allowing interactive data analysis both at the gene and gene set level. Moreover, GAzer offers extensive annotation for each gene.", "paper_title": "GAzer: gene set analyzer", "paper_id": "WOS:000248620400019"}
