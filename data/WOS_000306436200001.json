Telecommunication service industry includes such ubiquitous network infrastructure and most of related services, and it leads to simultaneous growth of network, terminal, software and contents etc., by placing at the top of value chain of IT industry. In this special issue, we have discussed current IT-related issues, policy trends and new industrial services which will lead to successful transfer toward intelligent ubiquitous society which is a new paradigm of future.", "paper_title": "Intelligent ubiquitous IT policy and its industrial services", "paper_id": "WOS:000306436200001"}
