Some of these models concerns visual saliency which is potentially very interesting in a lot of applications like robotics, image analysis, compression, video indexing. Unfortunately they are compute intensive with tight real-time requirements. Among all the existing models, we have chosen a spatio-temporal one combining static and dynamic information. We propose in this paper a very efficient implementation of this model with multi-GPU reaching real-time. We present the algorithms of the model as well as several parallel optimizations on GPU with higher precision and execution time results. The real-time execution of this multi-path model on multi-GPU makes it a powerful tool to facilitate many vision related applications.", "paper_title": "Parallel implementation of a spatio-temporal visual saliency model", "paper_id": "WOS:000287360200002"}
