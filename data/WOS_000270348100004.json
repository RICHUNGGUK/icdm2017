Starting from a minimal set of axioms that these operators must fulfill, we investigate which properties they satisfy. We also investigate some classes of t-norms on L(1) which can be generated using these operators; these classes provide natural extensions of the Lukasiewicz, product, Frank, Schweizer-Sklar and Yager t-norms to L(1).
