However, today's digital microfluidic biochips suffer from the drawback that there is no feedback to the control software from the underlying hardware platform. Due to the lack of precision inherent in biochemical experiments, errors are likely during droplet manipulation; error recovery based on the repetition of experiments leads to wastage of expensive reagents and hard-to-prepare samples. By exploiting recent advances in the integration of optical detectors (sensors) into a digital microfluidics biochip, we present a physical-aware system reconfiguration technique that uses sensor data at intermediate checkpoints to dynamically reconfigure the biochip. A cyberphysical resynthesis technique is used to recompute electrode-actuation sequences, thereby deriving new schedules, module placement, and droplet routing pathways, with minimum impact on the time-to-response.", "paper_title": "Error Recovery in Cyberphysical Digital Microfluidic Biochips", "paper_id": "WOS:000314676500006"}
