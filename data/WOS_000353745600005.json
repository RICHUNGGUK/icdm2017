So does the topology. In this paper, we describe the exploration flow of task mapping algorithms using different NoC mesh shapes. The flow is used to evaluate timing and energy consumption based on a NoC emulation platform. It is open to any task mapping algorithms and to any shapes of NoC mesh. A heterogeneous (PC and FPGA) platform is used to fully perform each step of the flow. The experiments demonstrate that the most appropriate task mapping strategy and the most suitable NoC shape strongly depend on the algorithm used. Depending on the timing latency results obtained and the FPGA resources used, the designer can select the appropriate task mapping strategy on the suitable shape in a short exploration time and with precise timing evaluation.
