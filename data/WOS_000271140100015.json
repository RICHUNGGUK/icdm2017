It produces segments that, on one hand, respect local image boundaries, while, on the other hand, limiting undersegmentation through a compactness constraint. It is very fast, with complexity that is approximately linear in image size, and can be applied to megapixel sized images with high superpixel densities in a matter of minutes. We show qualitative demonstrations of high-quality results on several complex images. The Berkeley database is used to quantitatively compare its performance to a number of oversegmentation algorithms, showing that it yields less undersegmentation than algorithms that lack a compactness constraint while offering a significant speedup over N-cuts, which does enforce compactness.", "paper_title": "TurboPixels: Fast Superpixels Using Geometric Flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000271140100015"}
