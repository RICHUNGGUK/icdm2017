Based on cyclic division algebras (CDA), they are full-rate, full-diversity codes, have non-vanishing determinants (NVD) and hence achieve diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). In addition, these codes have led to optimal distributed space-time codes when applied in cooperative networks under the assumption of perfect synchronization between relays. However, they lose their diversity when delays are introduced and thus are not delay-tolerant. In this paper, using the cyclic division algebras of perfect codes, we construct new codes that maintain the same properties as perfect codes in the synchronous case. Moreover, these codes preserve their full-diversity in asynchronous transmission.", "paper_title": "Construction of New Delay-Tolerant Space-Time Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000291003900029"}
