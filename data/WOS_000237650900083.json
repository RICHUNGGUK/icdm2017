This feature of communication requires high data-rate transmission. In order to meet the demand, in this paper, a high-speed MB-OFDM system, proposal of 802.15.3a standard for WPAN, employing layered space-time architecture is considered for possible WPAN applications. The MB-OFDM system with multiple antennas increases the transmission rate efficiently with low multiplication operations. With an emphasis on a preamble design for multi-channel separation, we address a channel estimation in MB-OFDM with MIMO antenna system. By properly designing each preamble for multiple antennas to be orthogonal in time domain, the channel estimation can be applied to the MB-OFDM proposal for IEEE 802.15.3a standard in the case of more than two transmitting antennas.", "paper_title": "Multi-channel estimation in multiple antenna MB-OFDM UWB system for home entertainment network", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900083"}
