The basic idea is to consider every point of a model as a message point. We propose a Virtual Multi-Level Embed Procedure to embed information based on shifting the message point, the order of which is assigned by principal component analysis. We modify the message point by its virtual geometrical property, which leads to a change of the position of the orthogonal projection of the message point on the virtual base, the height of the virtual triangle. and the arc length of the virtual circle. Experimental results show that the proposed technique is efficient and secure, has high capacity and low distortion. and is robust against affine transformations. The technique has proven to be feasible in data hiding.", "paper_title": "A data hiding algorithm for point-sampled geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900020"}
