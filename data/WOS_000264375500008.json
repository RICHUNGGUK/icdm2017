In the systems under consideration, there are parameter uncertainties in their state matrices and possible variations in the output of the actuators. In this work, a model of actuator faults is adopted such that both normal operation and partial actuator degradation are covered. A sufficient condition is derived such that the resultant sliding mode control system is asymptotically stable despite partial actuator degradation. Furthermore, it is shown that when a couple of linear matrix inequalities are feasible, the design of the sliding mode controller can be easily obtained via convex optimisation.", "paper_title": "Sliding mode control design for uncertain delay systems with partial actuator degradation", "paper_id": "WOS:000264375500008"}
