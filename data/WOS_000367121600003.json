Well-established companies have to shift their focus from the (still) profitable On-premises market to an, as yet unprofitable, On-demand market to survive. This requires strategies to handle the transformation process. Based on five case studies and following Christensen's disruptive innovation theory, we learn the successful strategies that software companies can adopt to handle a change from On-premises to On-demand delivery. These strategies include the general ideas that Christensen proposes and separate extensions for the software industry, suggesting an emerging area of IS research. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
