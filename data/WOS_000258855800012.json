In this context, this article presents the Multi-user Session Control (MUSC) solution to control the quality level of multimedia sessions shared by multiple-users, providing Quality of Service (QoS) mapping and QoS adaptation for those sessions over heterogeneous and mobile networks. MUSC uses the self-organized principle to coordinate QoS mapping and QoS adaptation mechanisms with mobility and resource allocation controllers, allowing the adaptation of a session to the current network conditions and the dynamic selection of the suitable network service class to map the session. MUSC minimizes the blocking probability, optimizes the usage of network resources and keeps sessions with an acceptable quality of experience. MUSC was evaluated in a simulation and in an experimental environment to analyze its convergence time, percentage of session blocking as well as delay, throughput, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Option Scores (MOS) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of sessions in QoS-aware mobile scenarios.", "paper_title": "QoS support for multi-user sessions in IP-based next generation networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258855800012"}
