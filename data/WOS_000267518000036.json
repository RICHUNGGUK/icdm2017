Prior literature suggests that most of the benefits of worker flexibility accrue with a moderate level of cross training. Because of factors such as MRP planning systems, seasonality and budgeting cycles, many companies experience workload imbalances that are more structured than the workload variability modeled in prior studies. Using factors based on industry examples we model structured workload imbalances. Our premise is that workload imbalances create the \"need\" for worker flexibility, while the available work center capacity in the shop influences the extent to which worker flexibility can be utilized to counter the workload imbalances. Our results confirm that under low workload imbalance conditions, most benefits associated with worker cross training are obtained with a moderate level of training. However, in the presence of high workload imbalances we find that more extensive worker cross training significantly enhances shop performance. A sufficient level of work center capacity is required to realize the benefits of extensive cross training in countering high workload imbalances.
