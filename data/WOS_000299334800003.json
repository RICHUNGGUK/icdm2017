This operator has an associated weights vector with specific properties. Different variants have been developed to obtain it. Among these are those which use the order relationship between the criteria. This paper presents a method to obtain a weights vector, which has as inputs the weights vector obtained by the BordaKendall law and the quantified preference relation between the criteria given by the decision maker. Then, through a set of operations, the new weights vector is obtained; this vector is between the weights obtained by the BordaKendall law and the weighted average vector. In addition, the paper shows the properties that verify the vectors obtained by this method and its use is illustrated through an example.
