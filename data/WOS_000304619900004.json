Nevertheless, many of the existing video abstraction approaches have high computational requirements, complicating the integration and exploitation of current technologies in real environments. This paper presents a novel method for news bulletin abstraction which combines on-line story segmentation, on-line video skimming and layout composition techniques. The developed algorithm provides an efficient, automatic and on-line news abstraction method which takes advantage of the specific characteristics of news bulletins for obtaining representative news abstracts.", "paper_title": "On-line video abstract generation of multimedia news", "paper_id": "WOS:000304619900004"}
