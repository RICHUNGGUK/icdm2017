We first consider the optimal intra-cluster rate allocation problem in using Slepian-Wolf coding for data aggregation, which aims at finding a rate allocation subject to Slepian-Wolf theorem such that the total energy consumed by all sensor nodes in a cluster for sending encoded data is minimized. Based on the properties of Slepian-Wolf coding with optimal intra-cluster rate allocation, a novel encryption mechanism, called spatially selective encryption, is then proposed for data encryption within a single cluster. This encryption mechanism only requires a cluster head to encrypt its data while allowing all its cluster members to send their data without performing any encryption. In this way, the data from all cluster members can be protected as long as the data of the cluster head (called virtual key) is protected. This can significantly reduce the energy consumption for performing data encryption. Furthermore, an energy-efficient key establishment protocol is also proposed to securely and efficiently establish the key used for encrypting the data of a cluster head. Simulation results show that the joint data aggregation and encryption scheme can significantly improve energy efficiency in data transmission while providing a high level of data security.
