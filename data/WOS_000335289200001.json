Although current computational docking protocols are able to generate near-native solutions in a reasonable time, the problem of identifying near-native conformations from a pool of solutions remains very challenging. In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations driven by a collective reaction coordinate to optimize full hydrogen bond networks in a set of protein-protein docking solutions. The collective coordinate biases the system to maximize the formation of hydrogen bonds at the protein-protein interface as well as all over the structure. The reaction coordinate is therefore a measure for docking poses affinity and hence is used as scoring function to identify near-native conformations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
