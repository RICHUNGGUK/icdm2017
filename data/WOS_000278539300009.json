So, it is important to have a mobility management scheme that can manage handoff for both interclass and intraclass mobility so that the users can connect to and roam between any network. We propose an end-to-end mobility management scheme, Multiclass SIGMA (mSIGMA), that performs soft handoff for interclass and intraclass mobility in wireless network and can perform low-loss location management. Our analysis shows mSIGMA can perform seamless handoff across networks with low delay and packet loss with efficient location management. We have also shown though experimental analysis that mSIGMA is implementable with existing networking technologies and can perform handoff efficiently.", "paper_title": "mSIGMA: An Efficient Handoff Scheme for Multiclass Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000278539300009"}
