The implemented MPP tracker bases on a perturb and observe algorithm and acquires the information concerning the power flow via an analog processing circuit which is connected at the switched mode converter input respectively the output of the attached PV string of nine cells. There the solar cell current is measured via a very low-ohmic shunt resistor of 1 ma\"broken vertical bar and analogously multiplied with the cell voltage. As output the fabricated test chip directly generates a 530 kHz PWM signal for the external switched mode converter. Measurements show that under similar conditions analog MPP tracking of the converter input power improves the robustness with respect to settling times of the power path compared to those topologies at which the power is measured at the converter output. Between 0.4 and 7.5 A photocurrent the chip achieves tracking efficiencies better than 99.5 % while the power consumption is only 750 mu W and a very low chip area demand of 0.043 mm(2) for the MPP tracking core is achieved.", "paper_title": "CMOS integrated MPP tracker with analog power measurement at the PV converter input", "paper_id": "WOS:000333611000018"}
