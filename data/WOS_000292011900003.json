However, it also necessitates that the sub-circuit to be activated should be charged for some time before its activation. This critical issue can influence the decomposition of a finite state machine (FSM) for its power gated implementation. In this paper we have presented a power-gating method that integrates FSM partitioning with state encoding, thus providing a total solution to the problem of power-aware FSM synthesis. It shows better results, in terms of dynamic and leakage power consumption, compared to the existing techniques reported in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
