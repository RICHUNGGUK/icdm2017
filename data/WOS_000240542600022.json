In this paper, we investigate the impact of mobility and resource-limitedness of UbiComp upon service provision, and design an adaptive service delivery model which can dynamically deliver satisfying services to mobile users in tune with the variation of context. In our design, we propose a user-oriented Quality of Service (QoS) model to measure whether services are suitable for being delivered to the mobile users in UbiComp environments. Moreover, we utilize first-order logic inference and fuzzy logic evaluation in the process of service delivery. We also perform several experiments to evaluate the service delivery model in terms of scalability and performance.", "paper_title": "Adaptive service delivery for mobile users in Ubiquitous Computing environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600022"}
