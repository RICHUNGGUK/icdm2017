Two types of simulated customer and one practical demand are employed to validate the capability of the MDL method. Since stochastic factors hidden in the demand data disturb the prediction, the surrogate data method is proposed for identifying the characteristics of the demand data. This method excludes demands that are totally stochastic when forecasting. We demonstrate how optimal models estimated by MDL are consistent with the dynamics of demand data identified by the surrogate data method. The complementary approach of the surrogate data method and neural network constitutes a comprehensive framework for making various demand predictions. This framework is applicable to a wide variety of real-world data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
