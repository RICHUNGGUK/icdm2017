In order to reduce the computation complexity of the system after the fuzzification of features, the optimal fuzzy feature subset should be selected. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic algorithm, where the criterion is based on min-max learning rule and fuzzy extension matrix is designed as the search strategy. The algorithm is proved in theory and has shown its high performance over several real-world benchmark data sets. (C) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
