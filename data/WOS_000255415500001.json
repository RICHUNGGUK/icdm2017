To reduce the volume of test data, several test data compression techniques have been proposed. Frequency-directed run-length (FDR) code is a variable-to-variable run length code based on encoding runs of Os. It is demonstrated that higher test data compression can be achieved based on encoding both runs of Os and is. An extension to the FDR code is proposed and by experimental results its effectiveness in achieving a higher compression ratio is demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Test data compression for system-on-a-chip using extended frequency-directed run-length code", "paper_id": "WOS:000255415500001"}
