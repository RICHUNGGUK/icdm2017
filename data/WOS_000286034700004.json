POOMM evaluates the trustworthy degree of Web service by a neutral third party Trustworthiness Metric Center, in which the trustworthy metric index system is described by preference-oriented domain ontology and FDL-POOMM calculates the trustworthy degree of Web services by processing information of ontologies, and the Trustworthy Service Intelligent Evaluating System is developed to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of POOMM.
