Generally, hand gesture recognition aims to identify specific human gestures and use them to convey information. The process of hand gesture recognition composes mainly of four stages: hand gesture images collection, gesture image preprocessing using some techniques including edge detection, filtering and normalization, capture the main characteristics of the gesture images and the evaluation (or classification) stage where the image is classified to its corresponding gesture class. There are many methods that have been used in the classification stage of hand gesture recognition such as Artificial Neural Networks, template matching, Hidden Markov Models and Dynamic Time Warping. This exploratory survey aims to provide a progress report on hand posture and gesture recognition technology.", "paper_title": "Hand posture and gesture recognition technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000340584700034"}
