Their application domains span from RFID systems to peer-to-peer networks; from traffic analysis to wireless sensor networks; from multicast networks to WLANs. The present contribution aims at illustrating and classifying in a coherent framework the main approaches proposed so far in the computer networks literature to deal with such a problem. In particular, starting from the methodologies proposed in ecological studies since the last century, this paper surveys their counterparts in the computer network domain, finding that many lessons can be gained from this insightful investigation. Capture-Recapture techniques are deeply analyzed to allow the reader to exactly understand their pros, cons, and applicability bounds. Finally, some open issues that deserve further investigations and could be relevant to afford estimation problems in next generation Internet are discussed for sake of completeness.
