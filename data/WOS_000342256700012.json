Albums, usually associated with pictures of a small group of people at a certain event or occasion, provide vital information that can be used to effectively reduce the possible list of candidate labels. We show how this intuition can be formalized into a model that expresses a prior on how albums tend to have many pictures of a small number of people. We also show how it can be extended to include other information available in a social network. Using two real-world datasets independently drawn from Facebook, we show that this model is broadly applicable and can significantly improve recognition rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
