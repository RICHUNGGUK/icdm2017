This numerical scheme is proved to preserve the original conservative properties. Using the discrete energy analysis method, we also prove that the scheme is unconditionally stable and second-order convergent in discrete L(2)-norm based on some preliminary estimations. The results show that the new scheme is efficiency. (C) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
