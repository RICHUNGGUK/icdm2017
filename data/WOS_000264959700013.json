Two sets of experimental data on reconstituted clays are used for evaluation of three constitutive models of different complexity (Modified Cam clay model, 3SKH model, hypoplastic model for clays). Although all the models predict the influence of OCR correctly from the qualitative point of view, quantitative comparison using a suitable scalar error measure reveals merits and shortcomings of different models.
