Inspired by biologic gene technique, we propose a novel grid trust model based on Family Gene (FG) model. The model answers the existing questions in tradition trust model by adopting the technology of family gene. The concepts and formal definitions of Family Gene in the grid trust security domains are given. Then, the mathematical models of Family Gene are established. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the model is a good solution to grid trust domain.", "paper_title": "Family gene based grid trust model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100014"}
