Aiming to answer the question whether the binding to NKRs could have a share in the side effects or even the desired effects of already licensed drugs, we generated a set of ligand-based common feature pharmacophore models based on the structural information about subtype-selective and nonselective NKR antagonists and screened an in-house database mainly composed of licensed drugs. The prospective pharmacological investigations of the virtual hits haloperidol, eprazinone, and fenbutrazate confirmed them to be NKR ligands in vitro. By the identification of licensed drugs as so far unknown NKR ligands, this study contributes to establishing an activity profile of the investigated compounds and confirms the presented pharmacophore models as useful tools for this purpose.", "paper_title": "Pharmacophore Modeling, Virtual Screening, and in Vitro Testing Reveal Haloperidol, Eprazinone, and Fenbutrazate as Neurokinin Receptors Ligands", "paper_id": "WOS:000337937100019"}
