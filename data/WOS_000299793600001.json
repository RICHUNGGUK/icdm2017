For that purpose, fully mixed models (i.e. for instance, a single temperature per room) easily prove inadequate, while computational fluid dynamics ones do not provide sufficient simulation speed, and are difficult to formulate and manage in a modular manner. This manuscript presents a somehow intermediate solution based on the object-oriented modelling paradigm, and implemented in the Modelica language. The proposal advantages are illustrated by two significant examples.", "paper_title": "Object-oriented sub-zonal modelling for efficient energy-related building simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000299793600001"}
