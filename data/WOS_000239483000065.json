First, action scenes are detected by analyzing film rhythm of video sequence. Then four important features are extracted to characterize chase and fight scenes. After then the Probability Neural Networks is employed to classify the detected action scenes into fight, chase and uncertain scenes. Experimental results show that the proposed method works well over the real movie videos.", "paper_title": "Two important action scenes detection based on probability neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000065"}
