Due to the degradation process of the LR image (e.g., noisy, blurred, and down-sampled), the neighborhood relationship of the LR space cannot reflect the truth. To this end, this paper proposes a coarse-to-fine face super-resolution approach via a multilayer locality-constrained iterative neighbor embedding technique, which intends to represent the input LR patch while preserving the geometry of original HR space. In particular, we iteratively update the LR patch representation and the estimated HR patch, and meanwhile an intermediate dictionary learning scheme is employed to bridge the LR manifold and original HR manifold. The proposed method can faithfully capture the intrinsic image degradation shift and enhance the consistency between the reconstructed HR manifold and the original HR manifold. Experiments with application to face super-resolution on the CAS-PEAL-R1 database and real-world images demonstrate the power of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Face Super-Resolution via Multilayer Locality-Constrained Iterative Neighbor Embedding and Intermediate Dictionary Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000341706700001"}
