Due to the role of the quinolone signaling pathway of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the expression of several virulence factors and biofilm formation, PqsD is a potential target for controlling this nosocomial pathogen, which exhibits a low susceptibility to standard antibiotics. PqsD belongs to the beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase family and is similar in structure to homologous FabH enzymes in E. coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations to obtain the structural position of the substrate ACoA in the binding pocket of PqsD, and semi-empirical molecular orbital calculations to study the reaction mechanism for the catalytic cleavage of ACoA. Our findings suggest a nucleophilic attack of the deprotonated sulfur of Cys112 at the carbonyl carbon of ACoA and a switch in the protonation pattern of His257 whereby N-delta is protonated and the proton of Ne is shifted to the sulfur of CoA during the reaction. This is in agreement with the experimentally determined decreased catalytic activity of the Cys112Ser mutant, whereas the Cys112Ala, His257Phe, and Asn287Ala mutants are all inactive. ESI mass-spectrometric measurements of the Asn287Ala mutant show that anthraniloyl remains covalently bound to Cys112, thus further supporting the inference from our computed mechanism that Asn287 does not take part in the cleavage of ACoA. Since this mutant is inactive, we suggest instead that Asn287 must play an essential role in the subsequent formation of HHQ in vitro.", "paper_title": "Mechanistic details for anthraniloyl transfer in PqsD: the initial step in HHQ biosynthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000338632200042"}
