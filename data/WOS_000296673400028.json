To learn stream data evolving over time effectively, it is required to detect the drift of concept. We present a window adaptation function on domain value (WAV) to determine the size of windowed batch for learning algorithms of stream data and a method to detect the change of data characteristics with a criterion function utilizing correlation. When applying our adaptation function to a clustering task on a multi-stream data model, the result of learning synopsis of windowed batch determined by it shows its effectiveness. Our criterion function with correlation information of value distribution over time can be the reasonable threshold to detect the change between windowed batches.", "paper_title": "Concept Drift Detection for Evolving Stream Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000296673400028"}
