To achieve both objectives. Active Storage moves certain processing tasks to the storage nodes, near the data they manage. Our proposal for Active Storage has several key features: user-space implementation which facilitates the port to different file systems, analytical model to anticipate the performance of Active Storage with respect to a traditional system, support for striped files and complex-format files such as netCDF, and scientific-friendly programming and run-time environment.
