Design and loom integration of a traversing camera sled, a camera vibration damper and a complementary back-light illumination are presented and discussed. Image acquisition strategies and traverse control are described to complete the discussion on hardware and mechanics. The main part of the paper focuses on a novel algorithmic framework for woven fabric defect detection in highly resolved (1,000+ ppi) image data. Within this scope, single yarns are tracked and measured in terms of position, size, and appearance in real time. An inspection prototype has been mounted onto an industrial loom. Extensive on-line and off-line evaluations for various fabric materials gave precise and stable detection results with few false alarms. A brief cost analysis for the prototype system is provided and completes the presentation of the system.", "paper_title": "A traverse inspection system for high precision visual on-loom fabric defect detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000342435400013"}
