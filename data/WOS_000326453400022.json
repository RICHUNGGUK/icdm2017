For example the code-division multiple access system (CDMA) requires more than 80 dB of gain range so that, many variable gain amplifiers (VGAs) must be used, resulting in high power consumption and low linearity because of VGA non-linearity factors. In this paper, a one-stage VGA in 0.18 mu m technology is presented. The VGA based on the class AB power amplifier is designed and simulated for a high linearity and an 80 dB tuning range. For the linear-in-decibel tuning range, transistors in sub-threshold region is used. The current control circuit of the VGA changes gain continuously from -68 to 18 dB at 0.5 GHz and -60 to 20 dB at 1 GHz with gain error of less than 2 dB. The power consumption enjoys a highest value about 13.5 mW in the maximum gain and P1dB is also about -3.4 dBm at 0.5 GHz and 2.2 dBm at 1 GHz.", "paper_title": "A 0.5-1 GHz single stage linear-in-decibel VGA with 80 dB gain range in 0.18 mu m CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000326453400022"}
