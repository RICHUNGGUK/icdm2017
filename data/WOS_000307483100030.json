The coregionalization for modeling multivariate spatial data is adopted to formulate the correlated structure between adjacent time points. A Bayesian approach coupled with the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is developed to obtain the Bayesian estimates of unknown parameters and latent variables simultaneously. A simulation study and a real example related to an emotion study are presented to illustrate the newly developed methodology. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
