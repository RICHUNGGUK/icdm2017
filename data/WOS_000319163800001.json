CWSN devotes itself to the solution of spectrum sharing in forms of networks, such as IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth. A new algorithm is proposed for allocating the idle spectrum to secondary users (SUs). This algorithm uses \"the last diminisher\" algorithm, which appears in fair division models. It can help solve complicated problems in a simple fashion. This article combines the trust value and the method of spectrum allocation. The concept of trust value in reputation management is introduced. All the factors are applied to solve the realistic problems of spectrum allocation. With the growing number of sensor nodes, the stable throughput is of vital importance.", "paper_title": "A Trust Value-Based Spectrum Allocation Algorithm in CWSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000319163800001"}
