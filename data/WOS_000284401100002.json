As more and more Web resources are annotated using RDF(S), there is an urgent need for efficiently dealing with this large volume of data. In this paper, we present Atlas, a peer-to-peer system for storing, updating and querying RDF(S) data. The Atlas system has been built using the distributed hash table Bamboo. Atlas was developed in the context of project OntoGrid, where it was used as a distributed repository for RDF(S) metadata describing Grid services and resources. The development of Atlas continues in other projects that our group participates currently. This paper gives an overview of the most recent version of Atlas and discusses a representative application. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
