First, a Polya tree prior is constructed so that the centering distribution is the null. Second, the prior is updated in the light of data to obtain the posterior centering distribution as the alternative. Third, a Kullback-Leibler divergence type of test statistic is derived to assess the discrepancy between the two centering distributions. The properties of the test statistic are derived, and a power comparison with several well-known test statistics is conducted. The use of the test statistic is illustrated using network traffic data.", "paper_title": "A nonparametric assessment of model adequacy based on Kullback-Leibler divergence", "paper_id": "WOS:000313731700002"}
