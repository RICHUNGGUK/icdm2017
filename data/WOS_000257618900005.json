The first approach is a more classical one, which introduces new extensions to the OSPF-TE routing protocol. The other approach makes use of an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to adaptively calculate routes in the network by actively monitoring the aggregate optical power of each link. By using an analytical model to incorporate the constraints of the Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) noise of the optical amplifiers into the routing, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches by means of an illustrative numerical example.
