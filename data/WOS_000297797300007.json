Not all approaches are applicable, however, for the stringent accuracy, timeliness, and development complexity requirements of distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems. This paper empirically evaluates constant-time supervised machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), and presents a composite metric to support quantitative evaluation of accuracy and timeliness for these adaptation approaches.", "paper_title": "Evaluating Timeliness and Accuracy Trade-offs of Supervised Machine Learning for Adapting Enterprise DRE Systems in Dynamic Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000297797300007"}
