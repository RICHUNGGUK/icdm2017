In spread spectrum communication systems, sequences having nice correlation properties are important in many ways such as in suppressing multiuser interference, for reliable initial synchronization and in separation of the multipath components. It would be even good if the sequences are easy to construct and have desirable lengths for the system under consideration. In this paper, M sets of sequences that constitute a complete complementary sequences with i(th) set containing N sequences of length L-i each, i = 0, 1,..., M - 1, is defined and a general method that constructs such a class of complete complementary sequences (of different lengths) is given. The proposed class of complete complementary sequences, constituted by sequence sets of different lengths, does not increase the data rates when short-length sequences are employed.", "paper_title": "Complete complementary sequences of different length", "paper_id": "WOS:000247840400019"}
