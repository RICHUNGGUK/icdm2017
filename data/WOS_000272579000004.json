To do this, we adopted a unique approach in quantitative structure-activity relationships. An efficient feature selection method was emphasized in such an approach, using the confirmative results of different routine and novel feature selection methods. The proposed methods generated quite consistent results ensuring the effectiveness of the selected structural features. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
