However, classic management-related flaws still persist, e.g. the fusion of large amounts of security events reported from many heterogeneous systems, whilst novel intriguing challenges arise specially when dealing with the adaptation to newly encountered and multi-step attacks. In this article, we provide SIEM correlation with self-adaptation capabilities to optimize and significantly reduce the intervention of operators. In particular, our enhanced correlation engine automatically learns and produces correlation rules based on the context for different types of multi-step attacks using genetic programming. The context is considered as the knowledge and reasoning, not only acquired by a human expert but also inferred by our system, which assist in the identification and fusion of events. In this regard, a number of artificial neural networks are trained to classify events according to the corresponding context established for the attack. Experimentation is conducted on a real deployment within OSSIM to validate our proposal. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
