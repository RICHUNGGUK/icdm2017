For high-speed scanning a new controller, based on input-shaping techniques, has been developed that reduces imaging artifacts due to the scanner's dynamics. The implementation of the new AFM system offers imaging capabilities of several thousand lines per second with a scanning range of 13 mu m in both scanning directions, and the freedom to choose the fast scan-axis in any arbitrary direction in the X-Y-plane.
