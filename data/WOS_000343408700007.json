The link between cloud computing services and KMS is a new concept, and methods for selecting multiple choice goals of cloud computing service provider have lacked a formal reference framework. From the perspectives of customer needs and technology requirements, selecting the right cloud computing service supplier for KMS is a key strategic consideration. This paper presents an integrated analytical hierarchy process (AHP), quality function development (QFD) and multi-choice goal programming (MCGP) method to address the cloud computing service provider selection problem in KMS for information service. To show the practicality and usefulness of the proposed method, a case study of a Taiwanese textbook company is presented. This paper shows that the proposed model is a good decision-making tool for the selection of new information technology.", "paper_title": "A QFD Approach for Cloud Computing Evaluation and Selection in KMS: A Case Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000343408700007"}
