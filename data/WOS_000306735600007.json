A new model (referred to as 6+N model) is proposed to describe arbitrarily shaped cut cells and treat all the cells as polyhedrons with 6+N faces. The finite volume discretization of the NavierStokes equation is then implemented by using the 6+N model to separate the surface flux integrals into two parts, that is, the fluxes through the basic face of the hexahedron and those through the cutting surfaces. The previously proposed Kitta Cube algorithm and volume computer-aided design platform (J.?Comput.?Aided.?Des. 2005; 37(4): 15091520. Doi:10.1016/j.cad.2005.03.006) are adopted to generate cut cells and provide shape data and physical attributes for the numerical analysis. A modified SIMPLE-based smoothing pressure correction scheme is applied to suppress checkerboard pressure oscillations caused by the collocated arrangement of velocities and pressure. The calculation accuracy of the numerical method expressed by L1 and L?8? norm errors is first demonstrated by the simulation of a pipe flow. Then its feasibility, efficiency, and potential in engineering applications are verified by applying it to solve natural convections between concentric spheres and between eccentric spheres. The heat transfer patterns in eccentric spheres are also obtained by using the numerical method.
