Here we develop a predictor of cholesterol and cholate binding that Works across diverse protein families, extending beyond sequence motif-based prediction. This approach,combines: SituSite3D site comparison with the detection of conserved interactions in,cholesterolicholate bound crystal structures to Ciefirre three-dimensional interaction motifs. The resulting predictor identifies cholesterol sites with an similar to 82% unbiased true positive rate in both membrane and soluble proteins, with a very low false positive rate relative to other predictors. The CholMine Web server can analyze users' structures detect those likely to bind cholesterol/cholate, and predict the binding mode and key interactions By deciphering the determinants, of binding for these important :steroids, CholMine may also aid in the design of selective inhibitors and detergents for targets such as G protein coupled receptors aid bile acid receptors.", "paper_title": "CholMine: Determinants and Prediction of Cholesterol and Cholate Binding Across Nonhomologous Protein Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000353668600005"}
