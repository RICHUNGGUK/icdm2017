Our research model suggests that top management support, system compatibility, IS infrastructure, IS expertise, and perceived importance of IS security affect four control modes: controls for system continuity, access controls, communication controls and informal controls. Furthermore, it posits that B2CIS controls affect B2CIS implementation, which has three dimensions: volume, sophistication, and information contents. Empirical tests indicated that IS infrastructure and perceived importance of IS security affect the usage of four modes of B2CIS controls, while system compatibility affects the usage of all these control modes except communication controls. The controls for system continuity are the most important controls for B2CIS implementation. This study provides insights into the adequacy of security measures undertaken under specific organizational circumstances for systems implementation.", "paper_title": "THE ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXTS, CONTROLS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF E-BUSINESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000284189000013"}
