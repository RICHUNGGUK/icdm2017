(2) two sets of parallel connection single-phase DC-DC converter, and (3) two sets of series connection single-phase DC-DC converter. The purposes are: (1) to propose the simplification conditions and procedures for the three-phase AC-DC converter; (2) propose a set of new simplification steps for modeling, and present the examples of different three-phase AC-DC circuit topologies, detailed discussion on the simplification steps for modeling of a three-phase AC-DC converter is offered, to help people simplify and analyze the simplified model easily: (3) according to three: types of simplified modeling in the three-phase AC-DC converter, this study established a useful reference for the design and analysis of the control systems of the three-phase AC-DC converter simply; (4) to acquire PWM control strategy beforehand based on PFC-Controlled property; (5) to reduce the switching loss for the PWM control strategy of the simplified model; (6) to maintain the original circuit topology and verify that the theory can extensively apply the knowledge of single-phase DC-DC converter to the simplified modeling of three-phase AC-DC converter.", "paper_title": "A Novel Concept for Simplified Model of a Three-Phase AC-DC Converter Using PFC-Controlled Property", "paper_id": "WOS:000295601100005"}
