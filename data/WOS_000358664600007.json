Conventional web service discovery approaches usually organize the service repository in a list manner, therefore service matchmaking is performed with linear complexity. In this work, services in a repository are clustered using hierarchical clustering algorithms with a distance measure from an attached matchmaker. Service discovery is then performed over the resulting dendrogram (binary tree). In comparison with conventional approaches that mostly perform exhaustive search, we show that service-clustering method brings a dramatic improvement on time complexity with an acceptable loss in precision.", "paper_title": "Service discovery acceleration with hierarchical clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000358664600007"}
