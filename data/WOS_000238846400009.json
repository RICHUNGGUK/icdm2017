Successful thermal modeling of the human eye will assist in enabling early detections of eye abnormalities such as inflammatory. However, validity of every computer simulated results must be benchmarked with experimental measurement and this can be a daunting task especially in biomedical fields where experimental data is not in abundance. This paper presents a 2D finite element (FE) human eye model developed to simulate its thermal steady state conditions based on the properties and parameters reported in the open literatures. The results are verified with experimental and computational results obtained by previous studies on human as well as animal eyes. Results show discrepancy of only 0.33% when compared to images from infrared (IR) screening and a difference of only 0.127% compared to another finite element model. The sensitivity analysis also provides good agreement with results by previous studies. This promising simulation allows new possibility in computational methods for eye health care.
