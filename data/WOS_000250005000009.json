Using the existing biomedical ontologies it has been impossible to capture the complexity of the community's knowledge about biological functions. Results: We present here a top-level ontological framework for representing knowledge about biological functions. This framework lends greater accuracy, power and expressiveness to biomedical ontologies by providing a means to capture existing functional knowledge in a more formal manner. An initial major application of the ontology of functions is the provision of a principled way in which to curate functional knowledge and annotations in biomedical ontologies. Further potential applications include the facilitation of ontology interoperability and automated reasoning. A major advantage of the proposed implementation is that it is an extension to existing biomedical ontologies, and can be applied without substantial changes to these domain ontologies.", "paper_title": "A top-level ontology of functions and its application in the Open Biomedical Ontologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000250005000009"}
