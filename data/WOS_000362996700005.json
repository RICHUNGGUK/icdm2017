The filter is designed following a skeletal approach, using a newly proposed stencil-reduce, and has been implemented by way of the FastFlow parallel programming library. As a result of its high-level design, it is possible to run the filter seamlessly on a multicore machine, on multi-GPGPUs, or on both. The design and implementation of the filter are discussed, and an experimental evaluation is presented.", "paper_title": "Parallel visual data restoration on multi-GPGPUs using stencil-reduce pattern", "paper_id": "WOS:000362996700005"}
