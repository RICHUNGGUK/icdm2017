Several companies offer the ability to track the position of the players and the ball with high accuracy and high resolution. They also offer software that include basic analysis tools, for example basic statistics about distance run and number of passes. It is, however, a non-trivial task to perform more advanced analysis. We present a collection of tools that we developed specifically for analysing the performance of football players and teams. The aim, functionality and the underlying algorithms for each tool are presented and discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
