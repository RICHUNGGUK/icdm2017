We first establish a lower bound on the achievable rates based on noisy network coding and Gelfand-Pinsker coding, and show that it provides an alternative characterization of a previously known bound. We then introduce the class of state-decoupled relay channels and show that our lower bound is tight for a subclass of semideterministic channels. We also compute the capacity for two specific examples of this subclass-a channel with multiplicative binary fading and a channel with additive Gaussian interference. These examples are not special cases of previous classes of semideterministic relay channels with known capacity.", "paper_title": "State-Dependent Relay Channel: Achievable Rate and Capacity of a Semideterministic Class", "paper_id": "WOS:000318163500006"}
