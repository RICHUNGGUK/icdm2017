Gene rearrangements occurring in the miRNA sequence are associated with cancer. The IBTK genetic locus is located in the genomic sequence 6q14.1 that undergoes chromosomal aberration in lymphoproliferative disorders. The IBTK gene encodes the proteins IBtk-alpha, beta and gamma that regulate the B cell receptor signalling through Bruton's tyrosine kinase, which promotes B cell survival and differentiation. Pro-Mirll-based analysis predicted four precursors of microRNAs (pre-miR) encoded by introns 17, 21, 26 and the 3' un-translated region of the IBTK gene. Pre-miR-IBTK3, which was encoded by intron 26, was the effective substrate of RNase III Dicer in vitro as well as the precursor of an IBtk miRNA generated in vivo. By CLUSTALW-based analysis, pre-miR-IBTK3 homologues were found in Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus and Macaca mulatto, suggesting an evolutionary conserved function in primates.
