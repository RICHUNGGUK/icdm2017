The results showed recurrence plot appeared different textures for the transitional oil/water two phase flow patterns, and was special for different flow pattern. That indicated the texture of recurrence plot was sensitive to the changes of oil/water two flow patterns, and the recurrence quantification analysis is a useful diagnosis tool in identifying of two phase flow patterns.", "paper_title": "Application of chaotic recurrence plot analysis to identification of oil/water two-phase flow patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000151"}
