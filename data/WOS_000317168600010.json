In the present approach common software packages are directly used for the entire simulation process from segmentation of CT scans, surface reconstruction, mesh generation, calculation of mean element densities to FE simulation. The influence of the mesh discretisation level on the maximum displacement, the total system energy and the principal surface stress distribution of eight human femurs was analysed. Both the maximum displacement and the total system energy showed typical convergence behaviour towards an asymptotic value with decreasing element size. The principal surface stress distribution followed similar qualitative trends at all mesh discretisation levels studied for the same femur. However, the stress distributions did not converge with decreasing element size and still differed significantly between the two smallest element sizes studied of approximately 2 mm and 1 mm. The magnitude of convergence differed among the individual femurs. Thus, individual convergence studies in terms of local stress or strain distributions are necessary for accurately predicting local stress and Strain values in subject-specific FE bone models.
