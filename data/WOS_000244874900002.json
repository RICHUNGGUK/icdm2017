In this paper we study the properties of an operator assigning a fractal function to every continuous function on a compact interval. In particular, the operator is proven bounded with respect to the mean square norm. The transformation provides a procedure to construct fractal functions on the sphere that generalize the classical spherical harmonics.", "paper_title": "Fractal functions on the sphere", "paper_id": "WOS:000244874900002"}
