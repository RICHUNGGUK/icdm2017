Design/methodology/approach - A cooperation model has been constructed, and drawing upon the patent data of 91 aluminum nitride manufacturers, the implications of R&D capability for commercialization strategy are illustrated. Findings - The authors' analysis suggests that competitive interaction between startup innovators and established firms depends on the R&D capability of the startup innovators, which can be evaluated by patent data. Practical implications - For technologically efficient firms, a high level of integration to achieve the benefits of economies of scope will lead to more profits. However, for technologically inefficient firms, maintaining a low level of integration to achieve the benefits of specialization is the better strategy. Originality/value - This paper provides a simplified model which combines an evaluation of R&D capability using patent data with strategic decision making to facilitate successful commercialization in startups.", "paper_title": "Assessment of commercialization strategy using R&D capability", "paper_id": "WOS:000291136900002"}
