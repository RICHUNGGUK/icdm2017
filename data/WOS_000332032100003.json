The most efficient algorithms to collect them are based on compressed indexes that rely on longest common prefix array-centered data structures. However, their space-efficient representations make use of encoding techniques that are expensive from a computational point of view. With the deluge of data generated by high-throughput sequencing, new approaches need to be developed to deal with larger genomic sequences. Results: In this work, we have developed a new longest common prefix array-sampled representation, optimized to work with the backward search method inherently used by the FM-Index. Unlike previous implementations that sacrifice running time to have smaller space, ours lead to both a fast and a space-efficient approach. This implementation was used by the new software slaMEM, developed to efficiently retrieve MEMs. The results show that the new algorithm is competitive against existing state-of-the-art approaches.", "paper_title": "slaMEM: efficient retrieval of maximal exact matches using a sampled LCP array", "paper_id": "WOS:000332032100003"}
