Using the impulse response of multipath channel, the BER performance of the synthesized antenna pattern on binary pulse amplitude modulation system can be calculated. Based on the topography of the circular antenna array and the BER formula, the array pattern synthesis problem can be reformulated into an optimization problem and solved by the DDE algorithm. The novelties of our approach are not only choosing BER as the object function instead of sidelobe level of the antenna pattern but also considering the antenna feed length effect of each array element. The strong point of the DDE algorithm is that it can find out the solution even if the performance index cannot be formulated by simple equations. Simulation results show that the synthesized antenna array pattern is effective to focus maximum gain to the line of site path which scales as the number of array elements. In other words, the receiver can increase the received signal energy to noise ratio. The synthesized array pattern also can mitigate severe multipath fading in complex propagation environment. As a result, the BER can be reduced substantially in indoor UWB communication system. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
