In this preliminary study, a set of four EEG features were used to detect seizures and three different electrical stimulation strategies (standard (130Hz), very high (500Hz) and ultra high (1000Hz)) were delivered to terminate seizures. Seizure durations were significantly shorter with all three stimulation strategies when compared to non-stimulated (control) seizures. We used mean seizure duration of epileptiform discharges persisting beyond the end of electrical stimulation as a measure of stimulus efficacy. When compared to the duration of seizures stimulated in the standard approach (7.0 s +/- 10.1), both very high and ultra high frequency stimulation strategies were more effective at shortening seizure durations (1.3 +/- 2.2 s and 3.5 +/- 6.4 s respectively). Further studies are warranted to further understand the mechanisms by which this therapeutic effect may be conveyed, and which of the novel aspects of the very high and ultra high frequency stimulation strategies may have contributed to the improvement in seizure abatement performance when compared to standard electrical stimulation approaches.", "paper_title": "CLOSED-LOOP SEIZURE CONTROL WITH VERY HIGH FREQUENCY ELECTRICAL STIMULATION AT SEIZURE ONSET IN THE GAERS MODEL OF ABSENCE EPILEPSY", "paper_id": "WOS:000288805100007"}
