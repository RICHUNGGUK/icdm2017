Unfortunately, all known algorithms that compute the greedy spanner on points use space, which is impractical on large instances. To the best of our knowledge, the largest instance for which the greedy spanner was computed so far has about 13,000 vertices. We present a linear-space algorithm that computes the same spanner for points in running in time for any fixed stretch factor and dimension. We discuss and evaluate a number of optimizations to its running time, which allowed us to compute the greedy spanner on a graph with a million vertices. To our knowledge, this is also the first algorithm for the greedy spanner with a near-quadratic running time guarantee that has actually been implemented.", "paper_title": "Computing the Greedy Spanner in Linear Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000362973600005"}
