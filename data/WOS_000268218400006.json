The method is based on Jensen's photon mapping algorithm. In order to capture high angular frequencies in the radiance function, we incorporate the angular domain into the density estimation. However density estimation in position-direction space makes it necessary to find a trade off between the spatial and angular accuracy of the estimation. We identify, the parameters which are important for this tradeoff and investigate the typical estimation errors. We show how the large data size, which is inherent to the underlying problem, can be handled. The method is applied to different automotive tail lights. It can be applied to a wide range of other real-world light sources.", "paper_title": "Efficient and Accurate Rendering of Complex Light Sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000268218400006"}
