These machines are semi-weakly universal which means that on one side of the input they have an infinitely repeated word, and on the other side there is the usual infinitely repeated blank symbol. This work can be regarded as a continuation of early work by Watanabe on semi-weak machines. One of our machines has only 17 transition rules, making it the smallest known semi-weakly universal Turing machine. Interestingly, two of our machines are symmetric with Watanabe's 7-state and 3-symbol, and 5-state and 4-symbol machines, even though we use a different simulation technique.", "paper_title": "Small Semi-Weakly Universal Turing Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000265239200011"}
