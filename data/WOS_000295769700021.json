The so-called raft library, provide a set of useful and basic tools, usually needed in many inverse problems that are related to medical imaging. The subroutines in raft are free software and written in C language; portable to any system with a working C compiler. This paper presents source codes written according to raft routines, applied to a new imaging modality called X-ray fluorescence tomography.

Solution method: As a library, raft covers the standard reconstruction algorithms like filtered backprojection, Novikov's inversion, Hogan's formula, among others. The input data set is represented by a complete sinogram covering a determined angular range. Users are allowed to set solid angle range for fluorescence emission at each algorithm. Running time: 1 second to 15 minutes, depending on the data size. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "C-library raft: Reconstruction algorithms for tomography.
