The proposed IPC method works within the purview of the implicit mixed linear complementarity problem (MLCP) formulation of collision response. In IPC, first the potential directions of frictional force are determined at each contact point by leveraging the monotonic convergence of an iterative MLCP solver. All the contacts are then categorized into either static or kinetic frictional states. Linear projection constraints (LPCs) are used to enforce 'stiction' for contacts in static friction. We propose a modified iterative constraint anticipation (MICA) approach that can resolve the LKs while simultaneously solving the MLCP. Our method can handle arbitrary models including asymmetric and anisotropic friction models. IPC requires low memory and is highly tunable. Multiple example problems are solved to demonstrate the method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
