The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed as the response system to achieve the dual synchronization. Two methods axe proposed and investigated. The first method treats the combination of a Colpitts circuit and a Chua's circuit as a higher-dimensional system, while the second method considers the Colpitts circuit and Chua's circuit sepaxately and utilizes the cross-coupling scheme. The simulation results indicate that the proposed methods can effectively achieve and maintain dual synchronization of the hybrid system through an AWGN channel.", "paper_title": "EKF-BASED DUAL SYNCHRONIZATION OF CHAOTIC COLPITTS CIRCUIT AND CHUA'S CIRCUIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000260388800004"}
