We show how the teleported entanglement depends on the quality of the quantum channel used, as defined through its entanglement and mixedness, as well as the form of the target state to be teleported. We present new results based on the fidelity of the teleported state as well as an experimental setup that is immediately implementable with currently available technology.", "paper_title": "TELEPORTING BIPARTITE ENTANGLEMENT USING MAXIMALLY ENTANGLED MIXED CHANNELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000278194600004"}
