To achieve this purpose, a two objective optimisation model is set up for prototype selection problem in the paper. To make the model be solved easier, it is transformed to a single objective optimisation model by the division of the two objectives, and a new two-layer genetic algorithm is proposed by using a divide-and-conquer partition strategy. The divide-and-conquer partition can divide the whole dataset into some random sub-datasets to be handled, respectively. The simulations are conducted and the proposed algorithm is compared with several existing algorithms. The results obtained on UCI static datasets and time series datasets indicate that the proposed algorithm is an expedient method in design nearest neighbour classifiers.", "paper_title": "Prototype selection based on multi-objective optimisation and partition strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000352853500003"}
