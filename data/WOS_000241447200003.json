In this paper, we propose a general strategy in order to, reduce the complexity in some important formulas (those following a specific pattern) obtained by this algorithm. Then, we show two examples of application of this methodology.", "paper_title": "Reducing computational costs in the Basic Perturbation Lemma", "paper_id": "WOS:000241447200003"}
