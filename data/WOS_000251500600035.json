Within this framework, the popular FastICA algorithm can be regarded as a technique that keeps C(Y) = 0 by first enforcing the whiteness of Y. Because of this constraint, the standard version of FastICA employs the sample-fourth moment as G( Y), instead of the sample-fourth cumulant. Our work analyzes some of the estimation errors introduced by the use of finite date sets in such a higher-order statistics (HOS) contrast and compares FastICA with an alternative version based on the sample-fourth cumulant, which is shown for different probability distributions having a lower variance in the generalization error in the case in which no whitening is performed, e.g. when orthonormal mixing of sources is present.
