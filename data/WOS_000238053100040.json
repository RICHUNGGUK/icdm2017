The system under development, called PASER (Planner for the Automatic Synthesis of Educational Resources), uses an automated planner, which given the initial state of the problem (learner's profile, preferences, needs and abilities), the available actions (study an educational resource, take an exam, join an e-learning course, etc.) and the goals, (obtain a certificate, learn a subject, acquire a skill, etc.) constructs a complete educational curriculum that achieves the goals. PASER is compliant with the evolving educational metadata standards that describe learning resources (LOM), content packaging (CP), educational objectives (RDCEO) and learner related information (LIP).", "paper_title": "Towards automatic synthesis of educational resources through automated planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000238053100040"}
