We find conditions for the local stability of the prey-free periodic solution by applying the Floquet theory of an impulsive differential equation and small amplitude perturbation techniques to the system. In addition, it is shown that the system is permanent under some conditions by using comparison results of impulsive differential inequalities. Moreover, we add a forcing term into the prey population's intrinsic growth rate and find the conditions for the stability and for the permanence of this system. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
