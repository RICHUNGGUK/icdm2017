With the aid of the largest subfield over which the given subspace is a vector space, the cardinality of the orbit code can be determined, and estimates for its distance can be found. This subfield is closely related to the stabilizer of the generating subspace. Finally, with a linkage construction larger, and longer, constant dimension codes can be derived from cyclic orbit codes without compromising the distance.", "paper_title": "CYCLIC ORBIT CODES AND STABILIZER SUBFIELDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000354031100004"}
