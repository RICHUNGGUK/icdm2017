Hsieh et al. presented their protocol in 2002. However, Tseng et al. found a flaw in the protocol which resulted in a key compromise impersonation attack. Later. Tseng proposed his protocol conforming which conforms to all desirable security properties and is efficient. In this paper we propose two new two-party identity-based authenticated key agreement protocols. The first is based on Hsieh et al.'s protocol and makes it immune against Tseng et al.'s attack, while the second is an efficiently improved protocol based on Tseng's protocol. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
