Recently, with high classification precision and affordable complexity, one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine (QSSVM) has been introduced to deal with the online and adaptive outlier detection in WSN. Regarding the one-sided consideration of optimization or iterative updating algorithm for QSSVM model within current techniques, we have proposed comprehensive outlier detection methods in WSN based on the QSSVM algorithm. To reduce the complexity of optimization algorithm for QSSVM model in existing techniques, a fast optimization algorithm based on average Euclidean distance has been developed and employed to the comprehensive outlier detection method. Evaluated by real and synthetic WSN data sets, our methods have shown an excellent outlier detection performance, and they have been proved to meet the requirements of online adaptive outlier detection in the case of nonstationary detection tasks of WSN.", "paper_title": "Comprehensive Outlier Detection in Wireless Sensor Network with Fast Optimization Algorithm of Classification Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000359214000001"}
