A common hypothesis for explaining the differences among image regions is that they are generated by sampling different likelihood functions called models. In this work, we construct on last hypothesis and, additionally, we assume that such samples come from independent and identically distributed random variables. Thus, the probability (likelihood) that a particular model generates the observed value (at a given pixel) is estimated by computing the likelihood of the sample composed with the surrounding pixels. This simple approach allows us to propose efficient segmentation methods able to deal with textured images. Our approach is naturally extended for combining different features. Experiments in interactive image segmentation, automatic stereo analysis and denoising of brain water diffusion multi-tensor fields demonstrate the capabilities of our approach.", "paper_title": "Spatial Sampling for Image Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000301295000006"}
