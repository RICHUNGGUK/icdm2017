The networking community has appreciated the value of large scale test labs to explore complex network interactions, as seen in projects such as Planet Lab, GENT, DETER, Emu lab, and SecSI. Virtualization has enabled the creation of many more such labs. However, one problem remains: it is time consuming, tedious and error prone to setup and configure large scale test networks. Separate devices need to be configured in a coordinated way, even in a virtual lab. AutoNetkit, an open source tool, uses abstractions and defaults to achieve both configuration and deployment and create such large-scale virtual labs. This allows researchers and operators to explore new protocols, create complex models of networks and predict consequences of configuration changes. However, our abstractions could also allow the discussion of the broader configuration management problem. Abstractions that currently configure networks in a test lab can, in the future, be employed in configuration management tools for real networks.", "paper_title": "AutoNetkit: Simplifying Large Scale, Open-Source Network Experimentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000309217600019"}
