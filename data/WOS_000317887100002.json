The necessity of data-driven control is discussed from the aspects of the history, the present, and the future of control theories and applications. The state of the art of the existing DDC methods and applications are presented with appropriate classifications and insights. The relationship between the MBC method and the DDC method, the differences among different DDC methods, and relevant topics in data-driven optimization and modeling are also highlighted. Finally, the perspective of DDC and associated research topics are briefly explored and discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
