The hybridization of finite element discretizations has the main advantage that the resulting set of algebraic equations has globally coupled degrees of freedom (DOFs) only on the skeleton of the computational mesh. Consequently, solving for these DOFs involves the solution of a potentially much smaller system. This not only reduces storage requirements but also allows for a faster solution with iterative solvers. The mesh adaptation is driven by an error estimate obtained via a discrete adjoint approach. Furthermore, the computed target functional can be corrected with this error estimate to obtain an even more accurate value. The aim of this paper is twofold: Firstly, to show the superiority of adjoint-based mesh adaptation over uniform and residual-based mesh refinement and secondly, to investigate the efficiency of the global error estimate.
