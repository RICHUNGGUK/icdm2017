The approach is based on three well-established techniques, namely formal analysis, programme analysis and software engineering (SwE) techniques. More precisely, our contribution consists of the synergistic combination of model checking, static analysis and SwE metrics that enables the automatic and efficient assessment of design models from static and dynamic perspectives. Additionally, we present the design and implementation of an automated computer-aided assessing framework integrating the proposed approach. Moreover, we discuss the related technical details and the underlying synergism. Finally, we illustrate the proposed approach by assessing a design case study that is composed of state machine and sequence diagrams.", "paper_title": "Synergistic verification and validation of systems and software engineering models", "paper_id": "WOS:000271663200003"}
