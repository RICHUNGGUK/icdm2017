We employ a technique called lightpath switching (LPS) wherein the data transmission may begin on one lightpath and switch to a different lightpath at a later time. Lightpath switches are transparent to the user and are managed by the network. Allowing LPS creates a number of segments that can use independent lightpaths. We first compare the performance of traditional routing and wavelength (RWA) assignment to routing and wavelength assignment with LPS. We show that LPS can significantly reduce blocking compared to traditional RWA. We then address the problem of routing dynamic anycast HTA dynamic circuits. We propose two heuristics to solve the anycast RWA problem: anycast with continuous segment (ACS) and anycast with lightpath switching (ALPS). In ALPS we exercise LPS, and provision a connection request by searching for the best candidate destination node is such a way that the network resources are utilized efficiently. In ACS we do not allow a connection request to switch lightpaths. The lightpaths to each candidate destination node of a request are computed using traditional RWA algorithms. We first compare the performance of ACS to ALPS and observe that ALPS achieves better blocking than ACS. Furthermore, we also compare the performance of these two anycast RWA algorithms to the traditional unicast RWA algorithm. We show that the anycast RWA algorithms presented here significantly outperform the traditional unicast RWA algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
