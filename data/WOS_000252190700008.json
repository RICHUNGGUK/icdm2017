The associated clustering problem is as follows: Given n points in R-d, find a size-k subset with minimum average pairwise L-1 distance. We present a natural approximation algorithm and show that it is a 7/4-approximation for two-dimensional grids; in d dimensions, the approximation guarantee is 2-1/2d, which is tight. We also give a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for constant dimension d, and we report on experimental results.", "paper_title": "Communication-aware processor allocation for supercomputers: Finding point sets of small average distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000252190700008"}
