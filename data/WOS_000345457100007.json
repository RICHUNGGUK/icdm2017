In this paper, we prove that if such a P systems model is endowed with antimatter and annihilation rules, then NP problems can be solved, even without non-elementary membrane division. In this way, antimatter is shown to be a frontier of tractability in Membrane Computing.", "paper_title": "Antimatter as a Frontier of Tractability in Membrane Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000345457100007"}
