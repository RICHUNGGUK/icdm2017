Several algorithms are available and benchmarking is needed to rank the different algorithms. Prior work has argued that the quality of the models produced by the algorithms can be evaluated by measuring compactness, generality and specificity. In this paper severe problems with these standard measures are analysed both theoretically and experimentally both on natural and synthetic datasets. We also propose that a Ground Truth Correspondence Measure (GCM) is used for benchmarking and in this paper benchmarking is performed on several state of the art algorithms using seven real and one synthetic dataset.", "paper_title": "Measures for benchmarking of automatic correspondence algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000250379300003"}
