The implementation of a combined presentation of effect size and statistical significance in a graphical method, added to the ordering of the variables based on the effect-ordered data display principle was deemed useful by the authors to facilitate in the process of recognizing meaningful patterns in these associations. Materials and methods: The requirements, analyses and graphical presentation of the feature-expression heat map are described. The graphs display associations of two sets of ordered variables where a one-way direction is assumed. The associations are depicted as circles representing a combination of effect size (color) and statistical significance (radius). Results: An example dataset is presented and relation to other methods, limitations, areas of application and possible future enhancements are discussed. Conclusion: The feature-expression heat map is a useful graphical instrument to explore associations in complex biological systems where one-way direction is assumed, such as genotype-phenotype pathophysiological models.
