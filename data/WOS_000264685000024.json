Different from the earlier unified moving mesh gas-kinetic method [C.Q.Jin, K. Xu, An unified moving grid gas-kinetic method in Eulerian space for viscous flow computation, J. Comput. Phys. 222 (2007) 155175], the coupling of the fluid equations and geometrical conservation laws has been removed in order to make the scheme applicable for any quadrilateral or unstructured mesh rather than parallelogram in 2D case. Since a purely Lagrangian method is always associated with mesh entangling, in order to avoid computational collapsing in multidimensional flow simulation, the mesh velocity is constructed by considering both fluid velocity (Lagrangian methodology) and diffusive velocity (Regenerating Eulerian mesh function). Therefore, we obtain a generalized Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method by properly designing a mesh velocity instead of re-generating a new mesh after distortion. As a result, the remapping step to interpolate flow variables from old mesh to new mesh is avoided. The current method provides a general framework, which can be considered as a remapping-free ALE-type method. Since there is great freedom in choosing mesh velocity, in order to improve the accuracy and robustness of the method, the adaptive moving mesh method [H.Z. Tang, T. Tang, Adaptive mesh methods for one-and two-dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 41 (2003) 487-515] can be also used to construct a mesh velocity to concentrate mesh to regions with high flow gradients. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
