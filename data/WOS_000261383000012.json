Although Ising-like interactions affect the growth dynamics, deposited spins are frozen and not allowed to flip. This paper focuses on recent developments and future prospects, such as spontaneous switching phenomena, critical behavior associated with fractal, wetting, and order-disorder phase transitions, the equilibrium/nonequilibrium correspondence conjecture, as well as dynamical and critical features of the MEM defined on complex network substrates.", "paper_title": "THE MAGNETIC EDEN MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000261383000012"}
