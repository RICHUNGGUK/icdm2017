The polymorphism, realized through a general node-link interface and proper discretization, offers several prominent advantages. First of all, PDNL allows road facilities in the same network to be represented by different traffic flow models based on the tradeoff of efficiency and realism and/or the characteristics of the targeted problem. Second, new macroscopic link/node models can be easily plugged into the framework and compared against existing ones. Third, PDNL decouples links and nodes in network loading, and thus opens the door to parallel computing. Finally, PDNL keeps track of individual vehicular quanta of arbitrary size, which makes it possible to replicate analytical loading results as closely as desired. PDNL, thus, offers an ideal platform for studying both analytical dynamic traffic assignment problems of different kinds and macroscopic traffic simulation.", "paper_title": "A polymorphic dynamic network loading model", "paper_id": "WOS:000252210000003"}
