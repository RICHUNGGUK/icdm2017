Anonymizing data sets via generalization to satisfy certain privacy requirements such as k-anonymity is a widely used category of privacy preserving techniques. At present, the scale of data in many cloud applications increases tremendously in accordance with the Big Data trend, thereby making it a challenge for commonly used software tools to capture, manage, and process such large-scale data within a tolerable elapsed time. As a result, it is a challenge for existing anonymization approaches to achieve privacy preservation on privacy-sensitive large-scale data sets due to their insufficiency of scalability. In this paper, we propose a scalable two-phase top-down specialization (TDS) approach to anonymize large-scale data sets using the MapReduce framework on cloud. In both phases of our approach, we deliberately design a group of innovative MapReduce jobs to concretely accomplish the specialization computation in a highly scalable way. Experimental evaluation results demonstrate that with our approach, the scalability and efficiency of TDS can be significantly improved over existing approaches.", "paper_title": "A Scalable Two-Phase Top-Down Specialization Approach for Data Anonymization Using MapReduce on Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000329051500010"}
