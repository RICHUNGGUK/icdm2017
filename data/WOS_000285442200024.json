Conjunctive keyword search is one of these extensions, however, most of these constructed schemes can not solve conjunctive with subset keywords search function. Subset keywords search means that the receiver could query the subset keywords of all the keywords embedded in the ciphertext. In this paper, we study the problem of conjunctive with subset keywords search function, discuss the drawbacks about the existed schemes, and then give out a more efficient construction of Public Key Encryption with Conjunctive-Subset Keywords Search (PECSK) scheme. A comparison with other schemes about efficiency will be presented. We also list the security requirements of our scheme, then give out the security analysis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
