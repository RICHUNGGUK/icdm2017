Based on this, a new method is proposed to locate beam cracks and to estimate their depths. The fault-induced modal shape and frequency changes of cracked structures are taken into account to construct a new hybrid crack detection method. The method includes two steps: crack localization and depth estimation. The locations of the cracks are determined by applying the wavelet transform to the modal shape. Using the measured natural frequencies as inputs, the depths of the cracks are estimated from a database established by wavelet finite element method. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid two-step method is demonstrated by numerical simulation and experimental investigation of a cantilever beam with two cracks. Our analyses also indicate that the proposed method performed reasonably well at certain level of noise.", "paper_title": "Wavelet-Based Detection of Beam Cracks Using Modal Shape and Frequency Measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000304902800004"}
