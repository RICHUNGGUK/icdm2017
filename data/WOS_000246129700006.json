Our approach is based upon reorganizing the regular linear GOP encoding structure to prevent the error propagation phenomenon and recover lost frames by interpolation. For errors taking place in a single frame, we guarantee that errors will not propagate to the neighboring frames. Therefore, both the past and future temporal information can be used to reconstruct the damaged frame. Furthermore, the proposed coding structures can also recover successive lost frames. In low power and low bandwidth circumstances such as some mobile devices, the proposed structures can also dynamically adjust the video quality level to adapt to a fluctuant network environment.
