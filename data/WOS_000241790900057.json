This method could be used with the Bayesian Programming formalism, being a very useful tool when working with real world data. It has the advantage of learning unknown probabilistic distributions directly from raw data, and to remain more balanced than other previous methods. Finally, an application to learn a fuzzy control system, using this approach, will be presented.", "paper_title": "Learning discrete probability distributions with a multi-resolution binary tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900057"}
