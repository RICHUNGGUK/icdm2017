A Distributed Luby Transform (DLT) codes based transmission scheme is proposed over lossy VANETs to reduce transmission latency. Furthermore, focusing on the degree distribution of DLT codes, a Modified Deconvolved Soliton Distribution (MDSD) is designed to further reduce the transmission latency and improve the transmission reliability. We investigate the network behavior of the transmission scheme with MDSD, called MDLT based scheme. Closed-form expressions of the transmission latency of the proposed schemes are derived. Performance simulation results show that DLT based scheme can reduce transmission latency significantly compared with traditional Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) and Luby Transform (LT) codes based schemes. In contrast to DLT based scheme, the MDLT based scheme can further reduce transmission latency and improve FER performance substantially, when both the source-to-relay and relay-to-sink channels are erasure channels.", "paper_title": "A Distributed LT Codes-based Data Transmission Technique for Multicast Services in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000318245700008"}
