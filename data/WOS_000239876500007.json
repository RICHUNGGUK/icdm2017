PTreeRec involves three basic steps. First, regions of maximal segment pairs (MSPs) based on an all-against-all pairwise comparison of genomes are located. Second, a distance matrix is calculated from MSP scores or coverage. Finally, a phylogenetic tree is reconstructed by the neighbor-joining method. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
