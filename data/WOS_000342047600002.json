Design/methodology/approach - To find a sample of name variants across DLs (e.g. DBLP and ACM) and in a single DL (e.g. ACM), the approach is based on two bipartite matching algorithms: Maximum Weighted Bipartite Matching and Maximum Cardinality Bipartite Matching. Findings - First, the authors validated the effectiveness and efficiency of the bipartite matching algorithms. The authors also studied the nature of real cases of author name variants that had been found across DLs (e.g. ACM, CiteSeer and DBLP) and in a single DL. Originality/value - To the best of the authors knowledge, there is less research effort to understand the nature of author name variants shown in DLs. A thorough analysis can help focus research effort on real problems that arise when the authors perform duplicate detection methods.", "paper_title": "A case study for understanding the nature of redundant entities in bibliographic digital libraries", "paper_id": "WOS:000342047600002"}
