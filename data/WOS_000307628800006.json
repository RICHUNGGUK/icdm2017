In order to satisfy the requirements of a remote user authentication scheme, the smart card has become an essential device, one that is widely used because of its low computation cost and expedient portability. To achieve computation efficiency and system security, many researchers have focused on this field and published corresponding literature. Recently, Chen et al. proposed security enhancement on an improvement on two remote user authentication schemes using smart cards. They claimed their method does not have the security weaknesses of Wang et al.'s scheme such as impersonation attack and parallel session attack, and preserves important criteria through which a legal user can negotiate a specific session key with his remote authentication server by executing mutual authentication. Meanwhile, the scheme can provide high-level perfect forward secrecy. However, there is much room for security enhancement in Chen et al.'s scheme. In this paper, we suggest that serious vulnerabilities still threaten security requirements, and that security enhancements still cannot withstand known-key attack and off-line guessing attack. Accordingly, we propose an enhanced scheme to remedy these security weaknesses and prove that this scheme is more secure and efficient for network application with merits in its properties.", "paper_title": "A SMART CARD BASED AUTHENTICATION SCHEME FOR REMOTE USER LOGIN AND VERIFICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000307628800006"}
