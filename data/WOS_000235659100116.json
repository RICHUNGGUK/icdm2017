Operation consistency of Web interfaces is not guaranteed by the traditional control mode. This paper presents a Petri-net based approach to analyze the design of Web interface. The proposed method can be used to identify interface inconsistency and convert interface operation model featured by Petri-net for increase the coverage ability of graph; hence improving the graph. Finally, the paper describes the consistency rules for various operations using XML protocol with the aim at achieving standardize operations of user interface.", "paper_title": "Consistency of user interface based on Petri-net", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100116"}
