We first elaborate the issues encountered by the original algorithm and then propose a corrected version for the biobjective case using an exact representation of the nondominated set associated with an appropriate update procedure. Then we introduce several improvements using better bound sets and branching strategies and finally present some experiments to study the effectiveness of our propositions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
