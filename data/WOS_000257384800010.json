Our algorithm exploits connectivity information and uses the adjacency relationships between triangles to perform hierarchical culling. This can be combined with table-based lookups to eliminate duplicate elementary tests. In practice, our approach can reduce the number of elementary tests by two orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on various challenging rigid body and deformable simulations.", "paper_title": "Adjacency-based culling for continuous collision detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000257384800010"}
