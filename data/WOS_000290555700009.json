We compare our method to two standard methods for trend change detection and evaluate them with Monte Carlo simulations for different time series lengths, autocorrelation strengths, trend slopes and distribution of residuals. The proposed method turns out to estimate T better for small and correlated time series. The methods were also applied to global temperature records suggesting different turning points.
