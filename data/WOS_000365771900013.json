But it is too expensive to deploy on each bus. So, we need to investigate how to deploy PMU to satisfy our observation requirements with minimum PMU numbers. This problem is called the optimal PMU placement (OPP). In this paper, we employ differential evolution (DE) algorithm to solve the OPP problem. Our optimization target is to make the power grid completely observable with maximum redundancy and minimum number of PMU. The proposed method is tested on IEEE 14-bus system, IEEE 30-bus system and IEEE 57-bus system respectively with considering the zero injection.", "paper_title": "Differential evolution-based optimal placement of phase measurement unit considering measurement redundancy", "paper_id": "WOS:000365771900013"}
