The Kwanza river, the longest and most plentiful in Angola, is a paradigmatic case, as it is one of the main sources of wealth in that country. Many people base, direct or indirectly, their living on its water, and many economical activities, including energy production, depend also on its stream. We provide a model for the multiobjective multipurpose management of the Kwanza river. The problem is complicated by the need to take into account uncertainty in various involved processes, to plan over a long period of time, and the presence of several conflicting objectives. We describe also a decision support system implementing our model.", "paper_title": "MULTIOBJECTIVE DECISION SUPPORT FOR THE KWANZA RIVER MANAGEMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000325419500007"}
