First, a delay- and range-dependent criterion for a given H-infinity performance is derived. Second, a memoryless H-infinity state-feedback controller is designed based on a performance analysis. Finally, two numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that both the upper bound and range of an interval-like time-varying delay affect the stability and/or H-infinity performance of a system.", "paper_title": "Delay-dependent H-infinity control of linear discrete-time systems with an interval-like time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000253658900009"}
