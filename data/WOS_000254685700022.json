A hybrid Eulerin-Lagrangian method is used in which the velocity and pressure are discretized oil a fixed mesh and Lagrangian particles are used to implicitly track the interface between the two phases. The Navier Stokes equations are solved using an approximate GodLmov projection method, collectively called the Godunov inarker-particle projection scheme. The results show good qualitative agreement with previous research as well as demonstrating the efficacy of the method.
