Building on traditional modelling methods, we propose the online remeshing of a volumetric deformable model for locally adapting the underlying mesh and thus optimising the computational workload. Our technique overcomes limitations of previous methods that made it difficult to modify the topology of the mesh online. The performance of our methodology is demonstrated for each of the two main tissue modelling methods: mass-spring systems and finite element methods.", "paper_title": "Local mesh adaptation for soft tissue simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239565100023"}
