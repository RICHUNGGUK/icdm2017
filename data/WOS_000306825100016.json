In this paper, we introduce a novel phrase model, in which treebank tags are employed to decorate the bilingual phrase pairs. We use tag sequences, instead of phrase pairs, to train the lexicalized reordering model. Since the number of treebank tags is much smaller than the number of words, the tag sequence based reordering model is smaller and more accurate than the phrase based reordering model. Experiments were carried out on three types of models: the phrase model, the POS tag encapsulated phrase (PTEP) model and the syntactic tag encapsulated phrase (STEP) model. The STEP model obtained higher BLEU-4 score than other models on NIST MT tasks.", "paper_title": "Decorated Phrase Model and Syntax-Based Reordering Model for Statistical Machine Translation", "paper_id": "WOS:000306825100016"}
