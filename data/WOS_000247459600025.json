Hit-list scanning is a technique for accelerating the initial spread of a worm. Due to the recent surge of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems with large numbers of users, P2P systems can be a potential vehicle for the active worms to achieve fast worm propagation in the Internet too. When the technique of hit-list scanning is used on top of P2P system, some new characters emerge. In this paper, we have defined an L system and an O system. Based on modeling the spread of active worms, we focused all our attention on analyzing the characteristics of the spread of active worms between the L system and the O system which can help us design and control the P2P systems effectively as well as defend against the propagation of worms.
