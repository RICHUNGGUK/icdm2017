The objective is to minimize the makespan. To satisfy reality, we consider the processing times as fuzzy numbers. To the best of our knowledge, scheduling with learning effects and fuzzy processing times on parallel machines has never been studied. The possibility measure will be used to rank the fuzzy numbers. Two heuristic algorithms, the simulated annealing algorithm and the genetic algorithm, are proposed. Computational experiments have been conducted to evaluate their performance.
