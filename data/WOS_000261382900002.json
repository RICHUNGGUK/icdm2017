We propose measures for quantifying the political memory using the correlation function and scaling analysis. These methods reveal time correlations and self-affine scaling properties, respectively, and they have been applied to polling data from Norway. Power-law dependencies have been found between correlation measures and party size, and different scaling behaviors have been found for large and small parties.", "paper_title": "CORRELATIONS BETWEEN POLITICAL PARTY SIZE AND VOTER MEMORY: A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF OPINION POLLS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261382900002"}
