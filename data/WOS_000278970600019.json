This technique uses a cylindrical parallax barrier and a one-dimensional light source array. We have developed an experimental display system using this technique. Since this technique is based on the parallax panoramagram, the parallax number and resolution are limited by the diffraction at the parallax barrier. In order to solve this problem, we improved the technique by revolving the parallax barrier. The improved technique was incorporated into two experimental display systems. The newer one is capable of displaying 3D color video images within a 200-mm diameter and a 256-mm height. Images have a resolution of 1254 circumferential pixels and 256 vertical pixels, and are refreshed at 30 Hz. Each pixel has a viewing angle of 60 degrees that is divided into over 70 views so that the angular parallax interval of each pixel is less than 1 degree. These pixels are arranged on a cylindrical surface to allow for the produced 3D images to be observed from all directions. In this case, observers may barely perceive the discrete parallax.
