But mobile devices at present have severe limitations in terms of processing, memory capabilities and energy. Minimizing the energy usage in mobile devices poses significant challenges in mobile grids. This paper presents energy constrained resource allocation optimization for mobile grids. The goal of the paper is not only to reduce energy consumption, but also to improve the application utility in a mobile grid environment with a limited energy charge, ensuring battery lifetime and the deadlines of the grid applications. The application utility not only depends on its allocated resources including computation and communication resources, but also on the consumed energy, this leads to a coupled utility model, where the utilities are functions of allocated resources and consumed energy. Energy constrained resources allocation optimization is formulated as a utility Optimization problem, which can be decomposed into two subproblems, the interaction between the two sub-problems is controlled through the use of a pricing variable. The paper proposes a price-based distributed energy constrained resources allocation optimization algorithm. In the simulation, the performance evaluation of our energy constrained resources allocation optimization algorithm is conducted. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
