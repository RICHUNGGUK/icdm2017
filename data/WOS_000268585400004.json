It gives an unconditional lower bound on the computation time from a given program in absence of auxiliary information. Variants known as logical depth and computational depth are expressed in Kolmogorov complexity theory. We derive quantitative relation between logical depth and computational depth and unify the different depth notions by relating them to A. Kolmogorov and L. Levin's fruitful notion of randomness deficiency. Subsequently, we revisit the computational depth of infinite strings, study the notion of super deep sequences and relate it with other approaches.", "paper_title": "Depth as Randomness Deficiency", "paper_id": "WOS:000268585400004"}
