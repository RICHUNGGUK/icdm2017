To select reliable relay nodes for data transmission, a trust-status-aware data forwarding strategy is proposed in this article. By exploiting locally recorded forwarding behavior information, process-based and relationship-based credibility can be precisely evaluated in a distributed manner. Additionally, with the assistance of an effective intrusion detection mechanism, reasonable relay selection can be perfected. Numerical results show that the proposed mechanism can provide reliable data transmission with high QoP and improved user QoE, which dramatically reduces the network load and enhances the resource utilization.", "paper_title": "QUALITY-OF-PROTECTION-DRIVEN DATA FORWARDING FOR INTERMITTENTLY CONNECTED WIRELESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000360548200011"}
