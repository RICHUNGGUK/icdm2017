This paper studies modeling and simulation of assembly line with overlapped and stopped operation, builds mathematical model for the assembly line both under certainty and uncertainty environment. Assembly line problem with these two conditions is simulated, and a simulation prototype system is developed. The assembly line simulation at assembly workshop in an auto company of Beijing validates the effectiveness and correctness of the prototype system. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
