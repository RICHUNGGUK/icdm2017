Both centralized and distributed schemes are proposed. The centralized scheme is based on the greedy algorithm, serving as a performance bound to the distributed scheme. The distributed scheme is to solve the system-wide optimization problem in the flat network model, i.e. no central control node. Furthermore, it requires relatively low inter-cell exchange information among neighboring cells over an inter-cell channel, e.g. X2 interface in the LTE network. The proposed design objective is to minimize the number of mobile users that do not satisfy the specified average throughput, while distributing the user traffic load as uniformly as possible among the neighboring cells. Our simulation results for a uniform user distribution demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve up to almost 80% of a load balancing gain that has been achieved by a greedy algorithm in the centralized optimization.
