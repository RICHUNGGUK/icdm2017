The significance of the h-blossom is that the h-blossom satisfies a dual functional property for h-Bezier curves over arbitrary intervals. Using the h-blossom, several new identities involving the h-Bernstein bases are developed including an h-variant of Marsden's identity. In addition, for each h-Bezier curve of degree n, a collection of n! new, affine invariant, recursive evaluation algorithms are derived. Using two of these recursive evaluation algorithms, a recursive subdivision procedure for h-Bezier curves is constructed. Starting from the original control polygon of an h-Bezier curve, this subdivision procedure generates a sequence of control polygons that converges rapidly to the original h-Bezier curve.
