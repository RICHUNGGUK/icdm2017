The idea is to map time-space such that the interfaces can evolve exponentially fast in the new time scale while the area/volume enclosed by the interface remains unchanged. The rescaling scheme significantly reduces the computation time (especially for slow growth), and enables one to accurately simulate the very long-time dynamics of moving interfaces. We then implement this scheme in a Hele-Shaw problem, examine the dynamics for a number of different injection fluxes, and present the largest and most pronounced viscous fingering simulations to date.
