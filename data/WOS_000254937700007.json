It can learn arbitrary n-inputs patterns with O(n) time complexity. There are no multipliers required, and the learned knowledge is stored in a general purpose RAM with a size ranging from O(n) to O(n(2)). The proposed architecture is composed only of four building blocks, an iterative nonlinear expander, a sorter, a RAM memory, and an accumulator, all of them readily available in either digital hardware or software technology. Simulation results indicate good accuracy for a wide variety of benchmark problems.
