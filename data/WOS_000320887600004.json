The outcome is a finite collection of computable invariants which answer the basic questions on persistence and in addition encode the topology of the source space and its relevant subspaces. Unlike persistence of real-valued maps, circle-valued maps enjoy a different class of invariants called Jordan cells in addition to bar codes. We establish a relation between the homology of the source space and of its relevant subspaces with these invariants and provide a new algorithm to compute these invariants from an input matrix that encodes a circle-valued map on an input simplicial complex.", "paper_title": "Topological Persistence for Circle-Valued Maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000320887600004"}
