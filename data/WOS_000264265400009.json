The hydrogen-bonded interactions in HB=BH center dot center dot center dot HX are found to be stronger than those in H2C=CH2 center dot center dot center dot HX and OCB=BCO center dot center dot center dot HX. The analyses of natural bond orbital (NBO) and the electron density shifts reveal that the nature of the T-shaped X-H center dot center dot center dot pi hydrogen-bonded interaction is that much of the lost density from the pi-orbital of B=B bond is shifted toward the hydrogen atom of the proton donor, leading to the electron density accumulation and the formation of the hydrogen bond. The atoms in molecules (AIM) theory have also been applied to characterize bond critical points and confirm that the B=B double bond can be a potential proton acceptor.", "paper_title": "A theoretical study on unusual intermolecular T-shaped X-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions between the singlet state HB=BH and HF, HCl, HCN or H2C2", "paper_id": "WOS:000264265400009"}
