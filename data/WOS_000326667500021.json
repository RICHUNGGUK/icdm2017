Specifically, the new closed-form expressions for cumulative distribution function (CDF) and outage probability (OP) are presented over time varying Rayleigh-fading channels. Furthermore, simple approximate OP is derived assessing the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), which identifies the diversity behavior. Numerical results show excellent agreement with theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Outage Performance Analysis of a Multiuser Two-Way Relaying Network with Feedback Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000326667500021"}
