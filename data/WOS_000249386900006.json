Here we have shown that the uncertain information processing capability of fuzzy set theory based techniques can successfully be employed for modeling and simulation of complex real life natural systems through fuzzy model-based approach. Three case studies in the form of genesis of tropical cyclone, evolution of tumor in human tissues and occurrence of turbulence in a fluid flow have been discussed with fuzzy model-based approach. A fuzzy evolutionary algorithm has been described for solving a set of one dimensional fuzzy differential inclusion relations.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy knowledge-based and model-based systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000249386900006"}
