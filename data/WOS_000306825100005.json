The current paper further studies the syntactic structure of the system L*, presents several new results with respect to this system. Especially, a simplified system which contains only seven axioms is proposed, and the system is found to be equivalent to the original system. Also, the independence of the simplified system is proved in the present paper.", "paper_title": "On the Independence of the Formal System L*", "paper_id": "WOS:000306825100005"}
