Inspired by the CS theory, the interior problem in computed tomography is proved uniquely solvable by minimizing the region-of-interest's total variation if the imaging object is piecewise constant or polynomial. This is called CS-based interior tomography. However, the CS-based algorithms require high computational cost due to their iterative nature. In this paper, a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based parallel computing technique is applied to accelerate the CS-based interior reconstruction for practical application in both fan-beam and cone-beam geometries. Our results show that the CS-based interior tomography is able to reconstruct excellent volumetric images with GPU acceleration in a few minutes.", "paper_title": "GPU-Based Acceleration for Interior Tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000209653800051"}
