These problems arise in many industrial fields such as apparel manufacturing, sheet metal layout, shoe manufacturing, VLSI layout, furniture layout, etc., and are known by a variety of names: layout, packing, nesting, loading, placement, marker making, etc. When the 2-dimensional objects to be packed are non-rectangular the problem is known as the nesting problem. The nesting problem is strongly NP-hard. Furthermore, the geometrical aspects of this problem make it really hard to solve in practice. In this paper we describe a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) model for the nesting problem based on an earlier proposal of Daniels, Li and Milenkovic, and analyze it computationally. We also introduce a new MIP model for a subproblem arising in the construction of nesting solutions, called the multiple containment problem, and show its potentials in finding improved solutions.", "paper_title": "Mixed-integer programming models for nesting problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000265020500002"}
