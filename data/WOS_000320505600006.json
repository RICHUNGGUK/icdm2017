However, highly specific ways to inhibit TGF-beta signalling need to be developed to prevent cross-talk with related receptors and minimise unwanted side effects. We have used used virtual screening and molecular docking to identify small molecule inhibitors of TGF-beta binding to T beta RII. The crystal structure of TGF-beta 3 in complex with the extracellular domain of the type II TGF-beta receptor was taken as a starting point for molecular docking and we developed a structure-based pharmacophore model to identify compounds that competitively inhibit the binding of TGF-beta to T beta RII and antogonize TGF-beta signalling. We have experimentally tested 67 molecules suggested by in silico screening and similarity searching for their ability to inhibit TGF-beta signalling in TGF-beta-dependent luciferase assays in vitro and the molecule with the strongest inhibition had an IC50 of 18 mu M. These compounds were selected to bind to the SS1 subsite (composed of F30, C31, D32, I50, T51 S52, I53, C54 and E55) of T beta RII and all share the general property of being aromatic and fairly flat. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that this was the most likely binding mode. The computational methods used and the hits identified in this study provide an excellent guide to medicinal chemistry efforts to design tighter binding molecules to disrupt the TGF-beta/T beta RII interaction.", "paper_title": "Identification of novel small molecule TGF-beta antagonists using structure-based drug design", "paper_id": "WOS:000320505600006"}
