We developed a pharmacophore model based on known GPR139 surrogate agonists which led us to propose aromatic-containing dipeptides as potential ligands. Upon testing, the dipeptides demonstrated agonism in the G(q) pathway. Next, in testing all 20 proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acids, L-tryptophan and L-phenylalanine were found to have EC50 values of 220 and 320 mu M, respectively, making them the first putative endogenous agonists for GPR139.", "paper_title": "Computer-Aided Discovery of Aromatic L-alpha-Amino Acids as Agonists of the Orphan G Protein-Coupled Receptor GPR139", "paper_id": "WOS:000337937100001"}
