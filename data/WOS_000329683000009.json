In this paper, we present a cost-effective way of simultaneously accelerating both of OpenVG and SVG Tiny, based on the multimedia-processing hardware, which is wide-spread on mobile phones and media devices. Through the effective use of these multimedia processors, we successfully accelerated OpenVG and SVG Tiny at least 3.5 times to at most 30 times, even with less power consumption and less CPU usage.
