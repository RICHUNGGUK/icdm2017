The idea of this limiter is to reconstruct the entire polynomial, instead of reconstructing point values or moments in the classical WENO reconstructions. That is, the reconstruction polynomial on the target cell is a convex combination of polynomials on this cell and its neighboring cells and the nonlinear weights of the convex combination follow the classical WENO procedure. The main advantage of this limiter is its simplicity in implementation, especially for multi-dimensional meshes. Numerical results in one and two dimensions are provided to illustrate the behavior of this procedure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
