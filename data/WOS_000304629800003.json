This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In this context the JUMAS system, stem from the homonymous European Project (www.jumasproject.eu), takes up the challenge of exploiting semantics and machine learning techniques towards a better usability of multimedia judicial folders. Findings - In this paper one of the most challenging issues addressed by the JUMAS project is described: extracting meaningful abstracts of given judicial debates in order to efficiently access salient contents. In particular, the authors present an ontology enhanced multimedia summarization environment able to derive a synthetic representation of judicial media contents by a limited loss of meaningful information while overcoming the information overload problem. Originality/value - The adoption of ontology-based query expansion has made it possible to improve the performance of multimedia summarization algorithms with respect to the traditional approaches based on statistics. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been evaluated on real media contents, highlighting a good potential for extracting key events in the challenging area of judicial proceedings.", "paper_title": "Semantic storyboard of judicial debates: a novel multimedia summarization environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000304629800003"}
