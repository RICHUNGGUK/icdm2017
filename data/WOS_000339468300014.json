For example, a rule A -> alpha & (sic)B defines a symbol a, as long as it is preceded by a string defined by B. The conjunction operator in this example is taken from conjunctive grammars (Okhotin, 2001), which are an extension of ordinary context-free grammars that maintains most of their practical properties, including many parsing algorithms. This paper gives two equivalent definitions of grammars with left contexts by logical deduction and by language equations and establishes their basic properties, including a transformation to a normal form and a cubictime parsing algorithm, with a square-time version for unambiguous grammars.
