This stochastic volatility model preserves the completeness of the market and can potentially reproduce the observed smile and term structure patterns of implied volatility. A calibration procedure based on ad-hoc numerical schemes for hypoelliptic PDEs is proposed and used to quantitatively investigate the pricing performance of the model. Numerical results based on S&P500 option prices are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
