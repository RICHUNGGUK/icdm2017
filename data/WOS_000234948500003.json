The XL algorithm was proposed to be a more efficient algorithm to solve a system of algebraic equations under a special condition, without calculating a whole Grobner basis. But in our result, it is shown that to solve a system of algebraic equations with a special condition under which the XL algorithm works is equivalent to calculate the reduced Grobner basis of the ideal associated with the system. Moreover we show that the XL algorithm is a Grobner basis algorithm which can be represented as a redundant variant of a known Grobner basis algorithm F-4.", "paper_title": "Relation between the XL algorithm and Grobner basis algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000234948500003"}
