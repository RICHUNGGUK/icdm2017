The wind-induced performance-based design optimization framework has been developed to take into account uncertainties in the vibration related occupant comfort problems of tall buildings. An innovative decoupling strategy is adopted to transform the original coupled reliability-based optimization problem into two separated sub problems, which are then solved using the inverse reliability approach and Optimality Criteria (OC) algorithm respectively. A 60-story building example is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed reliability performance-based design optimization method. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
