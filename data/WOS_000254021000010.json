Comparisons are made with direct numerical simulation data and reliable measurements. Global properties of the jet such as the spreading and centerline velocity decay rates are investigated. The mean-flow and turbulence parameters in the self-similar region are also studied. Mixed models developed for boundary layers compare well with the benchmark jet data and the linear model predictions. Differences between the models are minor and none showed any clear advantage in all the data comparisons. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
