Content provider mobility in the NDN allows users to receive real-time traffic when the content providers are on the move. However, the current solutions for managing these mobile content providers suffer several issues such as long handover latency, high cost, and non-optimal routing path. In this paper, we survey main approaches for provider mobility in NDN and propose an optimal scheme to support the mobile content providers in the large-scale NDN domain. Our scheme predicts the movement of the provider and uses state information in the NDN forwarding plane to set up an optimal new routing path for mobile providers. By numerical analysis, our approach provides NDN users with better service access delay and lower total handover cost compared with the current solutions.", "paper_title": "Optimal Provider Mobility in Large-Scale Named- Data Networking", "paper_id": "WOS:000366399000016"}
