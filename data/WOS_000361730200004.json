The local structures are revealed by running fuzzy clustering (Fuzzy C-Means), whereas building a global view is realized by forming global proximity matrices on a basis of the local proximity matrices implied by the partition matrices formed for the individual data sets. To capture the diversity of local structures, a global perspective at the structure of the data is captured in terms of a granular proximity matrix, which is built by invoking a principle of justifiable granularity with regard to the aggregation of individual proximity matrices. The three main scenarios are investigated: (a) designing a global structure among the data through building a granular proximity matrix, (b) refining a local structure (expressed in the form of a partition matrix) by engaging structural knowledge conveyed at the higher level of the hierarchy and provided in the form of the granular proximity matrix, (c) forming a consensus-building scheme and updating all local structures with the aid of the proximity dependences available at the upper layer of the hierarchy. While the first scenario delivers a passive approach to the development of the global structure, the two others are of an active nature by facilitating a structural feedback between the local and global level of the hierarchy of the developed structures. The study is illustrated through a series of experiments carried out for synthetic and publicly available data sets.", "paper_title": "Distributed proximity-based granular clustering: towards a development of global structural relationships in data", "paper_id": "WOS:000361730200004"}
