The new designed algorithm is called principal whitened gradient-projection algorithm. In the principal natural gradient step, we use principal whitened gradient algorithm to obtain an optimal trajectory of the weight vector on the B-spline manifold from the viewpoint of information geometry. In the projection step, we project the selected points on B onto M. The coordinates of the projections on M give the trajectory of the control input u.", "paper_title": "Principal whitened gradient-projection algorithm for distribution control", "paper_id": "WOS:000318197000018"}
