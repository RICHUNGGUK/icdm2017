We design a realistic simulation model taking into account not only deterministic features, but also elements of uncertainty. Following a statistical analysis of the results, we are able to indicate how the most important variables affect large scale performance descriptors such as berth occupancy, queueing hours and costs. The model is thoroughly validated against historical data and is subsequently applied to determine the impact of changes in key parameters on overall port operation and to suggest possible improvements of the modelled system.
