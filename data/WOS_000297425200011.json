Several approaches have been proposed to evaluate the MOS values of voice paths. However, these solutions require extra servers/gateways to conduct heavy computation for MOS measurement of VoIP calls. We propose two MOS measurement procedures for mobile devices. In our approach, a simple program is installed in each of the mobile devices (through an app-store like mechanism). In the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) MOS measurement procedure, a lightweight real-time table lookup solution significantly reduces the computation time of PESQ MOS measurement from 315.4 s to 3 s. In the E-model MOS measurement procedure, the E-model MOS value can be accurately computed in 5.35 s.", "paper_title": "Real-Time VoIP Quality Measurement for Mobile Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000297425200011"}
