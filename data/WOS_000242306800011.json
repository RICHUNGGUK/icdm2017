This is the first attempt to account for inversions in an evolutionary model of tandemly repeated genes. We present a time-efficient branch-and-bound algorithm and show, using simulated data, that it can be used to detect \"wrong\" phylogenies among a set of putative ones for a given gene family. An application on a published phylogeny of KRAB zinc finger genes is presented.", "paper_title": "Evolution of tandemly repeated sequences through duplication and inversion", "paper_id": "WOS:000242306800011"}
