However, a gap between increasing data size and our ability to visualize them still remains. Despite the great amount of progress that has been made in the field of flow visualization over the last two decades, a number of challenges remain. While the visualization of 2D flow has many good solutions, the visualization of 3D flow still poses many problems. Challenges such as domain coverage, speed of computation, and perception remain key directions for further research. Flow visualization with a focus on surface-based techniques forms the basis of this literature survey, including surface construction techniques and visualization methods applied to surfaces. We detail our investigation into these algorithms with discussions of their applicability and their relative strengths and drawbacks. We review the most important challenges when considering such visualizations. The result is an up-to-date overview of the current state-of-the-art that highlights both solved and unsolved problems in this rapidly evolving branch of research. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
