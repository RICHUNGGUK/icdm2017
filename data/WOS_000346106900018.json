Congruence relations for the Wiener index for specific families of trees were studied by several authors. Namely, in [Gutman, Rouvray, Comput. Chem. 14 (1990) 29-32] it is shown that Wiener indices of any two trees on the same number of vertices and with 1-factor are congruent modulo 4. Recently, the author of [Lin, MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 70 (2013) 575-582] generalized this result to trees with path factors and [Gutman, Xu, Liu, to appear in Filomat] generalized it to even much larger class of graphs. We continue this work by establishing congruence relations for various large families of graphs with a tree-like structure, whose \"vertices\" and \"edges\" represent some graphs of prescribed type and congruence.", "paper_title": "A Congruence Relation for the Wiener Index of Graphs with a Tree-Like Structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000346106900018"}
