The difficulty focuses on how to resolve the contradiction between lower computational load and higher request of animating quality. A highly effective method of modeling and animating of debris flow with adaptive grid is presented. First, the debris flow is modeled as Bingham plastic fluid with view-dependent adaptive grid that is adopted to model the flow volume, and the boundless grids can cover the large scale region of debris flow. Then the mixed grids are built for confluent flows, and the two-way coupling interaction between flows and environment is considered. After extracting the debris flow surface, adaptive surface tension combining wave particles equation is used to enhance the details and sprays are generated by particles considering the interaction between two fluid volumes. Finally, different dynamic realistic scenes with debris flow are successfully animating at interactive rates.
