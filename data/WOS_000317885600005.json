This paper discusses the general approach to such a fluid-structure interaction and further presents a detailed comparison between two representative materials used as aircraft surfaces. Two structure surfaces are respectively composed of natural rubber with high elasticity and steel alloy 1020 with high stiffness. In the test environment, the experimental model has a velocity of 8 m/s relative to the airflow, and the Reynolds number is higher than 5.44 x 10(4). The simulations of the two aerodynamic models using the two materials were performed in ANSYS CFX. The simulation results have shown that the aerodynamic shape with flexible rubber material has greater deformation and smaller force peak amplitude than the rigid material aerodynamic shape, which is a good factor to maintain flight stability. It is concluded that the flexible material with higher flexibility and shock-absorbing capability used as micro aircraft shape can play a buffer role especially in the aerodynamic disturbance.
