Unlike most of the previous works, the proposed framework results in a general bilateral filter that can have arbitrary spatial and arbitrary range filter kernels. This bilateral filter takes about 3.5 s to exactly filter a one megapixel 8-bit grayscale image on a 3.2 GHz Intel Core i7 CPU. In practice, the intensity/range and spatial domain can be downsampled to improve the efficiency. This compression can maintain very high accuracy (e.g., 40 dB) but over faster.", "paper_title": "Constant Time Median and Bilateral Filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000353159600003"}
