In this model, the improved mirror particle treatment for solid boundaries is developed, in which the mirror parameters and mirroring rules are redefined. The proposed mirror particle treatment is more accurate with less artificial oscillations of pressure. The improvement of pressure computations is verified by a benchmark test of dam break flow and the comparisons with the documented data showed satisfactory agreement. A series of numerical simulations have been conducted to further verify the applicability of the model for simulations of wave interaction with coastal structures of various shapes. These include linear wave reflection from an impermeable breakwater, solitary wave passing a rectangular obstacle and periodic wave train decompositions over a submerged shelf. In these simulations, the total particle number employed is up to 150,000 and rather good agreement has been obtained when the numerical results are compared to available analytical, experimental, and other numerical data found in literatures.
