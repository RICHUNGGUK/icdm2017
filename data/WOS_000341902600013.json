Traditional methods simply attempt to maximize user satisfaction by provisioning the composite service instance with the best QoS. These \"best-effort\" methods fail to take into account that there also exist other consumers competing for the service resources and their decisions of service selection/composition can impact on QoS. Since user's QoS needs can be met once the demanded level is reached, in this paper, we propose an \"on-demand\" strategy for QoS-aware service composition to replace the traditional \"best-effort\" strategy. The service broker is introduced to facilitate implementation of this strategy: it first purchases a number of service instances for each component from providers and then provisions the composite services with different QoS classes to consumers. This paper focuses on how the broker follows the service level agreement (SLA) to provision composite services in the \"on-demand\" manner. This problem is formally expressed as the minimization of the QoS distance function between SLA and QoS of composite service instances, under a series of constraints. Heuristic approaches are proposed for the problem and experiments are conducted at last to verify their effectiveness and efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
