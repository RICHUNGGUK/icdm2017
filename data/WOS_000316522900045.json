This work is a first step towards the ontology-based domain-independent generalization of a system that identifies Escherichia coli regulatory networks. First, a domain ontology based on the RegulonDB database was designed and populated. After that, the steps of the existing IE system were generalized to use the knowledge contained in the ontology, so that it could be potentially applied to other domains. The resulting system has been tested both with abstract and full articles that describe regulatory interactions for E. coli, obtaining satisfactory results. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
