We define and study the pointed equality algebras and its subclass of compatible pointed equality algebras. We introduce and investigate the internal states and the state-morphism operators on equality algebras and on their corresponding BCK-meet-semilattices. We prove that any internal state (state-morphism) on an equality algebra is also an internal state (state-morphism) on its corresponding BCK-meet-semilattice, and we prove the converse for the case of linearly ordered equality algebras. Another main result consists of proving that any state-morphism on a linearly ordered equality algebra is an internal state on it. We show that any internal state on a linearly ordered BCK-meet-semilattice satisfying the distributivity condition is also an internal state on its corresponding equality algebra and a state-morphism on a BCK-meet-semilattice satisfying the distributivity condition is also a state-morphism on its corresponding equality algebra.", "paper_title": "Internal states on equality algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000351408300015"}
