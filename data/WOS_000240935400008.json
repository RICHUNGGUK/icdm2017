This paper addresses a dynamic location problem as well as a static location problem. Mathematical models are proposed for obtaining the optimal solution. To overcome the excessive computational time of optimizing methods, a genetic algorithm is suggested. Also, simple heuristic rules are suggested to solve the dynamic location problem. Performance of various solution methods are compared with each other.", "paper_title": "A grouped storage method for minimizing relocations in block stacking systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240935400008"}
