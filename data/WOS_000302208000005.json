However, many industrial applications involve small vibrations superimposed on large static preloads. In this specific case, the dynamic problem can be treated as a small amplitude problem near a finite strain state. In this paper, we discuss how to extend previous approaches by taking arbitrary (large) dynamic rotations into account. A general approach is proposed as well as a finite element implementation. Results show that large rotations are required in some tests, even at small dynamic amplitudes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
