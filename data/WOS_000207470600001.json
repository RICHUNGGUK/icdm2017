This brief descriptor refers to a CAD/CAE/CAM/PIMS system, applied to design, engineer, and manufacture automobiles; and further to provide product information across and beyond the entire enterprise, extending into the supplier and customer base. The design foundation of the C3P system retains its utility today. The only system changes have arisen from technological upgrades which are independent of the original design strategy.", "paper_title": "Enterprise integration of product development data: systems science in action", "paper_id": "WOS:000207470600001"}
