It is important to develop a landslide warning system to recognize the sharpness of the landslide. However, there are several problems (e. g., the quality of the collected sensor data) to reduce the performance of the system (e. g., false alarms). Thereby, this study aims to design a landslide detection technique based on (i) motion detection and (ii) cross movement methods. They are applied in a detection phase, in order to identify the degree of landslide influence on road capacity by considering vehicles dimensions. Roadway landslide information dissemination (RLID) detects the landslide based on several image processing techniques, and determines the current condition by considering landslide level of road safety. As a result, landslide information can be disseminated to vehicles encountering the target area by using infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, in order to reduce crash likelihood and to increase traffic flow efficiency. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method in the detection phase can identify the degree of landslide influence on road capacity and monitor the level of effect on road safety.", "paper_title": "Public Alerts on Landslide Natural Disaster Using Vehicular Communications (Retracted article.
