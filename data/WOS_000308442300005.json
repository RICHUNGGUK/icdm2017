The local temporal common spatial patterns (LTCSP) method is a temporal generalization of CSP. Both CSP and LTCSP, however, are only suitable for the two-class paradigm. In this paper, we address this limitation under the framework of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We show that CSP is equivalent to maximizing the symmetric KL divergence of two class-conditional probability density functions under the Gaussian assumption. This analysis establishes a probabilistic interpretation for CSP, as well as LTCSP. Based on the KL formulation, we propose a new multi-class extension to optimizing the spatio-temporal filters by maximizing the harmonic mean of all pairs of symmetric KL divergences between the filtered class-conditional densities. Experiments of classification of multiple EEG classes on the data sets of BCI competition show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Harmonic Mean of Kullback-Leibler Divergences for Optimizing Multi-Class EEG Spatio-Temporal Filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000308442300005"}
