The aims of this paper are to evaluate the vulnerability of existing columns to credible impact events as well as to contribute new information towards the safe design of such vulnerable columns. The model incorporates concrete confinement, strain rate effects of steel and concrete, contact between the steel tube and concrete and dynamic relaxation for pre-loading, which is a relatively recent method for applying a pre-loading in the explicit solver. The finite element model was first verified by comparing results with existing experimental results and then employed to conduct a parametric sensitivity analysis. The effects of various structural and load parameters on the impact response of the CFST column were evaluated to identify the key controlling factors. Overall, the major parameters which influence the impact response of the column are the steel tube thickness to diameter ratio, the slenderness ratio and the impact velocity. The findings of this study will enhance the current state of knowledge in this area and can serve as a benchmark reference for future analysis and design of CFST columns under lateral impact.
