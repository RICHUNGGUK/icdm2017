In this paper. we propose a new load balance mechanism and a novel bandwidth estimation method for ad hoc on-demand routing protocols. Destination chooses the optimal path via the route information carried by RREQ, whilst congested intermediate nodes dropped RREQs to avoid RREQ storm. Simulation shows that our new scheme improves packet delivery ratio, reduces end-to-end latency and decreases routine overhead.", "paper_title": "A load balance based on-demand routing protocol for mobile ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500002"}
