They significantly outperform energy and cyclostationary detectors in practical scenarios. We also analyze the performance of the NPD and GLRD for unknown transmitted signal over Rayleigh channels, where they reduce to a linear weighted-correlator and a weighted-energy detector respectively.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Spectrum Sensing over Mixture-Nakagami Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696700004"}
