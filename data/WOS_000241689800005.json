The tracking problem is formulated as the minimization of a differentiable criterion whose differential structure is rich enough for optimization to be accomplished via hill-climbing. This avoids the computational expense of Monte Carlo methods, while yielding good results under challenging conditions. To demonstrate the generality of the approach we show that we can learn and track cyclic motions such as walking and running, as well as acyclic motions such as a golf swing. We also show results from both monocular and multi-camera tracking. Finally, we provide results with a motion model learned from multiple activities, and show how this models might be used for recognition. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
