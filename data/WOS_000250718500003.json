Therefore, there is a need for existing cluster resource management systems (RMS) to provide a means for the user to express its perceived utility during job submission. The cluster RMS can then obtain and consider these user-centric needs such as Quality-of-Service requirements in order to achieve utility-driven resource management and allocation. We advocate the use of computational economy-for this purpose. In this paper, we describe an architectural framework for a utility-driven cluster RMS. We present a user-level job submission specification for soliciting user-centric information that is used by the cluster RMS for making better resource allocation decisions. In addition, we propose a dynamic pricing function that the cluster owner can use to determine the level of sharing within a cluster. Finally, we define two user-centric performance evaluation metrics: Job QoS Satisfaction and Cluster Profitability for measuring the effectiveness of the proposed pricing function in realizing utility-driven resource management and allocation.", "paper_title": "Pricing for utility-driven resource management and allocation in clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000250718500003"}
