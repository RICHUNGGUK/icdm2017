At each iteration, mixed well-posed problems are solved for the same parabolic operator. The presence of corner points renders singularities of the solutions to these mixed problems, and this is handled with the use of weight functions together with, in the numerical implementation, mesh grading near the corners. The mixed problems are reformulated in terms of boundary integrals obtained via discretization of the time-derivative to obtain an elliptic system of partial differential equations. To numerically solve these integral equations a Nystrom method with super-algebraic convergence order is employed. Numerical results are presented showing the feasibility of the proposed approach.
