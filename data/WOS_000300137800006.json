However, the scheme is almost infeasible, because the scheme needs to implement a binding cache for all mobile hosts and correspondent nodes to solve the triangle routing problem. In this paper, we propose an IP header extension scheme for route optimization in Mobile IP to solve the triangle routing problem. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the standard Mobile IP scheme.", "paper_title": "An IP Header Extension Scheme for Route Optimization in Mobile IP Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000300137800006"}
