Compared with recent works, the underlying channel model is generalized from Rayleigh fading to a combination of Nakagami fading and Gamma shadowing. In addition, asymptotic analysis shows that the mean power of intercell interference changes from infinite to finite with a guard zone. Based on this interference distribution, the average capacity at the cell edge is further obtained. Special case approximation indicates that the capacity scales proportionally to the exponential of the guard zone size. Analytical capacities are validated by Monte Carlo simulations.", "paper_title": "Guard Zone Protected Capacity in Multi-Cell MISO Networks under Fading and Shadowing", "paper_id": "WOS:000332591300027"}
