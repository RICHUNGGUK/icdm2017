In previous papers, we showed that the satisfiability problem for any such logic is in PSPACE (provided the dependence alphabet is fixed, Gastin and Kuske (2003) [10]) and remains in PSPACE for all classical local temporal logics even if the dependence alphabet is part of the input, Gastin and Kuske (2007) [8]. In this paper, we consider the uniform satisfiability problem for arbitrary MSO-definable local temporal logics. For this problem, we prove multi-exponential lower and upper bounds that depend on the number of alternations of set quantifiers present in the chosen MSO-modalities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
