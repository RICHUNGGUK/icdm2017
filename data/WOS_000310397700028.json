Many computational models for different applications have been proposed, such as mesh saliency, mesh roughness and mesh skeleton. In this letter, we present a novel Skeleton Modulated Topological Visual Perception Map (SMTPM) integrated with visual attention and visual masking mechanism. A new skeletonisation map is presented and used to modulate the weight of saliency and roughness. Inspired by salient viewpoint selection, a new Loop subdivision stencil decision based rapid viewpoint selection algorithm using our new visual perception is also proposed. Experimental results show that the SMTPM scheme can capture more richer visual perception information and our rapid viewpoint selection achieves high efficiency.", "paper_title": "Skeleton Modulated Topological Perception Map for Rapid Viewpoint Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000310397700028"}
