In this paper, we discuss three soft risk maps and show their applications. A soft risk map of flood is applied to help choose zones for investment in projects whose profits depend on water resources, cost and flood risk. A soft risk map of drought can help an investor to choose an appropriate city to invest in a flower shop whose profits depend on drought risk and the number of customers. With a soft risk map of earthquake, a licensee designing a nuclear power station can reasonably adjust the earthquake-resistant parameters to avoid underestimating earthquake.
