A theoretical framework of the compression algorithm has been developed and implemented, based on the concept of a simple spring. The volume subjected to compression is divided into a number of \"model elements\", each one consisting of 27 nodes. The nodes are connected with springs. The mechanical properties of the tissues are assumed to be linear and isotropic. The compressed volume remains constant due to the introduced concept of spring variable equilibrium lengths. Initial settings for compression simulation are introduced in order that the algorithm converges faster. The developed compression algorithm was used to model breast compression during a standard mammography examination. Specifically, the method was applied to a high-resolution three-dimensional software breast phantom, composed to have a medium glandularity and calcification abnormalities. The compression was set to 50%. Results showed that the abnormalities maintain their shape and dimensions during the compression, while the surrounding breast tissues undergo considerable deformation and displacement. A \"decompression\" algorithm was also applied to test the reversibility of the model.", "paper_title": "A novel simulation algorithm for soft tissue compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000248408700005"}
