Namely, assuming that each vertex of the graph is associated with a stochastic weight, such that the joint distribution is known, the goal is to obtain a subgraph of minimum risk satisfying a given hereditary property. We employ a stochastic programming framework that is based on the formalism of modern theory of risk measures in order to find minimum-risk hereditary structures in graphs with stochastic vertex weights. The introduced form of risk function for measuring the risk of subgraphs ensures that optimal solutions of R-MWS problems represent maximal subgraphs. A graph-based branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm for solving the proposed problems is developed and illustrated on a special case of risk-averse maximum weighted clique problem. Numerical experiments on randomly generated Erdos-R,nyi graphs demonstrate the computational performance of the developed BnB.", "paper_title": "On risk-averse maximum weighted subgraph problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000337042900010"}
