We show how an active network environment was implemented and how this environment allows slow active code to control the code organisation of the fast path. The underlying code is structured much like components in a 'Click'-router that may be connected or disconnected at runtime. Not only are active packets permitted to reconfigure predefined native components in the networking code, by using the safe programming model of the open kernel environment they are also able to load and link their own native components at any place in the datapath and at any level in the processing hierarchy.
