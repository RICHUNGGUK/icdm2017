The goal is to achieve fast and smooth handoffs by reducing the latency added by the authentication process. This process is typically required when a mobile user moves from one authenticator to another regardless of whether the new authenticator is in the same domain (intra-domain) or different domain (inter-domain). To achieve an efficient solution to this problem, it has been generally recognized that a fast and secure key distribution process is required. We propose a new fast re-authentication architecture that employs a secure three-party key distribution protocol which reduces the number of message exchanges during the network access control process. Our approach is proved to preserve security and verified by means of a formal tool. The resulting performance benefits are shown through our extensive simulations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
