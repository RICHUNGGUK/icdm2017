In this paper, a real-time face recognition system via Local Binary Pattern (LBP) plus Improved Biomimetic Pattern Recognition (BPR) has been proposed. This system comprises three main steps: real-time color face detection process, feature extraction process and recognition process. Firstly, a color face detector is proposed to detect face with eye alignment and simultaneous performance; while in feature extraction step, LBP method is adopted to eliminate the negative effect of the light heterogeneity. Finally, an improved BPR method with Selective Sampling construction is applied to the recognition system. Experiments on our established database named WYU Database, PUT Database and AR Database show that this real-time. face recognition system can work with high efficiency and has achieved comparable performance with the state-of-the-art systems.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Face Detection and Recognition via Local Binary Pattern Plus Sample Selective Biomimetic Pattern Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000320214300019"}
