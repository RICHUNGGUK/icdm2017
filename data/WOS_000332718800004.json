Kriging-model-based RBDO is an effective method to overcome this difficulty. However, the accuracy of Kriging model depends directly on how to select the sample points. In this paper, the local adaptive sampling (LAS) is proposed to enhance the efficiency of constructing Kriging models for RBDO problems. In LAS, after initialization, new samples for probabilistic constraints are mainly selected within the local region around the current design point from each optimization iteration, and in the local sampling region, sample points are first considered to be located on the limit state constraint boundaries. The size of the LAS region is adaptively defined according to the nonlinearity of the performance functions. The computation capability of the proposed method is demonstrated using three mathematical RBDO problems and a honeycomb crash-worthiness design application. The comparison results show that the proposed method is very efficient.", "paper_title": "A local adaptive sampling method for reliability-based design optimization using Kriging model", "paper_id": "WOS:000332718800004"}
