Models of this type are likely to appear in man-made environments. While traditional simplification algorithms focus on generality and smooth meshes, the approach presented here considers a specific class of man-made models. By detecting and classifying edge loops on the mesh and providing a guided series of binary mesh partitions, our approach generates a series of simplified models, each of which better respects the semantics of these kinds of models than conventional approaches do. A guiding principle is to eliminate simplifications that do not make sense in constructed environments. This, coupled with the concept of \"punctuated simplification\", leads to an approach that is both efficient and delivers high visual quality. Comparative results are given.", "paper_title": "Punctuated simplification of man-made objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000235751200008"}
