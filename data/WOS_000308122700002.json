The performance measure considered is the total flowtime. A new hybrid metaheuristic Genetic Algorithm-Cluster Search is proposed to solve the scheduling problem. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and the results are compared with the best method reported in the literature. Experimental tests show superiority of the new method for the test problems set, regarding the solution quality. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
