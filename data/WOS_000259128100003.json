In a software product audit this architectural knowledge needs to be uncovered and its effects assessed in order to evaluate the quality of the software product. A particular problem is to find and comprehend the architectural knowledge that resides ill the software product documentation. In this article, we discuss how the use of a technique called Latent Semantic Analysis call guide auditors through the documentation to the architectural knowledge they need. We validate the use of Latent Semantic Analysis for discovering architectural knowledge by comparing the resulting vector-space model with the mental model of documentation that auditors possess.
