We present reasons why performing spatial mappings at run-time is both necessary and desirable. We propose what is-to our knowledge-the first attempt at a formal description of spatial mappings for the embedded real-time streaming application domain. Thereby, we introduce criteria for a qualitative comparison of these spatial mappings. As an illustration of how our formalization relates to practice, we relate our own spatial mapping algorithm to the formal model.", "paper_title": "Run-time Spatial Mapping of Streaming Applications to Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000273810700005"}
