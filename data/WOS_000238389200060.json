The flow of viscous incompressible fluid in a channel is simulated numerically by means of a parallel computational code based on a mixed spectral-finite difference algorithm for the numerical integration of the Navier-Stokes equations. The DNS approach (Direct Numerical Simulation of turbulence) is followed in the calculations, performed at friction Reynolds number Re-t = 180. A database representing the turbulent statistically steady state of the flow through 10 viscous time units is assembled and the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition technique (POD) is applied to the fluctuating portion of the velocity field. The dynamic properties of the most energetic POD modes are investigated showing a clear interaction between streamwise-independent modes and quasi-streamwise modes in the temporal development of the turbulent flow field.", "paper_title": "Dynamics of POD modes in wall bounded turbulent flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200060"}
