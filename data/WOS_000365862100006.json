We call any subset C subset of V an identifying code if the sets I(v) = {c is an element of C vertical bar {v, c} is an element of E or v = c} are distinct and non-empty for all vertices v is an element of V. A graph is called twin-free if there is an identifying code in the graph. The identifying code with minimum size in a twin-free graph G is called the optimal identifying code and the size of such a code is denoted by gamma(G). Let G(S) denote the induced subgraph of G where the vertex set S subset of V is deleted. We provide a tight upper bound for gamma(G(S)) - gamma(G) when both graphs are twin-free and vertical bar V vertical bar is large enough with respect to vertical bar S vertical bar. Moreover, we prove tight upper bound when G is a bipartite graph and vertical bar S vertical bar = 1.", "paper_title": "Maximum difference about the size of optimal identifying codes in graphs differing by one vertex", "paper_id": "WOS:000365862100006"}
