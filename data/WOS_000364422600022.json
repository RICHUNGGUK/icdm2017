In this paper, we propose a method for improving AGH, which considers data distribution in a similarity space and selects suitable anchors by performing principal component analysis (PCA) in the similarity space.", "paper_title": "Efficient Anchor Graph Hashing with Data-Dependent Anchor Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000364422600022"}
