Our approach differs from image-based methods in that it operates directly on the triangular mesh, and ensures that the mesh topology remains unchanged during geometric processing. By implicitly deforming the input mesh through gradient manipulation, our approach is applicable to both plane surface bas-relief generation and curved surface bas-relief generation. We propose a series of gradient-based algorithms, such as height field deformation, high slope optimization, fine detail preservation, curved surface flattening and relief mapping. Additionally, we present two types of shape editing tools that allow the user to interactively modify the bas-relief to exhibit a desired shape. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is effective in producing plausible and impressive bas-reliefs.", "paper_title": "Bas-Relief Generation and Shape Editing through Gradient-Based Mesh Deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000351755700003"}
