In this paper, we extend their method to the general case. In particular, we show that, for functions of constant \"width\", an -approximate saddle point can be computed using random samples from log-concave distributions over the convex sets and . It is assumed that and have inscribed balls of radius and circumscribing balls of radius . As a consequence, we obtain a simple randomized polynomial-time algorithm that computes such an approximation faster than known methods for problems with bounded width and when is a fixed, but arbitrarily small constant. Our main tool for achieving this result is the combination of the randomized fictitious play with the recently developed results on sampling from convex sets.", "paper_title": "On Randomized Fictitious Play for Approximating Saddle Points Over Convex Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000360668100009"}
