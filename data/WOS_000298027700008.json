In this context, the cross-layer optimization techniques involving joint use of routing and link scheduling are able to provide better capacity improvements. Most works in the literature propose linear programming models to combine both mechanisms. However, this approach has high computational complexity and cannot be extended to large-scale networks. Alternatively, algorithmic solutions are less complex and can obtain capacity values close to the optimal. Thus, we propose the REUSE algorithm, which combines routing and link scheduling and aims to increase throughput capacity in wireless mesh networks. Through simulations, the performance of the proposal is compared to a developed linear programming model, which provides optimal results, and to other proposed mechanisms in the literature that also deal with the problem algorithmically. We observed higher values of capacity in favor of our proposal when compared to the benchmark algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
