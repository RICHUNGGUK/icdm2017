Replica exchange Monte Carlo method is used to enhance the performance of the conformation space exploration, and thus detailed investigation of phase behavior of the system can be provided. With the designed potentials, the coil-globule transition and the liquid-solid-like transition are identified, and the transition temperatures are measured with the conformational and thermodynamic analyses. Additionally, by extrapolating the coil-globule transition temperature, T-theta, and the liquid-solid-like transition temperature T-L -> S to the thermodynamic limit, N ->infinity, we found no \"tri-critical\" point in the current model.", "paper_title": "Thermodynamic and conformational insights into the phase transition of a single flexible homopolymer chain using replica exchange Monte Carlo method", "paper_id": "WOS:000339884800039"}
