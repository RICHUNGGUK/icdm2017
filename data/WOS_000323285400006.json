In this paper, an analytical model for characterizing spontaneous imbibition height versus time in natural porous media was derived using fractal approach. The average imbibition height in porous media is in terms of porosity, fractal dimensions, maximum pore size and viscosity, surface tension and liquid-solid interactions. The developed model is consistent with previous results and is tested against available experimental data showing fair agreements.", "paper_title": "A FRACTAL APPROACH TO SPONTANEOUS IMBIBITION HEIGHT IN NATURAL POROUS MEDIA", "paper_id": "WOS:000323285400006"}
