The effective use of the low-level descriptors is therefore mandatory. Many data structures have been proposed for managing the representation of multidimensional descriptors, each geared toward efficiency in some set of basic operations. The paper introduces a highly parametrizable structure called the BitMatrix, along with its search algorithms. The BitMatrix is compared with existing methods, all implemented in a common framework. The tests have been performed on two datasets, with parameters covering significant ranges of values. The BitMatrix has proved to be a robust and flexible structure that can compete with other methods for multidimensional descriptor indexing.", "paper_title": "Multidimensional descriptor indexing: Exploring the BitMatrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566500041"}
