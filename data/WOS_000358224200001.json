Exploring the tensor characteristic of hyperspectral data, a DR algorithm based on class-aware tensor neighborhood graph and patch alignment is proposed here. First, hyperspectral data are represented in the tensor form through a window field to keep the spatial information of each pixel. Second, using a tensor distance criterion, a class-aware tensor neighborhood graph containing discriminating information is obtained. In the third step, employing the patch alignment framework extended to the tensor space, we can obtain global optimal spectral-spatial information. Finally, the solution of the tensor subspace is calculated using an iterative method and low-dimensional projection matrixes for hyperspectral data are obtained accordingly. The proposed method effectively explores the spectral and spatial information in hyperspectral data simultaneously. Experimental results on 3 real hyperspectral datasets show that, compared with some popular vector-and tensor-based DR algorithms, the proposed method can yield better performance with less tensor training samples required.", "paper_title": "Dimensionality Reduction for Hyperspectral Data Based on Class-Aware Tensor Neighborhood Graph and Patch Alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000358224200001"}
