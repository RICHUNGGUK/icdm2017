Those operations include fault diagnosis, fault location, fault isolation, restoration, and repair. As the first of a two-part survey, this paper reviews optimization models and solution methodologies for reliability planning problems with fault considerations related to electric distribution operations. Contingency planning problems of emergency distribution response are discussed in the second part. The present paper surveys research on determining a distribution substation single-fault capacity, reallocating excess load, configuring distribution systems, partitioning a geographical area into service territories, and locating material stores and depots.
