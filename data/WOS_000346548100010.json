To better adapt to this heterogeneity and coexistence situation, it is critical for nodes to identify the available networks with high accuracy and low cost. Unlike traditional demodulation-based identification method, which is expensive and complexing, in this paper, we propose a novel conception called demodulation-free protocol identification. This method only employs the features of physical layer samples. We first extract features that can be used to identify different protocols. Specifically, a sparse sequence based Precision-Stable Folding Algorithm (PSFA) is proposed to detect periodicity feature, which is common in wireless network protocols. Then we construct a prototype with USRP to identify three commonly used protocols in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. Experiment results show that under low or moderate channel utilization, the accuracy is above 90%. We also show that the computational complexity is polynomial. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
