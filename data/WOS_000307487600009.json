It has been demonstrated that genome-wide expression profiles can predict the cellular differentiation stage by means of dimensionality reduction methods. Here we show that these techniques can be further strengthened to support decision making with i) a novel strategy for gene selection; ii) methods for combining the evidence from multiple data sets. Methods: We propose to exploit dimensionality reduction methods for the selection of genes specifically activated in different stages of differentiation. To obtain an integrated predictive model, the expression values of the selected genes from multiple data sets are combined. We investigated distinct approaches that either aggregate data sets or use learning ensembles. Results: We analyzed the performance of the proposed methods on six publicly available data sets. The selection procedure identified a reduced subset of genes whose expression values gave rise to an accurate stage prediction. The assessment of predictive accuracy demonstrated a high quality of predictions for most of the data integration methods presented. Conclusion: The experimental results highlighted the main potentials of proposed approaches. These include the ability to predict the true staging by combining multiple training data sets when this could not be inferred from a single data source, and to focus the analysis on a reduced list of genes of similar predictive performance.", "paper_title": "Supporting Regenerative Medicine by Integrative Dimensionality Reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000307487600009"}
