Design/methodology/approach - The investigated samples are composed of 28 slinky stators, coming from the same production chain. The stochastic modelling approach is first described. Thereafter, the Monte-Carlo sampling method is used to calculate, in post-processing, the iron loss density in a PMSM that is modelled by the finite element method. Findings - The interest of such an approach is emphasized by calculating the main statistical characteristics associated to the losses variability, which are Gaussian distributed for A and SI formulations. Originality/value - The originality of the approach is due to the fact that the global influence of the manufacturing process (cutting, assembly, ... ) on magnetic properties of the considered samples is taken into account in the way of computing the iron losses.", "paper_title": "Stochastic post-processing calculation of iron losses - application to a PMSM", "paper_id": "WOS:000322608900020"}
