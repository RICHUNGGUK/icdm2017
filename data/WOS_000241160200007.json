On the other hand there has been too much focus on many technical aspects of public participation with reduced focus on the citizens. Equal opportunities to express their opinions and an open debate between people are the basic foundation for democracy. Therefore the design of participatory processes must take outset in the citizens and their knowledge and commitment concerning the issue to be debated. The current paper presents the results of a survey among actively involved citizens in Northern Jutland County. Our analysis shows a high degree of involvement among middle-age well-educated males with a higher education and income above average. It seems that contrary to the planner's vision of an open debate among all citizens, the result of a PPGIS service is a debate among a rather limited group.", "paper_title": "The citizens in e-Participation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241160200007"}
