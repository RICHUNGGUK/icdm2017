We complete this classification by adding two recent prediction algorithms. More importantly, we precisely quantify the hierarchy by giving closed or asymptotic formulas for the theoretical number of structures of given size n in all the classes but one. This allows us to assess the tradeoff between the expressiveness and the computational complexity of RNA structure prediction algorithms.", "paper_title": "Counting RNA Pseudoknotted Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000295079100006"}
