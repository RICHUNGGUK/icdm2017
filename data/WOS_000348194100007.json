In this case, a robust algorithm is proposed which uses vehicle headlights as their prominent features. The proposed algorithm consists of three main stages. In the first stage, bright objects are segmented by thresholding the grey-scale image. An effective algorithm is then applied to distinguish between vehicles lights and lights reflected on the road and on the vehicles bodies. In the second stage, the segmented bright objects are tracked using their spatial characteristics and their shapes and then, their speeds are estimated. To correct the camera perspective effect and reduce computational complexity, a projective transformation is used. In the third stage, the lights of each vehicle are grouped and paired using their positions and speeds. Motorbikes are also identified among the unpaired lights in this stage. Finally, the proposed real-time system is implemented in C and applied to videos captured by traffic surveillance cameras in some highways in Iran. Experimental results reveal that accuracy of the algorithm proposed for vehicle detection is more than 98%.", "paper_title": "Robust vehicle tracking algorithm for nighttime videos captured by fixed cameras in highly reflective environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000348194100007"}
