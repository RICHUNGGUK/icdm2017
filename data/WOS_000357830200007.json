However, existing cluster methods often suffer the following problems: (1) Need a huge space and a lot of computation when the input data are large. (2) Need to assign some parameters (e.g. number of clusters) in advance which will affect the clustering results greatly. To save the space and computation, reduce the sensitivity of the parameters, and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the clustering algorithms, we construct a new clustering algorithm for image segmentation. The new algorithm consists of two phases: coarsening clustering and exact clustering. First, we use Affinity Propagation (AP) algorithm for coarsening. Specifically, in order to save the space and computational cost, we only compute the similarity between each point and its t nearest neighbors, and get a condensed similarity matrix (with only t columns, where t << N and N is the number of data points). Second, to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the Self-tuning Spectral Clustering (SSC) is used to the resulted points (the representative points gotten in the first phase) to do the exact clustering. As a result, the proposed algorithm can quickly and precisely realize the clustering for texture image segmentation. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than the compared algorithms FCM, K-means and SOM.", "paper_title": "Texture Image Segmentation Using Affinity Propagation and Spectral Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000357830200007"}
