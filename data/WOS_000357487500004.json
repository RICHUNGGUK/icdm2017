We describe an approach which automatically combines existing algorithms to get a balance of speed and precision. For measuring precision, we introduce fast metrics which are based on perceptual criteria and are tolerant of sketching imperfections. We return a likelihood estimate based on these metrics rather than deterministic yes/no result, in order that the approach can be used in higher-level collaborative-decision recognition flows.", "paper_title": "A fast approach for perceptually-based fitting strokes into elliptical arcs", "paper_id": "WOS:000357487500004"}
