Specifically, we analyze the customer-related-IT investment's contribution to society through consumer satisfaction as well as the financial impact on stockholders through abnormal stock returns. The abnormal stock returns are analyzed using a combination of parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric event study analysis, and are tested for generalizability to the broader market through consistency of findings with the S&P 500 and S&P MidCap 400. This study uses the firms of the University of Michigan American Customer Satisfaction Index for the time period of January 1996 - December 2001, and does find that an investment in customer-related IT both improves customer satisfaction and yields positive abnormal shareholder returns.", "paper_title": "The impact of customer-related it investments on customer satisfaction and shareholder returns", "paper_id": "WOS:000244367800011"}
