Toxicity was predicted from hydrophobicity parameter (log Kow) and maximum superdelocalizability (Amax). Special attention was drawn to prediction ability and robustness of the models. investigated both in a leave-one-out and 10-fold cross validation (CV) processes. The influence that the corresponding changes in the learning sets during these CV processes could have on a common external test set including 41 compounds was also examined. This allowed us to establish the stability of the models. The non linear results slightly outperform (as expected) multilinear relationships (MLR) and also favourably compete with various other non linear approaches recently proposed by Ren (J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci., 43 1679 (2003)).", "paper_title": "Quantitative structure-toxicity relationships (QSTRs): A comparative study of various non linear methods.
