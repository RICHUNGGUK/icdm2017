This is evident, for example, with the Apple iPod, Microsoft Zune, Sony Walkman, and the Samsung and iriver media players. Because of this, how to best understand the users' intentions to adopt these fashionable technologies has become a new issue in the information technology domain. However, in the literature, little is published about what motivates people to adopt these innovative technologies. To address this issue, this research sought to come up with a model by integrating key variables from the role of ergonomic and social psychological facets on estimates of the fashion technology acceptance. A structural equation modeling approach was used to examine 10 hypotheses in the proposed model. The results indicated that usefulness, playfulness, and aesthetics from the ergonomic facet and critical mass from the social psychological perspective positively contributed to the users' intent to adopt the fashion technology. Furthermore, the perceived ease of use indirectly affects adoptive intentions through perceived usefulness and playfulness. Important implications of these findings are discussed from both theoretical and practical aspects.", "paper_title": "Impact of Ergonomic and Social Psychological Perspective: A Case Study of Fashion Technology Adoption in Taiwan", "paper_id": "WOS:000290686300001"}
