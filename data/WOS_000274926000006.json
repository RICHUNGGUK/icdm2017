With the advent of the Web and the rapid increases in the amount of data and the number of Web documents and users, researchers have focused on enhancing the interoperability of data through the development of metadata schemes. Other researchers have looked to the wealth of metadata generated by book-marking sites on the Social Web. While several existing ontologies have capitalized on the semantics of metadata created by tagging activities, the UpperTag Ontology (UTO) emphasizes the structure of tagging activities to facilitate modeling of tagging data and the integration of data from different bookmarking sites as well as the alignment of tagging ontologies. UTO is described and its utility in modeling, harvesting, integrating, searching, and analyzing data is demonstrated with metadata harvested from three major social tagging systems (Delicious, Flickr, and YouTube).", "paper_title": "Upper Tag Ontology for Integrating Social Tagging Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000274926000006"}
