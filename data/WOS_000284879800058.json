In this work, we preset Caliper, a highly precise traffic generation tool, built on NetThreads, a flexible platform that we have created for developing packet processing applications on FPGA-based devices and the NetFPGA in particular. We will demonstrate the effect of ad-hoc inter-departure times on a commodity NIC compared to precisely timed inter-departures with Caliper. Both NetThreads and Caliper are available as free software to download [1].", "paper_title": "Caliper: A Tool to Generate Precise and Closed-loop Traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000284879800058"}
