Novel rule extraction and pruning techniques are introduced to effectively handle the exceptional pronunciation of speech databases. The performances with the full rules and the reduced rules are 99.22% and 99.11% phoneme level accuracy, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art previous works, the experimental results show that our method is very promising. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
