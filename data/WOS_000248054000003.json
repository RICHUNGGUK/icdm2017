However, parallel loop scheduling has not been widely applied to computing grids, which are characterized by heterogeneous resources and dynamic environments. In this paper, a performance-based approach, taking the two characteristics above into consideration, is proposed to schedule parallel loop iterations on grid environments. Furthermore, we use a parameter, SWR, to estimate the proportion of the workload which can be scheduled statically, thus alleviating the effect of irregular workloads. Experimental results on a grid testbed show that the proposed approach can reduce the completion time for applications with regular or irregular workloads. Consequently, we claim that parallel loop scheduling can benefit applications on grid environments.", "paper_title": "A performance-based parallel loop scheduling on grid environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000248054000003"}
