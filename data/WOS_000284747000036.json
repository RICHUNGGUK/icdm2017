The machine is subject to an availability constraint. Jobs interrupted by machine unavailability can resume their processing. The objective is to minimize the makespan. We first show that the problem can be solved optimally by 0-1 integer programming. We then prove that the problem is NP-hard in the ordinary sense and there exists a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for it. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
