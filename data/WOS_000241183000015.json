We also give algorithms to compute these recurrences. We employed these algorithms to compute a(n, r) and expected value, EPn, of number of patterns of a sequence of length n, for relatively large n. We offer a randomness test based on the algorithms to be used for testing randomness of binary sequences. We give outputs of the algorithms for some n. We also provide results of the proposed test applied to the outputs of contestant stream ciphers of ECRYPT's eSTREAM.", "paper_title": "On Lempel-Ziv complexity of sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000241183000015"}
