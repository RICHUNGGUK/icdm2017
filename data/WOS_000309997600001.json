Currently, these impairments are assessed by clinical tests or via kinematic analysis using expensive commercial visual tracking systems. This paper proposes an hybrid alternative to these costly systems. The tool proposed is based on the one hand on a low-cost camera network i.e. a visual modality, and on the other hand, an accelerometer network i.e. a kinematic modality. The off-line reconstruction quality made with such a system is evaluated by comparison with the Codamotion system reconstruction. Moreover, several kinematic parameters are computed for a set of hemiparetic and healthy subjects executing reach and grasp movements. These features were computed from both systems and compared with mean of correlation factor and random effects models. The low-cost hybrid system demonstrated comparable results with those obtained from the gold standard Codamotion system for all the kinematic features analyzed.", "paper_title": "Multi-modal movement reconstruction for stroke rehabilitation and performance assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000309997600001"}
