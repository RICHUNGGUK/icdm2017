However, their schemes were not focused on DNA modification rate or the expansion problem. Therefore, we propose a novel reversible data hiding scheme based on histogram technique to solve the weaknesses of Shiu et al.'s schemes. The proposed scheme transforms the DNA sequence into a binary string and then combines several bits into a decimal integer. These decimal integers are used to generate a histogram. Afterwards, the proposed scheme uses a histogram technique to embed secret data. The experimental results show that the modification rate of our proposed scheme is 69 % lower than that of Shiu et al.'s schemes for the same embedding capacity. In addition, the length of the DNA sequence remains unchanged in the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "A DNA-based data hiding technique with low modification rates", "paper_id": "WOS:000337156500004"}
