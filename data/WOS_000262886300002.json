In their scheme. a subset of original signers authenticates a designated proxy group to sign on behalf of the original group. A message in has to be signed by a subset of proxy signers who can represent the proxy group. Then, the proxy signature is sent to the verifier group. A subset of verifiers in the verifier group can also represent the group to authenticate the proxy signature. Subsequently, there are two improved schemes to eliminate the security leak of Tzeng et al.'s scheme. In this paper, we have pointed out the security leakage of the three schemes and further proposed a novel threshold multi-proxy multi-signature scheme with threshold verification.
