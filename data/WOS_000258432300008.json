The presentation of the vulnerability information in the form of fragility curves is a widely practiced approach when several uncertain sources are involved. The ASCE benchmark problem of a cable-stayed bridge is considered as a case study. A passive control technique is adopted and results are compared in term of fragility curves, In order to consider the uncertainties related to the ground motion 24 ground motion time history Lire considered, corresponding to four different hazard levels, while the uncertain ties in the structural characteristics are introduced by defining the different performance thresholds as random variables. The fragility evaluation shows how important a estimation of the limit state is for the comparison of different retrofit techniques. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
