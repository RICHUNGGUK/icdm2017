In this paper, the concept of driving dangerous area in curved section was proposed based on the vehicle track characteristics according to driving behavior decision making and accident probability. Taking the observation data of passenger cars as the representative, the vehicle track paths deviation regularity per measurement direction were analyzed by SPSS under the condition of different radius and different road cross section. The distribution probability of different track type and the accident probability calculation methods and results between opposite direction vehicles were given based on the track characteristics.", "paper_title": "Study on Driving Dangerous Area in Road Curved Section Based on Vehicle Track Characteristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000303572000015"}
