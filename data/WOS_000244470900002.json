Design/methodology/approach - The methodology adopted in this paper is based on a combined contingency analysis/reliability evaluation scheme. A three-component system model is utilized, which can be used effectively for evaluation and sensitivity analysis of reliability and quality in power systems. The model is a reduced (equivalent) system representation that comprises generation, transmission and load components with multi-state values. The computational scheme presented in the paper integrates both the contingency effect and its probability of occurrence into one routine of analysis while reducing the power system around the region of interest. Findings - The computational scheme presented in the paper can effectively assess both service reliability and system quality. The practical applications presented demonstrated that lower service reliability levels would jeopardize energy supply continuity and increase the likelihood of additional maintenance and restoration costs due to the resulting higher rate of system outages. Poor system quality levels, on the other hand, imply either deficiency or excess in the overall system capabilities as designed by its planners. Originality/value - The work of this paper contributes to the solution of the reliability and quality assessment problem in practical power systems. As part of the present work, an advanced computerized scheme for fast composite system reliability and quality assessment was developed and then applied to an equivalent system model of the Saudi electricity system. The results obtained are claimed to have far-reaching implications on various planning and operation aspects of the power system.", "paper_title": "Composite reliability and quality assessment of interconnected power systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000244470900002"}
