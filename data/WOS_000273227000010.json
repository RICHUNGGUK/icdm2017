In this paper, we first examine the fundamental components of management operations and argue that the lack of automation is due to a lack of programmability at the right level of abstraction. To address this challenge, we present DECOR, a database-oriented, declarative framework towards automated network management. DECOR models router configuration and any generic network status as relational data in a conceptually centralized database. As such, network management operations can be represented as a series of transactional database queries, which provide the benefit of atomicity, consistency and isolation. The rule-based language in DECOR provides the flexible programmability to specify and enforce network-wide management constraints, and achieve high-level task scheduling. We describe the design rationale and architecture of DECOR and present some preliminary examples applying our approach to common network management tasks.", "paper_title": "DECOR: DEClarative network management and OpeRation", "paper_id": "WOS:000273227000010"}
