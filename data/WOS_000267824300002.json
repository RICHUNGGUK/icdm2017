This question of Urrutia is closely related to the notion of regression depth introduced by Rousseeuw and Hubert ( 1996). We show the following: Given any collection C of n pairwise disjoint compact convex sets in d-dimensional Euclidean space, there exists a point p such that any ray emanating from p meets at most dn+1/d+1 members of C. There exist collections of n pairwise disjoint (i) equal-length segments or (ii) disks in the Euclidean plane such that from any point there is a ray that meets at least 2n/3-2 of them. We also determine the asymptotic behavior of tau(n) when the convex bodies are fat and of roughly equal size.", "paper_title": "Intersecting Convex Sets by Rays", "paper_id": "WOS:000267824300002"}
