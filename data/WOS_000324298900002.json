One effective way to overcome the above problem is rate adaptation, which adaptively selects an appropriate transmission rate according to current channel conditions. A number of rate adaptation algorithms have been proposed in the literatures. However, few of them have been thoroughly evaluated by simulations. It is necessary to conduct a comparative study of these rate adaptation mechanisms, to have a comprehensive view about their impacts on the performance of applications in different channel conditions. In this paper, we perform an extensive comparative simulation study on several well-known rate adaptation algorithms based on ns-3. We quantify their performance for aggregate network throughput in the following two environments: collision-concerned and mobility-concerned. This work is an important step to understand the behaviour of different rate adaptation algorithms.", "paper_title": "A comparative simulation study of rate adaptation algorithms in wireless LANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000324298900002"}
