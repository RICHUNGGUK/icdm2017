Given a low-resolution depth map as input, we recover a high-resolution depth map using the registered high-resolution color stereo image pair. First, based on the mutual benefits between raw depth map and features of high resolution color image, we model the relationship with two constraint terms of local and non-local priors and sufficiently explore their complementary nature. Moreover, by considering reliable disparity pixels calculated from stereo matching algorithm, we formulate a stereo disparity regularization term to further reinforce the preservation of fine depth detail. Hence, our SVA objective function includes a non-local prior constraint, a local prior constraint and a stereo disparity prior constraint. In addition, we employ an efficient algorithm to optimize the objective function. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can obtain superior performance in comparison with other methods.
