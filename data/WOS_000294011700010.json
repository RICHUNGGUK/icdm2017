It is obtained by generalized bistellar moves from a simplicial subdivision of the standard cell structure of S-2 x S-2. Both constructions have surprising and intimate relationships with the icosahedron. It is well known that CP2 has S-2 x S-2 as a two-fold branched cover; we construct the triangulation CP102 of CP2 by presenting a simplicial realization of this covering map S-2 x S-2 -> CP2. The domain of this simplicial map is a simplicial subdivision of the standard cell structure of S-2 x S-2, different from the triangulation alluded to in (b). This gives a new proof that Kuhnel's CP92 triangulates CP2. It is also shown that CP102 and (S-2 x S-2)(12) induce the standard piecewise linear structure on CP2 and S-2 x S-2 respectively.", "paper_title": "From the Icosahedron to Natural Triangulations of CP2 and S-2 x S-2", "paper_id": "WOS:000294011700010"}
