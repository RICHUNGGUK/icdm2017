This problem is NP-hard in general, and, therefore, it is natural to study how restricting the allowed types of constraints affects the approximability of the problem. In this article, we show that any MAX CSP problem with a finite set of allowed constraint types, which includes all fixed-value constraints (i. e., constraints of the form x = a), is either solvable exactly in polynomial time or else is APX-complete, even if the number of occurrences of variables in instances is bounded. Moreover, we present a simple description of all polynomial-time solvable cases of our problem. This description relies on the well-known algebraic combinatorial property of supermodularity.", "paper_title": "The approximability of MAX CSP with fixed-value constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000259434200001"}
