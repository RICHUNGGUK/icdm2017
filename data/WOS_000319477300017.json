Human intervention is necessary for most gridding methods, even if some so-called fully automatic approaches also need preset parameters. The applicability of these methods is limited in certain domains and will cause variations in the gene expression results. In addition, improper gridding, which is influenced by both the misalignment and high noise level, will affect the high throughput analysis. In this paper, we have presented a fully automatic gridding technique to break through the limitation of traditional mathematical morphology gridding methods. First, a preprocessing algorithm was applied for noise reduction. Subsequently, the optimal threshold was gained by using the improved Otsu method to actually locate each spot. In order to diminish the error, the original gridding result was optimized according to the heuristic techniques by estimating the distribution of the spots. Intensive experiments on six different data sets indicate that our method is superior to the traditional morphology one and is robust in the presence of noise. More importantly, the algorithm involved in our method is simple. Furthermore, human intervention and parameters presetting are unnecessary when the algorithm is applied in different types of microarray images.", "paper_title": "Using the Maximum Between-Class Variance for Automatic Gridding of cDNA Microarray Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000319477300017"}
