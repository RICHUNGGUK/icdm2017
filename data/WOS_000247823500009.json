Exact solutions are first presented for linear cases for both the during- and post-movement control problem, depending on a parameter alpha > 0. It is found that for the Langevin type equation and for the post-movement control case, a non-degenerate solution exists only when alpha > 1/2. For the Langevin type equation and for the during-movement control, a non-degenerate solution is found when alpha > 1. For the post-movement control and the Hamiltonian type equation, an optimal control signal is obtained and is non-degenerate when alpha > 1/2. Again for the during-movement control, we find an optimal non-degenerate control signal when alpha > 1. All results are then generalized to nonlinear control cases (the first order perturbation of linear cases). Numerical examples are included to illustrate the applications of our results.
