A two-stage cross-level PRC (CL-PRC) scheme is proposed. The conventional PRC schemes suppress all the chip-wise interference. However, the proposed scheme suppresses only the specific frame-wise inter-symbol interference (ISI) by exploiting the characteristic that the information bits are transmitted only at ultra short time slots. This results in a low complexity pre-equalizer without bit error rate (BER) performance degradation. Furthermore, an order selection rule is presented to achieve the tradeoff between signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and computational complexity. Simulation results illustrate the superior SIR and BER performance of our proposal.
