The HPM is an approximate method which yields an analytical solution in the form of a convergent power series with components, which can be easily computed. We show that the HPM can generate highly accurate solutions for the FKPP equation.", "paper_title": "The Solution of Fisher-Kolomogrov-Petrovskii-Piskunov equation by the Homotopy Perturbation Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000315700100010"}
