In this paper, we propose a new short-text oriented analysis approach to cluster short text automatically and extract the hot topics from each cluster. Differerent from the previous studies focused on long text, our analysis approach mainly focused on short-text cases. The approach consists of three stages: Firstly, generate feature vector for each sample so as to obtain the whole high-dimensional Vector Space Model; Secondly, use Singular Value Decomposition to achieve the dimensions reduction; Lastly, apply cosine similarity and k-means method to cluster samples on the low-dimensional matrix and extract the hot topics for each cluster. The experimental results show that our analysis approach can deal with the short-text samples and find out the hot topics effciently and effectively.", "paper_title": "A Short-Text Oriented Clustering Method for Hot Topics Extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000359322900003"}
