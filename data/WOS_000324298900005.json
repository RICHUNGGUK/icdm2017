This paper proposed an adaptive localisation algorithm of mobile node in wireless sensor network for solving this problem. The structure decomposition, electronic control and kinematics model of the proposed mobile node have been investigated, respectively. Improvements have been demonstrated through eliminates the positioning error caused by situations such as node self-energy, data packet loss, low measured value and singular values. A testbed has finally been created for validating the adaptive localisation capability of mobile nodes in wireless sensor network. Experimental results show that the proposed adaptive localisation algorithm can be applied in real use, and precision and stability are upper, and promote the speed and practicability of mobile node in wireless sensor networks using in undesirable environments.", "paper_title": "An adaptive localisation algorithm of mobile node in wireless sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000324298900005"}
