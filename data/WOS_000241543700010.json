The organ models have a parameterized representation that supports real-time interactive deformation. To accomplish real-time interaction with deformable organs, instead of computing the deformation on the 3D organ models in 3D space we use a novel yet simple and fast free-form deformation on the 2D parameterized representation itself. With the parameterized mesh, we also demonstrate that realistic visual and haptic rendering can be provided for interactive surgery simulation.", "paper_title": "Cyber surgery: Parameterized mesh for multi-modal surgery simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241543700010"}
