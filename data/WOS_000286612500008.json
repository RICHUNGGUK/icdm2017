Too strong tendency for synchronization would in terms of brain dynamics be expected to be a pathological case. We relate how the time to synchrony depends on coupling strength and connection dynamics to the latency between neuronal stimulation and conscious awareness. We suggest that this latency can be identified with the delay before a threshold level of synchrony is achieved between distinct regions within the brain, as suggested by recent empirical evidence, in which case the latency can easily be understood as the inevitable delay before such synchrony build-ups. This is demonstrated here through the study of simplistic coupled-map models.", "paper_title": "DELAY BEFORE SYNCHRONIZATION AND ITS ROLE IN LATENCY OF SENSORY AWARENESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612500008"}
