The impedance response on the desired frequency band can approximate that of the antenna at the feed point. Owing to the problems of information deficiency in the objective function, optimized results via conventional PSOs generally have failed to satisfy the expected requirements. An improved PSO incorporating a Decomposed Objective Function (PSO-DOF) is therefore proposed to overcome this problem. The objective function is first decomposed into a number of portions by using a set of weighting functions, and then each decomposed portion is used to evolve a corresponding group of factors in a particle. Because of the results optimized via the proposed PSO-DOF, the relationship between the antenna geometrical dimensions and circuit components can be established as a guideline for adjusting the antenna configuration to meet the desired specifications. Simulation results have demonstrated that the PSO-DOF is superior to the other PSO schemes in characterizing an equivalent circuit of a CPW-fed monopole antenna at the feed point, and successfully addressing the issue of information deficiency in the objective function.", "paper_title": "CPW-fed monopole antenna characterized by using particle swarm optimization incorporating decomposed objective functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000258427400007"}
