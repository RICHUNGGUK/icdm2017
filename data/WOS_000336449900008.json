Direct and inverse kinematics analysis has been carried out for each leg in order to develop an overall kinematics model of the six-legged robot. It aims to estimate energy-optimal feet forces and joint torques of the six-legged robot, which are necessary to have for its real-time control. To determine the optimum feet forces, two approaches are developed, such as minimization of norm of feet forces and minimization of norm of joint torques using a least square method, and their performances are compared. The developed kinematics and dynamics models are tested through computer simulations for generating turning motion of a statically stable six-legged robot over flat terrain with four different duty factors. The maximum values of feet forces and joint torques decrease with the increase of duty factor. A power consumption model has been derived for the statically stable wave gaits to minimize the power requirement for both optimal foot force distributions and optimal foot-hold selection. The variations of average power consumption with the height of the trunk body and radial offset have been analyzed in order to find out energy-optimal foothold. A parametric study on energy consumption has been carried out by varying angular velocity of the robot to minimize the total energy consumption during locomotion. It has been found that the energy consumption decreases with the increase of angular velocity for a particular traveled distance.", "paper_title": "Kinematics, Dynamics and Power Consumption Analyses for Turning Motion of a Six-Legged Robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000336449900008"}
