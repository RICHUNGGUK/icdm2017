The model employs linear diffusion fields of activators and inhibitors and a discrete transition rule after diffusion. Theoretical analysis of the one dimensional model proved that i) spatial distribution given by a periodic square function is stable at the equilibrium and ii) the spatial frequency is inversely proportional to the square root of a diffusion coefficient of the inhibitors. We also designed LSI circuits that implement the RD model on a silicon chip that has a compact construction and low-power consumption. Circuit simulations revealed that the proposed LSIs could restore stripe and spot images in a short time regardless of the number of pixels in the image.", "paper_title": "Striped and spotted pattern generation on reaction-diffusion cellular automata - Theory and LSI implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000258902500002"}
