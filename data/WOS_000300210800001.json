The method uses two thresholds, the relation threshold and attribute threshold, to guide the generalization process, and output generalized knowledge, a set of generalized tuples which describes the major characteristics of the target relation. Although AOI has been widely used in various applications, a potential weakness of this method is that it only provides a snapshot of the generalized knowledge, not a global picture. When thresholds are different, we would obtain different sets of generalized tuples, which also describe the major characteristics of the target relation. If a user wants to ascertain a global picture of induction, he or she must try different thresholds repeatedly. That is time-consuming and tedious. In this study, we propose a global AOI (GAOI) method, which employs the multiple-level mining technique with multiple minimum supports to generate all interesting generalized knowledge at one time. Experiment results on real-life dataset show that the proposed method is effective in finding global generalized knowledge. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
