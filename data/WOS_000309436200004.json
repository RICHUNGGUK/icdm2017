Objective: Our goal is to analyze the current state of the art in traceability management in the context of Model-Driven Engineering. Method: We use the systematic literature review based on the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham. We propose five research questions and six quality assessments. Results: Of the 157 relevant studies identified, 29 have been considered primary studies. These studies have resulted in 17 proposals. Conclusion: The evaluation shows that the most addressed operations are storage, CRUD and visualization, while the most immature operations are exchange and analysis traceability information.
