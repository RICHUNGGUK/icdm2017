However, the literature examines direct impact to project success measures without considering the process as a mediator nor possible beneficial effects on criteria other than traditional measures of project budget and schedule. We extend the study of conflict by considering the quality of the software product in addition to the project measures and include the process as a specific mediator. Results from a survey of system developers finds that conflict does indeed impact both measures negatively and is not fully mediated by effective processes. Researchers and practitioners should turn their attentions earlier in a development project to prevent the detrimental effects of conflict.", "paper_title": "THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CONFLICT ON THE INFORMATION SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, PRODUCT, AND PROJECT", "paper_id": "WOS:000268352800010"}
