Assignment of an action to a category is based on the comparison between action and category's least typical representative, which is considered as the category inclusion threshold. Evaluation is executed considering performance on evaluation criteria and calculation of a fuzzy inclusion relation for every action, generalizing preference relations model with concordance and nondiscordance concepts as used in ELECTRE methods. An application to a classification problem in banking is also presented in order to demonstrate its applicability to similar problems.", "paper_title": "FUZZY MULTICRITERIA ASSIGNMENT FOR NOMINAL CLASSIFICATION.
