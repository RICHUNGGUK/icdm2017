An integrated understanding of these evolving interaction spaces together with how they interconnect and leverage learning are needed to develop meaningful strategies for effective teaching and learning. The 18i collaborative interaction spaces model was designed based on constructivist principles, and describes 18 mixed instructor-learner spaces contextualized at a finer operational scale that makes explicit a wider range of interactions. The model was implemented during the life cycle of an undergraduate GIS-based multimedia cartography course. One output was the generation of a repository of rule-based trajectory plans for rapid planning and problem solving. The model provides an integrated workflow to manage course contents, products, interactions, individuality, and learning styles in blended environments. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
