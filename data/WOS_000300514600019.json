Recently, however, the fuzzy vault scheme has been shown to be susceptible to a correlation attack. This paper proposes a novel scheme for one-time templates for fingerprint authentication based on the fuzzy vault scheme. As in one-time passwords, the suggested method changes templates after each completion of authentication, and thus the compromised templates cannot be reused. Furthermore, a huge number of chaff minutiae can be added by expanding the size of the fingerprint image. Therefore, the proposed method can protect a user's fingerprint minutiae against the correlation attack. In our experiments, the proposed approach can improve the security level of a typical approach against brute-force attack by the factor of 10(34).", "paper_title": "Fingerprint Template Protection Using One-Time Fuzzy Vault", "paper_id": "WOS:000300514600019"}
