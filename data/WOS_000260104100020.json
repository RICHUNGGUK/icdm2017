In this paper, we introduce a new two stage approach to construct the hierarchical rule classifier for multiclass problems. In the first stage, we use an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm to obtain a hierarchical structure of groups of decision classes. Then, in the second stage we apply a rule induction algorithm at each branching node in this hierarchy - these miles assign a classified object to groups of classes. Finally, in a comparative experiments we show that the proposed approach can produce a classifier which is characterized by a good compromise between the classification accuracy and the readability of the knowledge representation.", "paper_title": "RULE INDUCTION VIA CLUSTERING DECISION CLASSES", "paper_id": "WOS:000260104100020"}
