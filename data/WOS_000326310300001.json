After explaining the creation and notation of the corpus, we present results of some explorations of the corpus data. We begin by considering the overall distribution of scale-degrees in rock. We then address the issue of key-finding: how the key of a rock song can be identified from harmonic and melodic information. Considering both the distribution of melodic scale-degrees and the distribution of chords (roots), as well as the metrical placement of chords, leads to good key-finding performance. Finally, we discuss how songs within the corpus might be categorized with regard to their pitch organization. Statistical categorization methods point to a clustering of songs that resembles the major/minor distinction in common-practice music, though with some important differences.", "paper_title": "Statistical Analysis of Harmony and Melody in Rock Music", "paper_id": "WOS:000326310300001"}
