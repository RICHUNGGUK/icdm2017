Finite element analysis is the most extensively used numerical analysis in mechanical engineering practice and is incorporated into many computer-aided design systems. The existing commercial software is very helpful when supporting realisation of the analysis process but still fails to provide adequate support during the post-processing phase. The results of analysis should be studied and decisions made regarding the design's suitability with respect to its engineering specifications. In general, design changes are indispensable and designers need help to design them properly. The prototype of an intelligent rule-based consultative system is being developed by the authors to provide such advice when considering a description of the design structure's critical area. This system is encoded in Prolog. It can deal with the results of prior strain-stress or thermal analysis. It presents a short list of proposed design changes that should be taken into account when improving the design. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
