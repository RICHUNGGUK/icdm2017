Nevertheless, any system intended for real-world deployment must be able to accommodate unexpected change-that is, it must be perturbation tolerant. We have found that metacognitive monitoring and control-the ability of a system to self-monitor its own decision-making processes and ongoing performance, and to make targeted changes to its beliefs and action-determining components-can play an important role in helping intelligent systems cope with the perturbations that are the inevitable result of real-world deployment. In this article we present the results of several experiments demonstrating the efficacy of metacognition in improving the perturbation tolerance of reinforcement learners, and discuss a general theory of metacognitive monitoring and control, in a form we call the metacognitive loop.", "paper_title": "The metacognitive loop I: Enhancing reinforcement learning with metacognitive monitoring and control for improved perturbation tolerance", "paper_id": "WOS:000241787200005"}
