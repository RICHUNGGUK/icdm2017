Currently, there are many XML-based workflow process specification languages (e.g. XPDL, BPEL) which can be used to define business processes in the Web services and Grid Computing world. However. with limited capability to describe the relationships (schemas or ontologies) between process objects, the dominant use of XML as a meta-data markup language makes the semantics of the processes ambiguous. OWL-S (Ontology Web Language for Services) exploits the semantic description power of OWL to build an ontology language for services. It therefore becomes a candidate for an inter lingua. In this paper, we propose an integration framework for business processes, which is applied to Web services defined in OWL-S. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
