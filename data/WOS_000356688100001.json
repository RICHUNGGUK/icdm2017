Using the proposed algorithm, each regular or position-unaware node estimates its distances only to reliable anchors or position-aware nodes. The latter are properly chosen following a new reliable anchor selection strategy that ensures an accurate distance estimation making thereby our localization algorithm more precise. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is implementable in both 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) scenarios. A power saving mechanism aiming to enhance the WSN lifetime is also envisaged in this paper. It is proven that the proposed algorithm could easily incorporate such a mechanism. Simulations show that our algorithm, whether combined or not with the power saving mechanism, consistently outperforms the best representative localization algorithms currently available in the literature in terms of accuracy, even with the presence of nonuniform node distribution or radiation irregularities.", "paper_title": "Accurate Nodes Localization in Anisotropic Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356688100001"}
