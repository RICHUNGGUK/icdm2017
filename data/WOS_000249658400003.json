In this paper, we revisit the complexity of the evaluation problem of not necessarily Boolean first-order (FO) queries over d-degree-bounded structures. Query evaluation is considered here as a dynamical process. We prove that any FO query on d-degree-bounded structures belongs to the complexity class CONSTANT-DELAY(lin), that is, can be computed by an algorithm that has two separate parts: it has a precomputation step of time linear in the size of the structure and then, it outputs all solutions (i.e., tuples that satisfy the formula) one by one with a constant delay (i.e., depending on the size of the formula only) between each. Seen as a global process, this implies that queries on d-degree-bounded structures can be evaluated in total time f (vertical bar phi vertical bar).(vertical bar S vertical bar + vertical bar phi(S)vertical bar) and space g(vertical bar phi vertical bar).vertical bar S vertical bar where S is the structure, phi is the formula, phi(S) is the result of the query and f, g are some fixed functions. Among other things, our results generalize a result of Seese on the data complexity of the model-checking problem for d-degree-bounded structures. Besides, the originality of our approach compared to related results is that it does not rely on the Hanf's model-theoretictechnique and is simple and informative since it essentially rests on a quantifier elimination method.", "paper_title": "First-order queries on structures of bounded degree are computable with constant delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000249658400003"}
