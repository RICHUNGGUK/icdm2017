In this paper, a novel hi-partition group based on prioritized traffics dynamic bandwidth allocation (BDBA) scheme is proposed to deliver the differentiated services over GPON. The proposed BDBA scheme divides the transmission cycle time into two groups with prioritized traffics and adjusts the bandwidth dynamically between the first group for high priorities T-CONT 1, and T-CONT 2 and the second group for low priorities T-CONT 3, and T-CONT 4. Moreover, the T-CONT 2 traffic has prediction mechanism and recycles the remaining unused bandwidth for the low priority T-CONTs. Simulation result shows that the proposed BDBA scheme can improve the system performance in terms of the throughput, blocking probability, end-to-end packet delay, jitter and fairness for 16 ONUs and 32 ONUs, and also can enhance Quality of Service (QoS) services without sacrificing the low priority traffic except before the system is half-loaded.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive DBA Scheme Using Bi-Partition Scheduling Based on Prioritized Traffics to Support Multiple Services over GPON", "paper_id": "WOS:000330497800006"}
