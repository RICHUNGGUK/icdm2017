This new phenomenon is commonly referred to as social commerce, however it has not yet been fully understood. In addition to the lack of a stable and agreed-upon definition, there is little research on social commerce and no significant research dedicated to the design of social commerce platforms. This study offers literature review to explain the concept of social commerce, tracks its nascent state-of-the-art, and discusses relevant design features as they relate to e-commerce and Web 2.0. We propose a new model and a set of principles for guiding social commerce design. We also apply the model and guidelines to two leading social commerce platforms, Amazon and Starbucks on Facebook. The findings indicate that, for any social commerce website, it is critical to achieve a minimum set of social commerce design features. These design features must cover all the layers of the proposed model, including the individual, conversation, community and commerce levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
