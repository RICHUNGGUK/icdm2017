As a highly dynamic social group, human crowd in confrontation is a fascinating phenomenon. This paper presents a novel method based on the concept of vector field to formulate the way in which external stimuli may affect the behaviours of individuals in a crowd. Furthermore, Modelling & Simulation (M&S) of large crowds at individual level has long been placed in the highly computation intensive world. This study adopts GPGPU to sustain massively parallel M&S of a confrontation operation involving a large crowd. This approach enables investigation of a crowd consisting of tens of thousands individuals whose size was prohibitively large for conventional M&S technique to support. Experimental results indicate that the approach is efficient in terms of both performance and energy consumption.", "paper_title": "Massively parallel Modelling & Simulation of large crowd with GPGPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000315162400004"}
