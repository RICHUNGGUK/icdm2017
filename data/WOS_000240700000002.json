The partition can be expressed as an n-dimensional vector, whereas the signed fuzzy measure is also an n-dimensional vector. Thus, the integration value is the inner product of these two vectors. Two pairs of extremes, the Lebesgue-like integral versus the Choquet integral and the upper integral versus the lower integral, are discussed in detail.
