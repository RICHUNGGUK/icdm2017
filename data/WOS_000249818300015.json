State-of-the-art supervised data mining methods often cover well only one of these aspects, motivating the development of methods where predictive models with a solid classification performance would be easily communicated to the domain expert. Results: Data visualization may provide for an excellent approach to knowledge discovery and analysis of class-labeled data. We have previously developed an approach called VizRank that can score and rank point-based visualizations according to degree of separation of data instances of different class. We here extend VizRank with techniques to uncover outliers, score features ( genes) and perform classification, as well as to demonstrate that the proposed approach is well suited for cancer microarray analysis. Using VizRank and radviz visualization on a set of previously published cancer microarray data sets, we were able to find simple, interpretable data projections that include only a small subset of genes yet do clearly differentiate among different cancer types. We also report that our approach to classification through visualization achieves performance that is comparable to state-of-the-art supervised data mining techniques. Availability: VizRank and radviz are implemented as part of the Orange data mining suite (http://www.ailab.si/orange).
