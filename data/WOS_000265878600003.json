Recently QCA has been advocated as a technology for implementing reversible computing. However, existing tools for QCA design and evaluation have limited capabilities. This paper presents a new mechanical-based model for computing in QCA. By avoiding a full quantum-thermodynamical calculation, it offers a classical view of the principles of QCA operation and can be used in evaluating energy dissipation for reversible computing. The proposed model is mechanically based and is applicable to six-dot (neutrally charged) QCA cells for molecular implementation. The mechanical model consists of a sleeve of changing shape; four electrically charged balls are connected by a stick that rotates around an axle in the sleeve. The sleeve acts as a clocking unit, while the angular position of the stick within the changing shape of the sleeve, identifies the phase for quasi-adiabatic switching. A thermodynamic analysis of the proposed model is presented. The behaviors of various QCA basic devices and circuits are analyzed using the proposed model. It is shown that the proposed model is capable of evaluating the energy consumption for reversible computing at device and circuit levels for molecular QCA implementation. As applicable to QCA, two clocking schemes are also analyzed for energy dissipation and performance (in terms of number of clocking zones).", "paper_title": "A Model for Computing and Energy Dissipation of Molecular QCA Devices and Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000265878600003"}
