The ability to discern such relationships is widely expected to grow as sequencing projects provide novel information, bridging gaps in our map of the protein universe. Results: We have plotted our progress in protein sequencing over the last two decades and found that the rate of novel sequence discovery is in a sustained period of decline. Consequently, PSI-BLAST, the most widely used method to detect remote evolutionary relationships, which relies upon the accumulation of novel sequence data, is now showing a plateau in performance. We interpret this trend as signalling our approach to a representative map of the protein universe and discuss its implications.", "paper_title": "Sequencing delivers diminishing returns for homology detection: implications for mapping the protein universe", "paper_id": "WOS:000283665000003"}
