After the nonlinearities of ELM network are fixed by randomly generating the parameters, the network will correspond to a linear regression model. The selection of hidden nodes can then be regarded as a subset model selection in linear regression. The proposed constructive hidden nodes selection for ELM (referred to as CS-ELM) selects the optimal number of hidden nodes when the unbiased risk estimation based criterion C(p) reaches the minimum value. A comparison of the proposed CS-ELM with other model selection algorithms of ELM is evaluated on several real benchmark regression applications. And the empirical study shows that CS-ELM leads to a compact network structure automatically. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
