While consensus clustering allows the aggregation of different clustering solutions into a single robust clustering solution, the interactive feature selection facilitates the incorporation of the users' experience in the clustering tasks by selecting a set of textual features, i.e., including user's supervision at the term-level. We propose an approach for incorporating interactive textual feature selection into consensus clustering. Experimental results on several text collections demonstrate that our approach significantly improves consensus clustering accuracy, even when only few textual features are selected by the users.
