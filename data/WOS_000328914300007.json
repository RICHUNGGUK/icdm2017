We fabricated blue phosphorescent OLEDs with four types electron transporting layers, which were doped with lithium quinolate (Liq) from 0% to 10%. A series of blue devices consisted of indium tin oxide (ITO, 180 nm)/4,4-bis[N-(naphthyl)-N-phenyl-amino]biphenyl (NPB, 50 nm)/N,N'-dicarbazolyl-3,5-benzene (mCP, 10 nm)/iridium(III)bis[(4,6-di-fluoropheny)-pyridinato-N,C-2] picolinate (FIrpic) doped in mCP (8%, 30 nm)/1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazole-2-yl)benzene (TPBi, 20 nm)/TPBi mixed with Liq (20 nm)/Liq (2 nm)/aluminum (Al, 100 nm). The blue OLED doped with 5% Liq, which demonstrated a maximum luminous efficiency and external quantum efficiency of 17.64 cd/A and 8.78%, respectively, were found to be superior to the other blue devices.
