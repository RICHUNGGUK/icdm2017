A new simulator model is proposed for a winding process using non-linear identification based on a recurrent local linear neuro-fuzzy (RLLNF) network trained by local linear model tree (LOLIMOT), which is an incremental tree-based learning algorithm. The proposed NF models are compared with other known intelligent identifiers, namely multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF). Comparison of our proposed non-linear models and associated models obtained through the least square error (LSE) technique (the optimal modelling method for linear systems) confirms that the winding process is a non-linear system. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed NF modelling approach.", "paper_title": "Intelligent non-linear modelling of an industrial winding process using recurrent local linear neuro-fuzzy networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000304694300001"}
