A two-stage color histogram based method is described. The first stage defines mapping into the CAN by use of a single fuzzy histogram; while the second stage completes the image retrieval process through a spatially-biased histogram. The proposed system is completely decentralized, non-flooding, and promises high image recall, while miminizing network traffic.", "paper_title": "An efficient Peer to Peer Image Retrieval technique using Content Addressable Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238053100060"}
