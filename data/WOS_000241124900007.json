We also aim to improve the passive and manpowered way of searching the missing patient with the help of the information technology. Our system provides four monitoring schemes, including indoor residence monitoring, outdoor activity area monitoring, emergency rescue, and remote monitoring modes, and we have developed a service platform to implement these monitoring schemes. The platform consists of a web service server, a database server, a message controller server, and a health-GIS (H-GIS) server. Family members or volunteer workers can-identify the real-time positions of missing elderly using mobile phone, PDA, Notebook PC, and various mobile devices through the service platform. System performance and reliability is analyzed. Experiments performed on four different time slots, from three locations, through three mobile telecommunication companies show that the overall transaction time is 34 s and the average deviation of the geographical location is about 8 m. A questionnaire surveyed by I I users show that eight users are satisfied with the system stability and 10 users would like to carry the locating device themselves, or recommend it to their family members.", "paper_title": "Wireless health care service system for elderly with dementia", "paper_id": "WOS:000241124900007"}
