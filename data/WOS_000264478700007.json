For a GHP (k, 1; n x g) of type [w(1), ... , w(g)], where k = Sigma(g)(j=1) w(j), the fundamental problem is to determine the packing number N([w(1), ... , w(g)], 1; n x g), that is, the maximum number of blocks in such a GHP. In this paper we determine completely the values of N([w(1), ... , w(g)], 1; n x g) in the case of block size k is an element of {3, 4}.", "paper_title": "Optimal grid holey packings with block size 3 and 4", "paper_id": "WOS:000264478700007"}
