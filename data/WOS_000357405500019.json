The imaging modality of this telescope is based on the Moire pattern concept and utilizes 30 subcollimators, each one containing a pair of co-axial grids. This paper applies Fourier analysis to provide the first rigorous description of the data formation process in STIX. Specifically, we show that, under the fundamental frequency approximation, the integrated counts measured by STIX subcollimators can be interpreted as specific spatial Fourier components of the incoming photon flux, named visibilities. Fourier analysis also allows the quantitative assessment of the reliability of such interpretation. The description of STIX data in terms of visibilities has a notable impact on the image reconstruction process, since it fosters the application of Fourier-based imaging algorithms.", "paper_title": "The Process of Data Formation for the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) in Solar Orbite", "paper_id": "WOS:000357405500019"}
