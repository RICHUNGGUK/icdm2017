Since the spatial correlation in a residual block can be further exploited among the residual signals after motion estimation/compensation, horizontal or vertical DPCM in the residual signals can be applied to further reduce the magnitudes of the residual signals. The proposed method reduces the average bitrates of 3.5% compared with the Inter lossless coding of the H.264 standard.", "paper_title": "Residual DPCM about Motion Compensated Residual Signal for H.264 Lossless Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000266425600020"}
