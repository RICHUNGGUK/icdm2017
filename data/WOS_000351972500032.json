The problems with this method are (i) that no additional information can be included in the model, and (ii) that orthogonality imposes a hard constraint, not always reasonably. To overcome these drawbacks, here we propose to use a more flexible approach such as Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) to obtain this set of biological pathways through the network. By using this method, different constraints can be included in the model, and the same source of variability can be present in different pathways, which is reasonable from a biological standpoint This work follows a methodology developed for Pichia pastoris cultures grown on different carbon sources, lately presented in Gonzalez-Martinez et al. (2014). In this paper a different grey modelling approach, which aims to incorporate a priori knowledge through constraints on the modelling algorithms, is applied to the same case of study. The results of both models are compared to show their strengths and weaknesses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
