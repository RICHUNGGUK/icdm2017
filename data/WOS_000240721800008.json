For this purpose Krylov subspaces are generated by applying S and S-1 cyclically. The iteration can be executed with every linear system once the coefficient matrix has been split into the sum of two readily invertible matrices. In case S is a translation and a rotation of a Hermitian matrix, a five term recurrence is devised.", "paper_title": "A minimum residual algorithm for solving linear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240721800008"}
