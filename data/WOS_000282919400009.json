The ship maneuvering systems are represented by a linear sequential model which is derived by using the orthogonal functions. This approach permits the linear feedback control law to be applied to the nonlinear continuous-time ship maneuvering systems. The proposed optimal controller can accommodate the effects caused by wave disturbances. The on-line optimal course-keeping handling control, course-tracking handling control and course-changing handling control for a ship maneuvering system with wave disturbance are presented to illustrate the considerable promise that the proposed methods exhibits.", "paper_title": "OPTIMAL COURSE HANDLING CONTROL FOR NONLINEAR SHIP MANEUVERING SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000282919400009"}
