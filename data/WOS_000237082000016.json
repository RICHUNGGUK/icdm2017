The semantics is defined as least fixpoint of an operator on the continuous domain of functions of time that take values in the lattice of compact subsets of n-dimensional Euclidean space. The semantic function assigns to every point in time the set of states the automaton can visit at that time, starting from one of its initial states. Our main results are the correctness and computational adequacy of the denotational semantics with respect to the operational semantics and the fact that the denotational semantics is computable.", "paper_title": "Denotational semantics of hybrid automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000237082000016"}
