With the development of silicon photonics for short-haul optical communication, wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)-based optical networks-on-chip (ONoCs) are emerging on-chip communication architectures that can potentially offer high bandwidth and power efficiency. Thermal sensitivity of photonic devices is one of the main concerns about the on-chip optical interconnects. We systematically modeled thermal effects in optical links in WDM-based ONoCs. Based on the proposed thermal models, we developed OTemp, an optical thermal effect modeling platform for optical links in both WDM-based ONoCs and single-wavelength ONoCs. OTemp can be used to simulate the power consumption as well as optical power loss for optical links under temperature variations. We use case studies to quantitatively analyze the worst-case power consumption for one wavelength in an eight-wavelength WDM-based optical link under different configurations of low-temperature-dependence techniques. Results show that the worst-case power consumption increases dramatically with on-chip temperature variations. Thermal-based adjustment and optimal device settings can help reduce power consumption under temperature variations. Assume that off-chip vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers are used as the laser source with WDM channel spacing of 1 nm, if we use thermal-based adjustment with guard rings for channel remapping, the worst-case total power consumption is 6.7 pJ/bit under the maximum temperature variation of 60 degrees C; larger channel spacing would result in a larger worst-case power consumption in this case. If we use thermal-based adjustment without channel remapping, the worst-case total power consumption is around 9.8 pJ/bit under the maximum temperature variation of 60 degrees C; in this case, the worst-case power consumption would benefit from a larger channel spacing.", "paper_title": "System-Level Modeling and Analysis of Thermal Effects in WDM-Based Optical Networks-on-Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000344530400011"}
