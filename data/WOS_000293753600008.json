This approach, oblique coordinate control, decouples tasks. Even though a system is large, they can be designed by a combination of small tasks. Therefore, tasks can be regarded as reusable components. In this study, micro-macro bilateral control is achieved as a complicated task. Small objects can be manipulated as large objects in micro-macro bilateral control. However, ideal micro-macro bilateral controllers are usually derived only for single-degree-of-freedom (DOF) systems. Then, we propose a micro-macro bilateral controller for multi-DOF on the basis of oblique coordinate control. To obtain multi-DOF bilateral control, we first derive control goals as kinematic relations. This study also considers the case where scaling gains of position and force are selected in a different manner. The goals of micro-macro bilateral control are then controlled by oblique coordinate control. The validity of the proposed method is experimentally verified.", "paper_title": "Multi-DOF Micro-Macro Bilateral Controller Using Oblique Coordinate Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000293753600008"}
