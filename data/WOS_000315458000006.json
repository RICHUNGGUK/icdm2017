MTGP supports large state sizes such as 11213 bits, and uses the high parallelism of GPUs in computing many steps of the recursion in parallel. The second proposal is a parameter-set generator for MTGP, named MTGP Dynamic Creator (MTGPDC). MTGPDC creates up to 2(32) distinct parameter sets which generate sequences with high-dimensional uniformity. This facility is suitable for a large grid of GPUs where each GPU requires separate random number streams. MTGP is based on linear recursion over the two-element field, and has better high-dimensional equidistribution than the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator.", "paper_title": "Variants of Mersenne Twister Suitable for Graphic Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000315458000006"}
