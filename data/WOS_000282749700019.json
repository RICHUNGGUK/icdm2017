Such a data typically consists of thousands of DNA segments with base-specific coverage values. We present a new version of our DNA motif discovery software ChIPMunk adapted for ChIPSeqdata. ChIPMunk is an iterative algorithm that combines greedy optimization with bootstrapping and uses coverage profiles as motif positional preferences. ChIPMunk does not require truncation of long DNA segments and it is practical for processing up to tens of thousands of data sequences. Comparison with traditional (MEME) or ChIP-Seq-oriented ( HMS) motif discovery tools shows that ChIPMunk identifies the correct motifs with the same or better quality but works dramatically faster.", "paper_title": "Deep and wide digging for binding motifs in ChIP-Seq data", "paper_id": "WOS:000282749700019"}
