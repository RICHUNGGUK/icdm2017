The proposed algorithm does not require a prior knowledge of the number of clusters; an improved variant of the clonal selection algorithm is used to determine the satisfied number of clusters and the appropriate partitioning of the data set as well. In addition, a novel operation called antibody gene transposon is introduced to the framework of clonal selection algorithm which can realize to find the satisfied number of cluster automatically. The proposed method has been extensively compared with iterated local search approach (ILS) and three well-known automatic clustering algorithms, including automatic clustering using an improved differential evolution algorithm (ACDE); variable-string-length genetic algorithm based clustering techniques (VGA) and the dynamic clustering approach based on particle swarm optimization (DCPSO). 23 datasets with widely varying characteristics are used to demonstrate the superiority of the GTCSA. In addition, GTCSA is applied to a real world application, namely natural image segmentation, with a good performance obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
