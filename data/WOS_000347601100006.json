In this paper, we study a constrained d-RSP problem (Constrained d-RSP problem) in which each line-segment l in the spanning path must cover all the points in S that share the same line with l. By applying the branch-and-search and dynamic programming techniques, a parameterized algorithm with running time 0*((1 + root 1 + 4(d - 1)(2))(k)) is given for the Constrained d-RSP problem, which significantly improves the current best result 0*((0.74dk)(k)).
