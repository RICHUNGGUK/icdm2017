Apart from having some intrinsic interest, the proven cancellation result plays a crucial role in the study of the cover equations, in the sense of Fokkink and Nain, that characterize the studied semantics. The techniques used in the proof of the cancellation theorem may also have some independent interest.", "paper_title": "A Cancellation Theorem for BCCSP", "paper_id": "WOS:000262452600001"}
