In this approach, an elaborate encoding method is developed, and the relative confidence is used as the fitness function. With genetic algorithm, a global search can be performed and system automation is implemented, because our model does not require the user-specified threshold of minimum support. Furthermore, we expand this strategy to cover quantitative association rule discovery. For efficiency, we design a generalized FP-tree to implement this algorithm. We experimentally evaluate our approach, and demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce the computation costs and generate interesting association rules only. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
