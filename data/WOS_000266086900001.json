External means that the specification only relates input and output variables. We introduce the subclass of uniformly well-connected (UWC) architectures for which there exists a routing allowing each output process to get the values of all inputs it is connected to, as soon as possible. We prove that the distributed synthesis problem is decidable on UWC architectures if and only if the output variables are totally ordered by their knowledge of input variables. We also show that if we extend this class by letting the routing depend on the output process, then the previous decidability result fails. Finally, we provide a natural restriction on specifications under which the whole class of UWC architectures is decidable.", "paper_title": "Distributed synthesis for well-connected architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000266086900001"}
