We give bounds for the dimension of the kernel and the rank of the image of a code over Z(2k) with a given type and show that there exists such a code for each dimension in the interval for the kernel. We determine when the Gray image of a code over Z(2k) generates a linear self-dual code and give families of codes whose image generate binary self-dual codes. We investigate the Gray image of quaternary self-dual codes and examine when the Gray image of a self-dual code over Z(4) is a binary self-dual code.", "paper_title": "CODES OVER Z(2k), GRAY MAP AND SELF-DUAL CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000296590400002"}
