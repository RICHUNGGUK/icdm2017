More specifically, we study how to achieve an optimal tradeoff between total access delay and caching overheads, by properly selecting a subset of wireless nodes as cache nodes when the network topology changes. We assume a data source updates a data item to be accessed by other client nodes. Most of the existing cache placement algorithms use hop counts to measure the total cost of a caching system, but hop delay in wireless networks varies much due to the contentions among these nodes and the traffic load on each link. Therefore, we evaluate the per-hop delay for each link according to the contentions detected by a wireless node from the MAC layer. We propose two heuristic cache placement algorithms, named Centralized Contention-aware Caching Algorithm (CCCA) and Distributed Contention-aware Caching Algorithm (DCCA), both of which detect the variation of contentions and the change of the traffic flows, in order to evaluate the benefit of selecting a node as a cache node. We also apply a TTL-based cache consistency strategy to maintain the delta consistency among all the cache nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms achieve better performance than other alternative ones in terms of average query delay, caching overheads, and query success ratio.
