The scheme formulated in a grid stencil of five nodal points for solving the three-dimensional waveguide equations employs the locally analytic solution. In this three-dimensional study, calculations were carried out for the investigation of wave propagation in diffused channel, rectangular and rib types of optical waveguide.
