A numerical solution based on the trapezoidal integration rule to the integral equation is introduced. To explain the method used in the article, four numerical examples with the exponential distribution, gamma distribution, Weibull distribution and lognormal distribution, respectively, are studied.", "paper_title": "Numerical solution to an integral equation in geometric process", "paper_id": "WOS:000249549100002"}
