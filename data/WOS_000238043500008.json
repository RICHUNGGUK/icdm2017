Planar regions are reconstructed using only sparse, affine-invariant sets of corresponding seed regions. These regions are iteratively expanded and refined using plane-induced homographies. Experiments on synthetic data show the high accuracy of the reconstruction and demonstrate that the reconstruction method can cope with large baseline changes. Experiments on real images show the performance of the method on practically relevant scenes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
