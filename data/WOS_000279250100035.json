Their construction was based on Gentry's IBE scheme that supports their security proof. In this paper, we show that their security proof is incorrect. We point out the difference between Gentry's proof and that of Hu et al., and we show that the security of Hu et al.'s HIBE scheme cannot be reduced to their claimed complexity assumption.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Hu-Huang-Fan Practical Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000279250100035"}
