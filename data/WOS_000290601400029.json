ROI selection is very important as it bears significant information about the theme of the visual scene. However, ROI selection remains an unsolved task for its notion of semantic attribute and its evaluation in a context. Therefore, this research proposes a new innovative approach to tackle this problem. In this approach, context is considered as the relevant object that has high probability of occurrence and is semantically relevant for the evidential object. To recognize meaningful objects of interest in an uncertain situation, Bayesian Network theory is applied. Objects and their interactions with other objects are modeled by mutual supplement as a simplest approach in natural language processing. In this model, we introduce an object-verb-function dependability for estimation of mutual supplement as prior information. For semantic evaluation of context awareness, our method formalizes the concept of semantic stability based on the functional relevance of the objects confined by ROIs. Experimental results show that the proposed method is innovative as it generates multiple inferences for context awareness without sufficient information.", "paper_title": "AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO EVALUATE SEMANTIC CONTEXT AWARENESS FOR ROI SELECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601400029"}
