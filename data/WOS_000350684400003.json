The objective of the obtained problem is to select a subset of jobs that constitutes a feasible solution to the shortest path problem, and to execute the selected jobs on the flow shop machines to minimize the makespan. We argue that this problem is NP-hard even if the number of machines is two, and is NP-hard in the strong sense for the general case. We propose an intuitive approximation algorithm for the case where the number of machines is an input, and an improved approximation algorithm for fixed number of machines.", "paper_title": "A combination of flow shop scheduling and the shortest path problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000350684400003"}
