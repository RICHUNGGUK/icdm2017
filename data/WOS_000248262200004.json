The method works by extracting the vertical projection feature from signature images and by comparing reference and probe feature templates using elastic matching. Modifications are made to the basic DTW algorithm to account for the stability of the various components of a signature. The basic DTW and the modified DTW methods are tested on a signature database of 100 people. The modified DTW algorithm, which incorporates stability. has an equal-error-rate of only 2% in comparison to 29% for the basic DTW method. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
