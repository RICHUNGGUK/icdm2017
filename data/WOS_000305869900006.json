Researchers have implemented different rules to increase the sensitivity of Shewhart, CUSUM and EWMA control charts for the detection of small shifts in process location. However, for the monitoring of process scale, the use of such rules has been limited to Shewhart charts. This study proposes the implementation of sensitizing rules in CUSUM scale charts to enhance their ability to detect smaller changes in process variability. The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated and compared with the simple scale CUSUM scheme, the EWMS chart, the M-EWMS chart and the COMB chart, in terms of run length characteristics such as average run length (ARL) and standard deviation of the run length distribution (SDRL). Control chart coefficients to set the ARL at the desired level are also provided. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the application of the proposed schemes on practical data sets.
