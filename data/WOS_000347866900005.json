Traditional DEA models assume that all input and output data are known exactly. In many situations, however, some inputs and/or outputs take imprecise data. In this paper, we present optimistic and pessimistic perspectives for obtaining an efficiency evaluation for the DMU under consideration with imprecise data. Additionally, slacks-based measures of efficiency are used for direct assessment of efficiency in the presence of imprecise data with slack values. Finally, the geometric average of the two efficiency values is used to determine the DMU with the best performance. A ranking approach based on degree of preference is used for ranking the efficiency intervals of the DMUs. Two numerical examples are used to show the application of the proposed DEA approach.
