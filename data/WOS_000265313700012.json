This perception difference leads to an inability to fully define the information requirements of a new system. Practitioners understand this difficulty and look for solid approaches to address the problem. A model is developed that links coordination mechanisms and project partnering practices to perception gaps and project success. The premise is to use the model to confirm the expected relationships and examine coordination practices in particular for effectiveness in promoting common understanding. Survey results from information system project professionals indicate that the managerial interventions of coordination and partnering are successful in reducing the perception gaps and improving project performance. Prior research had not established a link. The results support the principle that organizations must install specific coordination techniques and implement partnering procedures prior to the commencement of project activities.
