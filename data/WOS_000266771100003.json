We verified, on the basis of information obtained, that the studies which precede the decision of a Financial Corporation to initiate the launching of a public offering on a certain economic unit/company or to acquire the shares of a Public Limited Company to take over control, are based on numerical mathematics, adapted mainly to the study of the future hypothetical profitability of the group resulting from the merging process or fusion. We present a proposal based on combinatorial pretopology that leads to an algorithm capable of solving our objective adequately.", "paper_title": "M-ATTRIBUTES ALGORITHM FOR THE SELECTION OF A COMPANY TO BE AFFECTED BY A PUBLIC OFFERING", "paper_id": "WOS:000266771100003"}
