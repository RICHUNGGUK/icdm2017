We present a very simple single-bug program to model the problem. By examining different possible execution paths through this model program over a number of test cases, the effectiveness of different proposed spectral ranking methods can be evaluated in idealised conditions. The results are remarkably consistent to those arrived at empirically using the Siemens test suite and Space benchmarks. The model also helps identify groups of metrics that are equivalent for ranking. Due to the simplicity of the model, an optimal ranking method can be devised. This new method out-performs previously proposed methods for the model program, the Siemens test suite and Space. It also helps provide insight into other ranking methods.", "paper_title": "A Model for Spectra-Based Software Diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000294159500004"}
