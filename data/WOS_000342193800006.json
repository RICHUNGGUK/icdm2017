Unlike classical linear sequential organization, VideoGraph concentrates the video content across the time line by structuring scenes and materializes with two-dimensional graph, which enables non-linear exploration on the scenes and their transitions. To construct VideoGraph, we adopt a sub-shot induced method to evaluate the spatio-temporal similarity between shot segments of video. Then, scene structure is derived by grouping similar shots and identifying the valid transitions between scenes. The final stage is to represent the scene structure using a graph with respect to scene transition topology. Our VideoGraph can provide a condensed representation in the scene level and facilitate a non-linear manner to browse videos. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency by using VideoGraph to explore and access the video content.", "paper_title": "VideoGraph: a non-linear video representation for efficient exploration", "paper_id": "WOS:000342193800006"}
