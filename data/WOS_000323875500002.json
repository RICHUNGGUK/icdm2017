A chance-constrained programming model is established for the M-S 4PLRPFC. Next, a memetic algorithm (MA) with a fuzzy simulation method is designed to solve the problem. Based on a set of problem instances as the test bed, experiments are performed to compare the performance of the proposed MA with those of the enumeration method and a standard genetic algorithm (SGA). The experimental results show that the proposed MA obtains the same results as the enumeration method and that it is than the SGA. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
