Typically, they have many processing elements in the form of an array, which is suitable for implementing spatial redundancy used for fault-tolerant systems design. This paper presents a purely software-level approach to implementing transient-fault-tolerance on an existing processing element array without any modification to the architecture. It includes automated design flow to construct a fault-tolerant system and mathematical modeling for analyzing system reliability. Experiments with real-world applications show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in terms of yield enhancement and system reliability.", "paper_title": "Software-Level Approaches for Tolerating Transient Faults in a Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000342085500008"}
