The relationship between watermarking capacity and EBR is also discussed. Two watermarking communication models are established for the EBR analysis of digital image watermarking. In the watermarking communication models, channel coding is introduced to transmit digital watermark in the watermarking channel. Another concept, watermark payload capacity, is introduced. EBR of watermarking will keep a lower lever if its payload capacity is less than the channel capacity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
