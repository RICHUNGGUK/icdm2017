This principle has been recently accepted into mainstream XML query languages, but was still waiting for a complete treatment. We provide here a precise definition for this class of errors, and define a type system that is sound and complete, in its search for such errors, for a core language, under mild restrictions on the use of recursion in type definitions. In the process, we describe a dichotomy among existential and universal type systems, which is essential to understand some specific features of our type system.", "paper_title": "Static analysis for path correctness of XML queries", "paper_id": "WOS:000240174500008"}
