It is known that for such systems, conventional analog simulation can be critical due to the presence of strongly nonlinear switching devices. In or er to overcome the drawback, in this paper, an in-depth investigation of the weakness points of analog simulation is first presented. On the basis of the achieved understanding, a novel accurate and efficient simulation technique that combines conventional analog simulation with a suited event-driven management of internally controlled commutations is presented. The proposed method employs a novel algorithm for locating commutation time instants and a regionwise evaluation of critical switching devices. The method is general and can be easily inserted into analog simulator tools.", "paper_title": "Event-driven time-domain simulation of closed-loop switched circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000241567000010"}
