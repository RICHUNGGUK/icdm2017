Compositional heterogeneity in data intended for studies of phylogeny suggests that the data did not evolve under these conditions. SeqVis, a Java application for analysis of nucleotide content, reads sequence alignments in several formats and plots the nucleotide content in a tetrahedron. Once plotted, outliers can be identified, thus allowing for decisions on the applicability of the data for phylogenetic analysis.", "paper_title": "SeqVis: Visualization of compositional heterogeneity in large alignments of nucleotides", "paper_id": "WOS:000240433100017"}
