Considering the heterogeneity among SSs which have diverse traffic demands, in this paper, we introduce the weighted proportional fair (WPF) scheduling scheme for the Best Effort (BE) service in IEEE 802.16 networks to achieve the flexible and efficient resource allocation. We develop an analytical model to investigate the performance of WPF in terms of spectral efficiency, throughput, resource utilization, and fairness, where the Rayleigh fading channel and the adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) technique are considered. Extensive simulations are conducted to illustrate the efficiency of the WPF scheduling scheme and verify the accuracy of the analytical model.
