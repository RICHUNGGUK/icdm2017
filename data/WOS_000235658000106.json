It is urgent to integrate hydrological data of Yellow River and ease access to hydrological data by public, This is particularly because more and more hydrological data are collected by increasingly modernized measuring systems across the Yellow River basin. For this, a Web-oriented application management system of hydrological information has been proposed. This paper describes main technique points involved in the management system in order to build a common platform of hydrological data from different sources and to efficiently provide information services.", "paper_title": "Integrating hydrological data of Yellow River for efficient information services", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000106"}
