A new formulation is proposed in the framework of weakly enforced no-slip conditions that is better aligned with traditional near-wall modeling approaches than its predecessors. The new formulation is tested on turbulent open-channel flows at friction-velocity-based Reynolds numbers Re-tau = 395 and 950 benchmark problems. The computations are performed using the Residual-Based Variational Multiscale (RBVMS) formulation of LES, discretized using Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) based on Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). The new near-wall model formulation gives more accurate results for the mean flow and velocity fluctuations than its older versions, while exhibiting better numerical stability than traditional near-wall modeling techniques.
