However, it brings about the challenge of keeping both the data confidentiality and patients' identity privacy simultaneously. Many existing access control and anonymous authentication schemes cannot be straightforwardly exploited. To solve the problem, in this paper, a novel authorized accessible privacy model (AAPM) is established. Patients can authorize physicians by setting an access tree supporting flexible threshold predicates. Then, based on it, by devising a new technique of attribute-based designated verifier signature, a patient self-controllable multi-level privacy-preserving cooperative authentication scheme (PSMPA) realizing three levels of security and privacy requirement in distributed m-healthcare cloud computing system is proposed. The directly authorized physicians, the indirectly authorized physicians and the unauthorized persons in medical consultation can respectively decipher the personal health information and/or verify patients' identities by satisfying the access tree with their own attribute sets. Finally, the formal security proof and simulation results illustrate our scheme can resist various kinds of attacks and far outperforms the previous ones in terms of computational, communication and storage overhead.", "paper_title": "PSMPA: Patient Self-Controllable and Multi-Level Privacy-Preserving Cooperative Authentication in Distributed m-Healthcare Cloud Computing System", "paper_id": "WOS:000354526000017"}
