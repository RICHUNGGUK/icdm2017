Consistent initial conditions are essential for determining numeric solutions for systems of DAEs. Very few systems of DAEs can be solved using explicit ODE solvers. This paper applies a single-step approach to system initialization and simulation allowing for systems of DAEs to be solved using explicit (and linearly implicit) ODE solvers without a priori knowledge of the exact initial conditions for the algebraic variables. Along with using a combined process for initialization and simulation, many physical systems represented through large systems of DAEs can be solved in a more robust and efficient manner without the need for nonlinear solvers. The proposed approach extends the usability of explicit and linearly implicit ODE solvers and removes the requirement of Newton-Raphson type iteration.
