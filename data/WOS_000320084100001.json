One of the simplest, yet explanatorily powerful, models of oscillatory Coordination Dynamics is the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model. The metastable regime described by the HKB equation has been hypothesised to be the signature of brain oscillatory dynamics underlying sensorimotor coordination. Despite evidence supporting such a hypothesis, to our knowledge, there are still very few models (if any) where the HKB equation generates spatially situated behaviour and, at the same time, has its dynamics modulated by the behaviour it generates (by means of the sensory feedback resulting from body movement). This work presents a computational model where the HKB equation controls an agent performing a simple gradient climbing task and shows (i) how different metastable dynamical patterns in the HKB equation are generated and sustained by the continuous interaction between the agent and its environment; and (ii) how the emergence of functional metastable patterns in the HKB equation - i.e. patterns that generate gradient climbing behaviour - depends not only on the structure of the agent's sensory input but also on the coordinated coupling of the agent's motor-sensory dynamics. This work contributes to Kelso's theoretical framework and also to the understanding of neural oscillations and sensorimotor coordination.", "paper_title": "Sensorimotor coordination and metastability in a situated HKB model", "paper_id": "WOS:000320084100001"}
