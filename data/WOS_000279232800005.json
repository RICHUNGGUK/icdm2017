The proposed method is formulated with reactive power based model reference adaptive system (MRAS). The method does not require the estimation of stator/rotor flux. So, the integrator related problems at synchronous speed are overcome. Also, the estimation method is independent of stator and rotor resistance variation. Extensive simulation results are presented to validate the technique. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
