Mobile phone users (N = 644) were divided into two groups using a stratified random sampling method. Respondents from Group 1 (n = 334) were surveyed for mobile phone use and respondents from Group 2 (n = 310) were surveyed for the intention to adopt mobile video telephony. On the basis of structural equation analysis for the model of media attendance, the results of this study support the assumptions that (a) mobile phone use is more likely to be explained by habit strength and (b) the intention to adopt mobile video telephony is more likely to be predicted by outcome expectations.", "paper_title": "A Social Cognitive Perspective on Mobile Communication Technology Use and Adoption", "paper_id": "WOS:000262033200005"}
