The pseudostress-velocity formulation is a variation of the stress-velocity formulation, which does not require symmetric tensor spaces in the finite element discretization. Hence its discretization is greatly simplified. The discrete system is further decoupled into an H(div) problem for the pseudostress and a post-process resolving the velocity. This can be done conveniently by using the penalty method for steady-state flows or by using the time discretization for nonsteady-state flows. We apply this formulation to the 2D lid-driven cavity problem and study its grid convergence rate. Also, computational results of the time-dependent-driven cavity problem and the flow past rectangular problem are reported.
