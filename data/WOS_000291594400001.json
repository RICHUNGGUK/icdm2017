We show that by taking advantage of the periodicity of VoIP frames, generated by multiple vocoder types, and by applying semi-fixed allocations in the existing resource allocation process, the mapping overhead can be reduced substantially. We present a system model that allows the evaluation of the proposed solutions for the problem at hand. Using this model, we show that the problem is NP hard and present a set of observations on the resource allocation process leading to good mapping decisions from the perspective of mapping overhead. We present a new mapping algorithm that implement the decisions and show by extensive simulations that the proposed mapping algorithm can reduce the overhead down to 25% of the overhead experienced in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based systems such as WiMAX and IEEE802.16, while retaining a low computational complexity.
