The proposed ER circuit consists of one energy storage capacitor, two energy recovery inductors, and three insulated-gate bipolar transistors. The circuit operations in the series and parallel resonance modes are similar to conventional ones, except for the leading edge of the first sustain pulse and the trailing edge of the last sustain pulse. To reduce power consumption in the parallel resonance mode of operation, these two pulse edges are generated using a series resonance between the panel capacitance and the energy recovery inductor. The proposed circuit had energy recovery efficiencies in both the series and parallel resonance modes that were nearly the same as the efficiency of the conventional series resonance ER circuit. Experimental results on a 42-inch XGA single-scan PDP show that the proposed ER circuit is suitable for use in a PDP drive circuit. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
