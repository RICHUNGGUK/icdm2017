As a result, we show indexed containers provide normal forms for strictly positive families in much the same way that containers provide normal forms for strictly positive types. Interestingly, this step from containers to indexed containers is achieved without having to extend the core type theory. Most of the construction presented here has been formalized using the Agda system.", "paper_title": "Indexed containers", "paper_id": "WOS:000357277100003"}
