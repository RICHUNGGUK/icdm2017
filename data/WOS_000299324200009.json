In this environment, the duration of activities are considered as random fuzzy variables that have probability and fuzzy natures, simultaneously. To obtain a robust critical path with this kind of uncertainty a chance constraints programming model is used. This model is converted to a deterministic model in two stages. In the first stage, the uncertain model is converted to a model with interval parameters by alpha-cut method and distribution function concepts. In the second stage, the interval model is converted to a deterministic model by robust optimization and min-max regret criterion and ultimately a genetic algorithm with a proposed exact algorithm are applied to solve the final model. Finally, some numerical examples are given to show the efficiency of the solution procedure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
