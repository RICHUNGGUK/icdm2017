In this work, we extend the error model to Single Layer Perceptron Neural Network (SLPNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with sigmoid kernel function. For a trained SLPNN or SVM and a given training dataset, the proposed error model bounds above the error for unseen samples which are similar to the training samples. As the major component of the localized generalization error model, the stochastic sensitivity measure formula for perceptron neural network derived in this work has relaxed the assumptions of same distribution for all inputs and each sample perturbed only once in previous works. These make the sensitivity measure applicable to pattern classification problems. The stochastic sensitivity measure of SVM with Sigmoid kernel is also derived in this work as a component of the localized generalization error model. At the end of this paper, we discuss the advantages of the proposed error bound over existing error bound.", "paper_title": "The localized generalization error model for single layer perceptron neural network and sigmoid support vector machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000254194700010"}
