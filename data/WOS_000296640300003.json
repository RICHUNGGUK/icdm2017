In the original method, the phase of the respiratory oscillator is observed at the instants of time when the phase of the cardiac oscillator attains a certain value. In this article, we introduced an additional adaptive delay in the cardiac oscillator based on the maximisation of the cross-correlation or symbolic coupling traces between the phases of respiration and the delayed R-R intervals. We then investigated phase coordination in thirteen normal subjects (five males, eight females; age: 19-24 years) for different body postures. Cardiorespiratory coordination was observed to be significantly reduced in the upright position (supine vs. upright: 11.9 +/- A 5.1 vs. 6.9 +/- A 3.6, P < 0.05). Compared to the original algorithm we observed an increase in the detection of average cardiorespiratory coordination (supine original vs. delay: 11.9 vs. 18.9%), together with a decrease in standard deviation of the percentage of coordination in all the subjects, after introducing the heart rate delay (supine original vs. delay: 5.1 vs. 4.4%). In conclusion, the performance of the synchrogram technique was improved by including an adaptive delay in the cardiac oscillator.", "paper_title": "Time delay correction of the synchrogram for optimized detection of cardiorespiratory coordination", "paper_id": "WOS:000296640300003"}
