The flow considered is fully developed laminar flow driven by axial pressure gradient. It is shown that the drag of the annular flow decreases initially and then increases with the enhancememt of orbital motion, when it has the same direction as the inner cylinder rotation. If the eccentricity and rotation speed of the inner cylinder keep unchanged (with respect to the absolute frame of reference), and the orbital motion is strong enough that the azimuthal component (with respect to the orbit of the orbital motion) of the flow-induced force on the inner cylinder goes to zero, the flow drag nearly reaches its minimum value. When only an external torque is imposed to drive the eccentric rotation of the inner cylinder, orbital motion may occur and, in general, has the same direction as the inner cylinder rotation. Under this condition, whether the inner cylinder can have a steady motion state with force equilibrium, and even what type of motion state it can have, is related to the linear density of the inner cylinder.
