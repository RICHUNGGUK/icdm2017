Advances in technology have increased the relevance of studying digital communication using computational devices. Devices, such as multi-touch screens and cameras, are essential for natural communication, and obvious applications involve entertainment to attract users. This study focused on the use of cameras to support natural interaction of visitors during museum presentations. We first outlined a platform called the \"U-Garden,\" comprising a set of tools to assist application designers in developing movement-based projects that employ camera tracking. We then established a rationale with which to base the design of such presentation tools. This system supplies interactive power to natural interaction based on depth image streams, and provides tracking results to designers for producing numerous fascinating applications that appeal to more diverse interactive imaginations.", "paper_title": "A multimedia presentation system using a 3D gesture interface in museums", "paper_id": "WOS:000331715200004"}
