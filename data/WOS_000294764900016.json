In this paper, we focus on the problem of finding conditions under which the iterated hairpin completion of a given word is regular. According to the numbers of words alpha and (alpha) over bar that initiate hairpin completion and how they are scattered, we classify the set of all words w. For some basic classes of words w containing small numbers of occurrences of alpha and (alpha) over bar, we prove that the iterated hairpin completion of w is regular. For other classes with higher numbers of occurrences of alpha and (alpha) over bar, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the iterated hairpin completion of a word in these classes to be regular.", "paper_title": "On the Regularity of Iterated Hairpin Completion of a Single Word", "paper_id": "WOS:000294764900016"}
