We take full advantage of the low numerical errors and associated superior scale resolving capabilities of high-order spectral methods by using high-order ansatz functions up to 12th order. We employ polynomial de-aliasing techniques to prevent instabilities arising from inexact quadrature of nonlinearities. Without the need for any additional filtering, explicit or implicit modelling, or artificial dissipation, our high-order schemes capture the turbulent flow at the considered Reynolds number range very well. Three classical large eddy simulation benchmark problems are considered: a circular cylinder flow at Re-D=3900, a confined periodic hill flow at Re-h=2800 and the transitional flow over a SD7003 airfoil at Re-c=60,000. For all computations, the total number of degrees of freedom used for the discontinuous Galerkin spectral method simulations is chosen to be equal or considerably less than the reported data in literature. In all three cases, we achieve an equal or better match to direct numerical simulation results, compared with other schemes of lower order with explicitly or implicitly added subgrid scale models.
