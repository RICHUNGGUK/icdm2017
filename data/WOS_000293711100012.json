The TDNLMM algorithm, which is derived from robust M-estimation, has the advantage of improved performance over the conventional TDNLMS algorithm in combating impulsive noises. Using Price's theorem and its extension, the above algorithms can be treated in a single framework respectively for Gaussian and impulsive noise environments. Further, by introducing new special integral functions, related expectations can be evaluated so as to obtain decoupled difference equations which describe the mean and mean square behaviors of the TDNLMS and TDNLMM algorithms. These analytical results reveal the advantages of the TDNLMM algorithm in impulsive noise environment, and are in good agreement with computer simulation results.", "paper_title": "On the Performance Analysis of a Class of Transform-domain NLMS Algorithms with Gaussian Inputs and Mixture Gaussian Additive Noise Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000293711100012"}
