It is designed for stroke patients to use in their homes. It records motion exercise data, and immediately transfers this data to hospitals via the internet. A real-time videoconferencing interface is adopted for patients to observe therapy instructions from therapists. The system uses a peer-to-peer network architecture, without the need for a server. This is a potentially effective approach to reducing costs, allowing easy setup and permitting group-rehabilitation sessions. We evaluate this system using the following steps: (1) motion detection in different movement patterns, such as reach, drink, and reach-flexion; (2) online bidirectional visual telecommunication; and (3) 3D rendering using a proposed offline animation package. This evaluation has subjectively been proved to be optimal.", "paper_title": "An interactive Internet-based system for tracking upper limb motion in home-based rehabilitation", "paper_id": "WOS:000253215600005"}
