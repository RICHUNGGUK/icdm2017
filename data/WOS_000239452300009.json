In a first step, locally valid linear models are derived. Two linearization procedures are compared. The first procedure is the classical Taylor series expansion, while the second is a newly developed linearization procedure based on weighted linear combinations. In a second step, the locally valid models are combined to obtain one globally valid multi-model. Previous work has focused on the most basic configuration of one anoxic and one aerated tank followed by a point settler [Smets, I.Y., Haegebaert, J.V. and Carrette, R. and Van Impe, J.F., 2003, Water Research , 37 , 1831 - 1851]. Refinements to the methodology are however needed (and presented here) once the influent flow rate range is increased and the benchmark configuration, proposed by the COST 682 working group no. 2, is taken as the simulation protocol. The main advantage of the obtained linear model (structure) remains the alliance of high predictive power with low complexity, rendering the multi-model fit for on-line optimization and control schemes.", "paper_title": "A linear ASM1 based multi-model for activated sludge systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239452300009"}
