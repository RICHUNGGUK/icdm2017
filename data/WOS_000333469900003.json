This is exacerbated by the increasing overlap in user-bases among various services. To alert fellow researchers in both the academia and the industry to the feasibility of such an attack, we propose an algorithm, Seed-and-Grow, to identify users from an anonymized social graph, based solely on graph structure. The algorithm first identifies a seed subgraph, either planted by an attacker or divulged by a collusion of a small group of users, and then grows the seed larger based on the attacker's existing knowledge of the users' social relations. Our work identifies and relaxes implicit assumptions taken by previous works, eliminates arbitrary parameters, and improves identification effectiveness and accuracy. Simulations on real-world collected data sets verify our claim.", "paper_title": "A Two-Stage Deanonymization Attack against Anonymized Social Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000333469900003"}
