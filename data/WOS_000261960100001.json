This paper presents an algorithm for the composition of stack-attributed tree transducers with attributed tree transducers. The algorithm is an extension of the existing method to compose attributed tree transducers. It leads to some natural closure properties of the corresponding classes of tree transformations.", "paper_title": "Composing Stack-Attributed Tree Transducers", "paper_id": "WOS:000261960100001"}
