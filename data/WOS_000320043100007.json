Nevertheless, no work has shown a clear cut evidence that there is a correlation between the solver's population structure and the problem's network structure. In this work, we verify this correlation performing a clear and systematic analysis of a large set of population structures (based on the well known beta-graphs and NK-landscape problems. Furthermore, we go beyond our findings in these idealised experiments by analysing the performance of variable-topology EAs on a dynamic real-world problem, the Multi-Skills Call Centre.", "paper_title": "Matching island topologies to problem structure in parallel evolutionary algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000320043100007"}
