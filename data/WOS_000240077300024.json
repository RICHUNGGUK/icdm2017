We generalize this result in the following ways. First, a natural generalization of this statement is a necessary condition for k-trees, and we show that it is not sufficient for any k > 1. Second, we identify non-trivial sufficient conditions for the degree sequences of 2-trees. We also show that these sufficient conditions are almost necessary using bounds on the partition function p(n) and probabilistic methods. Third, we generalize the characterization of degrees of 1-trees in an elegant and counter-intuitive way to yield integer sequences that characterize k-trees, for all k.", "paper_title": "Sequences characterizing k-trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000240077300024"}
