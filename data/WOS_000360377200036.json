Web based solutions would be more appreciated and are complex to be realized for the problems related to the video desynchronization. In this paper, MyStoryPlayer/ECLAP solution is presented. The major contributions to the state of the art are related to: (i) the semantic model to formalize the relationships and play among audiovisual determining synchronizations, (ii) the model and modality to save and share user experiences in navigating among lessons including several related and connected audiovisual, (iii) the design and development of algorithm to shorten the production of relationships among media, (iv) the design and development of the whole system including its user interaction model, and (v) the solution and algorithm to keep the desynchronizations limited among media in the event of low network bandwidth. The proposed solution has been developed for and it is in use within ECLAP (European Collected Library of Performing Arts) for accessing and commenting performing arts training content. The paper also reports validation results about performance assessment and tuning, and about the usage of tools on ECLAP services. In ECLAP, users may navigate in the audiovisual relationships, thus creating and sharing experience paths. The resulting solution includes a uniform semantic model, a corresponding semantic database for the knowledge, a distribution server for semantic knowledge and media, and the MyStoryPlayer Client for web applications.", "paper_title": "MyStoryPlayer: experiencing multiple audiovisual content for education and training", "paper_id": "WOS:000360377200036"}
