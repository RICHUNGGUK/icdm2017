This framework specifically focuses on activity recognition using on-body accelerometer sensors. We present a novel interactive knowledge discovery tool for accelerometry in human activity recognition and study the sensitivity to the feature extraction parametrization. Results: The implemented framework achieved encouraging results in human activity recognition. We have implemented a new set of features extracted from wearable sensors that are ambitious from a computational point of view and able to ensure high classification results comparable with the state of the art wearable systems (Mannini et al. 2013). A feature selection framework is developed in order to improve the clustering accuracy and reduce computational complexity.(1) Several clustering methods such as K-Means, Affinity Propagation, Mean Shift and Spectral Clustering were applied. The K-means methodology presented promising accuracy results for person-dependent and independent cases, with 99.29% and 88.57%, respectively. Conclusions: The presented study performs two different tests in intra and inter subject context and a set of 180 features is implemented which are easily selected to classify different activities. The implemented algorithm does not stipulate, a priori, any value for time window or its overlap percentage of the signal but performs a search to find the best parameters that define the specific data. A clustering metric based on the construction of the data confusion matrix is also proposed. The main contribution of this work is the design of a novel gesture recognition system based solely on data from a single 3-dimensional accelerometer.
