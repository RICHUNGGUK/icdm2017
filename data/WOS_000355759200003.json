During design optimization, the panel mass and the radiated acoustic power are the two objectives to be minimized while satisfying constraints on buckling, von Mises stress and crippling. Based on the concept of plane wave propagation, a diffuse acoustic field is developed for use along with a finite element model. To represent the panel's structural behavior, the dynamic analysis of the panel is performed for the developed diffuse acoustic excitation and the radiated acoustic power is calculated using the velocities obtained from the dynamic analysis. A baseline design is obtained by optimization study with mass as an objective to be minimized while constraints are put on buckling, von Mises stress and crippling. The obtained baseline grid stiffened panel is used for a comparative study of a panel with curvilinear stiffeners in vibro-acoustics with diffuse sound field as the source of the excitation.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective vibro-acoustic optimization of stiffened panels", "paper_id": "WOS:000355759200003"}
