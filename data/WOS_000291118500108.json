This paper proposes a \"fuzzy expected value approach\" for data envelopment analysis (DEA) in which fuzzy inputs and fuzzy outputs are first weighted, respectively, and their expected values then used to measure the optimistic and pessimistic efficiencies of decision making units (DMUs) in fuzzy environments. The two efficiencies are finally geometrically averaged for the purposes of ranking and identifying the best performing DMU. The proposed fuzzy expected value approach and its resultant models are illustrated with three numerical examples, including the selection of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS).
