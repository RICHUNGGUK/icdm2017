In this paper, a multi-hop heterogeneous cluster-based optimization algorithm (MHCOA) for WSNs is proposed. The motivation to MHCOA for WSNs is that several higher energy sensor nodes act as cluster heads, which are deployed artificially, while some low energy sensor nodes act as cluster members, which are deployed randomly. In order to realize monitoring task, we complete three major works in this paper. First, MHCOA calculates the number of cluster heads and communication radius of low energy sensor nodes; Second, it finishes monitoring task through data packets transmission with higher energy nodes acting as cluster heads in the form of multi-hop heterogeneous WSNs; Finally, simulation results show that compared to its peers in heterogeneous WSNs, MHCOA reduces the number of cluster heads, which saves the network average energy by up to 16.7 % and extends the network life by up to 38 %, while with less end-to-end delay.", "paper_title": "A multi-hop heterogeneous cluster-based optimization algorithm for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000347777300005"}
