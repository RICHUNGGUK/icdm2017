Deciding on the right coordination method for ASM when executing a given mission in an arbitrary environment can be a huge obstacle. Providing the system with some kind of Artificial Intelligence (Al) to deal with the dynamics of a given task would be highly recommended. In this paper, an evolutionary process has been employed in a behavior-based system to generate a suitable ASM based on a system's mission scenario. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to train the weights of a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) feed-forward artificial neural network in identifying a suitable formulation of ASM. Implementation of such systems in a target tracking mission has shown positive results. Depending on the mission scenario, the evolved ASM can dynamically manage the coordination method in order to achieve the overall system objective. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
