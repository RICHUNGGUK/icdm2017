During the analysis of the visual scene, the retrieval phase of the associative memory is divided into two stages: the attention stage and the binding stage. In the attention stage, an attention window selects patterns representing objects for further access. In the binding stage, the selected patterns form an address vector. The behavior of the model is demonstrated by theoretical analysis and empirical experiment.", "paper_title": "The Role of Attention in the Context of Associative Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000292777700023"}
