From a more practical point of view, this means that in linear elasticity, a separation of variables ansatz can be used for the displacements in a scaled boundary coordinate system. This approach allows an analytical treatment of the problem in the scaling direction. Only the boundary needs to be discretized with finite elements. Employment of the separation of variables ansatz in the virtual work balance yields a Cauchy-Euler differential equation system of second order which can be transformed into an eigenvalue problem and solved by standard eigenvalue solvers for nonsymmetric matrices. A further obtained linear equation system serves for enforcing the boundary conditions. If the scaling center is located directly at a singular point, elliptic boundary value problems containing singularities can be solved with high accuracy and computational efficiency. The application of the SBFEM to the linear elasticity problem of two meeting inter-fiber cracks in a composite laminate exposed to a simple homogeneous temperature decrease reveals the presence of hypersingular stresses.
