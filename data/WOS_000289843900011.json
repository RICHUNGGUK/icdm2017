In fact, as technology shrinks, the power contribute of NoC links starts to compete with that of NoC routers. In this paper, we propose the use of data encoding techniques as a viable way to reduce both power dissipation and energy consumption of NoC links. The proposed encoding scheme exploits the wormhole switching techniques and works on an end-to-end basis. That is, flits are encoded by the network interface (NI) before they are injected in the network and are decoded by the destination NI. This makes the scheme transparent to the underlying network since the encoder and decoder logic is integrated in the NI and no modification of the routers architecture is required. We assess the proposed encoding scheme on a set of representative data streams (both synthetic and extracted from real applications) showing that it is possible to reduce the power contribution of both the self-switching activity and the coupling switching activity in inter-routers links. As results, we obtain a reduction in total power dissipation and energy consumption up to 37% and 18%, respectively, without any significant degradation in terms of both performance and silicon area.", "paper_title": "Data Encoding Schemes in Networks on Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000289843900011"}
