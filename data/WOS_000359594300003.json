The authors explain how to unlock the CPUs' computing power without slowing down other tasks related to data movement. By solving the representative diffusion equation using the cell-centered finite volume method, the authors demonstrate that combining the computing capacity of CPUs and GPUs delivers a performance advantage over the GPU-only approach.", "paper_title": "SCALABLE HETEROGENEOUS CPU-GPU COMPUTATIONS FOR UNSTRUCTURED TETRAHEDRAL MESHES", "paper_id": "WOS:000359594300003"}
