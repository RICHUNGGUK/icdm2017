The LCA tree includes the left main coronary artery, the left anterior descending branch, the left circumflex branch and their major branches. Spatial differentiation indicates that low values of WP (locally), WPG, WSS, WSSG and high molecular viscosity appear opposite flow dividers and this probably correlates to atherosclerosis localization.
