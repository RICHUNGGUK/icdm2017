Systems that fail to acquire and share the context required for some topic are likely to fail to communicate successfully about that topic. Software systems populating an open medium such as the Web are unlikely to have been designed or otherwise prepared to communicate with each other, so if they are to communicate they face this challenge of acquiring and sharing the necessary context. We consider this situation for software systems implemented as meme media objects that contain representations of human knowledge, The mentioned acquisition can be understood as an enhancement of the knowledge representation they contain. Thus we consider establishing successful communication among meme media objects on the Web as an instance of knowledge evolution. The paper provides a conceptual framework for studying knowledge evolution. That framework is based on a particular interpretation of the concept of model. We give an example of use of the framework in an e-learning case study within a medical context.", "paper_title": "Towards understanding meme media knowledge evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000236905700011"}
