Then, 1P-FOPAs performance comparison among PCF, dispersion-shifted fiber (DSF) and highly nonlinear fibers (HNLF) are carried out by numerical simulations. It is shown that the 1P-FOPA based on triangular PCF can provide higher peak gain over wider bandwidth. When the pump wavelength is at the zero-dispersion wavelength (ZDWL), about 108.7 nm single-pass gain bandwidth and 91.4 dB peak gain can be obtained; when in the normal dispersion regime and near zero-dispersion wavelength, not less than 46 nm single-pass gain bandwidth 77.1 nm away from pump can be achieved. Finally the influence of dispersion fluctuation is analyzed, and the result shows that the tolerance of the 1P-FOPA based on photonic crystal fiber is better.", "paper_title": "Numerical analysis of fiber optical parameter amplifier based on triangular photonic crystal fiber", "paper_id": "WOS:000268192800020"}
