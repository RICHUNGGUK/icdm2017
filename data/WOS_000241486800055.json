Training samples obtained from an industrial marker based tracking system are used for a nonparametric Parzen density estimation in the 12-dimensional joint configuration space. These learned probability densities constrain the image-driven joint angle estimates by drawing solutions towards familiar configurations. This prevents the method from producing unrealistic pose estimates due to unreliable image cues. Experiments on sequences with a human leg model reveal a considerably increased robustness, particularly in the presence of disturbed images and occlusions.", "paper_title": "Nonparametric density estimation for human pose tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000241486800055"}
