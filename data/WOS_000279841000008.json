We hypothesized and empirically tested our belief that hard decision making in conventional development projects is very similar to GSD and differences arise from the nature of the relationship and the ranking of issues. Findings from a Delphi study illustrated our approach and shed some light into the management of GSD teams.", "paper_title": "A Qualitative Study of Hard Decision Making in Managing Global Software Development Teams", "paper_id": "WOS:000279841000008"}
