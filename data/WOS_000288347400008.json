These segmentation techniques have been developed up to now with a contour coding term adapted to polygonal objects. However, this approach can lead to degraded segmentation results for smooth contours of objects which can be observed for example in geoscience, medicine or microscopy. We demonstrate that an appropriate choice of the contour coding term can improve segmentation results with MDL active grid approaches in the presence of regions with smooth boundaries. This improvement opens a large class of application domains and still allows one to obtain low computational time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
