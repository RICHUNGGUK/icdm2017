This paper discusses structural-complexity issues of one-tape Turing machines of various types (deterministic, nondeterministic, reversible, alternating, probabilistic, counting, and quantum Turing machines) that halt in linear time, where the running time of a machine is defined as the length of any longest computation path. We explore structural properties of one-tape linear-time Turing machines and clarify flow the machines' resources affect their computational patterns and power. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
