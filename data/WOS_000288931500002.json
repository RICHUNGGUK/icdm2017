We give an explicit construction of an (n - o(n))-mixed Boolean function whose circuit complexity over the basis U(2) is 5n + o(n). This shows that a lower bound method for the size of a U2 circuit that applies to arbitrary well-mixed functions, which yields the largest known lower bound of 5n - o(n) for the U(2)-circuit size (Mama, Lachish, Morizumi and Raz [STOC01, MFCS02]), has reached the limit.
