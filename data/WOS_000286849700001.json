In order to assist the development of multi-agent systems, agent-oriented methodologies (AOM) have been created in the last years to support modelling more and more complex applications. Even though agents are perceived as autonomous entities that act according to some objectives, they are also members of a society, and have to exchange information with other agents and maintain some relationships at an organizational level. Modern AOMs should be able to capture and represent organizational structures, defining interaction and collaboration patterns between agents, their internal roles and dependencies between groups of agents. This paper analyses the most notable AOMs, paying attention to the support and possibilities that they offer for modelling organizational structures with different levels of complexity. This work can help developers to select the most appropriate methodology taking into account the social and organizational requirements of the multi-agent system to be deployed.
