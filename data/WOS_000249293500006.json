Despite that a plethora of work has been done in designing energy efficient protocols for sensor networks, the time-varying nature of wireless channel is largely unexplored. Indeed. we believe that a cross-layer design on power aware communication is necessary to further optimize energy usage. In this paper, we propose a new channel adaptive power aware protocol, called CAEM, which works by dynamically adjusting the data throughput under different channel conditions with the help of an adaptive channel coding and modulation facility. Each sensor device judiciously accesses the wireless medium in that communication activity is reduced for devices under poor channel conditions. Simulation results indicate that the proposed CAEM protocol can lead to energy conservation by as much as 30 percent. Furthermore, CAEM is also efficient in channel utilization as it generates a higher data throughput even under heavy traffic load.
