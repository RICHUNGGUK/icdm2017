A detailed analysis of the finite element method is presented including an explicit form for the discrete dispersion relation and a complete characterisation of the numerical Bloch waves admitted by the scheme. A comparison is made with the spectral element method and the discontinuous Galerkin method with centred fluxes. It is shown that all schemes admit a spurious mode. The spectral element method is always inferior to the finite element and discontinuous Galerkin schemes; a somewhat surprising result in view of the fact that, in the case of the second order wave equation, the spectral element method propagates waves with an accuracy superior to that of the finite element scheme. The comparative behaviour of the finite element and discontinuous Galerkin scheme is also somewhat surprising: the accuracy of the finite element method is superior to that of the discontinuous Galerkin method in the case of elements of odd order by two orders of accuracy, but worse, again by two orders of accuracy, in the case of elements of even order.
