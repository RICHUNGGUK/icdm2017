In the existed methods which solve these chemically reacting systems with delays, averaging over a great deal of simulations is needed for reliable statistical characters. Here we present an accelerating approach, called the \"Delay Final All Possible Steps\" (DFAPS) approach, which does not alter the course of stochastic simulation, but reduces the required running times. Numerical simulation results indicate that the proposed method can be applied to a wide range of chemically reacting systems with delays and obtain a significant improvement on efficiency and accuracy over the existed methods.
