Most architectures of wireless sensor networks (WSN) are built as homogeneous networks, where all sensor nodes have the same structure. But it is not suitable for cluster-based WSN. By using multi-antenna sensor node (MASN) as the cluster head (CH), we import multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) and single-input-multi-output (SIMO) communication modes into WSN. In this network scenario, tremendous energy saving is possible when transmission range is larger than a given threshold. This paper motivates and describes the realization of the inhomogeneous network, special communication scheme and simulation of energy consumption and delay model of it.", "paper_title": "MIMO techniques in cluster-based wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100038"}
