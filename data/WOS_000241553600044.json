This photograph is used as a reference for each revision of the diagnosis or the therapeutic plan. This article presents the results of the evaluation of various fuzzy clustering algorithms applied to the segmentation of burn wounds images. The study compares recent and classical algorithms in order to establish a better comparison between the benefits of more complex techniques for pixel classification. Our final purpose is to develop a module that provides the medical expert with information on the extension of the burned area.", "paper_title": "Analysis of fuzzy clustering algorithms for the segmentation of burn wounds photographs", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600044"}
