Most researches focus on static systems, which require a clear and level image to be taken of the license plate. However, the acquisition of images that can be successfully analyzed relies on both the location and movement of the target vehicle and the clarity of the environment. Moreover, only few studies have addressed the problems associated with instant car image processing. In view of these problems, a real-time license plate recognition system is proposed that recognizes the video frames taken from existing surveillance cameras. The proposed system finds the location of the license plate using projection analysis, and the characters are identified using a back propagation neural network. The strategy achieves a recognition rate of 85.8% and almost 100% after the neural network has been retrained using the erroneously recognized characters, respectively.", "paper_title": "A back propagation based real-time license plate recognition system", "paper_id": "WOS:000254293000002"}
