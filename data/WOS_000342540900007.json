Exploitation of sub-wavelength domain based on emerging optical technology is attractive from a functional and performance perspective but its feasibility must be proven also in relation to the costs of components. In this paper a new methodology to compare optical switching matrices based on different wavelength converters sharing strategies is presented, which introduces component cost evolution in time. The methodology is applied to compare different switch configurations by taking into account possible evolution in component costs relationship in relation to technology availability. Design guidelines are drawn based on extensive simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
