Therefore, an extensive measurement campaign of 50 GHz wide indoor radio channels is presented for the frequencies between 275 and 325 GHz. Individual ray paths are resolved spatially according to angle of arrival and departure. A MIMO channel is recorded in a 2x2 configuration. An advanced frequency domain ray tracing approach is used to deterministically simulate the THz indoor propagation channel. The ray tracing results are validated with the measurement data. Moreover, the measurements are utilized for the calibration of the ray tracing algorithm. Resulting ray tracing accuracies are discussed.", "paper_title": "Ultra Broadband Indoor Channel Measurements and Calibrated Ray Tracing Propagation Modeling at THz Frequencies", "paper_id": "WOS:000335833600002"}
