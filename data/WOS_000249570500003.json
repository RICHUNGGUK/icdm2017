This paper concerns the following four quantities.. The finite-state dimension dim(FS)(CEk(A)), a finite-state version of classical Hausdorff dimension introduced in 2001. The finite-state strong dimension DimFS (CEk (A)), a finite-state version of classical packing dimension introduced in 2004. This is a dual of dimFS(CEk(A)) satisfying DimFS(CEk(A)) >= dimFS(CEk(A)). The zeta-dimension Dim (A), a kind of discrete fractal dimension discovered many times over the past few decades. The lower zeta-dimension dim(zeta)(A), a dual of Dim(zeta)(A) satisfying dim(zeta)(A) <= Dim(zeta)(A). We prove the following. (1) dimFS(CEk(A)) >= dim (A). This extends the 1946 proof by Copeland and Erdos that the sequence CEk(PRIMES) is Borel normal. (2) Dim(FS)(CEk(A)) >= Dim(zeta)(A). (3) These bounds are tight in the strong sense that these four quantities can have (simultaneously) any four values in [0,1] satisfying the four above-mentioned inequalities. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
