The RBF model is used for regression analysis tasks. The novel aspect of the proposed protocol lies to the fact that it assumes a malicious user model and does not use homomorphic cryptographic methods, which are inherently only suited for a semi-trusted user environment. The performance analysis shows that the communication overhead is low enough to warranty its use while the computational complexity is identical in most cases with the centralized computation scenario (e.g. a trusted third party). The accuracy of the output model is only marginally subpar to a centralized computation on the union of all datasets.", "paper_title": "Privacy Preserving Data Mining Using Radial Basis Functions on Horizontally Partitioned Databases in the Malicious Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000344398600004"}
