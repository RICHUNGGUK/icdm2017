Furthermore, we show that by swapping the arguments of the Eta pairing, one obtains a very efficient algorithm resulting in a speed-up of a factor of around six over the usual Tate pairing, in the case of curves that have large security parameters, complex multiplication by an order of Q(root-3), and when the trace of Frobenius is chosen to be suitably small. Other, more minor savings are obtained for more general curves.", "paper_title": "The Eta pairing revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000240776500018"}
