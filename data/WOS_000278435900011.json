This paper presents a three-tier, 3-D 192-kB cache for a 3-D processor-memory stack. The chip is designed and fabricated in a 0.18 mu m fully depleted SOI CMOS process. An ultra wide data bus for connecting the 3-D cache with the microprocessor is implemented using dense vertical vias between the stacked wafers. The fabricated cache operates at 500 MHz and achieves up to 96 GB/s aggregate bandwidth at the output.", "paper_title": "A 3-D Cache With Ultra-Wide Data Bus for 3-D Processor-Memory Integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000278435900011"}
