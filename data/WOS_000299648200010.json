We establish an injective mapping between one complementary rule and two secret bits in a message. Based on this mapping mechanism, the proposed scheme can effectively hide two secret bits in a message by replacing one character. This approach can greatly improve the embedding capacity in data hiding. Robustness and security analyses show that the probability of an attacker's making a successful recovery of the hidden data is negligible. According to the experimental results, the proposed scheme has a stable and efficient embedding capacity with a low modification rate, and the fake DNA sequence does not need to expand the length of the reference DNA sequence.", "paper_title": "A NEW DATA HIDING SCHEME BASED ON DNA SEQUENCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000299648200010"}
