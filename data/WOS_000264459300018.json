The purpose of this paper (Part I of M is to prevent the contradiction in physics due to this paradox. Design/methodology/approach - Both physical considerations and neuropsychological considerations are applied. Findings - The physical considerations imply that assuming multidimensionality of time prevents Feynman's paradox and additional physical paradoxes. This multidimensionality in explained by neuropsychological considerations. Practical implications - A suggested method of obtaining unlimited quantity of clean energy based on the principle of annihilating matter and antimatter is presented in Part II. Originality/value - This theory is entirely new. Its; approach is different from that of other approaches to the multidimensionality of time.", "paper_title": "Cybernetical physics Part I: \"Feynman's paradox\" and its implications", "paper_id": "WOS:000264459300018"}
