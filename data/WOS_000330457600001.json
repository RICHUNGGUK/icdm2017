Most of the existing solutions to this problem aim to find as many barrier sets as possible to enhance coverage for the target area, which did not consider the power conservation. In this paper, we address the efficient sensor deployment (ESD) problem and energy-efficient barrier coverage (EEBC) problem for directional sensor networks. First, we describe a deployment model for the distribution of sensor locations to analyze whether a target area can be barrier covered. By this model, we examine the relationship between the probability of barrier coverage and network deployment parameters. Moreover, we model the EEBC as an optimization problem. An efficient scheduling algorithm is proposed to prolong the network lifetime when the target area is barrier covered. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of this algorithm.", "paper_title": "Optimal Deployment and Scheduling with Directional Sensors for Energy-Efficient Barrier Coverage", "paper_id": "WOS:000330457600001"}
