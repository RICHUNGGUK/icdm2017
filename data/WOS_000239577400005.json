Unlike lowpass pre-processing approaches to the LP enlargement method, an embedded approach is used in this paper. Since the amplitude of Gaussian noise signals is smaller than the amplitude of image edge signals in the predicted LP stage, we adopt a modified E-filter in the proposed LP enlargement algorithm to reduce the Gaussian noise. Experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain high accuracy denoise enlarged images.", "paper_title": "Enlargement for images with Gaussian noise by embedded filtering in the LP algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000239577400005"}
