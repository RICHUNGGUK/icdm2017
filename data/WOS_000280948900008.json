Toward this objective, the study goes through three phases. First, a cluster-based scheme is exploited. At every sampling instant, only one cluster of sensors that located in the proximity of the target is activated, whereas the other sensors are inactive. To activate the most appropriate cluster, we propose a nonmyopic rule, which is based on not only the target state prediction but also its future tendency. Second, the variational filtering algorithm is capable of precise tracking even in the highly nonlinear case. Furthermore, since the measurement incorporation and the approximation of the filtering distribution are jointly performed by variational calculus, an effective and lossless compression is achieved. The intercluster information exchange is thus reduced to one single Gaussian statistic, dramatically cutting down the resource consumption. Third, a binary proximity observation model is employed by the activated slave sensors to reduce the energy consumption and to minimize the intracluster communication. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of tracking accuracy, internode communication, and computation complexity.", "paper_title": "Decentralized Variational Filtering for Target Tracking in Binary Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280948900008"}
