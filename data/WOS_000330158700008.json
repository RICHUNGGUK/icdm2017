This paper proposes an integrated approach, based on formal graph-based models and methods, to handle both of these tasks. The introduced formalisms help handle the state-space explosion related to the aforementioned characteristics. Control is performed by means of AI techniques (including rule-based systems and pattern matching), which is applied to the system using graph transformations. An illustrative, simple example is carried out throughout the paper, but the presented methods are highly scalable, which made them applicable to several practical projects of varying scale and characteristics.
