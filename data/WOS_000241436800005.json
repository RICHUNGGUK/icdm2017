Runs correspond to locally consistent markings and acceptance is defined by means, of regular conditions on the paths emanating from the root. Comparing the expressive power of these two notions of graph acceptors, we show that E-automata are more expressive than V-automata. Moreover, we prove that E-automata are at least as expressive as the M-calculus. Our main result implies that every MSO-definable tree language can be recognised by E-automata with uniform runs, that is, runs that do not distinguish between isomorphic subtrees.", "paper_title": "Automata on directed graphs: Edge versus vertex marking", "paper_id": "WOS:000241436800005"}
