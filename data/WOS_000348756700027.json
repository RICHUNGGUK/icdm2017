Employing a weakly compressible framework, the method is simple, mass conserving and capable of handling flows with large density and viscosity ratios and high surface tension. Since the viscosity jump at the material interface is directly imposed by an interface-flux term, momentum conservation is ensured when capillary effects are absent. Furthermore, a subcell-resolution method for volume-fraction evaluation is developed to achieve accurate interface reconstruction. A number of two and three dimensional numerical examples, are considered to demonstrate that the present method is able to simulate a wide range of flow problems with good robustness and high accuracy.
