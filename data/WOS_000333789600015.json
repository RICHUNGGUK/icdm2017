The primary objective of the methodology is to assist therapists by allowing them to delegate repetitive therapy tasks to a mechatronic system. The trajectory generator is packaged as a platform-independent solution to facilitate the rehabilitation of patients using multiple manipulator configurations. The system utilizes a fuzzy-logic schema to introduce compliance into the human-robot interaction, and to allow the emulation of a wide variety of therapy techniques. This approach also allows for the fine-tuning of patient specific behaviour using linguistic variables. The rule base for the system is trained using a fuzzy clustering algorithm and applied to the experimental data gathered during traditional therapy sessions. The compliance rule base is combined with a hybrid neuro-fuzzy compensator to automatically tune the dynamics of the robot-patient interaction. Preliminary results indicate that the approach can accurately reproduce a prescribed patient/therapist interaction, validating the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
