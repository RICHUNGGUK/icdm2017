Typically, scientific workflows are both compute- and data-intensive, and often require dynamic execution control mechanisms. We present a service-oriented infrastructure that addresses these challenges by seamlessly integrating grid computing technologies with a Cloud infrastructure to support the scheduling of dynamic scientific workflows. A case study implementing a complex scientific workflow for computing photodynamics of biologically relevant molecules, a simulation of the non-adiabatic dynamics of 2,4-pentadieneiminum-cation (Protonated Schiff Base 3 (PSB3)) solvated in Water, is realised via the presented infrastructure.", "paper_title": "A grid services cloud for molecular modelling workflows", "paper_id": "WOS:000281023300005"}
