It has been therefore frequently associated with informal learning or learning outside the classroom. Cloud technologies can play an important role supporting this type of learning, since it requires ubiquitous computing support, connectivity and access to data across various scenarios: on the field, in the classroom, at home, etc. In this paper we first present the situated learning theory and how we can take advantage of services offered by Cloud Computing to implement computer applications implementing learning activities based on this theory, providing pertinent geographical information and discussion boards. Next we propose a software architecture schema which can be used as a basis for integrating existing cloud services into new applications supporting learning activities. Then we present two examples developed with this approach with its viability and advantages. These are discussed in the concluding chapter. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
