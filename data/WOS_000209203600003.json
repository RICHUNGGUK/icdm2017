An improved skin tone detection model is proposed based on the Gaussian function, which could generate an accurate initial contour for C-V model. As the single Gaussian model (SGM) only uses the prior information to determine the likelihood of a pixel, it lacks adaptability for an image with lighting and poses variances. A more adaptive SGM (ASGM) is proposed in this paper that, by updating the model parameters according to the input image, could provide a more stable approximation of face region. And then, we apply the estimated initial contour to C-V model for precise face segmentation. Tests conducted on a public face dataset (220 images with pose and illumination changes) have shown that the accuracy of skin region detected by ASGM is at a ratio higher than 99%, which lays a good foundation for further segmentation by the C-V model. Extensive experiments have validated effectiveness and efficiency of our system in face segmentation.", "paper_title": "A robust framework for face contour detection from clutter background", "paper_id": "WOS:000209203600003"}
