To attain efficiency we use a special representation of the pattern graph. We also combine our search algorithm with some known bisection algorithms. Experimental comparison with other algorithms was performed on several types of graphs. The comparison results suggest that the approach provided here is most effective when all instances of a subgraph need to be found.", "paper_title": "Subsea: an efficient heuristic algorithm for subgraph isomorphism", "paper_id": "WOS:000270324200002"}
