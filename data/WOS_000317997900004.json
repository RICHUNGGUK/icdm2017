When designing a conference scheme for mobile communications it should be taken into account that the mobile users are typically using portable devices with limited computing capability. Moreover, wireless communications are more susceptible to eavesdropping and unauthorized access than conversations via wires. Based on elliptic curve cryptography, this article proposes a secure mobile conference scheme which allows a participant to join or quit a teleconference dynamically. Without any interactive protocol among participants are required to construct the common key. This can save on communication overhead.", "paper_title": "Efficient Mobile Conference Scheme for Wireless Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000317997900004"}
