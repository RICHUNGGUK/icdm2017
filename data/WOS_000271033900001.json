Shortages are not allowed and the effect of the inflation rate, deterioration rate and delay in payment are discussed as well. As a result, in this article, we establish a mathematical model to determine the optimal payment period and replenishment cycle. Using Taylor series approximation, we characterise the optimal solution and provide an easy-to-use algorithm to find the optimal solution. Finally, the proposed models are illustrated through numerical examples and the sensitivity analysis is reported.", "paper_title": "Optimal payment time with deteriorating items under inflation and permissible delay in payments", "paper_id": "WOS:000271033900001"}
