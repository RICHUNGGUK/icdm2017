An example is SIMBA (SIMulator for Business Administration), a powerful simulator which is currently used as a web-based platform for business education in different institutions. In this paper, we propose the application of reinforcement learning (RL) for the creation of intelligent agents that can manage virtual companies in SIMBA. This application is not trivial, given the particular intrinsic characteristics of SIMBA: it is a generalized domain where hundreds of parameters modify the domain behavior; it is a multi-agent domain where both cooperation and competition among different agents can coexist; it is required to set dozens of continuous decision variables for a given business decision, which is made only after the study of hundreds of continuous variables. We will demonstrate empirically that all these challenges can be overcome through the use of RL, showing results for different learning scenarios.", "paper_title": "REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR DECISION-MAKING IN A BUSINESS SIMULATOR", "paper_id": "WOS:000311164400004"}
