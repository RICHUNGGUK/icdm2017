By using the Hamilton-Caylay Theorem, an operator is constructed such that tracking problem is converted into a standard stabilisation problem. A control law is designed such that the output signal of the closed-loop system tracks some reference signal and rejects the disturbances. A second-order LDI system is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design technique.", "paper_title": "Output tracking and disturbance rejection of linear differential inclusion systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000309129000008"}
