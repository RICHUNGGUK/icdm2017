In frequency division duplexing systems, channel quantization is applied for reporting channel state information (CSI). Considering the dynamic number of cooperation base stations (BSs), asymmetry feature of CoMP channels and high searching complexity, simply increasing the size of the codebook used in traditional multiple antenna systems to quantize the global CSI of CoMP systems directly is infeasible. Per-cell codebook based channel quantization to quantize local CSI for each BS separately is an effective method. In this paper, the theoretical upper bounds of system throughput are derived for two codeword selection schemes, independent codeword selection (ICS) and joint codeword selection (JCS), respectively. The feedback overhead and selection complexity of these two schemes are analyzed. In the simulation, the system throughput of ICS and JCS is compared. Both analysis and simulation results show that JCS has a better tradeoff between system throughput and feedback overhead. The ICS has obvious advantage in complexity, but it needs additional phase information (PI) feedback for obtaining the approximate system throughput with JCS. Under the same number of feedback bits constraint, allocating the number of bits for channel direction information (CDI) and PI quantization can increase the system throughput, but ICS is still inferior to JCS. Based on theoretical analysis and simulation results, some recommendations are given with regard to the application of each scheme respectively.", "paper_title": "Research on Per-cell Codebook based Channel Quantization for CoMP Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000338846200001"}
