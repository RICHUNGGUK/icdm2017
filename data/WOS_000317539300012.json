In the new version, we have implemented the following features: (i) the modified Broyden method for non-linear problems, (ii) optional breaking of reflection symmetry, (iii) calculation of axial multipole moments, (iv) finite temperature formalism for the HFB method, (v) linear constraint method based on the approximation of the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) matrix for multi-constraint calculations, (vi) blocking of quasi-particles in the Equal Filling Approximation (EFA), (vii) framework for generalized energy density with arbitrary density-dependences, and (viii) shared memory parallelism via OpenMP pragmas. Program summary Program title: HFBTHO v2.00d Catalog identifier: ADUI_v2_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ADUI_v2_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License version 3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 167228 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 2672156 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: FORTRAN-95. Computer: Intel Pentium-III, Intel Xeon, AMD-Athlon, AMD-Opteron, Cray XT5, Cray XE6. Operating system: UNIX, LINUX, WindowsXP. RAM: 200 Mwords Word size: 8 bits Classification: 17.22. Does the new version supercede the previous version?: Yes Catalog identifier of previous version: ADUI_v1_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 167 (2005) 43 Nature of problem: The solution of self-consistent mean-field equations for weakly-bound paired nuclei requires a correct description of the asymptotic properties of nuclear quasi-particle wave functions. In the present implementation, this is achieved by using the single-particle wave functions of the transformed harmonic oscillator, which allows for an accurate description of deformation effects and pairing correlations in nuclei arbitrarily close to the particle drip lines. Solution method: The program uses the axial Transformed Harmonic Oscillator (THO) single- particle basis to expand quasi-particle wave functions. It iteratively diagonalizes the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Hamiltonian based on generalized Skyrme-like energy densities and zero-range pairing interactions until a self-consistent solution is found. A previous version of the program was presented in: M.V. Stoitsov, J. Dobaczewski, W. Nazarewicz, P. Ring, Comput. Phys. Commun. 167 (2005) 43-63. Reasons for new version: Version 2.00d of HFBTHO provides a number of new options such as the optional breaking of reflection symmetry, the calculation of axial multipole moments, the finite temperature formalism for the HFB method, optimized multi-constraint calculations, the treatment of odd-even and odd-odd nuclei in the blocking approximation, and the framework for generalized energy density with arbitrary density-dependences. It is also the first version of HFBTHO to contain threading capabilities. Summary of revisions: 1. The modified Broyden method has been implemented, 2. Optional breaking of reflection symmetry has been implemented, 3. The calculation of all axial multipole moments up to lambda = 8 has been implemented, 4. The finite temperature formalism for the HFB method has been implemented, 5. The linear constraint method based on the approximation of the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) matrix for multi-constraint calculations has been implemented, 6. The blocking of quasi-particles in the Equal Filling Approximation (EFA) has been implemented, 7. The framework for generalized energy density functionals with arbitrary density-dependence has been implemented, 8. Shared memory parallelism via OpenMP pragmas has been implemented. Restrictions: Axial- and time-reversal symmetries are assumed. Unusual features: The user must have access to (i) the LAPACK subroutines. DSYEVD, DSYTRF and DSYTRI, and their dependences, which compute eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices, (ii) the LAPACK subroutines DGETRI and DGETRF, which invert arbitrary real matrices, and (iii) the BLAS routines DCOPY, DSCAL, DGEMM and DGEMV for double-precision linear algebra (or provide another set of subroutines that can perform such tasks). The BLAS and LAPACK subroutines can be obtained from the Netlib Repository at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville: http://netlib2.cs.utk.edu/. Running time: Highly variable, as it depends on the nucleus, size of the basis, requested accuracy, requested configuration, compiler and libraries, and hardware architecture. An order of magnitude would be a few seconds for ground-state configurations in small bases N-max approximate to 8 - 12, to a few minutes in very deformed configuration of a heavy nucleus with a large basis N-max > 20.
