To effectively deal with the timing constraints of context-aware systems, a methodology must be developed specifying the causal relationship between the contexts and timing aspect. To date, this issue has not yet been adequately addressed. In this paper, we propose a new modeling methodology which effectively represents the timing variation of contexts by extending interval timed colored Petri net. We also propose a technique determining if a service is able to satisfy the timing requirement. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a collision avoidance service provided to moving vehicles.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Analysis of Time-Critical Context-Aware Service Using Extended Interval Timed Colored Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000303068200009"}
