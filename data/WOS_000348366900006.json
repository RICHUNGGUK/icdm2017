Firstly, traversability analysis of the lunar surface is studied based on the weighted least squares method and fuzzy computing. Secondly, a polar coordinates histogram is built around the rover to measure the traversability to enable selection of the optimal driving direction. Thirdly, a longitudinal traction coordinating controller based on sliding mode theory and a latitudinal trajectory tracking controller based on optimal theory are proposed to follow the desired path. Finally, a six-wheel lunar rover with Rocker Bogie model is established in ADAMS software, and co-simulation between ADAMS and MATLAB/Simulink are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Traversability based obstacle avoidance path-planning and path-following control for lunar rover", "paper_id": "WOS:000348366900006"}
