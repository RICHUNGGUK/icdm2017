An adaptive method is developed in order to improve both accuracy and computational time in the resolution of nonlinear problems. Finally, several numerical simulations are discussed in relation to the development of this kind of high-order adaptive methods for unstable thermo-hydraulic systems. (C) 2011 IMACS.
