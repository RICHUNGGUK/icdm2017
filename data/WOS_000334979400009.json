A new formulation for the transformation from global to local quantities for the cohesive law is presented. This formulation works as a generic shell around any cohesive law so that the cohesive law needs only to be implemented in two dimensions while it can be used in both two and three dimensional analysis. Particular attention is paid to consistent linearization of the contribution from the cohesive tractions. The proposed formulation is tested on three relevant examples of three-dimensional analysis.
