The proposed algorithm not only keeps the characters of simple and easy to be implemented, but also enhances the ability of getting rid of local optimum and improves the speed and precision of convergence. The testing results of several benchmark functions with different dimensions show that the proposed algorithm is superior to standard PSO and the other PSO algorithms.", "paper_title": "A new hybrid algorithm of particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400006"}
