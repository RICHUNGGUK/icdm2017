Mobile nodes communicate with each other using multihop wireless links. Each mobile node in the network also acts as a router, which forwards data packets to other nodes. A main challenge in the design of this mobile network is the development of dynamic routing protocols that can efficiently find routes between two communicating nodes that often change the network topology drastically and unpredictably. All communications between the nodes inside the mobile network and the global Internet must be maintained, although the mobile router (MR) connecting the other mobile network to the global Internet must change their address; and mobile nodes suffer from end-to-end delay and handoff delay. That is to say, hereafter the packets sailing for the mobile node would not be routed directly for the destination, but will always make a detour by way of HA to the target node. In this paper, we suggest Information-based Connection Algorithm that adds keyword management method in order to resolve such a problem, simulations are carried out with NS-2 for performance evaluation. The results of the simulations show an improvement on throughput and handoff delay, and consequently the QoS improvement.", "paper_title": "Information-based connection algorithm for supporting QoS in nested mobility network", "paper_id": "WOS:000265047300006"}
