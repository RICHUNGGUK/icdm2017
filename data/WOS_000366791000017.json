We tackle this challenge through the joint modeling of a large set of diseases and a large set of clinical observations. The observations are drawn directly from heterogeneous patient record data (notes, laboratory tests, medications, and diagnosis codes), and the diseases are modeled in an unsupervised fashion. We apply UPhenome to two qualitatively different mixtures of patients and diseases: records of extremely sick patients in the intensive care unit with constant monitoring, and records of outpatients regularly followed by care providers over multiple years. We demonstrate that the UPhenome model can learn from these different care settings, without any additional adaptation. Our experiments show that (i) the learned phenotypes combine the heterogeneous data types more coherently than baseline LDA-based phenotypes; (ii) they each represent single diseases rather than a mix of diseases more often than the baseline ones; and (iii) when applied to unseen patient records, they are correlated with the patients' ground-truth disorders. Code for training, inference, and quantitative evaluation is made available to the research community. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
