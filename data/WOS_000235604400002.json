Currently used PCR-based approaches for determination of transgene location are relatively complicated and often fail when the transgene is duplicated, rearranged or fragmented. HideNseek is a new bioinformatics tool that allows computation of transgene locations, provided that a suitable genomic restriction enzyme digestion profile is available. Since the new approach is not based on the terminal sequences of the transgene insert, it is less sensitive to transgene duplication, rearrangement or fragmentation. HideNseek has been tested experimentally and by in silico simulation. The experimental example provided here shows that this simple approach is feasible, permitting rapid location of transgenes with little bench work.
