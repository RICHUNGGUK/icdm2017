However, a non-negligible influence of backpressure on the macro mechanical properties of methane-hydrate-bearing-sediments (MHBS) has been surprisingly observed in several recent experiments reported in the literature. This paper aims to shed light on this phenomenon. A theoretical analysis on the microscopic interaction between soil grains and inter-particle methane hydrate (MH) was carried out to highlight how backpressure affects the mechanical properties of the inter-particle MH which in turn affect the macroscopic mechanical behavior of MHBS. The influence of backpressure is accounted for in a new bond contact model implemented into the Distinct Element Method (DEM). Then, a series of DEM biaxial compression tests were run to investigate the link between mechanical properties of MHBS and backpressure. The DEM numerical results show that shear strength, small strain stiffness and shear dilation of MHBS increase with the level of backpressure. As the critical state is approached, the influence of backpressure ceases. Moreover, the elastic modulus and cohesion of MHBS increase linearly while the internal friction angle decreases at a decreasing rate as the backpressure increases. Simple analytical relationships were achieved so that the effect of backpressure on the mechanical properties of MHBS can be accounted in the design of laboratory tests to characterize the mechanical behavior of MHBS.
