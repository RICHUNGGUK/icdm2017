We applied the collaboration-conflict process to Software Review Meetings, commonly adopted to verify the functional specification of software. We developed a groupware tool demonstrating the dynamics of the collaboration-conflict process in review meetings. We also provide results from an experiment with the tool in a software engineering firm. The results show that the collaboration-conflict process promotes argumentation and generates better reviews.", "paper_title": "COLLABORATION AND CONFLICT IN SOFTWARE REVIEW MEETINGS", "paper_id": "WOS:000312456800004"}
