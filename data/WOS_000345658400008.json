The membership problem for pattern languages, i.e., deciding on whether or not a given word is in the pattern language of a given pattern is NP-complete. We show that any parameter of patterns that is an upper bound for the treewidth of appropriate encodings of patterns as relational structures, if restricted, allows the membership problem for pattern languages to be solved in polynomial time. Furthermore, we identify new such parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Patterns with bounded treewidth", "paper_id": "WOS:000345658400008"}
