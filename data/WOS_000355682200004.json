BIP supports incremental design of large systems from atomic components that communicate via connectors and whose interactions can be described with a powerful algebra. This paper presents SBIP, an extension of BIP for stochastic systems. SBIP offers the possibility to add stochastic information to atomic component's behaviors, and hence to the entire system. Atomic component's semantics in SBIP is described by Markov Chains. We show that the semantics of the entire system is described by a Markov chain, showing that the non-determinism arising from system interactions is automatically eliminated by BIP. This allows us to verify systems described in SBIP with Statistical Model Checking. This paper introduces SBIP and illustrates its usability on several industrial case studies.", "paper_title": "Statistical model checking QoS properties of systems with SBIP", "paper_id": "WOS:000355682200004"}
