We provide linear lower bounds on cutwidth for two simple polytopes. Considering CP as a propositional refutation system, one can see that the cutwidth of a CNF contradiction F is always bound above by the Resolution width of F. We provide an example proving that the converse fails: there is an F which has constant cutwidth, but has Resolution width Omega(n). Following a standard method for converting an FO sentence psi, without finite models, into a sequence of CNFs, F (psi,n) , we provide a classification theorem for CP based on the sum cutwidth plus rank. Specifically, the cutwidth + rank of F (psi,n) is bound by a constant c (depending on psi only) iff psi has no (infinite) models. This result may be seen as a relative of various gap theorems extant in the literature.", "paper_title": "Cutting Planes and the Parameter Cutwidth", "paper_id": "WOS:000302036100004"}
