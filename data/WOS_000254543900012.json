Each job j has a positive handling time h(j), a time window [r(j), d(j)], and a benefit b(j). We consider the following two problems: MAX-VSP asks to find a schedule for a single vehicle to process a subset of jobs with the maximum benefit; and MIN-VSP asks to find a schedule to process all given jobs with the minimum number of vehicles. We first give an O(rho n(3+gamma)) time algorithm that delivers a 2-approximate solution to MAX-VSP, where rho = max(j,j)'(d(j) - r(j))/h(j') and gamma is the maximum number of jobs that can be processed by the vehicle after processing a job j and before visiting the processed job j again by deadline d(j). We then present an O(rho n(4+gamma)) time algorithm that delivers a 2H (n) -approximate solution to MIN-VSP, where H(n) is the nth harmonic number. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
