Three steps are included. First, a new nontensor product bivariate wavelet is utilized to get different facial frequency components. Then a modified 2D linear discriminant technique (M2DLD) is applied on these frequency components to enhance the discrimination of the facial features. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) is adopted for classification. Compared with the traditional tensor product wavelet, the new nontensor product wavelet can detect more singular facial features in the high-frequency components. Earlier studies show that the high-frequency components are sensitive to facial expression variations and minor occlusions, while the low-frequency component is sensitive to illumination changes. Therefore, there are two advantages of using the new nontensor product wavelet compared with the traditional tensor product one. First, the low-frequency component is more robust to the expression variations and minor occlusions, which indicates that it is more efficient in facial feature representation. Second, the corresponding high-frequency components are more robust to the illumination changes, subsequently it is more powerful for classification as well. The application of the M2DLD on these wavelet frequency components enhances the discrimination of the facial features while reducing the feature vectors dimension a lot. The experimental results on the AR database and the PIE database verified the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "FACIAL BIOMETRICS USING NONTENSOR PRODUCT WAVELET AND 2D DISCRIMINANT TECHNIQUES", "paper_id": "WOS:000267114600008"}
