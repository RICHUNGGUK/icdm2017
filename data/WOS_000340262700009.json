For the user could conveniently design their favorite product and interact with the system by a graphical interface, the car console conceptual design system is established. And IGA based on hesitancy degree is proposed in this paper to reduce user's uncertainty or fuzzy feeling. By repeating the simulation experiment, the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper.", "paper_title": "Application of Interactive Genetic Algorithm based on hesitancy degree in product configuration for customer requirement", "paper_id": "WOS:000340262700009"}
