Let f(min) be the minimum of f on S. Suppose S is nonsingular and f(min) is achievable on S, which are true generically. This paper proposes a new type semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation which is the first one for solving this problem exactly. First, we construct new polynomials phi(1), ... , phi(r), by using the Jacobian of f, h(i), g(j), such that the above problem is equivalent to min(x is an element of Rn) f(x) s.t. h(i)(x) = 0, phi(j)(x) = 0, 1 <= i <= m(1), 1 <= j <= r, g(1)(x)(nu 1) ... g(m2)(x)(nu m2) >= 0, for all nu is an element of {0, 1}(m2). Second, we prove that for all N big enough, the standard N-th order Lasserre's SDP relaxation is exact for solving this equivalent problem, that is, its optimal value is equal to f(min). Some variations and examples are also shown.", "paper_title": "An exact Jacobian SDP relaxation for polynomial optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000313797100010"}
