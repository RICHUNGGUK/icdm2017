The previous research did not take the impact of individual attributes on classification accuracy into account, and therefore assumed that all attributes follow the same generalized Dirichlet prior. In this study, the selective naive Bayes mechanism is employed to choose and rank attributes, and two methods are then proposed to search for the best prior of each single attribute according to the attribute ranks. The experimental results on 18 data sets show that the best approach is to use selective naive Bayes for filtering and ranking attributes when all of them have Dirichlet priors with Laplace's estimate. After the ranks of the chosen attributes are determined, individual setting is performed to search for the best noninformative generalized Dirichlet prior for each attribute. The selective naive Bayes is also compared with two representative filters for the feature selection, and the experimental results show that it has the best performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
