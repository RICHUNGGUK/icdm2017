Using a modified LimeWire servent ( for both the server and client) and a variance-time plot for traffic characterization, the authors analyze the Gnutella protocol's traffic shape and find that the messages exhibit a self-similar shape. This result shows network designers that they need to consider the self-similar traffic shape in their set-up - for instance, by introducing appropriate buffer sizes.", "paper_title": "Application-layer traffic analysis of a peer-to-peer system", "paper_id": "WOS:000258934200015"}
