The model includes the effect of bulk generation and space charge generation that is verified against numerical simulations of an Si-BOX-pSi structure. The final result of the model, the duration of the high breakdown voltage phase as a function of device characteristic and the applied voltage, is verified against experimental results regarding the duration of the increased breakdown voltage phase in a power LDMOS in SOI technology. The results show that the interface states are probably the limiting fact or for the duration of the increased breakdown voltage phase.", "paper_title": "Modeling the Duration of the High Breakdown Voltage Phase in Deep Depletion Power Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000207536800003"}
