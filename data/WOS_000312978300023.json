In this paper, we focus on the non-malleability of ID-based trapdoor commitment. We first point out some weakness of the definition for Fischlin's ID-based trapdoor commitments, which we call the partial ID-based trapdoor commitments. Moreover, we present the formal definition for the full ID-based trapdoor commitment and give a concrete construction based on the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption. Finally, we use the idea of multi-trapdoor commitments and the technique of non-malleability to propose two efficient interactive full ID-based non-malleable trapdoor commitments in discrete logarithm (DL) system, with/without random oracle respectively.
