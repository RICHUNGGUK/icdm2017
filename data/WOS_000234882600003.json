By analyzing various image features between stego-images (the images containing hidden messages) and cover-images (the images containing no hidden messages), a steganalytic system is able to detect stego-images. In this paper, we present a new concept of developing a robust steganographic system by artificially counterfeiting statistic features instead of the traditional strategy by avoiding the change of statistic features. We apply genetic algorithm based methodology by adjusting gray values of a cover-image while creating the desired statistic features to generate the stego-images that can break the inspection of steganalytic systems. Experimental results show that our algorithm can not only pass the detection of current steganalytic systems, but also increase the capacity of the embedded message and enhance the peak signal-to-noise ratio of stego-images.", "paper_title": "Genetic algorithm based methodology for breaking the steganalytic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000234882600003"}
