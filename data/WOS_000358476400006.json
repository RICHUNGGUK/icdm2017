In this paper, the limitations of these analytical models for RC joint applications are reviewed. Essentially for predictions of RC joint shear behaviour, the MCFT is not applicable, while the STM can only predict the ultimate shear strength. To eliminate these limitations, an improved STM is derived and applied to some commonly encountered 2D joints, viz., interior and exterior joints, subjected to monotonic loading. Compared with the other STMs, the most attracting novelty of the proposed improved STM is that all critical stages of the shear stress-strain relationships for RC joints can be predicted, which cover the stages characterized by concrete cracking, transverse reinforcement yielding and concrete strut crushing. For validation and demonstration of superiority, the shear stress-strain relationships of interior and exterior RC beam-column joints from published experimental studies are employed and compared with the predictions by the proposed improved STM and other widely-used analytical models, such as the MCFT and STM.", "paper_title": "Improved strut-and-tie method for 2D RC beam-column joints under monotonic loading", "paper_id": "WOS:000358476400006"}
