A sliding window is set up to adjust the electing probability and keep stable the expected number of the cluster heads using two parameters in this method, one is the initial energy information of the nodes and the other is the average energy information of those that have not already been cluster heads in the network. Meanwhile, the number of cluster heads which is fixed in the entire network lifetime in LEACH is modified to be a variable according to the number of the living nodes. Simulations show that the improvement for First Node Dies (FND) and Half of the Nodes Alive (HNA) is 41% and 36%, respectively over LEACH, 17% and 26% for Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy with Deterministic Cluster-Head Selection (LEACH-DCHS), 22% and 21% for Advanced Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (ALEACH).
