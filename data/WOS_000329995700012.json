We consider a downlink network with a single base station, L shared channels, and N mobile users. Throughput optimal algorithms like MaxWeight in general require the complete channel-state information (CSI) (NL link states) for scheduling. Acquiring the complete CSI, however, is a prohibitive overhead in multichannel networks when the number of users is large. In this paper, we consider the scenario where the base station allocates only a limited amount of uplink resources for acquiring channel-state information. We first show that to support a (1 - epsilon) fraction of the full throughput region (the throughput region with the complete CSI), the base station needs to acquire at least Theta((1 - epsilon)L) link states at each time-slot. We then propose a Weight-Based Feedback allocation, named WBF, and show that WBF together with MaxWeight scheduling achieves a (1 - epsilon) fraction of the full throughput region by acquiring Theta (L log 1/epsilon) link states per time-slot. For i.i.d. ON-OFF channels, we further prove that link Theta (L log 1/epsilon) states per time-slot is necessary for achieving a (1 - epsilon) fraction of the full throughput region.", "paper_title": "Approaching Throughput Optimality With Limited Feedback in Multichannel Wireless Downlink Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000329995700012"}
