Through the antenna, a node can simultaneously transmit/receive a packet to/from all the directions around it. Thus the antenna switches itself in transmission and reception mode. In our scheme all transmission and reception will be directional. We discussed the hidden and deaf node problems with directional MAC and proposed the scheme to overcome those shortcomings. Our scheme has been inspired by the IEEE 802.11, which includes a new scheme to inform its neighbors who was deaf due to other communication. Moreover, the simultaneous transmission of the RTS/CTS through it's all beams prevent the hidden node problem. In our scheme the idle nodes stay in reception mode for sensing the channel through its M non overlapping beams, as a substitute of omnidirectional antenna. It prevents the hidden node problem due to asymmetry in gain. We have simulated our scheme by OPNET 16.0, and compared our results with CDR MAC, DMAC and IEEE 802.11 protocols. Our results show that NIADH performs better than that of the existing protocols in majority of the scenarios.", "paper_title": "Neighbor initiated approach for avoiding deaf and hidden node problems in directional MAC protocol for ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000320891600025"}
