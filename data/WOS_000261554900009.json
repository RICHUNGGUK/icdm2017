A survey was conducted from December 2004 to May 2005, with 282 nurses in four local hospitals in Hong Kong Completing a self-report questionnaire. Multiple regression showed that older age (beta = 0. 13, P =.01), higher educational levels (beta = 0.37, P <.001), and attitude scores (beta = 0.14, P <.001) are factors that significantly improve nurses' knowledge. Factors that may improve nurses' attitudes were shown to be more on work experiences (beta = 0.52, P =.01), experience in medical or specialist units and senior ranking (beta = 2.51, P<.001), and higher knowledge (beta = 1.24, P <.001). Older age (beta = 0.73, P <.001), higher educational level (beta = 1.78, P <.001), and senior ranking (beta = 4.06, P <.001) are factors that improve nurses' skills. The managerial implications for these findings are important because the variables identified in this study are directly related to enhancement of the quality and efficiency of the clinical management system. These findings should be.,used to formulate strategies to encourage nurses to resolve actual problems and increase the depth and breadth of their computer knowledge, attitudes, and skills.", "paper_title": "Factors Affecting Knowledge, Attitudes, and Skills Levels for Nursing Staff Toward the Clinical Management System in Hong Kong", "paper_id": "WOS:000261554900009"}
