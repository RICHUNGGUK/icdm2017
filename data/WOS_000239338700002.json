In this manner, fast changes in the object or background appearance can be dealt with. When modelling the target alone (and not its distinction from the background), changes of lighting or changes of viewpoint can invalidate the internal target model. As the main contribution, we propose a new model for the detection of the target using fore around/back around texture discrimination. The background is represented as a set of texture patterns. During tracking, the algorithm maintains a set of discriminant functions each distinguishing one pattern in the object region from background patterns in the neighborhood of the obect. The idea is to train the foreground/background discrimination dynamically, that is while the tracking develops. In our case, the discriminant functions are efficiently trained online using a differential version of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Object detection is performed by maximizing the sum of all discriminant functions. The method employs two complementary sources of information: it searches for the image region similar to the target object, and simultaneously it seeks to avoid background patterns seen before. The detection result is therefore less sensitive to sudden changes in the appearance of the object than in methods relying solely on similarity to the target. The experiments show robust performance under severe changes of viewpoint or abrupt changes of lighting.", "paper_title": "Robust tracking using foreground-background texture discrimination", "paper_id": "WOS:000239338700002"}
