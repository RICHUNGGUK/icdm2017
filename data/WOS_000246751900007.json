A graphical representation of the tool movements is used to determine the in-process chip geometry and tool edge contact length using an adaptive and local depth buffer. The graphical representation of the tool movements is generated using either tooth swept sectors that model the tool's cutting teeth as they rotate or the swept surface of the tool as it moves along the tool path. The mechanistic model was verified with two cutting experiments: The first cutting test showed that the data agrees with the simulation results within 7% of the peak-to-peak forces. The second cutting test modelled a more complex stock surface and tool path. The simulation results were within 10% of the measured peak-to-peak cutting torque. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
