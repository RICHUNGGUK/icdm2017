Research on coreference resolution in the general English domain dates back to 1960s and 1970s. However, research on coreference resolution in the clinical free text has not seen major development. The recent US government initiatives that promote the use of electronic health records (EHRs) provide opportunities to mine patient notes as more and more health care institutions adopt EHR. Our goal was to review recent advances in general purpose coreference resolution to lay the foundation for methodologies in the clinical domain, facilitated by the availability of a shared lexical resource of gold standard coreference annotations, the Ontology Development and Information Extraction (ODIE) corpus.
