Additionally, unexpected incidents are the next most probable cause of these bottleneck regions. Moreover, most drivers are driving based on their empirical experience without awareness of real-time traffic situations. This unintelligent traffic behavior can make the congestion problem worse. Prediction based route guidance systems show great improvements in solving the inefficient diversion strategy problem by estimating future travel time when calculating accurate travel time is difficult. However, performances of machine learning based prediction models that are based on the historical data set degrade sharply during a congestion situation. This paper develops a new navigation system for reducing travel time of an individual driver and distributing the flow of urban traffic efficiently in order to reduce the occurrence of congestion. Compared with previous route guidance systems, the results reveal that our system, applying the advanced multi-lane prediction based real-time fastest path (AMPRFP) algorithm, can significantly reduce the travel time especially when drivers travel in a complex route environment and face frequent congestion problems. Unlike the previous system,(1) it can be applied either for single lane or multi-lane urban traffic networks where the reason for congestion is significantly complex. We also demonstrate the advantages of this system and verify the results using real highway traffic data and a synthetic experiment.", "paper_title": "MACHINE LEARNING ON CONGESTION ANALYSIS BASED REAL-TIME NAVIGATION SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000293513700008"}
