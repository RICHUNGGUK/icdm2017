Registry and research systems are foundations for conducting clinical and epidemiological research. Developing countries lack these systems due to the scarcity of the resources allocated for health information systems. In this study, we provide an integrated model for Turkey in order to optimize the utilization of resources. The Breast Diseases Registry system (BDRS) is implemented as an integrated disease-specific system for breast diseases in order to obtain a comprehensive use of patient health data for research and Breast Cancer Registry as well as an ancillary clinical tool.
