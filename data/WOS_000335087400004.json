Sulfur-containing industrial organic chemicals can be grouped into several chemical classes including mercaptans (RSH), sulfides (RSR'), disulfides (RSSR'), sulfoxides (RS(=O)R'), sulfones (RS(=O)(=O)R'), sulfonates (ROS(=O)(=O)R') and sulfates (ROS(=O)(=O)OR'). In silico expert systems that predict protein binding reactions from 2D structure sub-divide these chemical classes into a variety of chemical reactive mechanisms and reactions which have toxic consequences. Using the protein binding profilers in version 3.1 of the OECD QSAR Toolbox, a series of sulfur-containing chemicals were profiled for protein binding potential. From these results it was hypothesized which sulfur-containing chemicals would be reactive or non-reactive in an in chemico glutathione assay and whether if reactive they would exhibit toxicity in excess of baseline in the Tetrahymena pyriformis population growth impairment assay. Subsequently, these hypotheses were tested experimentally. The in chemico data show that the in silico profiler predictions were generally correct for all chemical categories, where testing was possible. Mercaptans could not be assessed for GSH reactivity because they react directly with the chromophore 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). With some exceptions, the major being disulfides, the in vitro toxicity data supported the in chemico findings.", "paper_title": "Experimental verification of structural alerts for the protein binding of sulfur-containing compounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000335087400004"}
