In this paper new models are developed, based on evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR), for assessment of liquefaction potential and lateral spreading. The models developed for liquefaction and lateral spreading are compared to those obtained from neural network and linear regression based techniques. It is shown that the developed models are able to learn the complex relationship between either of these problems and their contributing factors in the form of a function with high level of accuracy (mostly in excess of 90%). The results of the EPR model developed for the liquefaction determination are used to find a novel 3-D boundary surface that discriminates between the cases of occurrence and non-occurrence of liquefaction. The developed boundary surface is employed to calculate the factor of safety against liquefaction occurrence. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
