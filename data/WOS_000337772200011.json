A personalized and refined therapy based on predicting prognostic outcomes of cancer patients has been actively sought in the past decade. Accurate prognostic prediction requires higher-order representations of complex dependencies among genetic factors. However, identifying the co-regulatory roles and functional effects of genetic interactions on cancer prognosis is hindered by the complexity of the interactions. Here we propose a prognostic prediction model based on evolutionary learning that identifies higher-order prognostic biomarkers of cancer clinical outcomes. The proposed model represents the interactions of prognostic genes as a combinatorial space. It adopts a flexible hypergraph structure composed of a large population of hyperedges that encode higher-order relationships among many genetic factors. The hyper-edge population is optimized by an evolutionary learning method based on sequential Bayesian sampling. The proposed learning approach effectively balances performance and parsimony of the model using information-theoretic dependency and complexity-theoretic regularization priors. Using MAQC-II project data, we demonstrate that our model can handle high-dimensional data more effectively than state-of-the-art classification models. We also identify potential gene interactions characterizing prognosis and recurrence risk in cancer. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
