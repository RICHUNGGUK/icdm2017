We then analyze some properties of such a family of aggregation operators, introducing the semiautoduality condition, which is weaker than the standard autoduality condition (i.e., the standard self De Morgan identity). Particular families of aggregation operators will appear depending on the context. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
