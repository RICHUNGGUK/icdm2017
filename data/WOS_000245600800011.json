Many segment-based correspondence approaches have been proposed in recent years. Untextured pixels and boundaries of discontinuities are imposed with hard constraints by the discontinuity assumption that large disparity variation only happens at the boundaries of segments in the above approaches. Significant improvements on performance of untextured and discontinuity area have been reported. But, the performance near occlusion is not satisfactory because a segmented region in one image may be only partially visible in the other one. To solve this problem, we utilize the observation that the shared edge of a visible area and an occluded area corresponds to the discontinuity in the other image. So, the proposed model conducts color segmentation on both images first and then a segment in one image is further cut into smaller patches corresponding to the boundaries of segments in the other when it is assigned with a disparity. Different visibility of patches in one segment is allowed. The uniqueness constraint in a segment level is used to compute the occlusions. An energy minimization framework using graph-cuts is proposed to find a global optimal configuration including both disparities and occlusions. Besides, some measurements are taken to make our segment-based algorithm suffer less from violation of the discontinuity assumption. Experimental results have shown superior performance of the proposed approach, especially on occlusions, untextured areas, and near discontinuities.", "paper_title": "Stereo correspondence with occlusion handling in a symmetric patch-based graph-cuts model", "paper_id": "WOS:000245600800011"}
