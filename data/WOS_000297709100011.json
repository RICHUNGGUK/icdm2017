A key feature of the Ecolocation algorithm is that it constructs a constraint table based on RSSI values and compares data between two tables. However, the definitions of the constraint and the centroid in the Ecolocation algorithm are imperfect, and result in poor localization performance. To improve the localization accuracy, a new algorithm based on weighted rank order correlation coefficient and dynamic centroid method is proposed. Simulation results indicate that compared with the Ecolocation, the localization accuracy and robustness of the new algorithm are distinctly raised.", "paper_title": "Sequence-based localization algorithm with improved correlation metric and dynamic centroid", "paper_id": "WOS:000297709100011"}
