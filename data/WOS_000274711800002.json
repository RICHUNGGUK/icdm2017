The scheme utilises the trapezium rule of numerical integration and the accuracy and robustness of the method is enhanced by the bisection method of root-finding. The scheme is efficient and flexible in that it can be used with any adsorption isotherm and is readily modified for solving the problem of adsorption onto a convex interface. This scheme is not suggested for the adsorption onto a concave interface and the confusions that have previously arisen in relation to this problem are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
