The TTFD of a mono-component signal can be obtained directly through its analytic instantaneous frequency. The characteristic property of TTFD is its complete concentration along the analytic instantaneous frequency graph. For multi-components there are induced time-frequency distributions called composing transient time-frequency distribution (CTTFD). Each CTTFD is defined as the superposition of the TTFDs of the composing intrinsic mono-components in a suitable mono-components decomposition of the targeted multicomponent. In studying the properties of TTFD and CTTFD the relations between the Fourier frequency and analytic instantaneous frequency are examined.", "paper_title": "TRANSIENT TIME-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION BASED ON MONO-COMPONENT DECOMPOSITIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000319995600002"}
