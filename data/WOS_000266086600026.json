This problem appears when the number of examples that represents one of the classes of the data-set (usually the concept of interest) is much lower than that of the other classes. In this manner, the learning model must be adapted to this situation, which is very common in real applications. In this paper, we will work with fuzzy rule based classification systems using a preprocessing step in order to deal with the class imbalance. Our aim is to analyze the behaviour of fuzzy rule based classification systems in the framework of imbalanced data-sets by means of the application of an adaptive inference system with parametric conjunction operators. Our results shows empirically that the use of the this parametric conjunction operators implies a higher performance for all data-sets with different imbalanced ratios. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
