We consider the problem of marking (or designating) one point on each line in [k](n) so that each point in [k](n) is marked either a or b times, for some fixed a or b. This is equivalent to forming a strategy for a hat guessing game for n players with k different colors of hats where the number of correct guesses, regardless of hats placed, is either a or b. If we let s = 0 and t = 0 denote the number of vertices marked a and b times respectively, then we have the following obvious necessary conditions: s + t = k(n) (the number of points) and as + bt = nk(n-1) (the number of lines). Our main result is to show for n <= 5, and k arbitrary, that these necessary conditions are also sufficient.", "paper_title": "A note on marking lines in [k](n) In honor of Rick Wilson's 65th birthday", "paper_id": "WOS:000313055300002"}
