The suggested architecture provides an enhanced security protection scheme for use in smartphones, PDA's, as well as other similar systems. Sensitive data storage facilities, cryptographic engines, and physical protection mechanisms such as debug port access control are presented and described in detail. The proposed secure architecture has been incorporated as a part of an application processor which in turn is embedded in a number of smartphone and handheld products. System operation is discussed and hardware realization and experimental results of the proposed architecture are described. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
