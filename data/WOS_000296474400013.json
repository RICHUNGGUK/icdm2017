Our toolkit uses OpenSource elements to analyze bibliometric data gathered from the Web Of Science. We take the example of our institution, ENS de Lyon, to show how different maps, using co-occurrence (of authors, keywords, institutionsaEuro broken vertical bar) and bibliographic coupling can be built. These maps may become a valuable tool for discussing institutions' policies, as they offer different views on the institution at a global scale.", "paper_title": "Mapping scientific institutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000296474400013"}
