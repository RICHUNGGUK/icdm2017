FQ(n) is superior to Q(n) in many measurements, such as diameter, fault diameter, connectivity, and so on. Let (V) over tilde (FQ(n)) (resp. (E) over tilde (FQ(n))) denote the set of faulty nodes (resp. faulty edges) in FQ(n). In the case that all nodes in FQ(n) are fault-free, it has been shown that FQ(n) contains a fault-free path of length 2(n) - 1(resp. 2(n) - 2) between any two nodes of odd (resp. even) distance if [(E) over tilde (FQ(n))] <= n - 1, where n >= 1 is odd; and FQ(n) contains a fault-free path of length 2(n) - 1 between any two nodes if [(E) over tilde (FQ(n))] <= n- 2, where n >= 2 is even. In this paper, we extend the above result to obtain two further properties, which consider both node and edge faults, as follows: 1. FQ(n) contains a fault-free path of length at least 2(n) - 2 vertical bar(V) over tilde (FQ(n)vertical bar - 1(resp. 2(n) - 2 vertical bar(V) over tilde (FQ(n))vertical bar- 2) between any two fault-free nodes of odd (resp. even) distance if vertical bar(V) over tilde (FQ(n))vertical bar+vertical bar(E) over tilde (FQ(n))vertical bar <= n - 1, where n >= 1 is odd. 2. FQ(n) contains a fault-free path of length at least 2(n) - 2 vertical bar(V) over tilde (FQ(n))vertical bar - 1 between any two fault-free nodes if vertical bar(V) over tilde (FQ(n))vertical bar + vertical bar(E) over tilde (FQ(n))vertical bar <= n - 2, where n >= 2 is even.
