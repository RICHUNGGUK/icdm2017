Most current methods invest considerable complexity to model interdependencies between labels. This paper shows that binary relevance-based methods have much to offer, and that high predictive performance can be obtained without impeding scalability to large datasets. We exemplify this with a novel classifier chains method that can model label correlations while maintaining acceptable computational complexity. We extend this approach further in an ensemble framework. An extensive empirical evaluation covers a broad range of multi-label datasets with a variety of evaluation metrics. The results illustrate the competitiveness of the chaining method against related and state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of predictive performance and time complexity.", "paper_title": "Classifier chains for multi-label classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000296065300004"}
