No matter how the battery energy is conserved, once the energy is used up, the network life terminates. Therefore, guaranteeing long-term energy supply has persisted as a big challenge. To address this problem, we propose a node reclamation and replacement (NRR) strategy, with which a mobile robot or human labor called mobile repairman (MR) periodically traverses the sensor network, reclaims nodes with low or no power supply, replaces them with fully charged ones, and brings the reclaimed nodes back to an energy station for recharging. To effectively and efficiently realize the strategy, we develop an adaptive rendezvous-based two-tier scheduling scheme (ARTS) to schedule the replacement/reclamation activities of the MR and the duty cycles of nodes. Extensive simulations have been conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the ARTS scheme.", "paper_title": "Node Reclamation and Replacement for Long-Lived Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000292908300012"}
