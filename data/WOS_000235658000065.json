However, update management in PDMSs has received very little attention. This paper proposes a strategy to maintain views in our SPDMS. Based on applications, this paper extends the definition of view and proposes the peer view, local view and global view. So the maintenance of a global view is became the maintenance of all related local views if join operations are confined in each local PDMS. Furthermore, this paper proposes an ECA rule for definition consistency maintenance and a push-based strategy for date consistency maintenance. Finally, we do extensive simulation experiments in our SPDMS. The simulation results show the proposed strategy has better performance than that of Mork's.", "paper_title": "Materialized view maintenance in peer data management systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000065"}
