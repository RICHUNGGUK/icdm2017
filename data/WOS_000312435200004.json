Initially, gradient linearization procedure is applied to describe such nonlinear system into several linear systems. Next, a convex hull set is investigated in order to transform the actuator constraints into several linear constraints, and then, a set of H-infinity observers is designed for these linear models, which guarantees the system states belong to an ellipsoid invariant set. Finally, continuous gain-scheduled approach is employed to design continuous nonlinear observer on the entire uncertain nonlinear system. A simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of developed techniques.", "paper_title": "CONTINUOUS GAIN SCHEDULED H-INFINITY OBSERVER FOR UNCERTAIN NONLINEAR SYSTEM WITH TIME-DELAY AND ACTUATOR SATURATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000312435200004"}
