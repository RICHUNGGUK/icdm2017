Wilson points out what he describes as flaws in our proof in 'Influences of Resource Limitations and Transmission Costs on Epidemic Simulations and Critical Thresholds in Scale-free Networks' (Simulation 85(3): 205-219) and offers an alternative steady-state behavior derivation based on our epidemic simulation model. In this response we will explain our definitions for the terms used in our paper and the derivation process for our analysis, then compare and contrast our mathematical model with that proposed by Wilson. We suggest that more compartmental models can be used to support our argument that increasing transmission costs or decreasing individual resources increases the critical threshold of a contagion event in a scale-free network.", "paper_title": "Response to Wilson's note on 'Influences of resource limitations and transmission costs on epidemic simulations and critical thresholds in scale-free networks'", "paper_id": "WOS:000287024800007"}
