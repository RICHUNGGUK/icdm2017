The results of the simultaneous analysis in multiple populations with structural equation modeling show that four kinds of motivations affect browsing mobile-based online stores, whereas three motivations affect browsing physical stores. This study implies that idea motivation is the most important determinant of both mobile and offline browsing. Also, it implies that adventure motivation and value motivation are important for mobile-based online stores, whereas gratification motivation is important for physical stores. This is the first study to examine the determinants of browsing intention in both physical stores and mobile-based online stores and will contribute to better understanding in-store browsing activity.", "paper_title": "Consumer Motivations in Browsing Online Stores with Mobile Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000305696000006"}
