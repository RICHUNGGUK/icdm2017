This study presents the use of artificial neural networks (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), multiple linear regression (MLR) and multiple nonlinear regression (MNLR) for forecasting maximum daily flow at the outlet of the Khosrow Shirin watershed, located in the Fars Province of Iran. Precipitation data from four meteorological stations were used to develop a multilayer perceptron topology model. Input vectors for simulations included the original precipitation data, an area-weighted average precipitation and antecedent flows with one- and two-day time lags. Performances of the models were evaluated with the RMSE and the R (2). The results showed that the area-weighted precipitation as an input to ANNs and MNLR and the spatially distributed precipitation input to ANFIS and MLR lead to more accurate predictions (e.g., in ANNs up to 2.0 m(3) s(-1) reduction in RMSE). Overall, the MNLR was shown to be superior (R (2) = 0.81 and RMSE = 0.145 m(3) s(-1)) to ANNs, ANFIS and MLR for prediction of maximum daily flow. Furthermore, models including antecedent flow with one- and two-day time lags significantly improve flow prediction. We conclude that nonlinear regression can be applied as a simple method for predicting the maximum daily flow.", "paper_title": "Flood flow forecasting using ANN, ANFIS and regression models", "paper_id": "WOS:000338191300003"}
