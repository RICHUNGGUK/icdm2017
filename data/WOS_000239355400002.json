Networks based on these graphs reduce the Torus diameter in a factor root 2, which translates into significant performance gains for unicast traffic. In addition, they are clearly superior to Tori when managing collective communications. This paper introduces a new two-dimensional node's labeling of the networks explored which simplifies their analysis and exploitation. In particular, it provides simple and optimal solutions to two important architectural issues: routing and broadcasting. Other implementation issues such as network folding and scalability by using hierarchical networks are also explored in this work.", "paper_title": "Dense Gaussian networks: Suitable topologies for on-chip multiprocessors", "paper_id": "WOS:000239355400002"}
