One challenge lies in identifying traffic phases using variables that could be directly calculated from the dual-loop data. This article presents an innovative approach and associated algorithm for identifying traffic phases through a hybrid method that incorporates level of service method and K-means clustering method. The \"phase representative variables\" are identified to represent traffic characteristics in the traffic flow phase identification algorithm. The traffic factors influencing the vehicle classification accuracy under non-free traffic conditions are successfully identified using video-based vehicular trajectory data, and the innovative length-based vehicle classification models are then developed. The result of the concept-of-evidence test with use of sample data indicates that compared with the existing model, the accuracy of the estimated vehicle lengths is increased from 42% to 92% under synchronized and stop-and-go conditions. The results also foster a better understanding of the traffic stream characteristics and associated theories to lay out a good foundation for further development of relevant microscopic simulation models with other sensing traffic data sources.", "paper_title": "Empirical Innovation of Computational Dual-Loop Models for Identifying Vehicle Classifications against Varied Traffic Conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000322003300006"}
