Missing green samples are first estimated based on the variances of the color differences along different edge directions. The missing red and blue components are then estimated based on the interpolated green plane. This algorithm can effectively preserve the details in texture regions and, at the same time, it can significantly reduce the color artifacts. As compared with the latest demosaicing algorithms, the proposed algorithm produces the best average demosaicing performance both objectively and subjectively.", "paper_title": "Color demosaicing using variance of color differences", "paper_id": "WOS:000240776200008"}
