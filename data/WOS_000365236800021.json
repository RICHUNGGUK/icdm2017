Focusing on accurate scaled cloud computing environment and efficient task scheduling under resource constraints problems, we introduce fine-grained cloud computing system model and optimization task scheduling scheme in this paper. The system model is comprised of clearly defined separate submodels including task schedule submodel, task execute submodel and task transmission submodel, so that they can be accurately analyzed in the order of processing of user requests. Moreover the submodels are scalable enough to capture the flexibility of the cloud computing paradigm. By analyzing the submodels, where results are repeated to obtain sufficient accuracy, we design a novel task scheduling scheme based on reinforcement learning and queuing theory to optimize task scheduling under the resource constraints, and the state aggregation technologies is employed to accelerate the learning progress. Our results, on the one hand, demonstrate the efficiency of the task scheduling scheme and, on the other hand, reveal the relationship between the arrival rate, server rate, number of VMs and the number of buffer size.", "paper_title": "Random task scheduling scheme based on reinforcement learning in cloud computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000365236800021"}
