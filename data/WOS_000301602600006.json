We present a novel pipelined architecture to implement N-bit fixed-point square root operation on an FPGA using a non-restoring pipelined algorithm that does not require floating-point hardware. Pipelining hazards in its hardware realization are avoided by modifying the classic non-restoring algorithm, thus resulting in a 13% improved latency. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is flexible allowing modification as per individual application needs. It is demonstrated that the proposed architecture is approximately four times faster than its popular counterparts and at the same time it consumes 50% less energy for envelope detection at 268 MHz sampling rate.", "paper_title": "Novel Pipelined Architecture for Efficient Evaluation of the Square Root Using a Modified Non-Restoring Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000301602600006"}
