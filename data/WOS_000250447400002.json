Therefore, it is a good candidate for advanced video compression algorithms, requiring higher compression efficiency than current algorithms. One disadvantage of the affine motion model is the increased number of motion vector parameters, therefore increased motion vector bit rate. We develop and analyze several simulation based approaches of entropy coding for orthonormalized affine motion vector (AMV) coefficients, by considering various context-types and coders. In our work we expand the traditional idea of a context type by introducing four new context types. We compare our method of contexts-type and coder selection with context quantization. The best of our contexts-type and coder solutions produces 4% to 15% average AMV bit-rate reductions over the original VLC approach. For more difficult content AMV bit rate reduction up to 26% is reported.", "paper_title": "Encoding of alffine motion vectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000250447400002"}
