However, its features also introduce significant overhead threatening the performance of modern applications. In this paper, we present a study of XML parsing and determine that memory-side data loading in the parsing stage incurs a significant performance overhead, as much as the computation does. Hence, we propose memory-side acceleration which incorporates of data prefetching techniques, and can be applied on top of computation-side acceleration to speed up the XML data parsing. To this end, we study here the impact of our proposed scheme on the performance and energy consumption and demonstrated how it is capable of improving performance by up to 20 percent as well as produce up to 12.77 percent of energy saving when implemented in 32-nm technology. In addition, we implement a prefetcher on an platform in an effort to evaluate its implementation feasibility in terms of area and energy overhead.", "paper_title": "Acceleration of XML Parsing through Prefetching", "paper_id": "WOS:000321221000011"}
