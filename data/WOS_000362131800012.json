In particular, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is used to exchange routing information between Internet entities, called Autonomous Systems (ASes), proved to be prone to attacks launched by a single malicious AS. Recent research contributions pointed out that even S-BGP, the secure variant of BGP that is being deployed, is not fully able to blunt traffic attraction attacks. Given a traffic flow between two ASes, we study how difficult it is for a malicious AS to devise a strategy for hijacking or intercepting that flow. The goal of the attack is to attract a traffic flow towards the malicious AS. While in the hijacking attack connectivity between the endpoints of a flow can be disrupted, in the interception attack connectivity must be maintained. We show that this problem marks a sharp difference between BGP and S-BGP. Namely, while it is solvable, under reasonable assumptions, in polynomial time for the type of attacks that are usually performed in BGP, it is NP-hard for S-BGP. Our study has several by-products. E.g., we solve a problem left open in the literature, stating when performing a hijacking in S-BGP is equivalent to performing an interception. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
