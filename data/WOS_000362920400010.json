Bins have infinite capacities and the stretching factor is the size of the largest bin. We present an algorithm with stretching factor 26/17 approximate to 1.5294 improving the best known algorithm by Kellerer and Kotov (2013) [1] with a stretching factor 11/7 approximate to 1.5714. Our algorithm has 2 stages and uses bunch techniques: we aggregate bins into batches sharing a common purpose. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
