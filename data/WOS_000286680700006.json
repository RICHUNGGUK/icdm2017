In this paper, we assign each pair of elements x,y is an element of E with a cost, and to find a linear extension of P with the minimum sum cost. For the general case, it is NP-complete and we present a greedy approximation algorithm which can be finished in polynomial time. Also we consider a special case which can be solved in polynomial time.", "paper_title": "Minimizing the sum cost in linear extensions of a poset", "paper_id": "WOS:000286680700006"}
