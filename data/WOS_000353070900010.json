However, mobile users are still experiencing poor service quality on the move due to the large handoff delay and packet loss problem. In order to reduce the delay, a new handoff scheme using the geomagnetic sensor embedded in mobile devices is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme predicts the movement direction of a Mobile Station (MS) from the currently associated Access Point (AP) and performs active scanning with a reduced number of channels. In terms of the packet loss, a lightweight retransmission protocol is also proposed to minimize lost packets on Wi-Fi without producing a lot of acknowledgement packets. The proposed approaches are implemented on Android smartphones, and their performance is evaluated in a real indoor WLAN environment. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed schemes maintain seamless quality for real-time video even in an environment with frequent handoffs. Note that the proposed schemes are a client-only solution and do not require modification of the existing APs, which renders them very practical. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
