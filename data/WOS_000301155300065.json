First, we propose a new method for ranking interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Then, we propose a new method for fuzzy multiple attributes group decision-making based on the proposed ranking method of interval type-2 fuzzy sets. We also use some examples to illustrate the fuzzy multiple attributes group decision-making process of the proposed method. The proposed method is simpler than the methods presented in Chen and Lee (2010a, 2010b) for fuzzy multiple attributes group decision-making based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets. It provides us with a useful way for dealing with fuzzy multiple attributes group decision-making problems based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
