The resulting image is typically computed by solving a Poisson equation that diffuses the curve colors to the interior of the image. In this paper we present a new method for solving diffusion curves by using ray tracing. Our approach is analogous to final gathering in global illumination, where the curves define source radiance whose visible contribution will be integrated at a shading pixel to produce a color using stochastic ray tracing. Compared to previous work, the main benefit of our method is that it provides artists with extended flexibility in achieving desired image effects. Specifically, we introduce generalized curve colors called shaders that allow for the seamless integration of diffusion curves with classic 2D graphics including vector graphics (e.g. gradient fills) and raster graphics (e.g. patterns and textures). We also introduce several extended curve attributes to customize the contribution of each curve. In addition, our method allows any pixel in the image to be independently evaluated, without having to solve the entire image globally (as required by a Poisson-based approach). Finally, we present a GPU-based implementation that generates solution images at interactive rates, enabling dynamic curve editing. Results show that our method can easily produce a variety of desirable image effects.", "paper_title": "A Ray Tracing Approach to Diffusion Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000292884700020"}
