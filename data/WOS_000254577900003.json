Four of these contexts are identified, namely, the research context, the educational context, the industrial context and the socio-cultural context. For each context, the major trends are analysed and summarized as short statements, thus providing a background in which the state-of-the-art and the challenges of sound and music research can be situated.", "paper_title": "The societal contexts for sound and music computing: Research, education, industry, and socio-culture", "paper_id": "WOS:000254577900003"}
