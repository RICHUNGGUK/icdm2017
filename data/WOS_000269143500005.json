A method for segmenting components into strokes using velocity profiles is proposed. Each stroke is a simple arbitrary shape and is encoded using three attributes. Correspondence between various strokes is established using Dynamic Space Warping. A distance measure which reliably differentiates between two corresponding simple shapes (strokes) has been formulated thus obtaining a perceptual distance measure between any two characters. Tests indicate an accuracy of over 85% on two different datasets of characters.", "paper_title": "DYNAMIC SPACE WARPING OF STROKES FOR RECOGNITION OF ONLINE HANDWRITTEN CHARACTERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000269143500005"}
