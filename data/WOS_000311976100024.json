The method is implemented to data from ninety-three open angle glaucoma eyes. The results show that in established glaucoma, CCT is significantly associated with HRTII structural measurements (maximum contour depression, cup volume inferotemporally) and IOP. They are also compared to those obtained from the application of standard linear regression methods, improving the coefficient determination R-2 by 35%, exhibiting thus the performance of the proposed methodology.
