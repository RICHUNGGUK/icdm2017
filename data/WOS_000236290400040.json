Most methods employ the NMT to empirically adjust the parameters of a speech enhancement system according to the various properties of noise. In this article, without ally predefined empirical factor, an explicit-form gain factor for a frequency bill is derived by perceptually constraining the residual noise below the NMT in spectral domain. This perceptual constraint preserves the spectrum Of noisy speech when the level of residual noise is less than the NMT. If the level of residual noise exceeds the NMT, then the spectrum of noisy speech is Suppressed to reduce the corrupting noise. Experimental results, how that the proposed approach can efficiently remove the added noise in Cases of various noise corruptions, and almost free from musical residual noise.", "paper_title": "An explicit-form gain factor for speech enhancement using spectral-domain-constrained approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000236290400040"}
