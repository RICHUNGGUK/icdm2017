We provide algorithms for the computation of sigma-lacunas in omega, that is the positions where the longest sigma-palindromic suffix is not uni-occurrent. The sigma-palindromic defect is explicitly computed for Sturmian words and the Thue-Morse word. Finally, the problem of reconstructing words from a given fixed set of sigma-palindromes is decidable.", "paper_title": "Reconstructing Words from a sigma-palindromic Language", "paper_id": "WOS:000345458100005"}
