The main objective is to overcome the problem dependence of fixed slop of the activation function in ELM. We mainly considered the issue of processing of benchmark problems on function approximation and pattern classification. Compared with ELM and E-ELM learning algorithms with the same network size or compact network configuration, the proposed algorithm has improved generalization performance with good accuracy. In addition, the proposed algorithm also has very good performance in the TAF neural networks learning algorithms.", "paper_title": "The extreme learning machine learning algorithm with tunable activation function", "paper_id": "WOS:000314844300012"}
