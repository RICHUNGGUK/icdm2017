In this paper, a top-down approach is investigated to discover the rules of musical composition from given music objects and to create a new music object of which style is similar to the given music objects based on the discovered composition rules. The proposed approach utilizes the data mining techniques in order to discover the styled rules of music composition characterized by music structures, melody styles and motifs. A new music object is generated based on the discovered rules. To measure the effectiveness of the proposed approach in computer music composition, a method similar to the Turing test was adopted to test the differences between the machine-generated and human-composed music. Experimental results show that it is hard to distinguish between them. The other experiment showed that the style of generated music is similar to that of the given music objects.", "paper_title": "Algorithmic compositions based on discovered musical patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000273093600001"}
