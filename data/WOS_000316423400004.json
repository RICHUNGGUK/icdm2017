We specifically focus on looking for solutions in arithmetic progression that lie in the ring of integers of a number field. With the help of previous work by Alvanos and Poulakis, we give a complete decision algorithm, which allows us to prove finiteness results concerning these particular solutions. Finally, some extensive computations are presented regarding two particular cases: the generalized Markoff equation x(2) + y(2) + z(2) = dxyz over quadratic fields and the classic Markoff equation x(2) + y(2) + z(2) = 3xyz over an arbitrary number field.
