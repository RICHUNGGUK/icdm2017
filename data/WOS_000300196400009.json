We formalize and prove the theorem in the context of grid graphs, under different input settings, in theories of bounded arithmetic that correspond to small complexity classes. The theory V-0(2) (corresponding to AC(0)(2)) proves that any set of edges that form disjoint cycles divides the grid into at least two regions. The theory V-0 (corresponding to AC(0)) proves that any sequence of edges that form a simple closed curve divides the grid into exactly two regions. As a consequence, the Hex tautologies and the st-connectivity tautologies have polynomial size AC(0)(2)-Frege-proofs, which improves results of Buss which only apply to the stronger proof system TC0-Frege.", "paper_title": "The Complexity of Proving the Discrete Jordan Curve Theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000300196400009"}
