In this paper, we firstly suggest a method of discovering information flows of posts on Facebook and their underlying contexts by incorporating process mining and text mining techniques. Based on comments collected from Facebook, the experiment results illustrate how the proposed method can be applied to analyze information flows and contexts of posts on social network services.", "paper_title": "Analyzing Information Flow and Context for Facebook Fan Pages", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784100020"}
