The GMWC(T) problem is a natural generalization of the classical multiway cut in trees problem, and has an implicit relation to the Densest -Subgraph problem. In this paper, we show that the GMWC(T) problem is fixed-parameter tractable by giving an time algorithm, where is the size of an optimal solution, and the GMWC(T) problem is polynomial time solvable when the problem is restricted in paths.We also discuss some heuristics for the GMWC(T) problem.", "paper_title": "On the generalized multiway cut in trees problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000330209400006"}
