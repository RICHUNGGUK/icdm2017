By utilising an observer-based fault detection filter as a residual generator, the RFD of networked control systems with non-uniformly distributed network-induced time-varying delay is formulated as an H(infinity) model-matching problem. Delay-interval-dependent and delay-interval-occurrence-rate-dependent sufficient conditions are obtained by employing the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach. Especially, the robust fault detection filters guarantee strong robustness from residual signal to disturbance as well as high sensitivity to faults. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design techniques.", "paper_title": "Robust fault detection filter design for networked control systems with delay distribution characterisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000293842400007"}
