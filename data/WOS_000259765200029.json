In this paper, we consider the trees with order n, diameter d or maximum degree Delta, and extremal Wiener indices. We obtain the tree with minimum Wiener index among all the trees of order n and with diameter d, and the trees with minimum and maximum Wiener indices among all the caterpillar trees of order n and with diameter d. We also obtain the tree with maximum Wiener index among all the trees of order n and with maximum degree A, and the trees with the second and the third maximum Wiener indices among all the trees of order n, whose vertices are of degree 1 or Delta.", "paper_title": "Trees with extremal Wiener indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000259765200029"}
