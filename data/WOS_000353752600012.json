The multifield hybrid approach for two-phase flow modeling consists in dealing separately with the small and spherical bubbles, treated with a dispersed approach, and with the large and distorted ones, which interface is located. These two approaches are coupled through mass transfer terms. The overall method relies on two existing blocks, consisting in a set of averaged models dedicated to dispersed bubbles and another one dedicated to interface locating, which have already been validated and have given a reasonable agreement with experimental data. The main outcome is the simulation of a three field case with a complete set of coupling terms between the two gas fields. This approach is used to simulate the experiment of Castillejos, a bubble plume in a water tank presenting a wide range of bubble diameter. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
