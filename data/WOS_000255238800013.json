Cross-correntropy nonlinearly maps the original time series into a high-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The correntropy coefficient computes the cosine of the angle between the transformed vectors. Preliminary experiments with simulated data and multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals during behaviour studies elucidate the performance of the new measure versus the well-established correlation coefficient.
