We achieve this by constructing the CBT (Clustered BitTorrent) system with two novel algorithms: a peer joining algorithm and a super-peer selection algorithm. Proximity and distribution are determined by the measurement of distances among peers. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the new architecture achieves better results than a randomly organized BitTorrent network, improving the system scalability and efficiency while retaining the robustness and incentives of original BitTorrent paradigm.", "paper_title": "Distributed proximity-aware peer Clustering in BitTorrent-like peer-to-peer networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300038"}
