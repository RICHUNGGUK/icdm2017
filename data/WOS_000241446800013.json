We initially define the operators at the schema level, and then show how each operator induces a corresponding transformation on any XML document under the schema. Finally, we note that our operators can be implemented in a high level language such as XQuery, and thus our approach can be used as the basis for automating the conversion of one XML document to another XML document.", "paper_title": "A formalism of XML restructuring operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800013"}
