Noise-tolerant acoustic models or noise reduction techniques are often used to improve recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a method to improve accuracy of spoken dialog system from a language model point of view. In the proposed method, the dialog system automatically changes its language model and dialog strategy according to the estimated recognition accuracy in a noisy environment in order to keep the performance of the system high. In a noise-free environment, the system accepts any utterance from a user. On the other hand, the system restricts its grammar and vocabulary in a noisy environment. To realize this strategy, we investigated a method to avoid the user's out-of-grammar utterances through an instruction given by the system to a user. Furthermore, we developed a method to estimate recognition accuracy from features extracted from noise signals. Finally, we realized a proposed dialog system according to these investigations.", "paper_title": "Selection of optimum vocabulary and dialog strategy for noise-robust spoken dialog systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000254606100018"}
