Finite Automata (FAs) are used to implement regular expressions matching, but they require a large amount of memory. Many recent works have proposed improvements to address this issue. This paper presents a new representation for deterministic finite automata (orthogonal to previous solutions), called Delta Finite Automata (delta FA), which considerably reduces states and transitions and requires a transition per character only, thus allowing fast matching. Moreover, a new state encoding scheme is proposed and the comprehensive algorithm is tested for use in the packet classification area.", "paper_title": "An Improved DFA for Fast Regular Expression Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000263599100007"}
