In particular, we design the first practical RSA-based SCUS schemes secure in the standard model. On the path, we also introduce two moduli RSA assumptions, including the strong twin RSA assumption, which is the RSA symmetry of the strong twin Diffie-Hellman assumption (Eurocrypt'08).", "paper_title": "New RSA-Based (Selectively) Convertible Undeniable Signature Schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000274505900008"}
