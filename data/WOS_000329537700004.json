A parametric study is also performed in order to analyse the influence of three factors, namely the diameter of excavation, the embedded length of the wall and the elastic modulus of the wall material. The numerical model incorporates the Blot's consolidation theory (coupled formulation of the equilibrium and flow equations) with soil constitutive relations simulated by the p-q-0 critical state model. Special emphasis is given to the analysis of excess pore pressures and displacements in the ground, as well as circumferential compression stresses, bending moments and horizontal displacements in the wall, and earth pressures on the wall faces.
