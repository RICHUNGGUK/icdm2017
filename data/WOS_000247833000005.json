These cameras need not have an overlapping field of view and should be allowed to move freely in space. Moreover, features like zooming in/out, readily available in security cameras these days, should be exploited in order to focus on any particular area of interest if needed. In this paper, a practical framework is proposed to self-calibrate dynamically moving and zooming cameras and determine their absolute and relative orientations, assuming that their relative position is known. A global linear solution is presented for self-calibrating each zooming/focusing camera in the network. After self-calibration, it is shown that only one automatically computed vanishing point and a line lying on any plane orthogonal to the vertical direction is sufficient to infer the dynamic network configuration. Our method generalizes previous work which considers restricted camera motions. Using minimal assumptions, we are able to successfully demonstrate promising results on synthetic, as well as on real data.", "paper_title": "Autoconfiguration of a dynamic nonoverlapping camera network", "paper_id": "WOS:000247833000005"}
