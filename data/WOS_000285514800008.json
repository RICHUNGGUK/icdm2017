Rather than using only the perceptually questionable PSNR, we instead propose a block-sensitive index, named PSNR-B, that produces objective judgments that accord with observations. The PSNR-B modifies PSNR by including a blocking effect factor. We also use the perceptually significant SSIM index, which produces results largely in agreement with PSNR-B. Simulation results show that the PSNR-B results in better performance for quality assessment of deblocked images than PSNR and a well-known blockiness-specific index.", "paper_title": "Quality Assessment of Deblocked Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000285514800008"}
