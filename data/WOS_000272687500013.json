Findings - The stress level for the stepping stress acceleration life test of a certain kind of equipment I confirmed and the data processing mathematical model and storage life forecasting method is, established. Research limitations/implications - Availability of data is the main limitation affecting which model will be applied Practical implications - Useful advice for products' storage life forecasting. Originality/value - The paper presents a new approach to product storage life estimation.", "paper_title": "Application of the stepping stress acceleration life test in the product storage life forecast", "paper_id": "WOS:000272687500013"}
