In this paper, we pursue this goal simply from a pair of image recordings. Specifically, our goal is to infer what the objects are, how they are structured, and how they moved between the images. The problem is challenging as large changes make point-level correspondence establishment difficult, which in turn breaks the assumptions of standard Structure-from-Motion (SfM). We propose a novel algorithm for dynamic SfM wherein we first generate a pool of potential corresponding points by hypothesizing over possible movements, and then use a continuous optimization formulation to obtain a low complexity solution that best explains the scene recordings, i.e., the input image pairs. We test the algorithm on a variety of examples to recover the multiple object structures and their changes.", "paper_title": "Dynamic SfM: Detecting Scene Changes from Image Pairs", "paper_id": "WOS:000362293300016"}
