Novel exponential stability criteria for the RNNs are derived, and upper bounds of the time delay and noise intensity are characterized by solving transcendental equations containing adjustable parameters. Through the selection of the adjustable parameters, the upper bounds are improved. It shows that our results generalize add improve the corresponding results of recent works. In addition, some numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the results we obtained. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
