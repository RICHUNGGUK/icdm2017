This tutorial focuses on the evaluation of such systems, from an application-oriented view. The tutorial recommends best practices, suggests a protocol for the evaluation process, and reviews a set of metrics that can be evaluated. The practices in this paper are motivated by similar procedures in nearby areas, such as machine learning, and information retrieval.", "paper_title": "Tutorial on application-oriented evaluation of recommendation systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000318470700005"}
