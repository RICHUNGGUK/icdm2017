In this paper, we propose a new infrastructure called MicroTextCluster Cube (or MiTexCube) to support efficient online text analysis on multidimensional text databases by introducing micro-clusters of text documents as a compact representation of text content. Experimental results on real multidimensional text databases show that (i) MiTexCube can be materialized efficiently with reasonable overhead in space, and (ii) applications based on the proposed materialized MiTexCube are more efficient than the baseline method of direct analysis based on document units in each cell, without sacrificing much quality of analysis, and MiTexCube naturally accommodates flexible trade-off between efficiency and quality of analysis.
