Chip dimensions, size, and location of the supply pads, metal coverage, piecewise distribution of IC consumption, and the resistance between the pads and the power supply are considered to obtain closed-form expressions for the IR-drop. The IR-drop model is validated by comparing its results with electrical simulations. The obtained error is in the range of 1%.", "paper_title": "IR-Drop in On-Chip Power Distribution Networks of ICs With Nonuniform Power Consumption", "paper_id": "WOS:000315639900011"}
