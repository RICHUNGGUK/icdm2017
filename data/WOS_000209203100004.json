In this paper, a novel adaptive filter, the least squares support vector machines adaptive filter (LS-SVMAF), is proposed to overcome this problem. Compared with traditional methods like multi layer perceptron (MLP), LS-SVM shows a superior performance of nonlinear modeling with small scale of data set or high dimensional input space. With the LS-SVMAF, we can model and predict the hand tremor more effectively and improve the precision and reliability in the master-slave robotic system for microsurgery. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter and its superior performance over its competing rivals.", "paper_title": "Adaptive least squares support vector machines filter for hand tremor canceling in microsurgery", "paper_id": "WOS:000209203100004"}
