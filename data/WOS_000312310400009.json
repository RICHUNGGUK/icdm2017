In this paper, we identify that the funneling effect occurs not only close to the sink but also within the network region where nodes have collision and induce heavy traffic to relay; we name it hot-spot funneling effect. This paper aims to improve the throughput and fairness of WCNs by mitigating the micro funneling effect. We propose a new mechanism, the backoff differentiation for contention resolution (BDCR), which is targeted to a system-wide high throughput on the basis of the contention resolution mechanism. To achieve high spatial reuses, BDCR divides the network into several regions and does backoff differentiation within each region. Within each backoff differentiation region, the backoff window range is adjusted according to the traffic rate, and at the same time, the backoff values are set with the awareness of the traffic intensity level. All regions share the same algorithm, which uses Kelly's rate control theory and method to allow each sensor to locally adjust its backoff value. One of the key advantages of BDCR is that it is extremely easy to implement. With extensive simulations and testbed experiments, BDCR is proved to achieve much higher throughput over the traditional carrier sense multiple access and some recent media access control protocols in literature, particularly when the network suffers intensive congestions.
