This aspect is more important if we target at portable devices, which have limited hardware capabilities. Developing new means for improving the interaction with 3D content in mobile devices is key. The aim of this work is to present a technique which can manage the level-of-detail of 3D meshes in portable devices. This solution has been devised considering the restrictions that this kind of devices poses. The results section shows how the integration has been successful while obtaining good performance.", "paper_title": "Efficient visualization of 3D models on hardware-limited portable devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000343080700021"}
