We point out some flaws in the variable delayed neural network proposed by Chen, and demonstrate that DCNN-AC is a powerful chaotic neural network through analyzing its single neural model and its \"beautiful\" chaotic dynamics. DCNN-AC has richer and more flexible chaotic dynamics and flexible annealing controlling strategies, so that it can be expected to have higher searching ability for globally optimal or near-optimal solutions. The DCNN-AC performance has been verified by simulations on some MCP benchmark instances. The comparisons with some famous proximate algorithms show the superiority of DCNN-AC in terms of the solution quality and the comparable computation time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
