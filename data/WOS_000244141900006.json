Metrically speaking, those graphs are equivalent to complete graphs; however they have far fewer edges when considering the Manhattan distance (we give here an upper bound on the number of saved edges). This article provides several theoretical, algorithmic, and complexity features of dilation-free graphs in the I-1-metric, giving several construction algorithms and proving some of their properties. Moreover, special attention is paid to the planar case due to its applications in the design of printed circuit boards.
