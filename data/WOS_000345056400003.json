We present some properties which allow us to obtain an algorithm that compares the behavior of two implicitly defined algebraic plane curves at the infinity. As an important result, we prove that if two plane algebraic curves have the same asymptotic behavior, the Hausdorff distance between them is finite. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
