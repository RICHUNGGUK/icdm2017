And a general theoretic analysis model is presented to obtain its throughput, which is also suitable for analyzing the performance of other protocols (such as S-ALOHA and S-ALOHA with cooperative transmission (C-ALOHA)) and is shown to be right and effective. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed protocol can improve the maximal throughput by 190% and 132% over a Rayleigh fading channel, respectively, as compared with S-ALOHA and C-ALOHA. And the results show that our protocol can provide an effective random access method with high throughput for wireless transmission.", "paper_title": "Throughput analysis of slotted ALOHA with cooperative transmission using successive interference cancellation", "paper_id": "WOS:000273575000013"}
