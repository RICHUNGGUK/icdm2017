Many computer simulations already exist for this task, mostly in neural networks. This article presents a new simulation approach, the first attempt to simulate the Stroop task using the properties of complexity and auto-adaptivity in a massive multi-agent system. Our approach allows us to simulate the time effects of cognitive impairment on the task, the adaptive cognitive behaviours involved, and is a first step for the simulation of cognitive disorders.", "paper_title": "Testing variation of attention capacities in a complex auto-adaptive system: a Stroop task simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000299541900001"}
