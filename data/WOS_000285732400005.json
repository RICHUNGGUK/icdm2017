Among these, the emerging field of ubiquitous learning is gradually attracting the attention of researchers; the key difference between u-learning and m-learning lies in the aspect of \"situation.\" Some studies showed that situated learning stimulates the establishment of learning impressions and learning experiences. On the other hand, some studies found that learning English through reading sentences or articles instead of the typical vocabulary-based system promotes learners' understanding of the connection between Words, the contextual meaning of words, and the methods of organization and expression. For this reason, this study proposes a mobile English reading learning system that integrates \"contextual information\" and \"situated learning.\" The system adopts RFID to detect the immediate location of the learners and then not merely provides the learners with English articles that are highly related to their location and situation but also provides them with reading support in words, sentence, paragraph, and article levels. Moreover, this study introduces three advanced indicators for developing learning strategies based on the learning portfolio. This study also conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation on both learning performance and system acceptance rate.", "paper_title": "Location Awareness Mobile Situated English Reading Learning System", "paper_id": "WOS:000285732400005"}
