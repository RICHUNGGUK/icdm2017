In this paper, based on the total variation (TV) we propose a new variational method for recovering images degraded by Cauchy noise and blurring. In order to obtain a strictly convex model, we add a quadratic penalty term, which guarantees the uniqueness of the solution. Due to the convexity of our model, the primal dual algorithm is employed to solve the minimization problem. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method for simultaneously deblurring and denoising images corrupted by Cauchy noise. Comparison with other existing and well-known methods is provided as well.", "paper_title": "Variational Approach for Restoring Blurred Images with Cauchy Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000362417500019"}
