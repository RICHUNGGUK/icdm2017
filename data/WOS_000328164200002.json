In order to store and process such a great amount of data, cloud computing and MapReduce were applied to many fields of bioinformatics. In this paper, we first introduce the basic concepts of cloud computing and MapReduce, and their applications in bioinformatics. We then highlight some problems challenging the applications of cloud computing and MapReduce to bioinformatics. Finally, we give a brief guideline for using cloud computing in biology research.", "paper_title": "WHEN CLOUD COMPUTING MEETS BIOINFORMATICS: A REVIEW", "paper_id": "WOS:000328164200002"}
