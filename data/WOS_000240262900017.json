However, since the intention of cluster analysis is a global partition of a data set into clusters, it is not suitable to identify single clusters in a large data set where the majority of the data can not be assigned to meaningful clusters. This paper presents a new objective function-based approach to identify a single good cluster in a data set making use of techniques known from prototype-based, noise and fuzzy clustering. The proposed method can either be applied in order to identify single clusters or to carry out a standard cluster analysis by finding clusters step by step and determining the number of clusters automatically in this way.", "paper_title": "Identifying single good clusters in data sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000240262900017"}
