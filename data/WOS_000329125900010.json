Due to the non-linear nature of process conversion mechanisms, metaheuristic algorithms are implemented in the framework to optimize operating conditions of process. Further, to apply complex kinetics in the process, we have made a linkage between process simulator (Aspen Plus) and Matlab. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, a hypothetical case study of a lignocellulosic biorefinery is utilized. The proposed framework results reveal a deviation in optimal process yields and production capacities from initial literature estimates. These results indicate the importance of developing a multilayered framework to optimally design a renewable energy production system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
