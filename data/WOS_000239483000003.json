In order to use CFNN to deal with non-numerical complicated data, rough set theory is adopted to improve the CFNN in this paper. First of all, we use rough set theory to extract core set of non-numerical attributes and decrease number of dimension of samples by reducing redundancy. Secondly, we can pre-classify the samples according to non-numerical attributes. Thirdly, we use CFNN to classify the samples according to numerical attributes. The proposed method not only increases classification accuracy but also speeds up classification process. Finally, the classification of wireless communication signals is given as an example to illustrate the validation of the proposed method in this paper.", "paper_title": "A modified constructive fuzzy neural networks for classification of large-scale and complicated data", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000003"}
