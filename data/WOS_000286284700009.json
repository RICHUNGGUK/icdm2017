However our empirical understanding of the reasons why particular DISTs are or are not used by different policy and management organisations, and the impacts they have on the work of those organisations is substantially weaker. Such understanding is needed to determine whether concerns raised in the literature about poor adoption and use of DISTs are correct, to understand why, and to remedy them. This paper presents a thematic analysis of 31 exploratory interviews with representatives of 14 desertification policy and management organisations operating at different scales about their use of DISTs: specifically GIS. remote sensing, simulation models, statistical models and DSS. DISTs of all types were found to be used along with other sources of decision and information support including hard-copy maps, aerial photography, databases, academic literature and local participation. GIS was most widely used, by 9 of the organisations interviewed. From the interview data a generic conceptual model identifying the organisational drivers for, constraints on and impacts of DIST use in desertification policy and management organisations is developed and discussed. Drivers were grouped into those concerned with system attributes (e.g. ease of use, flexibility) and those concerned with how information is used organisationally (e.g. to facilitate communication, assessment of desertification). Barriers including DIST information attributes such as reliability and uncertainty, and additional financial investment arising from training, employment and infrastructure procurement were identified. Impacts were grouped into structural changes, individual work changes and financial investment needs. No systematic variation was evident in the drivers, constraints or impacts of use according to DIST type, although GIS was the most widely used DIST and consequently was associated with a larger number of each., Results are discussed in relation to existing theory and evidence on information system and DSS adoption and use, and found to be in agreement. The paper finishes with a set of recommended improvements to DIST design processes to enhance the uptake of and positive benefits associated with use. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
