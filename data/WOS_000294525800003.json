Three forms of prime modulus and two types restriction on multiplier are considered in this paper. We perform computerized experiments that indicate significant differences exist among the number of primitive root of three forms of prime modulus. These differences can affect the performance of the spectral test. Two good 64-bit LCGs with significantly better spectral values and excellent empirical performance are presented. They are suitable for the requirements of today's computer simulation studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
