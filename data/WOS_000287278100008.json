Through iteration algorithm, between two sequences which are a sequence of state trajectories of linear quadratic zero-sum games and a sequence of corresponding Riccati differential equations, the optimal strategies for the nonaffine nonlinear zero-sum game are given. Under very mild conditions of local Lipschitz continuity, the convergence of approximating linear time-varying sequences is proved. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A NEW ITERATION APPROACH TO SOLVE A CLASS OF FINITE-HORIZON CONTINUOUS-TIME NONAFFINE NONLINEAR ZERO-SUM GAME", "paper_id": "WOS:000287278100008"}
