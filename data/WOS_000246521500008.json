Deformation of the antenna reflector affects antenna's electrical characteristics. In this paper, an analysis is made of the variation of antenna's performances under different employment conditions by applying the response surface method and the Coons divided-fitting method with presentation of the mathematical formula. Furthermore, three types of optimization models of the antenna structure are discussed and the main structural variables influencing electrical performances are analyzed. Finally, an example of multidisciplinary optimization design of an 8-m antenna is explored to illustrate the accuracy of the methods and the potential of application to improve the electrical performances of reflector antennas.", "paper_title": "On distorted surface analysis and multidisciplinary structural optimization of large reflector antennas", "paper_id": "WOS:000246521500008"}
