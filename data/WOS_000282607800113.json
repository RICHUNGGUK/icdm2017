Four combinations of EEG activities were also compared to investigate the difference in performance of these equations. The four equations tested were equation 1 (00), equation 2 (01(alpha+ beta)), equation 3 ((0 + alpha)beta), and equation 4 ((0 + alpha)1(alpha + beta)). A total of fifty male train drivers were recruited to perform a 30-min monotonous train-driving task while 2-channels of EEG (frontal and temporal) were recorded. At the frontal site, significant differences were found for theta (p = 0.045) and alpha (0.0001) activities, and at the temporal site, significant differences were found for delta (p = 0.007) and theta (0.01) activities. For the average of frontal and temporal site activities, significant differences were found for delta (p = 0.004), theta (p = 0.001), and beta (p = 0.048). Significant difference were found for temporal site for equation 1 (0/beta)(p = 0.04), and equation 4 ((0 + alpha)/(alpha + beta))(p = 0.02), and for the average of frontal and temporal site activities, significant differences were found for all four equations (equation 1 (p = 0.001), equation 2 (p = 0.006), equation 3 (p = 0.04), and equation 4 (p = 0.002)). These findings can be utilised as a potential fatigue indicator. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
