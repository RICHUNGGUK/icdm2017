The network moves around along with vehicles as a whole. According to NEMO basic support protocol (NEMO BSP), only one primary care of address (CoA) of MR can be registered with home agent, which will affect the handover performance. As an extension of NEMO BSP, multiple care of addresses (MCoA) registration scheme was proposed as Internet-draft and has received extensive researches. This paper studies the Internet connectivity of mobile router (MR) on the basis stated above; MR is equipped with WLAN, CDMA and GPRS interfaces simultaneously. Concretely, a smooth handover algorithm is proposed and experimented on our platform successfully; round trip time (RTT) of each link and the handover process between different interfaces are analyzed, respectively. Furthermore, the service disruption time and packet loss ratio performances are also compared between uni-interfaced MR scheme of NEMO BSP and scheme proposed in this paper, and the results indicate that multi-interfaced scheme not only supports large area movement across heterogeneous networks of MR, it also provides a seamless handover with no packet loss and little service disruption time.
