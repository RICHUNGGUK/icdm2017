The proposed algorithm recursively partitions a region into two subregions, starting from the largest scale. The segmentation process automatically terminates and detects when all the regions cannot be partitioned further. The number Of regions is not given and can be arbitrary. Furthermore, this method provides a full hierarchical representation that gives a Structure of a given image. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
