This scheme builds on a number of independent feature constructors (FCs) employed in the first s and a phone duration model (PDM) which operates on an extended feature vector in the second stage. The feature vector, v acts as input to the first stage, consists of numerical and non-numerical linguistic features extracted from text. The extended fe vector is obtained by appending the phone duration predictions estimated by the FCs to the initial feature vector. Experiment the American-English KED TIMIT and on the Modern Greek WCL-1 databases validated the advantage of the proposed two-scheme, improving prediction accuracy over the best individual predictor, and over a two-stage scheme which just fuses the first-outputs. Specifically, when compared to the best individual predictor, a relative reduction in the mean absolute error and the mean square error of 3.9% and 3.9% on the KED TIMIT, and of 4.8% and 4.6% on the WCL-1 database, respectively, is obse (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
