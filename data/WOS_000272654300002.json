We describe the existing procedure for oil and gas search which consists of manually extracting information from seismic data and then aggregating it into knowledge in a detail-oriented bottom-up approach. We then point out the weaknesses of this approach and propose how to improve on it by introducing a holistic computer-assisted top-down approach intended as a preparation step enabling a quicker, more focused and accurate bottom-up interpretation. The top-down approach also enables early representations of hypotheses and knowledge using domain-specific textures for annotating the data. Finally we discuss how these annotations can be extended to 3D for volumetric annotations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
