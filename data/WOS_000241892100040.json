In this paper, we put forward an estimation of distribution algorithm for fuzzy clustering gene expression data, which combines estimation of distribution algorithms and fuzzy logic. Comparing with sGA, our method can avoid many parameters and can converge quickly. Tests on real data show that EDA converges ten times as fast as sGA does in clustering gene expression data. For clustering accuracy, EDA can get a more reasonable result than sGA does in the worst situations although both methods can get the best results in the best situations.", "paper_title": "Estimation distribution of algorithm for fuzzy clustering gene expression data", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100040"}
