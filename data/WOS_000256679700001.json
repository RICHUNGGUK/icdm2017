Curvilinear text lines and small gaps between neighboring text lines present a challenge to algorithms developed for machine-printed or hand-printed documents. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on density estimation and a state-of-the-art image segmentation technique, the level set method. From an input document image, we estimate a probability map where each element represents the probability of the underlying pixel belonging to a text line. The level set method is then exploited to determine the boundary of neighboring text lines by evolving an initial estimate. Unlike connected component-based methods ([1] and [2], for example), the proposed algorithm does not use any script-specific knowledge. Extensive quantitative experiments on freestyle handwritten documents with diverse scripts such as Arabic, Chinese, Korean, and Hindi demonstrate that our algorithm consistently outperforms previous methods [1], [2], [3]. Further experiments show that the proposed algorithm is robust to scale change, rotation, and noise.", "paper_title": "Script-independent text line segmentation in freestyle handwritten documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000256679700001"}
