The results reported herein suggest that the hybrid algorithm, exploiting information sharing between the population elements, has the potential to improve the optimisation capability of classical DE algorithms. This claim is verified by running several experiments using state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, the significance of the frequency within which SDS introduces communication and information exchange is also investigated.", "paper_title": "Information sharing impact of stochastic diffusion search on differential evolution algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000209099300007"}
