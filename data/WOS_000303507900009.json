Additionally, different levels of protection should be possible to be addressed when manipulating the content towards the quality of experience maximization. This paper describes the use of a context-aware and Digital Rights Management (DRM)-enabled content adaptation platform towards meeting these challenges. The platform was conceived to deliver advanced content adaptation within different application scenarios, among which Virtual Collaboration (VC) was central. Descriptions of use cases implemented by the platform in heterogeneous VC environments are provided. Conducted experiments have highlighted the benefits to users when compared to an operation without the platform. Results of different adaptations suitable to sensed context conditions are also provided and analyzed. A brief description of the platform functionality is included together with pointers to additional information.", "paper_title": "Advanced delivery of sensitive multimedia content for better serving user expectations in Virtual Collaboration applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000303507900009"}
