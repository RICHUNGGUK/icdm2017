However little is known about teacher education in this area. The study aimed to investigate the sources and nature of secondary school teachers' education about computer-related ergonomics. It also investigated the use of computers by secondary school children. The study included all secondary schools in the Republic of Ireland. The findings suggest that computers are widely available and are used frequently by students and teachers. However, there is evidence that teachers are not receiving information on computer-related ergonomics. Teachers were generally dissatisfied with this and would welcome information on the subject. The study discusses the implications of the findings and makes recommendations to meet the needs of the teachers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
