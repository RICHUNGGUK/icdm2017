This paper also provides a comparative study of these control techniques. Design/methodology/approach - Battery chargers would play an important role in the development of new battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The control techniques of these OCBCs can significantly influence the BEV performance during the charging mode from the ac grid. In addition, the proper selection of control systems of the OCBCs has a great impact on the power quality of the AC grid during the charging period. Therefore, this paper presents the analysis of different control techniques that are commonly used to control the battery chargers. In addition, a comparative study of different control techniques of the OCBCs for BEVs is provided. Findings - The results have demonstrated that it is possible to significantly improve the efficiency, power factor and total harmonic distortion by using proportional-integral control and proportional-resonant control. The digital control can be used to validate the selected control technique. Originality/value - The main objective of this paper is to analyze the different control methods that can be used to control the OCBCs during charging mode from the ac grid. In addition, this paper presents a comparative analysis between these control methods. In this paper, a digital control based on TMS320F2808 DSP is used to implement the proper control method for OCBCs.", "paper_title": "Modeling and analysis of different control techniques of conductive battery chargers for electric vehicles applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000349641700011"}
