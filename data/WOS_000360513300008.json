Although several approximate algorithms have been proposed for this NP-hard problem, none of them can use the excellent speed-up method by Taillard (1990) [22] for makespan minimisation due to the special structure of the problem under consideration. In this paper, several properties of the problem are defined in order to be able to partly apply Taillard's acceleration. This mechanism, together with a novel feasible tabu local search method, allows us to further exploit the structure of solutions of the problem, and are incorporated in two proposed algorithms: a bounded-insertion-based constructive heuristic and an advanced non-population-based algorithm. These algorithms are compared with state-of-the-art algorithms under the same computer conditions. The results show that both algorithms improve existing ones and therefore, constitute the new state-of-art approximate solution procedures for the problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
