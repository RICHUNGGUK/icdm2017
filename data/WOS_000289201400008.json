Efficiency is analysed using fuzzy DEA techniques and the ranking is based on the statistical analysis of cases that include representative situations. The method enables the removal of the sometimes unrealistic hypothesis of a perfect trade-off between increased inputs and outputs. This model is compared with other DEA models that work with imprecise or fuzzy data. As an illustration, we apply our ranking method to the evaluation of a group of Spanish seaports, as well as teams playing in the Spanish football league. We compare the results with other methods and we show that our method enables a total ranking of the seaports, and that the ranking of football teams is found to be more consistent with final league positions.", "paper_title": "RANKING DECISION MAKING UNITS BY MEANS OF SOFT COMPUTING DEA MODELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289201400008"}
