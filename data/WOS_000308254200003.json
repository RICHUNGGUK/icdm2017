We describe here a dictionary methods language dREL that has been designed to enable complex data relationships to be expressed as formulaic scripts in data dictionaries written in DDLm [Spadaccini and Hall J. Chem Inf. Model 2012 doi:10.1021/ci300075z]. dREL describes data relationships in a simple but powerful canonical form that is easy to read and understand and can be executed computationally to evaluate or validate data The execution of dREL expressions is not a substitute for traditional scientific computation; it is to provide precise data dependency information to domain specific definitions and a means for cross validating data Some scientific fields apply conventional programming languages to methods scripts but these tend to inhibit both dictionary development and accessibility dREL removes the programming barrier and encourages the production of the metadata needed for seamless data archiving and exchange in science.", "paper_title": "dREL: A Relational Expression Language for Dictionary Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000308254200003"}
