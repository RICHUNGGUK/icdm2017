To provide a model for such cases a poset valued preference relation is introduced as a fuzzy relation on a set of alternatives with membership values in a partially ordered set. We analyze its properties and prove the representation theorem in terms of particular order reversing involution on the co-domain poset. We prove that for every set of alternatives there is a poset valued preference whose cut relations are all relations on this domain. We also deal with particular transitivity of such preferences.", "paper_title": "POSET-VALUED PREFERENCE RELATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000368042700003"}
