For the same purpose, discriminative training of HMMs has also been used. In this letter we investigate the effectiveness of these two techniques and their combination. We also investigate the robustness of matched and mismatched noise conditions between training and evaluation environments.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of Combinational Use of Discriminant Analysis-Based Acoustic Feature Transformation and Discriminative Training", "paper_id": "WOS:000274537600028"}
