In a typical scenario, two groups of aligned sequences will share a common motif but will differ in their functional annotation. The inclusion of the background alignment provides an appropriate underlying amino acid or nucleotide distribution and addresses intersite symbol correlations. In addition, the difference detection process is sensitive to the sizes of the aligned groups. Two Sample Logo extends WebLogo, a widely-used sequence logo generator.
