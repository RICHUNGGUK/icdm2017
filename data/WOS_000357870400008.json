It represents a general-purpose thesaurus for the environment, which has been published as a SKOS dataset in the Linked Open Data cloud. It promises to become a core tool for indexing and discovery environmental resources by refining and extending GEMET, which is considered the de facto standard when speaking of general-purpose thesaurus for the environment in Europe, besides it has been interlinked to popular LOD datasets as AGROVOC, EUROVOC, DBPEDIA and UMTHES. The paper illustrates the main characteristics of EARTh as a guide to its usage. It clarifies (i) the methodology adopted to define the EARTh content; (ii) the design and technological choices made when publishing EARTh as Linked Data; (iii) the information pertaining to its access and maintenance. Descriptions of EARTh applications and future relevance are highlighted.", "paper_title": "EARTh: An Environmental Application Reference Thesaurus in the Linked Open Data cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000357870400008"}
