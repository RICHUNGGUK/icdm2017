It exploits the feature of a trained one-class SVM, which uses points only residing on the exterior region of data distribution as support vectors. Thus, the proposed training set reduction method selects the so-called extreme points which sit on the boundary of data distribution, through local geometry and k-nearest neighbours. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce training set considerably, while the obtained model maintains generalization capability to the level of a model trained on the full training set, but uses less support vectors and exhibits faster training speed.
