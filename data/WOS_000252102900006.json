Our approach is based on the following simple idea given in [R.D. Lazarov, P.S. Vassilevski, L.T. Zikatanov, Multilevel preconditioning of second order elliptic discontinuous Galerkin problems, Preprint, 2005]. The finite element space V of piece-wise polynomials, discontinuous on the partition J, is projected onto the space of piece-wise constant functions on the same partition that constitutes the largest space in the multilevel method. The discontinuous Galerkin finite element system on this space is associated to the so-called \"graph-Laplacian\". In 2-D this is a sparse M-matrix with - 1 as off diagonal entries and nonnegative row sums. Under the assumption that the finest partition is a result of multilevel refinement of a given coarse mesh, we develop the concept of hierarchical splitting of the unknowns. Then using local analysis we derive estimates for the constants in the strengthened Cauchy-Bunyakowski-Schwarz (CBS) inequality, which are uniform with respect to the levels. This measure of the angle between the spaces of the splitting was used by Axelsson and Vassilevski in [Algebraic multilevel preconditioning methods II, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 27 (1990) 1569-15901 to construct an algebraic multilevel iteration (AMLI) for finite element systems. The main contribution in this paper is a construction of a splitting that produces new estimates for the CBS constant for graph-Laplacian. As a result we have a preconditioner for the system of the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method of optimal arithmetic complexity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
