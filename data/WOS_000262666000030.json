In addition, the missing information behind foreground objects is filled with an additional image of the areas occluded by nearer objects. The method creates high-quality depth-of-field results even in the presence of partial occlusion, without major artifacts often present in the previous real-time methods. The method can also be applied to simulating defocused highlights. The entire framework is accelerated by GPU, enabling real-time post-processing for both off-line and interactive applications.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Depth-of-Field Rendering Using Point Splatting on Per-Pixel Layers", "paper_id": "WOS:000262666000030"}
