The heat-kernel is the solution of the heat-equation and may be computed by exponentiating the Laplacian eigensystem with time. To characterise the shape of the heat-kernel trace we use the zeta-function, which is found by exponentiating and summing the reciprocals of the Laplacian eigenvalues. From the Mellin transform, it follows that the zeta-function is the moment generating function of the heat-kernel trace. We explore the use of the heat-kernel moments as a means of characterising graph structure for the purposes of clustering. Experiments with the COIL and Oxford-Caltech databases reveal the effectiveness of the representation.", "paper_title": "Trace formula analysis of graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100033"}
