The previous full implication inference principles are improved, and unified forms of the new method are respectively established for FMP (fuzzy modus ponens) and FMT (fuzzy modus tollens) to let different fuzzy implications be used under the same way. Furthermore, reversibility properties of the new method are analyzed from some conditions that many fuzzy implications satisfy, and it is found that its reversibility properties seem fine. Lastly, the more general alpha-symmetric implicational method is put forward, and its unified forms are achieved. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
