Using the compact difference schemes and Runge-Kutta (R-K) method, the time evolutions of temperature and complex flow fields are numerically studied for different types of porous fibrous media as well as width/height ratios of cubic cavities available to practical applications. The results indicate that the heat and mass transfer taking into account the adsorption effects is quite different from the case without consideration of adsorption effects. Taking into account the adsorption effects, the variation of isothermal surface with time is followed by the situation without consideration of sorption and it is shown that the temperature reaches a higher level and the streamline structure for fluid flow develops faster in the symmetrical plane. Furthermore, the numerical results are in good agreement with experimental data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
