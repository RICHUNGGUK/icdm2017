The distributed self-organisation of large numbers of bacteria into well-defined spatial structures is a form of computation that is deserving of further attention. In this paper we review how one particular collective response - bacterial chemotaxis - has been modelled in silico to generate novel algorithms. We describe how Such models may be further extended for the purposes of directed pattern-formation in bacteria, and conclude with a discussion of some fundamental questions that we aim to address with this approach.", "paper_title": "Bacterial self-organisation and computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000258954000004"}
