The core idea is using three rules to clarify regression raw data. The rules are realized through introducing a judge function on the regression datum whose value determines the importance of the datum. By applying the rules, a new pre-processing method for regression is developed. Performance of the new method on a series of simulations demonstrate that it not only significantly increases computational efficiency and robustness, but also preserves generalization capability of a regression method. Incorporated with any regression method, the developed method then can be efficiently applied to regression of large data sets.", "paper_title": "A new pre-processing method for regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000113"}
