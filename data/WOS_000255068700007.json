Similar to the classical SVM, the RMSVM searches for the separating hyper-plane that maximizes the rough margin, defined by the lower and upper margin. In this way, more data points are adaptively considered rather than the few extreme value points used in the classical SVM. In addition, different support vectors may have different effects on the learning of the separating hyper-plane depending on their positions in the rough margin. Points in the lower margin have more effects than those in the boundary of the rough margin. From experimental results on six benchmark datasets, the classification accuracy of this algorithm is improved without additional computational expense compared with the classical v-SVM.
