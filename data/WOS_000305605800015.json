This paper introduces light-power (LP) nonuniform cache architecture (NUCA), a tiled-cache addressing both goals. LP-NUCA places a group of small and low-latency tiles between the L1 and the last level cache (LLC) that adapt better to the application working sets and keep most recently evicted blocks close to L1. LP-NUCA is built around three specialized \"networks-in-cache,\" each aimed at a separate cache operation. To prove the design feasibility, we have fully implemented LP-NUCA in a 90-nm technology. From the VLSI implementation, we observe that the proposed networks-in-cache incur minimal area, latency, and power overhead. To further reduce the energy consumption, LP-NUCA employs two network-wide techniques (miss wave stopping and sectoring) that together reduce the dynamic cache energy by 35% without degrading performance. Our evaluations also show that LP-NUCA improves performance with respect to cache hierarchies similar to those found in high-end embedded processors. Similar results have been obtained after scaling to a 32-nm technology.", "paper_title": "LP-NUCA: Networks-in-Cache for High-Performance Low-Power Embedded Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000305605800015"}
