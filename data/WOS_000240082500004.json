Previous attempts of finding such good reasons focused on finding some minimally unsatisfiable sub-clause-set F' of F, which in general suffers from the non-uniqueness of F' (and thus it will only find some reason, albeit there might be others). In our work, we develop a fuller approach, enabling a more fine-grained analysis of necessity and redundancy of clauses, supported by meaningful semantical and proof-theoretical characterisations. We combine known techniques for searching and enumerating minimally unsatisfiable subclause-sets with (full) autarky search. To illustrate our techniques, we give a detailed analysis of well-known industrial problem instances.", "paper_title": "Categorisation of clauses in conjunctive normal forms: Minimally unsatisfiable sub-clause-sets and the lean kernel", "paper_id": "WOS:000240082500004"}
