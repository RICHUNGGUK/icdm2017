This trend in Business Intelligence (BI) is popularized under the term mobile BI. Various studies indicate a strong increase in the adoption of this technology. However. mobile BI implementations remain unexplored and unsupported by implementation methods. By devising a Mobile BI Implementation (MOBII) framework, this study aims to fill in this research gap. A systematic literature review revealed the following major implementation themes: (I) value creation, (2) application deployment, (3) information security, (4) workforce mobilization, (5) information delivery and (6) device management. Moreover, expert interviews revealed twenty key considerations, which are also included in the framework. Using a single case study the MOBII framework was successfully evaluated and its practical applicability was demonstrated by adapting an actively used BI implementation method.", "paper_title": "MOBILE BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE: KEY CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONS PROJECTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000332131000003"}
