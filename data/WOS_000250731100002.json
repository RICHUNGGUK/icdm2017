In this paper, we introduce a new metric of image complexity to enhance the evaluation of steganalysis performance. In addition, we also present a scheme of steganalysis of least significant bit (LSB) matching steganography, based on feature mining and pattern recognition techniques. Compared to other well-known methods of steganalysis of LSB matching steganography, our method performs the best. Results also indicate that the significance of features and the detection performance depend not only on the information-hiding ratio, but also on the image complexity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
