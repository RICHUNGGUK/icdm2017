Although a number of services have shown great potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of sensor registry, comprehensive methods that register sensors and algorithms in a catalogue service based on a process model are lacking. This paper addresses the registry of processes, including physical and non-physical processes, by using the OGC catalogue service. To provide more information on sensors and algorithms, the process catalogue information model extends the ebXML Registry information Model. The mapping between the metadata encoded in SensorML and the extended model includes more information for all types of processes. Moreover, the mapping includes the relationship among processes and their categories based on the properties of sensors and algorithms. The effectiveness of the improved model is registered and implemented in GEOSENSOR CSW, following the OGC \"transaction\" interface. Flooding experimental results demonstrate that the service can effectively and directly register sensors and algorithms so that processes can be flexibly executed according to users' demands.
