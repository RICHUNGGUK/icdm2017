With the introduction of the path computation element, routes can be calculated more efficiently in multi-domain optical networks. However, the optimal degree of routing approach in multi-layer and multi-domain optical networks is also determined by the clustering algorithms deployed for construction of hierarchical networks. Therefore, it is important to investigate the way to evaluate the impact of the clustering algorithm on the routing approach (e.g., blocking probability) in optical networks with dynamic traffic, which has not been studied sufficiently. In this paper, a novel method to describe and evaluate the clustered structures generated by different clustering algorithms for hierarchical optical networks is proposed. This method deploys a novel evaluation metric that represents blocking probability of clustered optical networks, so it can be used as guidelines for designing clustered structures. Besides theoretical analysis, simulations are carried out on different network topologies and clustered types to validate the effectiveness of the method presented.", "paper_title": "A novel method to evaluate clustering algorithms for hierarchical optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000301332600009"}
