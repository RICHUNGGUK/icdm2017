Using an FPGA as the implementation platform introduces greater flexibility into the design process and allows a new approach to embedded system design. Since there is no cost to reprogramming an FPGA, system performance can be measured on-chip in the runtime environment and the system's architecture can be altered based on an evaluation of the data to meet design requirements. In this article, we discuss a new hardware/software codesign methodology tailored to reconfigurable platforms and a design infrastructure created to incorporate on-chip design tools. This methodology utilizes the FPGA's reconfigurability during the design process to profile and verify system performance, thereby reducing system design time. Our current design infrastructure includes: a system specification tool, two on-chip profiling tools, and an on-chip system verification tool.", "paper_title": "Leveraging Reconfigurability in the Hardware/Software Codesign Process", "paper_id": "WOS:000299337400008"}
