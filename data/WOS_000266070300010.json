Due to the complex nature of the phenomena, electric PQ education at the undergraduate level is challenging. The instructional method is typically based on the traditional descriptive-inquiry approach. This article suggests that a time-domain computer-based simulation tool be used to supplement the traditional approach. The combined method allows students to simulate complex phenomena in a controlled environment so as to investigate the interaction between power system elements that give rise to the phenomena, and how the phenomena impact the system The combined method is expected to reinforce and enhance the student learning process. The article then presents three simulation examples to demonstrate how the time-domain simulation method can be integrated into the traditional descriptive-inquiry method. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals.
