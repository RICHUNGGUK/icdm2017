No redistance equation is used for the level-set function which is built from an accurate cubic spline interpolation of the markers describing the interface. Mass losses which usually appear with level-set functions are drastically reduced. Interface coupling with the incompressible momentum equation is taken into account thanks to the ghost-fluid method. Indeed, the particles allow an accurate computation of the local interfacial curvatures, and the capillary part of the pressure jump computed across the interface is more accurately evaluated. Results on static drop show a large decrease of spurious currents compared to other methods. Scalar advection validations and convergence studies are carried out as well as tough test-cases involving large density ratios (typically air/water). A better agreement with literature results is shown compared to classical approaches. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
