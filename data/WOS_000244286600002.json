The B-splines form a partition of unity and we define control points that constitute control triangles that give us a good insight in the shape of the spline. We further consider a number of CAGD applications such as approximation and compression of a given sphere-like triangular mesh, and editing global shape and local detail of a spline using spline subdivision.
