In the proposed model, all modeling outputs such as discharge, velocity and depth are developed as fuzzy numbers by taking into account all the available information and expert knowledge about the basic design/analysis parameters. The fuzzy outputs are then combined with performance assessment curves to calculate the hydraulic performance values. The proposed model was applied to a part of the sewer system of a city in Iran, and performance graphs were plotted. Such graphs can be used by design engineers and operation managers to improve the design quality, reliability and the performance of a system with uncertain parameters. The analysis results can also be used in decision-making and identifying priorities to develop rehabilitation strategies.", "paper_title": "Hydraulic performance analysis of sewer systems with uncertain parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000306535400010"}
