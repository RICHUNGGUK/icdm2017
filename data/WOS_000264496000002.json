The model is based on spatial references that capture the spatial relationship of a user's device with other co-located devices. Spatial references are obtained by relative position sensing and integrated in the mobile user interface to spatially visualize the arrangement of discovered devices, and to provide direct access for interaction across devices. In this paper we discuss two prototype systems demonstrating the utility of the model in collaborative and mobile settings, and present a study on usability of spatial list and map representations for device selection.", "paper_title": "Supporting device discovery and spontaneous interaction with spatial references", "paper_id": "WOS:000264496000002"}
