The approach is based on spatial \"domain decomposition\" in which molecular dynamics (MD) is used in regions where atomatic details are important, while classical continuum fluid dynamics is used in the remaining regions. The two descriptions are matched in a coupling region where we ensure continuity of mass, momentum, energy and their fluxes. The scheme for including the energy equation is implemented in 1-D and 2-D, and used to study steady and unsteady heat transfer in channel flows with and without nano roughness. Good agreement between hybrid results and analytical or pure MD results is bound, demonstrating the accuracy of this multiscale method and its potential applications in thermal engineering.
