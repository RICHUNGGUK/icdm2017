VVRKFA being an extension of fast regularized kernel function approximation (FRKFA), provides the vector-valued response at single step. The VVRKFA finds a linear operator and a bias vector by using a reduced kernel that maps a pattern from feature space into the low dimensional label space. The classification of patterns is carried out in this low dimensional label subspace. A test pattern is classified depending on its proximity to class centroids. The effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally verified and compared with multiclass support vector machine (SVM) on several benchmark data sets as well as on gene microarray data for multi-category cancer classification. The results indicate the significant improvement in both training and testing time compared to that of multiclass SVM with comparable testing accuracy principally in large data sets. Experiments in this brief also serve as comparison of performance of VVRKFA with stratified random sampling and sub-sampling.", "paper_title": "Discriminant Analysis for Fast Multiclass Data Classification Through Regularized Kernel Function Approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000278537600014"}
