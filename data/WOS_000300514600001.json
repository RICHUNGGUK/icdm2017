The widespread applications of CPSs still face enormous challenges because of the lack of theoretical foundations. In this technical survey, we review state-of-the-art design techniques from various angles. The aim of this work is to provide a better understanding of this emerging multidisciplinary methodology. The features of CPSs are described, and the research progress is analyzed using the following aspects: energy management, network security, data transmission and management, model-based design, control technique, and system resource allocation. We focus on CPS resource optimization, and propose a system performance optimization model with resource constraints. In addition, some classic applications (e.g., integrating intelligent road with unmanned vehicle) are provided to show that the prospects of CPSs are promising. Furthermore, research challenges and suggestions for future work are outlined in brief.", "paper_title": "Advances in Cyber-Physical Systems Research", "paper_id": "WOS:000300514600001"}
