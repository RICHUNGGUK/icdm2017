However, compared with the classical linear control algorithm, FCS-MPC requires a shorter control loop cycle time to reach the same control performance. To resolve this contradiction, this paper presents an effective method to simplify the conventional FCS-MPC. With equivalent transformation and specialized sector distribution method, the computation load of FCS-MPC is greatly reduced while the control performance is not affected. The proposed method can be used in various circuit topologies and cases with multiple constraints. Experiments on two-level converter and three-level NPC converter verify the good performance and application value of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A Simplified Finite-Control-Set Model-Predictive Control for Power Converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800014"}
