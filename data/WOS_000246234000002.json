Such overheads are a big obstacle for high-performance computing applications to exploit highspeed interconnects in cluster environments. To address this issue, many researchers have been presenting analyses of protocol overheads and suggesting a number of optimization approaches to harness the TCP/IP suite over high-speed interconnects. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study that analyzes and optimizes the protocol overheads thoroughly in an integrated manner. In this paper, we exploit a set of protocol optimization mechanisms in an integrated manner while dealing with the full spectrum of the protocol layers from the transport layer to the physical layer. To evaluate the impact of each protocol overhead, we apply the optimization mechanisms one by one and perform detailed analyses at each step. The thorough overhead measurements and analyses reveal the dependencies between protocol overheads. With our comprehensive optimizations, we show that UDP/IP can utilize more than 95% of the maximum network throughput a Myrinet-based experimental system can provide.", "paper_title": "Impact of protocol overheads on network throughput over high-speed interconnects: measurement, analysis, and improvement", "paper_id": "WOS:000246234000002"}
