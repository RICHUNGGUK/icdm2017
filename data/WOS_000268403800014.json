This is a deformable model used for image segmentation that integrates features of region-based and edge-based segmentation techniques, being able to fit the edges of the objects and model their inner topology. In this paper the active nets incorporate new energy terms for the optic disc localisation and their optimisation is performed with a genetic algorithm, with adapted or new ad hoc genetic operators. There is no need of any pre-processing of the images, which allows a quasi automatic localisation of the optic disc. This process also provides a simultaneous segmentation of the disc. We present representative results of optic disc localisations showing the advantages of the approach, with images focusing on the optic disc or on the macula, and with images with different levels of noise and lesion areas.
