We propose an outline to design an instance generator using an expanding graph of a certain type, called here an \"exact 1/2-enlarger\". We first show a simple algorithm for constructing an exact 1/2-enlarger, thereby deriving one concrete polynomial-time instance generator GEN. We also show that an exact 1/2-enlarger can be obtained with high probability from graphs randomly constructed. From this fact, we propose another type of instance generator RGEN; it produces a 2-CNF formula with a solution which is optimal for the formula with high probability. However, RGEN produces less structured formulas and a much larger class of formulas than GEN. In fact, we prove the NP-hardness of MAX2SAT over the set of 2-CNF formulas produced by RGEN.", "paper_title": "Generating instances for MAX2SAT with optimal solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000240364100008"}
