However, insufficient care in managing the process before the organizational decision to adopt information technology (IT) can result in poor outcomes. With most previous research focusing on IT adoption, this paper develops a multi-stage theoretical framework for the pre-adoption phase of healthcare IT to address this practical challenge and gap in the literature. With a priori concepts identified from previous multi-stage models, our framework was developed by analyzing two cases of the introduction of vital signs monitoring systems in hospitals to identify the important stages and influencing factors for healthcare IT pre-adoption.
