However would this kind of nanocompounds be able to encapsulate dianions and dications? This would be very interesting from an experimental point of view, since it would allow the isolation of such divalent ions. Moreover, the resulting endohedral complexes would serve as building blocks for new cluster-assembled materials, with enhanced stability arising from the electrostatic interaction between the incarcerated ions. In this work we have studied the structure and stability of (X@(CdS)(i))(+/- 2) with X = Be, Mg, Ca, O, S, Se and i = 9, 12, 15, 16 on the basis of Density Functional Theory and Quantum Molecular Dynamics simulations. Most of the nanoclusters are found to trap both chalcogen and alkaline earth atoms. Furthermore, the chalcogen doped clusters are calculated to be both thermodynamically and thermally stable. However, only a few of alkaline earth metal doped structures are predicted to be thermally stable. Therefore, the charge of the dopant atom appears to be crucial in the endohedral doping. Additionally, the absorption spectra of the title compounds have been simulated by means of Time Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) calculations. The calculated optical features show a blueshift with respect to the bulk CdS wurtzite. Furthermore, doping modifies notably the optical spectra of nanoclusters, as the absorption spectra shift to lower energies upon encapsulation.", "paper_title": "CdS nanoclusters doped with divalent atoms", "paper_id": "WOS:000338632200050"}
