The tests axe consistent against the 'new better, than used in expectation' (NBUE) class of alternatives. Consistency is shown and the limit null distribution of the test statistic is derived, while efficiency results axe also provided. The finite-sample properties of the proposed procedure in comparison to more standard procedures are investigated via simulation.", "paper_title": "A CLASS OF TESTS FOR EXPONENTIALITY BASED ON A CONTINUUM OF MOMENT CONDITIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000275281200005"}
