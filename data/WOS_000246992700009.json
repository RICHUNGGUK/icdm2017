Its main characteristic is that it is lightweight and that it can be easily adapted to heterogeneous SIP implementations. The paper analyzes several real-life attacks on VoIP services and proposes a novel detection and protection mechanism that is validated through an experimental test-bed under different test scenarios. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the employment of such a mechanism for the detection of malformed messages imposes negligible overheads in terms of the overall SIP system performance.
