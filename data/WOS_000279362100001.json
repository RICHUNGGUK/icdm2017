However, no significant effort has been made to take these issues into account in a systematic, well structured and comprehensive development process. To overcome the lack of such a process, a framework based on the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is proposed for the development of a hybrid MD model at the conceptual level and for the automatic derivation of its logical representation. Also, a running example is shown throughout this paper.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid Model Driven Development Framework for the Multidimensional Modeling of Data Warehouses", "paper_id": "WOS:000279362100001"}
