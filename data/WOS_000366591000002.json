A full kinematic description of the structure is obtained for the case when the maximum allowable tensile stress is greater than or equal to the allowable compressive stress. Although formal proof of optimality of the solution presented is not yet available, the proposed analytical solution is supported by substantial numerical evidence, involving the solution of problems with in excess of 10 billion potential members. Furthermore, numerical solutions for various combinations of unequal allowable stresses suggest the existence of a family of related, simple, and practically relevant structures, which range in form from a Hemp-type arch with vertical hangers to a structure which strongly resembles a cable-stayed bridge.", "paper_title": "Optimum structure for a uniform load over multiple spans", "paper_id": "WOS:000366591000002"}
