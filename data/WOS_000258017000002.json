They are based on the Navier-Stokes equations with low Mach number preconditioning. By alleviating the large disparity between acoustic waves and fluid speeds, the preconditioned flow and adjoint equations are numerically solved with affordable CPU cost, even at the socalled incompressible flow conditions. Either by employing the adjoint to the preconditioned flow equations or by preconditioning the adjoint to the 'standard' flow equations (under certain conditions the two formulations become equivalent, as proved in this paper), efficient optimization methods with reasonable cost per optimization cycle, even at very low Mach numbers, are derived. During the mathematical development, a couple of assumptions are made which are proved to be harmless to the accuracy in the computed gradients and the effectiveness of the optimization method. The proposed approaches are validated in inviscid and viscous flows in external aerodynamics and turbomachinery flows at various Mach numbers.
