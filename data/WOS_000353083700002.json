The recent solution of the long standing problem of the existence of spherical t-designs on S-d with O (9 (t(d)) number of points by A. Bondarenko, D. Radchenko, and M. Viazovska attracted new interest to this subject. Secondly, D.P. Hardin and E.B. Saff proved that point sets minimising the discrete Riesz energy on S-d in the hypersingular case are asymptotically uniformly distributed. Both results are of great relevance to the problem of describing the quality of point distributions on S-d, as well as finding point sets, which exhibit good distribution behaviour with respect to various quality measures.
