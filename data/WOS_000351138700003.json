To describe the relationships among quality characteristics, a concept named \"linkage\" is defined and the QCs-linkage model is introduced including linkage network and linkage matrix. Based on the QCs-linkage model, a quality problem processing framework is put forward, in which the quality problem is analyzed and handled in the granularity of components and characteristics. The component function flow matrix is adopted to describe component relationships, based on which the abnormal component and quality problem analysis space are determined. A variation cost oriented key quality characteristic identification algorithm is given and the QCs-linkage model is constructed. Then the quality problem is handled with source-targeted and non-source-targeted strategies. The following part discusses methods of quality problem prevention based on the component linkage degree and similarity degree. Finally a case of a single-cylinder reciprocating engine study presented in this paper indicates that the framework can provide support for the quality problem analysis.", "paper_title": "QCs-linkage model based quality problem processing framework: a Chinese experience in complex product development", "paper_id": "WOS:000351138700003"}
