It is based on spherical parameterization and umbrella-operator smoothing. Our main contribution lies in adopting a low-distortion spherical parameterization approach to generate high-quality subdivision connectivity meshes. Besides, a simple and efficient point location method on the sphere based on the uniform partition of the rectangle is presented, which is used to find the containing triangle in the spherical mesh for each point on the sphere rapidly. Our method can generate high-quality subdivision connectivity meshes fast, which can be applied to level of detail and progressive transmission. All the application examples demonstrate that our remeshing procedure is robust and efficient.
