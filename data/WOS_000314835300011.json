Especially in ultra-high frequency (UHF) RF identification (RFID) systems noise plays and important role. This is because the noise performance of the receiver chain is defined not only by the intrinsic noise of the receiver, but also by the large self-jammer signal. This self-jammer signal on the one hand requires that the receiver is designed for high input dynamic range which increases the intrinsic noise of the receiver. On the other hand this self-jammer signal through the effects of reciprocal mixing and range correlation contributes significantly to the total noise of the receiver. To our knowledge this is the first work that deals in detail with the amplitude and phase noise in a UHF RFID system.", "paper_title": "Noise analysis of the UHF RFID system", "paper_id": "WOS:000314835300011"}
