We address service-level and operation-level versioning, service endpoint mapping, and version sequencing. We also propose annotation extensions for developing versioned web services in Java. We have tested the proposed solution for versioning in two real-world environments and identified considerable improvements in service development and maintenance efficiency, improved service reuse, and simplified governance.
