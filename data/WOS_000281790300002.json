The most general tag structure for capturing dependences is shown to be inadequate for the task. A new tag structure is proposed. Comparison of the method with existing ones reveals that the proposed method has no dependence on schedule length in terms of modeling efficiency and it shares the same order of complexity with existing approaches. The proposed method, however, is shown to bear promise of applicability to other models of computation and hence to heterogeneous system models having such constituent models.", "paper_title": "A Tag Machine Based Performance Evaluation Method for Job-Shop Schedules", "paper_id": "WOS:000281790300002"}
