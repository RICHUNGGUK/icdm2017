In this paper, we present a physically based approach to this problem, using the linear elasticity model and a finite elements method. To handle large deformations in the linear elasticity model, we exploit the domain decomposition method, based on the observation that each sub-domain undergoes a relatively small local deformation, involving a global rigid transformation. In order to efficiently solve the deformation at each simulation time step, we pre-compute the object responses in terms of displacement accelerations to the forces acting on each node, yielding a force-displacement matrix. However, the force-displacement matrix could be too large to handle for densely tessellated objects. To address this problem, we present two methods. The first method exploits spatial coherence to compress the force-displacement matrix using the clustered principal component analysis method; and the second method pre-computes only the force-displacement vectors for the boundary vertices of the sub-domains and resorts to the Cholesky factorization to solve the acceleration for the internal vertices of the sub-domains. Finally, we present some experimental results to show the large deformation effects and fast performance on complex large scale objects under interactive user manipulations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
