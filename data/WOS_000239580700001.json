This proposal is based on the exploitation of an in-depth exploration of a well-experienced sociological theory, the Sociology of Organized Action, also called Strategic Analysis. This theory intends to discover the functioning of any organization beyond its formal rules, especially how social actors build the organization that in return rules their behaviors, and which are the mechanisms they use to regulate their interactions. We first present the concepts developed by this theory to reveal the strategic aspects of the actors' behaviors in an organized actions framework. Then we introduce a meta-model that allows us to describe the structure of Concrete Action Systems and how social actors handle its elements. A classical case study is used to illustrate the approach.", "paper_title": "A coordination framework based on the sociology of organized action", "paper_id": "WOS:000239580700001"}
