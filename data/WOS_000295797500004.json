In this paper, an adaptive approach is presented to optimize the tradeoff between service performance and security according to SBS users' requirements and preferences on performance and security. This adaptive approach is based on a tradeoff algorithm with quantitative performance and security metrics and the tradeoff objective function. An SBS example with a security service and a traffic service is used to illustrate the approach.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Approach to Optimizing Tradeoff Between Service Performance and Security in Service-Based Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000295797500004"}
