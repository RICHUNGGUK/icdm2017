Some flow phenomena lead to velocity fields with discontinuities that cause the deformation of the texture which is not properly controlled by these techniques. We propose a method to detect and visualize discontinuities on a flow, keeping consistent texture advection at both sides of the discontinuity. The method handles the possibility that the discontinuity travels across the domain of the flow with arbitrary velocity, estimating its speed with least-squares approximation. The technique is tested with different sample scenarios and with two avalanche scenes, showing that it can run at interactive rates.", "paper_title": "Texture advection on discontinuous flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000357487500028"}
