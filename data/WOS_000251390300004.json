There are various methods from the areas of statistics and data mining for that purpose. In this article we propose PREVENT, an algorithm which uses inter-transactional patterns for the prediction of rare events in transaction databases. PREVENT is a general purpose inter-transaction association rules mining algorithm that optimally fits the demands of rare event prediction. It requires only 1 scan on the original database and 2 over the transformed, which is considerably smaller and it is complete as it does not miss any patterns. We provide the mathematical formulation of the problem and experimental results that shows PREVENT's efficiency in terms of run time and effectiveness in terms of sensitivity and specificity.", "paper_title": "Detection and prediction of rare events in transaction databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000251390300004"}
