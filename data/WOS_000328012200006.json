Two guidance laws are proposed to solve this problem, and both explicitly take into account the constraints on the steering angle and ensure tracking an arbitrarily curved path. The first law is implemented by the pure sliding-mode controller, whereas the second one combines the sliding mode approach with a smooth nonlinear control law and requests control chattering at the reduced amplitude as compared with the first law. Mathematically rigorous proofs of global convergence and robust stability of the proposed guidance laws are presented. In doing so, the slipping effects are treated as bounded uncertainties. Simulation results and real world experiments confirm the applicability and performance of the proposed guidance approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
