The theoretical framework is essentially based in a simple extension of the HMO approach, leading to compute molecular CSM energy spectra, constituting a useful step for construction of first and higher order CSM terms. This permits in turn to connect the general CMS theoretical framework with the fundaments of structure-property relationships and allows the evaluation of statistical mechanics CMS partition functions and the deduction of CMS thermodynamical functions as well.", "paper_title": "Extensions and Foundations of the Continuous Symmetry Measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000266748900004"}
