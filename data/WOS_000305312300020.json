Exactly counting the number of assignments is #P-complete, since Irving and Leather demonstrated #P-completeness for the special case of the stable marriage problem (Irving and Leather, 1986 [11]). We show that counting the number of stable roommate assignments in the k-attribute model (#k-ATTRIBUTE SR, k >= 4) and the 3-Euclidean model (#k-EUCLIDEAN SR, k >= 3) is interreducible, in an approximation-preserving sense, with counting independent sets (of all sizes) (#IS) in a graph, or counting the number of satisfying assignments of a Boolean formula (#SAT). This means that there can be no FPRAS for any of these problems unless NP = RP. As a consequence, we infer that there is no FPRAS for counting stable roommate assignments (#SR) unless NP = RP. Utilizing previous results by Chebolu, Goldberg and Martin (2010) [3], we give an approximation-preserving reduction from counting the number of independent sets in a bipartite graph (#BIS) to counting the number of stable roommate assignments both in the 3-attribute model and in the 2-Euclidean model. #BIS is complete with respect to approximation-preserving reductions in the logically-defined complexity class #RH Pi(1). Hence, our result shows that an FPRAS for counting stable roommate assignments in the 3-attribute model would give an FPRAS for all #RH Pi(1). We also show that the 1-attribute stable roommate problem always has either one or two stable roommate assignments, so the number of assignments can be determined exactly in polynomial time.
