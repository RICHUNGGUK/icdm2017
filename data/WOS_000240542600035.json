This paper proposes a new rerouting algorithm to achieve a fast handoff based on k-hop backtracking mechanism. The algorithm can dynamically decide the backtracking hops according to the velocity of wireless devices and the current network bandwidth through iterative strategy. During the backtracking process, our algorithm is able to find out an optimized route for the handoff network services and require all intermediate nodes which has received the Location Update information forward all received packets to Mobile Terminal with their optimal route to the destination subscriber station. This will greatly reduce the cost of packet forwarding during the handoff process.", "paper_title": "Backtracking based handoff rerouting algorithm for WiMAX mesh mode", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600035"}
