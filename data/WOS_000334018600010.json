This study has developed 3D explicit dynamics finite element (FE) models to investigate the deformation of press-fit metal cups following insertion in the acetabular cavity. The cup deformation following insertion is clearly influenced by the forces encountered during insertion, the initial position of the cup in the cavity, the support provided by the underlying bone and the geometry of the cup itself. Experimentally validated explicit dynamics FE models were used to allow a physiologically relevant simulation of the impaction of cups, which is encountered in clinical practice, in comparison to previous studies that have used unrealistically high static forces to simulate a static press-fit insertion. Diametrical cup deformations were twice as large when the cup was tilted at 58 with respect to the cavity compared to when the poles of the cup and the cavity were aligned. The introduction of a non-uniform support to the cup increased deformations further by a factor of approximately 2.5. The greatest deformations established in the model were between 80 and 150 mu m similar to typical cup-femoral head clearances. Increasing the thickness at the pole of the cup and reducing the cup diameter resulted in significantly smaller deformations being generated. These results suggest that small cup misalignments, which may not be noticeable in a clinical situation, may produce significant deformations after insertion especially when coupled with the non-uniform support found in the pelvis.", "paper_title": "Deformation of uncemented metal acetabular cups following impaction: experimental and finite element study", "paper_id": "WOS:000334018600010"}
