If let d k, our constructed functions achieve the maximum algebraic immunity. Remarkably, 2([log2k]+2) symmetric Boolean functions on 2k variables with maximum algebraic immunity are constructed, which are much more than the previous constructions. Based on our construction, a lower bound of symmetric Boolean functions with algebraic immunity not less than d is derived, which is 2([log2d]+2(k-d+1)). As far as we know, this is the first lower bound of this kind.", "paper_title": "Constructing Even-Variable Symmetric Boolean Functions with High Algebraic Immunity", "paper_id": "WOS:000293818300041"}
