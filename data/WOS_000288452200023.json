The nontrivial correlations between sequences in Family are bounded in magnitude by 2 + 2((m+1)/2+t) . Families V(0) and V (1) compare favourably to the small and large Kasami sets, respectively. So far, the correlation distribution of Family V (t) is only known for t = 0. A general framework for computing the correlation distribution of Family V (t) is established. The correlation distribution of V(1) is derived, and a way to obtain the correlation distribution of V (2) is described.", "paper_title": "On the correlation distribution of Delsarte-Goethals sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000288452200023"}
