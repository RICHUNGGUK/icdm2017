Usually, induction measurements are only used. Design/methodology/approach - After a brief description of the magnetic gradient and magnetic scalar potential notions, methods to calculate them are presented and validated. These two kinds of measurements are tested for a numerical identification case. Then, virtual measurements can be generated and used for inverse problem resolution. Advantages of using induction, magnetic gradient or magnetic potential measurements are then discussed. Findings - A previous method to solve inverse problem based on induction measurement has been increased by the capability of using other kind of measurements. A numerical approach has allowed to validate the use of magnetic gradient or magnetic, scalar potential measurement as information sources. Originality/value - Usually, induction measurements are only used. Inversion resolution using other kind of measurements than the induction can be made. An experimental validation has been done for gradient measurements.", "paper_title": "Identification of ferromagnetic thin sheets magnetization", "paper_id": "WOS:000252916300007"}
