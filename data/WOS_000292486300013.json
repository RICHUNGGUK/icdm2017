Essential ideas of optimization employed in arriving at the proposed time integration scheme are extension of the earlier work reported in Rajpoot et al. (J Comput Phys 2010;229:3623-51). This is in turn an application of the correct error evolution equation in Sengupta et al. (J Comput Phys 2007;226:1211-8). Resultant DRP scheme demonstrated the idea for explicit spatial central difference schemes. Present work is similar, extending it for near-spectral accuracy compact schemes. Practical utility of the developed method is demonstrated by solution of model problems and for flow problems by solving Navier-Stokes equation, some of which cannot be solved by conventional schemes, as the problem of rotary oscillation of cylinder. Developed method is calibrated with: (i) flow past a circular cylinder performing rotary oscillation at Re = 150 and (ii) flow inside a 2D lid-driven cavity (LDC) at Reynolds numbers of Re = 1000 and Re = 10,000. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons show excellent match for rotary oscillation cylinder cases with the experimental results of Thiria et al. (J Fluid Mech 2006;560:123-47). Results for LDC for Re = 1000 are compared with that in Botella & Peyret (Comp Fluids 1998;27:421-33) and results for Re = 10,000 are compared with recent published ones showing triangular vortex in the core.
