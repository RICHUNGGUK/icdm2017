The application is based upon the concept that firms would benefit from clarifying R&D and R&D-like activities to assist their R&D decision. Using principal component analysis (PCA) of factor analysis, a number of possibly correlated R&D activities is transformed into a smaller number of uncorrelated activities called principal components, and firms can identify the patterns of service R&D, express their similarities and differences, and develop its R&D portfolio. A case example for service R&D in the Korean ICT industry is provided. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
