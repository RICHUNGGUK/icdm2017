Our method builds on a recent demographic inference method based on the coalescent with recombination, and is able to incorporate demographic information as a prior. Simulation study shows that diCal-IBD has significantly higher recall and precision than that of existing single-nucleotide polymorphism-based IBD detection methods, while retaining reasonable accuracy for IBD tracts as small as 0.1 cM.", "paper_title": "diCal-IBD: demography-aware inference of identity-by-descent tracts in unrelated individuals", "paper_id": "WOS:000345827400029"}
