In this study, the inherent spatial structure feature of a 3D FLC with two spatial inputs (also called as 3D two-term FLC) is first exposed via an analytical model. Then, the global bounded-input/bounded-output (BIBO) stability of the 3D fuzzy two-term control system is discussed. A sufficient condition is derived and provided as a useful criterion for the controller design of the 3D two-term FLC. Finally, a catalytic packed-bed reactor is presented as an example of spatially distributed process to demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
