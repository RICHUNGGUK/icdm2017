With this method, the pulses' envelope will keep unchanged and non-broadened after transmission under the combined effects of chromatic dispersion and self-phase modulation in the fiber link without any dispersion compensation. Numerical analysis shows how a pulse evolves for different orders of FRFT.", "paper_title": "Soliton-like dispersion-free optical transmission based on optical time-domain fractional Fourier transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000279840000002"}
