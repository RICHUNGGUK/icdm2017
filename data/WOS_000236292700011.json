Therefore the displacement between neighboring views should be very small in order to fulfill effective strips cutting. In this paper, a method is proposed to create a manifold mosaic by images with relative large displacement by means of cutting out multiple strips in the overlap area according to the homography between images. These strips are then warped together to create a smooth mosaic. An improved RANSAC algorithm is also presented in order to improve the precision of homography calculation. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the method.", "paper_title": "A new method of manifold mosaic for large displacement images", "paper_id": "WOS:000236292700011"}
