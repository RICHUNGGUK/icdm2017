These technologies have the potential to be exploited for illegal purposes, which highlights the need for digital forensic investigations. However, there have been few papers published in the area of distributed filesystem forensics. In this paper, we aim to address this gap in knowledge. Using our previously published cloud forensic framework as the underlying basis, we conduct an in-depth forensic experiment on XtreemFS, a Contrail EU-funded project, as a case study for distributed filesystem forensics. We discuss the technical and process issues regarding collection of evidential data from distributed filesystems, particularly when used in cloud computing environments. A number of digital forensic artefacts are also discussed. We then propose a process for the collection of evidential data from distributed filesystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
