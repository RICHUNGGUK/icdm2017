These clustering techniques can incorporate a priori knowledge (of an expert) to define the optimal structure for the clusters, i.e. the number of points in each cluster. Using ELM, the first proposed clustering problem formulation can be rewritten as a Traveling Salesman Problem and solved by a heuristic optimization method. The second proposed clustering problem formulation includes both a priori knowledge and a self-organization based on a predefined map (or string). The clustering methods are successfully tested on 5 toy examples and 2 real datasets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
