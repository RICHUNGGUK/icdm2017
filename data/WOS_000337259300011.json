Recently, Youn et al. presented a new signcryption scheme, which has fast online signing and short signcryptext, and is efficient enough for mobile applications. This scheme is claimed to be both existentially unforgeable and semantically secure. However, in this paper we shall show that it is not existentially unforgeable.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis of a signcryption scheme with fast online signing and short signcryptext", "paper_id": "WOS:000337259300011"}
