It works by first extracting consistent and structurally unique local neighborhood from inputs or models and then voting on the optimal matches employing dynamic programming and a novel hypercube-based indexing structure. The proposed concepts have been tested on a database with thousands of images and compared with the six nearest-neighbors shape description with superior results.", "paper_title": "Part-based object retrieval in cluttered environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000244855700011"}
