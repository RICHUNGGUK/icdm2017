In the proposed list SVD, the transmit antenna index detection is first performed and a list of the best candidates survives, then the constellation symbol detection is performed conditioned on the candidate list. Simulation results show that the proposed list SVD can approach the optimal detection performance with a small list size, i.e., an excellent performance-complexity tradeoff is achieved.", "paper_title": "Signal Vector Based List Detection for Spatial Modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696200001"}
