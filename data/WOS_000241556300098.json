Each surface was found as a minimum s-t cut from a geometric graph constructed from edge/regional information and a priori-determined surface constraints. Our approach was tested on 18 3-D data sets (9 from patients with normal optic discs and 9 from patients with papilledema) obtained using a Stratus OCT-3 scanner. Qualitative analysis of surface detection correctness indicates that our method consistently found the correct surfaces and outperformed the proprietary algorithm used in the Stratus OCT-3 scanner. For example, for the internal limiting membrane, 4% of the 2-D scans had minor failures with no major failures using our approach, but 19% of the 2-D scans using the Stratus OCT-3 scanner had minor or complete failures.", "paper_title": "Segmentation of the surfaces of the retinal layer from OCT images", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300098"}
