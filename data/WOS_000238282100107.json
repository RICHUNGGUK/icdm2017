An adaptive error concealment algorithm based on Markov Random Field (MRF) - Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) framework is proposed. Firstly, Discrimination Analysis is used to detect edges. So, edge threshold T for the Huber function of MRF is adaptively obtained, according to the edge or non-edge area that current pixel belongs to. Then, in order to eliminate the blocking artifacts, a slope k is also introduced to the linear part of the Huber function. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can recover images with the higher quality, comparing to the existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "Error concealment based on adaptive MRF-MAP framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100107"}
