Considering the increasing popularity and fast software development cycles (e.g., desktop and mobile applications), GUI testing gains more importance as it allows us to verify the behavior of a system from the user's perspective. Thus, it can quickly uncover relevant bugs, which a user could face. Traditional capture-replay GUI testing approaches do not meet the demands of developers anymore. Therefore, there is an increasing research activity in model-based GUI testing, where the user interaction behavior is simulated using a graph-based model. In the following, we outline different graphical notations to describe feasible user interactions, and methods to generate and execute test cases from these models. We discuss the benefits and limitations of the state-of-the-art in GUI testing research and give a brief outlook about new trends and possibilities to improve the GUI testing automation.", "paper_title": "Trends in Model-based GUI Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000309842800006"}
