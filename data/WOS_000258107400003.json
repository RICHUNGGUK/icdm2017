Each agent has an individual demand; demands are drawn according to some probability distribution. The cost paid by an agent for a resource it chooses is the total demand put on the resource divided by the number of agents who chose that same resource. So, resources charge costs in an equitable, fair way, while each resource makes no profit out of the agents.", "paper_title": "Cost sharing mechanisms for fair pricing of resource usage", "paper_id": "WOS:000258107400003"}
