By exploring intrinsic features between nonautonomous system and its asymptotic equation, several novel sufficient conditions are established to ensure,that all solutions of the networks converge to a periodic function or a constant vector for delayed Cohen-Grossberg-type neural network (NN) models in time-varying situation. The results can be applied directly to group of NNs models including Hopfield NNs, bidirectional association memory NNs, and cellular NNs. Our results are not only presented in terms of system parameters and can be easily verified but also are less restrictive than previously known criteria. Numerical simulations have also been presented to demonstrate the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Convergence of nonautonomous Cohen-Grossberg-type neural networks with variable delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000252516700012"}
