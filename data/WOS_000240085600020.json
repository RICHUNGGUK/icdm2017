We illustrate that adding simple axioms such as Leibniz equations to a calculus for an impredicative logic - in our case a sequent calculus for classical type theory - is like adding cut. The phenomenon equally applies to prominent axioms like Boolean- and functional extensionality, induction, choice, and description. This calls for the development of calculi where these principles are built-in instead of being treated axiomatically.", "paper_title": "Cut-simulation in impredicative logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085600020"}
