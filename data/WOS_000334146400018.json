Hence, knowing the factors that affect user's intention to pay for SNS fan pages is an important topic. For this study, we built a research model based on network externalities and social capital theory, targeting users of SNS fan pages. We gathered data using online questionnaires, of which 248 valid copies were retrieved, and we employed structural equation modeling to test the research model. The results show that both network externalities and social capital play vital roles in users' intention to pay for products and services recommended by fan pages.", "paper_title": "Understanding SNSs Users' Intention to Pay", "paper_id": "WOS:000334146400018"}
