However, our research shows that cell-phone-verification is not always reliable. This study proposes a new attack method named MAC-YURI (My ACcount, YoUr Responsibility) against cell-phone-verification to show people one possible abuse of smartphones. Through MAC-YURI, an attacker can utilize a compromised smartphone as a steppingstone to accept and forward account verification code to finish cell-phone-verification when applying a new account or logging in to an account. We have implemented MAC-YURI on an Android smartphone. Experimental results show that MAC-YURI can successfully assist an attacker in obtaining the verification code of an account without the awareness of a steppingstone smartphone owner. Besides, MAC-YURI also develops an SMS-based mechanism to create a smartphone-based botnet. After such a botnet is created, it is difficult to locate the hot master or the machine a hot will contact in the future. Finally, this paper proposes some recommendations to protect a smartphone against MAC-YURI.", "paper_title": "Bypass Cell-phone-verification Through a Smartphone-based Botnet", "paper_id": "WOS:000355962400018"}
