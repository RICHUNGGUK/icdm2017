The comparative analyses focus on top university research in hard sciences from 4 East Asian countries (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan) and 4 North European countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden), universities of which get altogether 95 recognitions in the HEEACT Top 300 rankings in the Natural Sciences (Sci), Technology (Tec) or Clinical Medicine (Med). According to productivity ratings (A(0), A, A(+), A(++)), Taiwan receives 10 A(++) ratings (Sci 5, Tec 5), Sweden 9 (Sci 4, Med 4, Tec 1) and Hong Kong 9 (Tec 4, Med 2, Sci 1). The smallest numbers of A(++) ratings are found in Norway, 1 (Med) and Finland 3 (all in Med). The only university with an A(++) rating in the top of all three fields is the National University of Singapore. The Pohang University of Science and Technology (South Korea) and the National Tsing Hua University (Taiwan) are exceptionally productive in Sci and Tec; Karolinska Institutet (Sweden) and the University of Helsinki (Finland) belong to the top in Med. Even though Northern European countries are ranked higher in the 'knowledge economy indicators', East Asians fare better by indicators of learning outcomes and by productivity of university research in Natural Sciences and Technology; North European countries are stronger in Clinical Medicine.", "paper_title": "Productivity analysis of research in Natural Sciences, Technology and Clinical Medicine: an input-output model applied in comparison of Top 300 ranked universities of 4 North European and 4 East Asian countries", "paper_id": "WOS:000313711500014"}
