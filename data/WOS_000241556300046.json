In standard slice based navigation, three dimensional imaging data is visualized on a two dimensional user interface in the surgery room. Another technology is the in-situ visualization i.e. the superimposition of imaging data directly into the view of the surgeon, spatially registered with the patient. Thus, the three dimensional information is represented on a three dimensional interface. We created a hybrid navigation interface combining an augmented reality visualization system, which is based on a stereoscopic head mounted display, with a standard two dimensional navigation interface. Using an experimental setup, trauma surgeons performed a drilling task using the standard slice based navigation system, different visualization modes of an augmented reality system, and the combination of both. The integration of a standard slice based navigation interface into an augmented reality visualization overcomes the shortcomings of both systems.", "paper_title": "Hybrid navigation interface for orthopedic and trauma surgery", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300046"}
