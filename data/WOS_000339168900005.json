The equivalence class of a word depends on the numbers of occurrences of different factors of length k for a fixed natural number k and the prefix of the word. We have shown earlier that over a ternary alphabet k-abelian squares cannot be avoided in pure morphic words for any natural number k. Nevertheless, computational experiments support the conjecture that even 3-abelian squares can be avoided over ternary alphabets. In this paper we establish the first avoidance result showing that by choosing k to be large enough we have an infinite k-abelian square-free word over three letter alphabet. In addition, this word can be obtained as a morphic image of a pure morphic word.", "paper_title": "EXISTENCE OF AN INFINITE TERNARY 64-ABELIAN SQUARE-FREE WORD", "paper_id": "WOS:000339168900005"}
