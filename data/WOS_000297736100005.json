The SpalartAllmaras turbulence model is solved using finite difference discretization. The variables on the cell interface are interpolated via the van Leer limiter in the reconstruction stage. Simulation of subsonic and transonic flow over a NACA0012 airfoil has been implemented using two-dimensional body-fitted grids. The numerical results obtained appear in good agreement with the AGARD results, demonstrating the effectiveness and usefulness of the strategy of coupling the SpalartAllmaras turbulence model with the BGK scheme for compressible turbulent flow simulation.
