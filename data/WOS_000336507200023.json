In contrast to traditional approaches based on replaying segments of motion data directly, our representation organizes samples of motion data into a high-dimensional generalization of a vector field that we call a motion field. Our runtime motion synthesis mechanism freely flows through the motion field in response to user commands. The motions we create appear natural, are highly responsive to real-time user input, and are not explicitly specified in the data.", "paper_title": "Motion Fields for Interactive Character Locomotion", "paper_id": "WOS:000336507200023"}
