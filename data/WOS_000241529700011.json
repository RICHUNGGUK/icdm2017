It is an attempt to foster AI and intelligent robotics research by providing a standard problem where wide range of technologies can be integrated and examined. RoboCup chose to use soccer game as a central topic of research, aiming at innovations to be applied for socially significant problems and industries.(1) The aim of the paper is to provide an AI research perspective on RoboCup, based on the experience gained partecipating in the competition, within our research group at \"La Sapienza\".", "paper_title": "Artificial intelligence in RoboCup", "paper_id": "WOS:000241529700011"}
