The aim of this study was to develop a method to investigate the influence of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) on vortex dynamics in a failing ventricle. An axisymmetric fluid dynamics model of the left ventricle was developed and coupled to a lumped parameter model of the complete circulation. Simulations were performed for healthy conditions and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Vortex structures in these simulations were analysed by means of automated detection. Results show that the strength of the leading vortex ring is lower in a DCM ventricle than in a healthy ventricle. The LVAD further influences the maximum strength of the vortex and also causes the vortex to disappear earlier in time with increasing LVAD flows. Understanding these phenomena by means of the method proposed in this study will contribute to enhanced diagnostics and monitoring during cardiac support.", "paper_title": "Influence of dilated cardiomyopathy and a left ventricular assist device on vortex dynamics in the left ventricle", "paper_id": "WOS:000260571300006"}
