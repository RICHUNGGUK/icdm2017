One of the two types of protocols is for hybrid P2P systems where there is a TTP to construct the transmission paths and look up the query files. The other type of protocol is for pure P2P environments where no TTP is involved in the session network. These two new protocols are based on primitive roots for three main reasons: simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency. Other issues concerning the P2P network structure as well as the security analyses of the proposed protocols will also be covered in this paper. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
