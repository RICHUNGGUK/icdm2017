A necessary condition for the implementability of an STG is the existence of a consistent and complete state encoding. For an important subclass of STGs, the marked graph STGs, we show that checking consistency is polynomial, but checking the existence of a complete state coding is co-NP-complete. In fact, co-NP-completeness already holds for acyclic and 1-bounded marked graph STGs and for live and 1-bounded marked graph STGs. We add some relevant results for free-choice, bounded, and general STGs.", "paper_title": "On the Complexity of Consistency and Complete State Coding for Signal Transition Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000262367600002"}
