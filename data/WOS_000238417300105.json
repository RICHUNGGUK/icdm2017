The mobility of the agent is suitable to trace the mobile hosts in the system and the intelligence of the agent makes it efficient to support the fault-tolerance services. The proposed scheme especially focuses on the adaptiveness of the agent. The agents try to keep the failure-recovery cost and the failure-free operation cost within a certain level, regardless of the hand-off frequency of the mobile hosts. They also try to,balance the two costs.", "paper_title": "Using adaptive agents for the fault-tolerant mobile computing system", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300105"}
