In order to do this efficiently, hierarchical decompositions are used, so that the features of the objects are classified into several types of cells, usually rectangular. In this paper we propose a solution based on the classification of a set of points situated on the device in a little-known spatial decomposition named tetra-tree. Using this type of spatial decomposition gives us several quantitative and qualitative properties that allow us a more realistic and intuitive visual interaction, as well as the possibility of selecting inaccessible components. These features could be used in virtual sculpting or accessibility tasks. In order to show these properties we have compared an interaction system based on tetra-trees to one based on octrees.
