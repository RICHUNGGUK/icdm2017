An exact solution of the equations is found when at the direct-current motors moving the wheels a constant voltage is supplied. The problem of minimizing the torques of electric motors is considered and steady-state motion modes are specified for which the torques of electric motors and energy expenses are minimum. The reckoning system for the robot traveled distance is described.", "paper_title": "On the motion of a mobile robot with roller-carrying wheels", "paper_id": "WOS:000251795100010"}
