Pressure distribution (hipprint) measured by network-connected sensors on the chair is used for identifying the person sitting on the chair. Hipprint information is not sufficient for maintaining a high level of security but is sufficient for providing personalized services such as automatic log-in at home or in a small office. In experiments, we obtained correct identification rates of 99.6% for five people and 93.2% for ten people. A false rejection rate of 9.2% and a false acceptance rate of 1.9% were achieved using another group of 20 people. The results also showed that changes in hipprints can be used to estimate what the person sitting on the chair is doing, for example, using a mouse or leaning back.", "paper_title": "Soft authentication and behavior analysis using a chair with sensors attached: hipprint authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000269914900005"}
