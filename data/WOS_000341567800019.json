In WSNs, the existing multipath routing schemes have demonstrated the effectiveness of traffic distribution over multipaths to fulfill the quality of service requirements of applications. However, the failure of links might significantly affect the transmission performance, scalability, reliability, and security of WSNs. Thus, by considering the reliability, congestion control, and security for multipath, it is desirable to design a reliable and service-driven routing scheme to provide efficient and failure-tolerant routing scheme. In this paper, an evaluation metric, path vacant ratio, is proposed to evaluate and then find a set of link-disjoint paths from all available paths. A congestion control and load-balancing algorithm that can adaptively adjust the load over multipaths is proposed. A threshold sharing algorithm is applied to split the packets into multiple segments that will be delivered via multipaths to the destination depending on the path vacant ratio. Simulations demonstrate the performance of the adaptive and secure load-balance routing scheme.", "paper_title": "Adaptive and Secure Load-Balancing Routing Protocol for Service-Oriented Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000341567800019"}
