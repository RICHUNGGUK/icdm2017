In this paper, the three-area multi-units system has chosen for the AGC in restructured power system. Federal energy regulatory commission (FERC) supports an open market system for price based operation. The theory of DISCO participation matrix is used to simulate the bilateral contracts in the three area multi-units systems. In this paper Fuzzy logic damping controller (FLDC) for optimal transient performance of AGC has been used. An effective method, namely, Fuzzy Subtractive Clustering is used here, which reduces the number of rules and membership functions of Fuzzy system. This Method provides a mechanism to obtain the reduced rule set covering the whole input/output space as well as membership functions for each input variable. Finally the results have been compared.", "paper_title": "Application of fuzzy subtractive clustering for optimal transient performance of automatic generation control in restructured power system", "paper_id": "WOS:000331137600009"}
