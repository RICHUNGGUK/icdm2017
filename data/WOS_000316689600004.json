Contour trees are often used to represent spatial relationships between contours and assist the user in analysing the terrain. However, automatic analysis from the contour tree is still limited as features identified on a map by sets of contours are not only characterised by local relationships between contours but also by relationships with other features at different levels of representation. In this paper, a new method based on adjacency and inclusion relationships between regions defined by sets of contours is presented. The method extracts terrain features and stores them in a feature tree providing a description of the landscape at multiple levels of detail. The method is applied to terrain analysis and generalisation of a contour map by selecting the most relevant features according to the purpose of the map. Experimental results are presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Multi-level representation of terrain features on a contour map", "paper_id": "WOS:000316689600004"}
