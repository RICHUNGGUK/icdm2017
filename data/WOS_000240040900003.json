However, the objects of some pattern classification applications consist of features/values of elements lying on a limited ID line segment. This paper will prove that districted matching scheme can still outperform undistricted matching scheme in these applications, and the improved performance of districted vote scheme is even more substantial for these 1 D objects than for 2D objects. The theoretical result suggests the use of districted matching schemes for pattern recognition of 1 D objects. We verified the theoretical analysis through artificial neural network-based approaches for the prediction of start codons of nucleotide sequences.", "paper_title": "Improving the performance of 1D object classification by using the Electoral College", "paper_id": "WOS:000240040900003"}
