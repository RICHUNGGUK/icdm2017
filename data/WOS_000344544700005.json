To develop RBDO utilizing the recently proposed novel second-order reliability method (SORM) that improves conventional SORM approaches in terms of accuracy, the sensitivities of the probabilistic constraints at the most probable point (MPP) are required. Thus, this study presents sensitivity analysis of the novel SORM at MPP for more accurate RBDO. During analytic derivation in this study, it is assumed that the Hessian matrix does not change due to the small change of design variables. The calculation of the sensitivity based on the analytic derivation requires evaluation of probability density function (PDF) of a linear combination of non-central chi-square variables, which is obtained by utilizing general chi-squared distribution. In terms of accuracy, the proposed probabilistic sensitivity analysis is compared with the finite difference method (FDM) using the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) through numerical examples. The numerical examples demonstrate that the analytic sensitivity of the novel SORM agrees very well with the sensitivity obtained by FDM using MCS when a performance function is quadratic in U-space and input variables are normally distributed. It is further shown that the proposed sensitivity is accurate enough compared with FDM results even for a higher order performance function.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic sensitivity analysis for novel second-order reliability method (SORM) using generalized chi-squared distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000344544700005"}
