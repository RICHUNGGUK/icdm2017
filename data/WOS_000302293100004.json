Many tools exist to produce and process such traces, but they are often too specific; using them as a basis for creating extended tools is then impractical. Some other tools are generic enough, but exhibit performance issues. This paper reports on our experience designing WiPal, a packet trace manipulation framework with a focus on IEEE 802.11. WiPal is designed for performance and re-usability, while introducing several novel features compared to previous solutions. Besides presenting how WiPal's original design can benefit packet processing programs, we discuss a number of issues a program designer might encounter when writing packet trace processing software. An evaluation of WiPal shows that, albeit generic, it does not impact performance regarding execution speed. WiPal achieves performance levels observed only with specialized code and outperforms some well-known packet processing programs.
