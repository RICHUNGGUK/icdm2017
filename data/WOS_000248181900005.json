It uses two known game- based characterisations to derive the following results: the combined model checking complexity as well as the data complexity of FLC are EXPTIME-complete. This is already the case for its alternation- free fragment. The expression complexity of FLC is trivially P- hard and limited from above by the complexity of solving a parity game, i. e. in UPnco-UP. For any fragment of fixed alternation depth, in particular alternation-free formulas it is P- complete.", "paper_title": "Three notes on the complexity of model checking fixpoint logic with chop", "paper_id": "WOS:000248181900005"}
