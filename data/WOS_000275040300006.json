The expressions for the periodic solutions derived from Hopf bifurcation are given by using the PIS. The result shows that the PIS has higher accuracy than the center manifold reduction (CMR) with normal form for the values of time delay not far away from the Hopf bifurcation point. In terms of the PIS, the necessary and sufficient conditions of synchronized periodic solution arising from a Hopf bifurcation are obtained and the synchronized periodic solution is expressed in an analytical form. It can be seen that theoretical analysis is in good agreement with numerical simulation. It implies that the provided method is valid and the obtained result is correct. To the best of our knowledge, the paper is the first one to introduce the PIS to study the periodic solution derived from Hopf bifurcation for a 4-D delayed system quantitatively.", "paper_title": "Computation of Synchronized Periodic Solution in a BAM Network With Two Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000275040300006"}
