The shape of the grid is optimized to accurately reproduce the low-energy part of the spectrum of the Schrodinger operator. Grids constructed this way are applicable to more complex few-body systems where the number of grid points is a critical limitation to numerical accuracy. The utility of the grid generation for improving few-body calculations is illustrated through an application to bound states of He trimers. (C) 2011 Elsevier By.
