Various NCV based formulations for simulating resin flow through fibrous media, resin cure, heat transfer in fabrication assemblies, changes in material properties with temperature and cure are explained. The development of a process-adaptive, modular, semi-steady simulation procedure that combines the benefits of a commercially available general-purpose FE package and user-defined computer programs for NCV grid is presented. The process is easily implementable for one-, two- or three-dimensional domains without re-meshing. Implications of ignoring the effects of the heat of exothermic cure reaction, the artificial loss of resin mass during the resin flow, and the die temperature on material properties are highlighted using example problems.
