The solution discussed is based on an enhanced hybrid model that relies on content-based and collaborative strategies aimed to exploit the information shared by other users to validate the quality of the recommendations provided. As a relevant feature, the proposed schema takes advantage of an automatic compensation of the mentioned strategies. To make the most of theses two approaches, the use of semantics is introduced to describe knowledge and to make smart recommendation decisions. To facilitate the task of other researchers and practitioners, details about the actual development and validation of the proposed model are also included in the paper, making it possible its replication in other environmentsEurope is involved in a process of transition to digital terrestrial television that is aimed to replace all analog broadcasting infrastructures into digital ones by year 2012. Besides the substitution of all broadcasting networks scattered around Europe, this process includes the replacement of all household elements related to the reception of terrestrial television emissions, namely television appliances and antenna settings. As in any major change in the every-day life of citizens, public administrations must keep citizen informed and provide convenient support, specially when dealing with the a communication medium designated to be the carriers of services and information. This paper tackles how this situation has been faced in Galicia, a European region with special needs in this area, as shown in the paper. Through a successful use case based on Geographical Information Services and Web2.0 technologies, we illustrate some features not present in related initiatives in other areas.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive and Social-Aware Recommendation Algorithm for Administration Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000347734200002"}
