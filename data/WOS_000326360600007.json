The numerical results are validated by comparisons with existing theoretical, experimental and numerical results, including a power law of the normalized angular speed versus the particle Reynolds number. The centerline between two walls is an expected equilibrium position of the cylinder mass center in shear flow. A new result on the equilibrium position has been obtained. When placing the particle away from the centerline initially, the cylinder migrates to an equilibrium position between the centerline and the wall for higher Reynolds numbers. This new equilibrium position is caused by the interplay between the slip velocity, the Magnus force, and the wall effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
