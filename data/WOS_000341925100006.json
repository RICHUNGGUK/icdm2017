As an innovation, this paper has proposed an architecture that allows the SC Performance Measurement System (SCPMS) components to have multi-level interoperability by integrating the multi-agent technology as well as ontology technology. It has also proposed a method to develop the required ontologies for the PMS agents and developed the ontologies in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to provide the semantic level interoperability. The syntax-level interoperability has been provided by a number of agent interaction protocols (AIPs). As another innovation, the authors have developed the SCPMS algorithms for the link analysis method by the Breadth-First Search (BFS) method and proved those algorithms. The authors have created the PMS agents based on those algorithms and prototyped a Multi-Agent System (MAS) for the SC of a tile manufacturer as a case study. The proposed multi-level architecture supports the GSCF model in the SC performance measurement, and improves the interoperability and the integration of the SCPMS.", "paper_title": "Designing an ontology-based multi-agent system for supply chain performance measurement using graph traversal", "paper_id": "WOS:000341925100006"}
