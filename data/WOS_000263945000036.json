Two types of optimal orbit decompositions of functional graphs are proposed for the preprocess. Both preprocesses require only linear time and linear space. Our decompositions minimize the number of recursions in the computation of f(m)(x) and solve some open problems in Tsaban (Discrete Applied Mathematics 155 (2007) 386-393). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
