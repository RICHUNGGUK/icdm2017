The outcomes are assessed through an evaluation model that considers the impact of motivation, enjoyment and team contributions on learning outcomes The study results indicate that motivation influences the relationship between team interactions and perceived learning Enjoyment is affected by motivation and perceptions of team members' contributions, with the implication that students who perceive that the team interactions are adding value to their education will better enjoy learning and will experience higherlevel learning outcomes (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Computer-supported team-based learning: The impact of motivation, enjoyment and team contributions on learning outcomes", "paper_id": "WOS:000277110400038"}
