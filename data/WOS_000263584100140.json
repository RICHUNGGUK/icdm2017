However, the miscellaneous information often brings the users at a loss. Web personalization provides a solution to improvement of information overloading on websites. The objective of web personalization is to give users a website they want or need, and thus knowing the needs of users is an important task for content recommendation in web personalization. In this article, we propose a hybrid approach for this task. The proposed approach trains the artificial neural networks to group users into different clusters, and applies the well-established Kano's method to extracting the implicit needs from users in different clusters. Finally, a real case of tour and travel websites applying the approach is presented to demonstrate the improvement of information overloading. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
