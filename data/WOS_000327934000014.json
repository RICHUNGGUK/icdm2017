Because of the increasing importance of decentralized and peer-to-peer environments, characterized by high dynamism and churn, a number of resource discovery mechanisms, mainly based on peer-to-peer techniques, have been presented recently. We present and classify them according to criteria like their topology and the degree of achievement of various common requirements of great importance for the targeted environments, as well as compare their reported performance. These classifications intend to provide an intuitive vision of the strengths and weaknesses of each system.", "paper_title": "Decentralized Resource Discovery Mechanisms for Distributed Computing in Peer-to-Peer Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000327934000014"}
