First, we study the ACLV of standard cell layouts by lithography simulation. Then, we introduce regularity in gate-forming poly-silicon patterns and how it improves the ACLV and also how it incurs area-overhead. According to the investigation, we propose two design guidelines for standard-cell layout that can reduce ACLV with reasonable area overhead. Those guidelines include on-grid fixed-pitch layout with dummy-poly insertion and stretched gate-poly extension. Design experiments assuming a 65 nm process technology indicate that a D-FF designed with the first guideline reduces ACLV by 35% with 14% area overhead and the second guideline reduces ACLV by 75% with 29% area overhead at the best focus condition. Under defocus conditions, both layouts exhibit stable characteristics whereas the variability of conventional layout grows rapidly as the level of defocus increases. Circuit-level lithography simulation over benchmark circuits also supports that the proposed guidelines considerably reduces the amount of gate length variation.", "paper_title": "Manufacturability-aware design of standard cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020700005"}
