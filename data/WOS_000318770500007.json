Also, data integration can be used to help model and understand multimodal processing in the brain. Amari proposed alpha-integration as a principled way of blending multiple positive measures (e.g., stochastic models in the form of probability distributions), enabling an optimal integration in the sense of minimizing the alpha-divergence. It also encompasses existing integration methods as its special case, for example, a weighted average and an exponential mixture. The parameter a determines integration characteristics, and the weight vector w assigns the degree of importance to each measure. In most work, however, alpha and w are given in advance rather than learned. In this letter, we present a parameter learning algorithm for learning a and w from data when multiple integrated target values are available. Numerical experiments on synthetic as well as real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Parameter Learning for Alpha Integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000318770500007"}
