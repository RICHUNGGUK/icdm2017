In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm that computes all locally optimal secondary structures for any folding model that takes into account the stability of helical regions. This algorithm is implemented in a software called regliss that runs on a publicly accessible web server.", "paper_title": "RNA Locally Optimal Secondary Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000309958100003"}
