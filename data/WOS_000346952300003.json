Several methods can be used for estimating the parameters of the DMRD. In the present work, we address the issue of estimating the parameters of the DMRD through a Bayesian approach associated with Monte Carlo methods. The proposed approach is compared via a simulation study with maximum likelihood method and method of moments by calculating the Mean Square Error (MSE). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
