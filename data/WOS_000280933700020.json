The interest rates are assumed to follow the recently introduced LIBOR Market Model. The Feynman-Kac theorem provides a PDE model for the spread option pricing problem which is initially posed in an unbounded domain. After a localization procedure and the consideration of appropriate boundary conditions in a bounded domain, we propose a Crank-Nicholson characteristic time discretization scheme combined with a Lagrange piecewise quadratic finite element for the spatial discretization. In order to illustrate the performance of the PDE model and the numerical methods, we present a real example of spread option pricing. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
