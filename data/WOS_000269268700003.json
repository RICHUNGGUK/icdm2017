In particular, context semantics lets us de. ne the weight of a proof-net as a measure of its inherent complexity: it is both an upper bound to normalization time (modulo a polynomial overhead, independently on the reduction strategy) and a lower bound to the amount of resources needed to compute the normal form. Weights are then exploited in proving strong soundness theorems for various subsystems of linear logic, namely elementary linear logic, soft linear logic, and light linear logic.", "paper_title": "Context Semantics, Linear Logic, and Computational Complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000269268700003"}
