Alongside the adoption of semantic web technologies for ontology-based modelling, our approach aims at a better relevance for recommendations by adopting a hybrid recommendation technique, combining a collaborative filtering and a content-based approach. The collaborative filtering module adopts a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in order to predict the next concept which will be focused on by the user, tracking the user navigation through an ontology instead of through the structure of a particular site. The content-based recommender module adopts a k nearest neighbours approach and exploits the similarities between the user and document modelling.", "paper_title": "An ontology-based approach for providing multimedia personalised recommendations", "paper_id": "WOS:000271426700006"}
