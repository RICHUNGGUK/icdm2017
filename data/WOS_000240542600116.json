The vehicle we deem to be appropriate for this situation is indirect communication (in some ways related to peripheral communication). The presence we intend is based on the activities of these intimate people. In short, with a certain periodicity the user is presented, on a peripheral user interface (windows desktop or digital picture frame), with a new collage composed of pictures indirectly triggered by their loved ones. In particular the pictures are triggered by the text they write and read, and the songs they listen to, while working on their PCs.", "paper_title": "Towards affective collages of presences", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600116"}
