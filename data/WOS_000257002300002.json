It improves upon the algorithm of Yan et al. [J.-H. Yan, J.-J. Chen, G.J. Chang, Quasi-threshold graphs, Discrete Appl. Math. 69 (3) (1996) 247-255] in that it is certifying, producing a P-4 or a C-4 when the graph is not TP. In addition, our algorithm can be easily modified to recognize the complement of TP graphs (co-TP) in linear time as well. It is based on lexicographic BFS, and in particular the technique of partition refinement, which has been used in the recognition of many other graph classes [D.G.
