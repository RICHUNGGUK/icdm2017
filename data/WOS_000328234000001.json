To ensure effective decisions being made, the interest of all the decision makers usually represented by the degree of consensus in the decision making process has to be adequately considered. This paper presents a consensus-based approach for effectively solving the multicriteria group decision making problem. The subjectiveness and imprecision of the decision making process is adequately handled by using intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. An interactive algorithm is developed for consensus building in the group decision making process. A decision support system framework is presented for improving the effectiveness of the consensus building process. An example is presented for demonstrating the applicability of the proposed approach for solving the multicriteria group decision making problem in real world situations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
