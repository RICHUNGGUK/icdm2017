It has come to attention in the recent literature that many real-world problems violate this assumption, and thus overlapping community detection has become a hot research topic. The existing work on this topic uses either content or link information, but not both of them. In this paper, we deal with the issue of overlapping community detection by combining content and link information. We develop an effective solution called subgraph overlapping clustering (SOC) and evaluate this new approach in comparison with several peer methods in the literature that use either content or link information. The evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and promise of SOC in dealing with large scale real datasets.", "paper_title": "Overlapping community detection combining content and link", "paper_id": "WOS:000310834300003"}
