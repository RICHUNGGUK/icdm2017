The proposed algorithm can detect any number of well-separated clusters with any shapes and indicate the inherent hierarchical nature of the Clusters present in a data set. Moreover, it is able to detect elements of small clusters as outliers in a data set and group them into a new cluster if the number of outliers is relatively large. Some computer simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the clustering scheme. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
