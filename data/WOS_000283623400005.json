The purpose of this paper is to present an approach to minimize the computation time by achieving the same simulation accuracy. Design/methodology/approach - The applied approach for avoiding high computational cost is the multi-slice method. This paper presents the adoption of this method to a tubular linear motor. Findings - It is demonstrated that the multi-slice method is applicable for tubular linear motors. Furthermore, the number of slices and thereby computation time is minimized at the same accuracy of the simulation results. Practical implications - The results of this paper offer a faster computation of skewed linear motors. At this juncture, the results are independent from the deployed FE solver. Originality/value - The methods developed and proved permit a faster and more accurate design of tubular linear motors.", "paper_title": "The multi-slice method for the design of a tubular linear motor with a skewed reaction rail", "paper_id": "WOS:000283623400005"}
