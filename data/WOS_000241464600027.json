For contactless SC, analysis of power consumption is essential. While functioning, energy for these products is supplied by electromagnetic waves and value of stored energy depends directly on the distance between the emitter and the card. Then, for each defined product operations, and at any time, the stored energy must be higher than the required energy. If not, the product will not operate correctly. This paper presents a methodology to survey the dynamic power of contactless SC by current analysis, and so to verify safe operation mode of the product.", "paper_title": "Methodology for dynamic power verification of contactless SmartCards", "paper_id": "WOS:000241464600027"}
