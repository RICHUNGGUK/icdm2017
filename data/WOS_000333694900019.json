However, like other agile methods such as Extreme Programming (XP), Feature Driven Development (FDD), and the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), Scrum has been criticized because of lack of support to develop secure software. Thus, in 2011, we published research proposing the idea of a security backlog (SB). This paper represents the continuation of our previous research, with a focus on the evaluation in industry-based case study. Our findings highlight an improved agility in Scrum after the integration of SB. Furthermore, secure software can be developed quickly, even in situations involving requirement changes of software. Based on our experimental findings, we noticed that, when integrating SB, it is quite feasible to develop secure software using an agile Scrum model.", "paper_title": "Integrating Software Security into Agile-Scrum Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000333694900019"}
