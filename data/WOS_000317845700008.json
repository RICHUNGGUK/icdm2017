The technique requires three fiduciary marker points and operates by minimising the angular DOF through a binary search driven algorithm. The technique is less computationally intensive than the standard closed form solutions and quickly converges to a solution which can be verified if additional fiduciary points are available. Evaluation for the technique is presented through a comparison to pose from orthography and scaling with iterations (POSIT) using synthetic data and a real-world application, where the technique is used for pose estimation of a mobile robot with respect to a motor vehicle for inspection purposes.", "paper_title": "A 3-degree of freedom binary search pose estimation technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000317845700008"}
