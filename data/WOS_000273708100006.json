This prior is based on products of spatially weighted total variations (TV). These spatial weights provide this prior with the flexibility to better capture local image features than previous TV based priors. Bayesian inference is used for image restoration with this prior via the variational approximation. The proposed restoration algorithm is fully automatic in the sense that all necessary parameters are estimated from the data and is faster than previous similar algorithms. Numerical experiments are shown which demonstrate that image restoration based on this prior compares favorably with previous state-of-the-art restoration algorithms.", "paper_title": "Variational Bayesian Image Restoration With a Product of Spatially Weighted Total Variation Image Priors", "paper_id": "WOS:000273708100006"}
