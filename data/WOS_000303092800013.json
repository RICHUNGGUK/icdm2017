Pertaining to branch vertices, this paper studies two optimization problems having roots in the domain of optical networks. The first one, referred to as MBV, seeks a spanning tree T of G with the minimum number of branch vertices, whereas the second problem, referred to as MDS, seeks a spanning tree T of G with the minimum degree sum of branch vertices. Both MBV and MDS are NP-Hard. Two heuristics approaches are presented for each problem. The first approach is a problem specific heuristic, whereas the latter one is a hybrid ant-colony optimization algorithm. Computational results show the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.
