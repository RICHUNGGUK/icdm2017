The aim of this paper is to provide a software engineering-based view of the web engineering discipline reviewing and classifying a significant part of the software engineering-related literature that makes up its body of knowledge. In order to facilitate the classification of this software engineering literature, this paper categorizes it into knowledge areas, providing a brief analysis of each area. These knowledge areas match the knowledge areas defined in the Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). As an immediate consequence of this paper, a comparison between software engineering and web engineering disciplines arises.", "paper_title": "A SWEBOK-based Viewpoint of the Web Engineering Discipline", "paper_id": "WOS:000275895000002"}
