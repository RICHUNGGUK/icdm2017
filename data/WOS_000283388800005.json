The established CoMFA model in training set gives a cross-validated q(2) value of 0.516 and a non-cross-validated r(ncv)(2) value of 0.667, while the CoMSIA model results in q(2)=0.517 and r(ncv)(2)=0.632. In general, the predictive ability of the CoMFA model is superior to that of the CoMSIA model, with r(pred)(2)=0.639 for the CoMFA and r(pred)(2)=0.619 for the CoMSIA model. Based on the CoMFA contour maps, some key structural characters of vitamin D-3 analogs responsible for inhibitory activity are identified, and some new C2 alpha-modified 24-alkylvitannin D-3 lactone analogs with high predicted pIC(50) values are designed. The ligand functional group mutations by FEP simulation and docking studies reveal the rationality of the molecular design.", "paper_title": "3D-QSAR Studies on C24-Monoalkylated Vitamin D-3 26,23-Lactones and their C2 alpha-Modified Derivatives with Inhibitory Activity to Vitamin D Receptor", "paper_id": "WOS:000283388800005"}
