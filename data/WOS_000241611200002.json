The most computationally demanding step in soft-decision decoding of RS codes is bivariate polynomial interpolation. In this paper, we present a hybrid data format-base interpolation architecture that is well suited for high-speed implementation of the soft-decision decoders. It will be shown that this architecture is highly scalable and can be extensively pipelined. It also enables maximum overlap in time for computations at adjacent iterations. It is estimated that the proposed architecture can achieve significantly higher throughput than conventional designs with equivalent or lower hardware complexity.", "paper_title": "High-speed interpolation architecture for soft-decision decoding of Reed-Solomon codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241611200002"}
