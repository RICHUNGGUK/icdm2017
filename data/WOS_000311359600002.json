Analyzing the optimal performance of these codes yields an alternative proof of the finite block length converse of Polyanskiy, Poor, and Verdu, and shows that they achieve this converse. This provides an explicit formulation of the converse as a linear program which has some useful features. For discrete memoryless channels, it is shown that nonsignaling codes attain the channel capacity with zero error probability if and only if the dispersion of the channel is zero.", "paper_title": "A Linear Program for the Finite Block Length Converse of Polyanskiy-Poor-Verdu Via Nonsignaling Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000311359600002"}
