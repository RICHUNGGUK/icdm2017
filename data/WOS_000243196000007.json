The grid cells are refined and coarsened in blocks of the grid depending on an estimate of the spatial discretization error and the time step is chosen to satisfy a tolerance on the temporal discretization error. The solution is conserved across the block boundaries so that the total probability is constant. A similar effect is achieved by rescaling the solution. The steady state solution is determined as the eigenvector corresponding to the zero eigenvalue. The method is applied to the solution of a problem with two molecular species and the simulation of a circadian clock in a biological cell. Comparison is made with a Monte Carlo method.", "paper_title": "Conservative solution of the Fokker-Planck equation for stochastic chemical reactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000243196000007"}
