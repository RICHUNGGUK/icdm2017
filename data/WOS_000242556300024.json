The HDPSO combines anew discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) with a local search. DPSO is an approach designed for the TSP based on the binary version of particle swarm optimization. Unlike in general versions of particle swarm optimization, DPSO redefines the particle's position and velocity, and then updates its state by using a tour construction. The embedded local search is implemented to improve the solutions generated by DPSO. The experimental results on some instances are reported and indicate HDPSO can be used to solve TSPs.", "paper_title": "A hybrid discrete particle swarm optimization for the traveling salesman problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300024"}
