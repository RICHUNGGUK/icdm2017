In this formulation, we use a stabilization parameter that was introduced for compressible flows and a new shock-capturing parameter. In the context of two test problems, we evaluate the performance of the new shock-capturing parameter. We also evaluate the performance of the space-time SUPG formulation compared to the semi-discrete SUPG formulation, where the system of semi-discrete equations is solved with the central-difference (Crank-Nicolson) time-integration algorithm.
