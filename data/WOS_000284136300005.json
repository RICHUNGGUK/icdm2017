VI, Problem 7.7). The model is obtained from the undirected graphical model of the complete bipartite graph K(2,4) by marginalizing two of the six binary random variables. We present algorithms for computing the Newton polytope of its defining equation by parallel walks along the polytope and its normal fan. In this way we compute vertices of the polytope. Finally, we also compute and certify its facets by studying tangent cones of the polytope at the symmetry classes of vertices. The Newton polytope has 17 214 912 vertices in 44 938 symmetry classes and 70 646 facets in 246 symmetry classes.
