The VaR concept has also been further extended to the portfolio value-at-risk (PVaR) measure used for managing risks and returns under a multiple-asset portfolio. Precise prediction of PVaR provides better evaluation criteria in areas such as investment decision-making and risk management. The two issues concerned with portfolio risk are efficient set selection and volatility forecasting. Most of the statistical portfolio selection models are based oil linear functions under specific assumptions. Due to the fattailed distribution in most real financial time-series data, extreme Value theory (EVT) is powerful in determining the VaR of a portfolio by concentrating oil estimating the shape of the fat-tailed probability distribution. However, using EVT to evaluate the portfolio's volatility is very difficult, because each asset within the portfolio has its own distinct peak threshold Value. This study introduces art evolutionary portfolio volatility forecasting model to optimize portfolios under their maximum expected returns subject to a risk constraint. We use a genetic algorithm (GA) to extract the best portfolio set and most suitable peak threshold in order to estimate the portfolio's VaR by means of EVT.
