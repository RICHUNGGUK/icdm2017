A multirepeat is maximal if it cannot be extended either to the right or to the left and produce a multirepeat. In this paper, we present algorithms for two different versions of the problem of finding maximal multirepeats in a set of strings. In the case of arbitrary gaps, we propose an algorithm with O(sigma N(2)n + alpha) time complexity. When the gap is bounded in a small range c, we propose an algorithm with O((c(2) + sigma(2))mN(2)n log(Nn) + alpha) time complexity. Here, N is the number of strings, n the mean length of each string, m the multiplicity of the multirepeat and alpha the number of reported occurrences. Our results extend previous work by considering sets of strings as well as by generalizing pairs to multirepeats.", "paper_title": "Locating maximal multirepeats in multiple strings under various constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000244840100005"}
