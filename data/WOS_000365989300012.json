The cognitive constituent of rClass is underpinned by a recurrent network based on a generalized version of the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system possessing a local feedback of the rule layer. The main basis of the what-to-learn component relies on the new active learning-based conflict measure. Meanwhile, the when-to-learn learning scenario makes use of the standard sample reserved strategy. The how-to-learn module actualizes the Schema and Scaffolding concepts of cognitive psychology. All learning principles are committed in the single-pass local learning modes and create a plug-and-play learning foundation minimizing additional pre- or post-training phases. The efficacy of rClass has been scrutinized by means of rigorous empirical studies, statistical tests, and benchmarks with state-of-the-art classifiers, which demonstrate the rClass potency in producing reliable classification rates, while retaining low complexity in terms of the rule base burden, computational load, and annotation effort.", "paper_title": "Recurrent Classifier Based on an Incremental Metacognitive-Based Scaffolding Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000365989300012"}
