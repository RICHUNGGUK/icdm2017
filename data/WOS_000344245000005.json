First, a new formulation of the bounded real lemma (BRL) for discrete-time singular Markovian jump systems is given by referencing slack variables technique, which ensures the considered systems to be regular, causal and stochastically stable with given H-infinity performance index gamma. Then, based on this new BRL, the desired controller gains are also presented by solving a set of strict linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness and less conservativeness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "H-infinity control for discrete-time singular Markovian jump systems based on the novel bounded real lemma", "paper_id": "WOS:000344245000005"}
