Couinaud divided the liver into 8 functionally independent segments. However, this method is not simple to perform in 3D space directly. Thus, we propose a rapid method to segment the liver based on the hepatic vessel tree. The most important step of this method is vascular projection. By carefully selecting a projection plane, a 3D point can be fixed in the projection plane. This greatly helps in rapid classification. This method was validated by applying it to a 3D liver depicted on CT images, and the result was in good agreement with Couinaud's classification. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
