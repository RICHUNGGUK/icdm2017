In the proposed method, blood vessel-like objects are extracted using the Laplacian operator and noisy objects are pruned according to the centerlines, which are detected using the normalized gradient vector field. The method has been tested with all the pathological retina images in the publicly available STARE database. Experiment results show that the method can avoid detecting false vessels in pathological regions and can produce reliable results for healthy regions.", "paper_title": "A novel vessel segmentation algorithm for pathological retina images based on the divergence of vector fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000252815200009"}
