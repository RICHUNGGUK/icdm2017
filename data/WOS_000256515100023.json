To tackle this problem, a skin heat transfer (SHT) model based on thermal physiology is derived in this paper. The proposed model converts the facial thermograms into blood-perfusion data, which is revealed to reduce the within-class scatter of face images. The advantage of the derived blood-perfusion data over the raw thermograms for recognition is analyzed by the normalized reverse cumulative histogram. It is shown that blood-perfusion data are more consistent in representing facial features. The experiments conducted on both same-session and time-lapse data have further demonstrated that (1) the blood-perfusion data are less sensitive to ambient temperature, physiological and psychological conditions if the human bodies are in the steady state; (2) for time-lapse data, the performance with the blood-perfusion data is nearly identical to that of the same-session data, while the recognition rate with the temperature data dramatically decreases in this case. The major contributions of this work are the well-grounded infrared data preprocessing and the corresponding face recognition system. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
