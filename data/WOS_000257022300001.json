Sinusoidal analysis is used to isolate and extract deterministic sounds, and transients are also isolated/extracted, leaving the stochastic background which is parameterized by wavelet tree analysis. All of these components become templates for the synthesis phase, which is controlled (1) by placing templates on timelines or in groups, (2) by real-time manipulation of parameters, and (3) via scripting using the ChucK language. The result is a flexible \"workbench\" for doing modern day musique concrete or acousmatic composition, sound design, and other sonic sculpting tasks.", "paper_title": "Musical tapestry: Re-composing natural sounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000257022300001"}
