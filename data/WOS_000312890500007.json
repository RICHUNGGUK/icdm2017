However, data reliability and confidence are essential components of a data warehousing system, as they influence subsequent retrieval and analysis. In this paper, we propose a generic method to assess data reliability from a set of criteria using the theory of belief functions. Customizable criteria and insightful decisions are provided. The chosen illustrative example comes from real-world data issued from the Sym'Previus predictive microbiology oriented data warehouse.", "paper_title": "Evaluating Data Reliability: An Evidential Answer with Application to a Web-Enabled Data Warehouse", "paper_id": "WOS:000312890500007"}
