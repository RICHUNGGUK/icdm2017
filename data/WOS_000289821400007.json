As these experiments show, using appropriate road and vehicle modeling and strong vehicle detection and tracking algorithms offers a good trade-off between correct dynamic vehicle identification and a real-time frame rate. Further, heuristic rules can help analyze and solve difficult traffic situations.", "paper_title": "Video-Based Distance Traffic Analysis: Application to Vehicle Tracking and Counting", "paper_id": "WOS:000289821400007"}
