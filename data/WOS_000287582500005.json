Preoperative planning using computed tomography (CT) is critically important, given the desirability of less invasive surgical approaches. The goal of this work is to advance 3D puzzle-solving methods towards use as a preoperative tool for reconstructing these complex fractures. A methodology for generating typical fragmentation/dispersal patterns was developed. Five identical replicas of human distal tibia anatomy were machined from blocks of high-density polyetherurethane foam (bone fragmentation surrogate), and were fractured using an instrumented drop tower. Pre- and post-fracture geometries were obtained using laser scans and CT. A semi-automatic virtual reconstruction computer program aligned fragment native (non-fracture) surfaces to a pre-fracture template. The tibiae were precisely reconstructed with alignment accuracies ranging from 0.03 to 0.4mm. This novel technology has the potential to significantly enhance surgical techniques for reconstructing comminuted intra-articular fractures, as illustrated for a representative clinical case.", "paper_title": "A computational/experimental platform for investigating three-dimensional puzzle solving of comminuted articular fractures", "paper_id": "WOS:000287582500005"}
