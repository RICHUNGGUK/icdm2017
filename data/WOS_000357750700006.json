The problems related to their design and implementation have sufficiently been solved. However, the true problems occur when an IS is already deployed and user requirements change. In this paper we introduce DaemonX - an evolution management framework which enables to manage evolution of complex applications efficiently and correctly. Using the idea of plug-ins, it enables to model almost any kind of a data format (currently XML, UML, ER, and BPMN). Since it preserves also mapping among modeled constructs of modeled formats via a common platform-independent model, it naturally supports propagation of changes to all related and affected parts.", "paper_title": "DATA AND QUERY ADAPTATION USING DAEMONX", "paper_id": "WOS:000357750700006"}
