We differentiate the methods of dynamic spectrum allocation as coordinated usage of resources, interworking solutions, integration solutions and secondary access of spectrum, Secondary spectrum access approaches are generally classified as real-time and non-real-time secondary access. However, the focus of this work is on real-time secondary spectrum utilization which can follow a negotiated or opportunistic access strategy. While different solutions for increasing spectrum utilization and efficiency are under investigation, many aspects of spectrum sharing technologies are still open questions. After an extensive literature survey, the major challenges and open questions of real-time secondary usage of spectrum are addressed here. We also provide some insights on potentially important design considerations and requirements when developing successful spectrum management schemes to realize real-time secondary spectrum usage.
