In addition, many emerging reconfigurable architectures have been optimised for low power. However, carrying out run-time reconfigurations often involves a costly reconfiguration overhead both in execution time and in energy consumption. Only the execution-time overhead was dealt with in the previous work. Here, the approach is significantly extended in order to reduce the reconfiguration energy overhead as well. To this end, a configuration memory hierarchy is proposed, with a shared memory layer consisting of a module optimised for performance combined with a module optimised for energy-efficient accesses. For this hierarchy, the authors have developed a mapping algorithm that decides where to load each configuration in order to achieve significant energy savings without introducing any performance degradation.", "paper_title": "Memory hierarchy for high-performance and energy-aware reconfigurable systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000250017300016"}
