This is an interactive artwork and drawing tool for creative participant experiences. Emergence is characteristically creative and many different models of emergence exist. It is therefore possible to effect creativity through the application of emergence mechanisms from these different disciplines. A review of theories of emergence and examples of visualization in the arts, is provided. An art project led by the author is then discussed in this context. This project, Iterative Intersections, is a collaboration with community artists from Cerebral Palsy League. It has resulted in a number of creative outcomes including the interactive art application, Of me with me. Analytical discussion of this work shows how its construction draws on aspects of experience design, fractal and emergent theory to effect perceptual emergence and creative experience as well as to facilitate self-efficacy.", "paper_title": "Emergence in Interactive Artistic Visualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000356542800002"}
