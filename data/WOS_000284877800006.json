In this study, silver nanoparticles were synthesized, evaluated for its wound healing activity and its effect in some functions of the liver and kidney. We investigated the wound-healing properties of silver nanoparticles in an animal model and found that rapid healing and improved cosmetic appearance occur within 15 days. Furthermore, we showed that silver nanoparticles exert positive effects through their antimicrobial properties, reduction in wound inflammation, and modulation in some of liver and kidney functions during skin wound healing. These results have given insight into the actions of silver and have provided a novel therapeutic direction for wound treatment in clinical practice. (C) 2010 King Saud University.
