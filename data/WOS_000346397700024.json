Several representative two-dimensional slope examples are analysed. Using the associated flow rule, the results showed that the two finite element methods were generally in good agreement and that the LEM yielded a slightly lower factor of safety than the two finite element methods did. Moreover, a key condition regarding the stress field is shown to be necessary for ELSM analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
