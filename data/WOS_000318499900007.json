Cloud computing using virtualization allows workloads to be deployed and scaled quickly through the rapid provisioning of virtual machines on physical machines. However, I/O virtualization, particularly for networking, suffers from significant performance degradation in the presence of high-speed networking connections. In this paper, we first analyze performance challenges in network I/O virtualization and identify two problems-conventional network I/O virtualization suffers from excessive virtual interrupts to guest VMs, and the back-end driver does not efficiently use the computing resources of underlying multicore processors. To address these challenges, we propose optimization methods for enhancing the networking performance: 1) Efficient interrupt coalescing for network I/O virtualization and 2) virtual receive-side scaling to effectively leverage multicore processors. These methods are implemented and evaluated with extensive performance tests on a Xen virtualization platform. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed optimizations can significantly improve network I/O virtualization performance and effectively solve the performance challenges.", "paper_title": "Performance Enhancement for Network I/O Virtualization with Efficient Interrupt Coalescing and Virtual Receive-Side Scaling", "paper_id": "WOS:000318499900007"}
