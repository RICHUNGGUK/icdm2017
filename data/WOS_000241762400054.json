In the realm of ubiquitous computing, the domain specific ontologies are constructed manually by experts, which is quite a toiling task. We proposed to extract ontologies dynamically for ubiquitous systems. We also argue that the components of the software middleware are the specialized research areas with different subject orientation e.g. context reasoning, service discovery etc[1] and following an evolvable component oriented approach would let the components of the software evolve independently of other software components, while making them interoperable irrespective of versions and vendors.", "paper_title": "On the dynamic management of information in ubiquitous systems using evolvable software components", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762400054"}
