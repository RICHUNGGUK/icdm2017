In this paper, we propose an innovative fully distributed DMAC protocol that cooperatively makes use of polarization diversity in low-mobility urban/suburban outdoor wireless ad hoc network environment. In the proposed cooperative polarization DMAC protocol (CPDMAC), each node directionally senses on both vertical and horizontal polarizations and dynamically adapts polarization that minimizes overall interference in the ad hoc network. Analysis is performed to establish relationship between vertically and horizontally polarized nodes in the network. Further, a theoretical lower bound is derived for probability of successful transmission to show capacity improvement as a function of cross polarization ratio (CPR). Simulation results confirm from 2% up to 400% improvement in average node throughput at data rate of 1.95 Mbps when compared to the traditional DMAC protocol. Moreover, our study clearly shows that the average throughput difference increases with increasing node density when compared to the traditional DMAC protocol. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
