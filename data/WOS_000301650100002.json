The integration of the simulation environment into a road vehicle dynamics curriculum is also presented. The simulation environment provides an immersive experience to conduct a wide range of research on driving behavior, vehicle design and intelligent traffic systems. From an education perspective, the environment is designed to promote hands-on student participation in real-world engineering experiences that enhance conventional learning mechanisms for road vehicle dynamics and engineering systems analysis. The paper assesses the impact of the environment on student learning objectives in an upper level vehicle dynamics course and presents results from research involving teenage drivers. The paper presents an integrated framework for the use of real-time simulation and large-scale visualization to both study driving behaviors and to discover the impact that design decisions have on vehicle design using a realistic simulated driving interface.
