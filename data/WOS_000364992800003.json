(PCySeMoL)-Cy-2 includes theory on how attacks and defenses relate quantitatively; thus, users must only model their assets and how these are connected in order to enable calculations. The performance of (PCySeMoL)-Cy-2 enables quick calculations of large object models. It has been validated on both a component level and a system level using literature, domain experts, surveys, observations, experiments and case studies.", "paper_title": "(PCySeMoL)-Cy-2: Predictive, Probabilistic Cyber Security Modeling Language", "paper_id": "WOS:000364992800003"}
