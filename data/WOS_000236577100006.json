This paper focuses on the enterprise model creation process using the computer integrated manufacturing open system architecture ( CIMOSA) modelling framework, assuming that the models of the enterprise environment to be analysed are available in the form of data flow diagrams ( DFDs) or unified modelling language ( UML) use cases. The method mostly concerns the development of partial models and the specification of enterprise components to support knowledge capitalization about the enterprise structure and operations. Not only information-oriented models ( i.e. data schemas) are needed to support enterprise integration, but also models describing function, information, resource and organization aspects of the business. Planning and development of workflow applications also require such an approach. For these reasons, it is useful to start from DFDs or UML models, usually available in many companies or easy to draft from user explanations, and to adapt or extend them with the approach presented in the paper to plan enterprise integration projects or to analyse the business operations from an industrial engineering perspective.", "paper_title": "From UML or DFD models to CIMOSA partial models and enterprise components", "paper_id": "WOS:000236577100006"}
