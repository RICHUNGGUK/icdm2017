A competitor that is at least as expressive as STSG is proposed and compared to STSG. The competitor is the extended multi bottom-up tree transducer (MBOT), which is the bottom-up analogue with the additional feature that states have non-unary ranks. Unweighted MBOT have already been investigated with respect to their basic properties, but the particular properties of the constructions that are required in the machine translation task are largely unknown. STSG and MBOT are compared with respect to binarization, regular restriction, and application. Particular attention is paid to the complexity of the constructions.", "paper_title": "An alternative to synchronous tree substitution grammars", "paper_id": "WOS:000289532400006"}
