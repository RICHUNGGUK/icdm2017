The 1/r singularity at r = 0 is avoided by using Gauss-Radau type quadrature points. In order to break the time-step restriction in the time-dependent problems, the clustering of collocation points near the pole is prevented through the technique of domain decomposition in the radial direction. A number of Poisson-type equations subject to the Dirichlet or Neumann boundary condition are computed and compared with the results in literature, which reveals a desirable result.
