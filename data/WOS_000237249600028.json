We introduce new formulations for the 1-SVM that can manipulate graph kernels quite efficiently. We demonstrate that the proposed formulations fully utilize the sparse structure of the Laplacian matrix, which enables the proposed approaches to be applied to recommendation tasks having a large number of customers and products in practical computational times. Results of various numerical experiments demonstrating the high performance of the proposed approaches are presented.", "paper_title": "One-class support vector machines for recommendation tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600028"}
