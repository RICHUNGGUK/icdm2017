Refinement and coarsening operations are defined in terms of set-operations resulting in robust and easy implementation compared to a quad-tree-based implementation. The graph only stores information corresponding to the leaves of a quad-tree thus has a smaller memory foot-print. The adjacency information in the graph relieves one from going up and down the quad-tree when searching for neighbors. This results in constant time complexities for refinement and coarsening operations.", "paper_title": "Maximal independent set graph partitions for representations of body-centered cubic lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000265539300006"}
