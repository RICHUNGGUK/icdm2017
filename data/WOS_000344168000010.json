The proposed LDO utilizes a non-symmetrical class-AB amplifier as the input stage to improve the transient performances. Meanwhile, PSR enhancement circuit, which only consumes 0.2-A mu A quiescent current at light load, is utilized to form a feedforward cancellation path for improving PSR over wide frequency range. The LDO has been designed and simulated in a mixed signal 0.13-A mu m CMOS process. From the post simulation results, the LDO is capable of delivering 100-mA output current at 0.2-V dropout voltage, with 3.8-A mu A quiescent current at light load. The undershoot, the overshoot and the 1 % settling time of the proposed LDO with load current switching from 50 A mu A to 100 mA in 300 ns are about 100 mV, 100 mV and 1 A mu s, respectively. With the help of proposed PSR enhancement technique, the LDO achieves a PSR of -69 dB at 100 kHz frequency for a 100-mA load current.", "paper_title": "A fast-transient high-PSR output-capacitor-free low-dropout regulator for low-power embedded systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000344168000010"}
