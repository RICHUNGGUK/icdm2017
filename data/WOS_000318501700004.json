The model deals with the entire process, consisting of fixation of bacteria, as well as of the subsequent soil reinforcement. The paper deals with the coupling of two earlier models for bacterial placement and reinforcement, where the construction of the model is discussed, as well as numerical results. Further, we present analytical solutions for the constant flow velocity case. The model is based on the assumption that the porous medium is stiff.", "paper_title": "A mathematical model for Biogrout", "paper_id": "WOS:000318501700004"}
