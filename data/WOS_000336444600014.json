The problem is of interest from four points of view: coding theory, combinatorial designs, -analogs, and projective geometry. In particular we examine coverings based on lifted maximum rank distance codes, combined with spreads and a recursive construction. New constructions are given for with or . We discuss the density for some of these coverings. Tables for the best known coverings, for and , are presented. We present some questions concerning possible constructions of new coverings of smaller size.", "paper_title": "Covering of subspaces by subspaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000336444600014"}
