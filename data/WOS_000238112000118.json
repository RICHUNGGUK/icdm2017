This method minimizes the long-time error other than the immediate error to improve the identification effect. We first represent the GFHM with a neural network structure, and then utilize the adaptive critic designs (ACDs) to get the optimal parameters of the network so that the long-time identification error is minimized. Finally, we give a simulation example to verify the effectiveness of this identification method.", "paper_title": "A new fuzzy identification method based on adaptive critic designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000118"}
