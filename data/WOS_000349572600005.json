RQA is used to obtain the nonlinear characteristic parameters which are able to effectively represent the resonance states without large amount of measurement data. The binary tree SVM is ordered according to the rank of state Mahalanobis distances in the feature vector space. In order to more precisely classify the feature zones, the RQA features are optimally selected as the inputs for each classifier of binary tree SVM by means of the Fish score evaluation. The practical experiments are performed on the cylindrical shaft-journal bearing test rig and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
