Most of these problems could be translated into solutions for systems of linear equations: the very topic of numerical linear algebra. Seemingly then, a set of efficient linear solvers could be solving important scientific problems for years to come. We argue that dramatic changes in hardware designs precipitated by the shifting nature of the marketplace of computer hardware had a continuous effect on the software for numerical linear algebra. The extraction of high percentages of peak performance continues to require adaptation of software. If the past history of this adaptive nature of linear algebra software is any guide then the future theme will feature changes as well - changes aimed at harnessing the incredible advances of the evolving hardware infrastructure.
