In such cases, we often wish to identify records that describe the same entity over time and so be able to perform interesting longitudinal data analysis. However, existing record linkage techniques ignore temporal information and fall short for temporal data. This article studies linking temporal records. First, we apply time decay to capture the effect of elapsed time on entity value evolution. Second, instead of comparing each pair of records locally, we propose clustering methods that consider the time order of the records and make global decisions. Experimental results show that our algorithms significantly outperform traditional linkage methods on various temporal data sets.", "paper_title": "Linking temporal records", "paper_id": "WOS:000304876500004"}
