The deformation due to laser scanning depends on various factors, namely laser power, scan speed, spot diameter, scan position, number of scans, and many others. This article presents soft computing-based methods to predict deformations for a set of heating conditions, and also to determine the heating lines and heat conditions, in order to get a desired shape (i.e., inverse analysis). A novel attempt has been made in this paper to carry out analysis and synthesis (inverse analysis) of laser forming process using both genetic-neural network (GA-NN) and genetic adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (GA-ANFIS). During the analysis, laser power, scan speed, spot diameter, scan position and number of scans are taken as inputs and bending angle is considered as the output. A batch mode of training has been used for both the approaches with the help of some experimental data. The performances of the developed approaches have been tested on some real experimental data. Both the approaches are found to be effective to predict the bending angles and carry out the process synthesis successfully. GA-NN approach is found to perform better than the GA-ANFIS approach in predicting the bending angles, and both the approaches are able to provide comparable predictions in inverse analysis.", "paper_title": "Analysis and synthesis of laser forming process using neural networks and neuro-fuzzy inference system", "paper_id": "WOS:000317786400010"}
