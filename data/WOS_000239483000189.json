In order to enable the PID controller to perform better, genetic algorithms are used to accumulate the priori knowledge of the neural network's connection weights, and the system voltages and the controlled parameters are forecasted. The experimental results show that the electronic power load simulator runs well when the Volt-Ampere characteristics simulated are time-variable or voltage disturbances occur in power system.", "paper_title": "Application of BP neural network in power load simulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000189"}
