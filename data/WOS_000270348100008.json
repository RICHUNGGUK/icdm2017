The proposed setting allows us to investigate suitable or-level sets of such processes, modeling birth-and-growth processes. A decomposition theorem is established to characterize the nucleation and the growth. As a consequence, different consistent set-valued estimators are studied for growth process. Moreover, the nucleation process is studied via the hitting function, and a consistent estimator of the nucleation hitting function is derived. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
