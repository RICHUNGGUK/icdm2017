Comparing with the morphological characteristic of photoplethysmograph (PPG) [2], the alternative sphygmogram (SPG) signal is much sharper and promising to improve the accuracy of onset point detection in PWTT estimation. Consequently, a hardware and software close-loop control scheme for SPG sampling with less distortion is proposed, through which the signal amplitude and baseline self-adjustment is realized such that the resulted SPG signal is more properly suitable for onset point detection. Testing results show out its superior features for adapting PWTT in e-home healthcare. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
