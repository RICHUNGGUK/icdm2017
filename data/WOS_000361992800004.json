The research in this field has lasted for nearly half a century. The period from 2010 to 2014 is the rapid developing period for China whose annual output has been close to USA by 2014. Though abundant in output, China did not performance equally well in terms of citation counts and h-index. Dalian University of Technology is the only Chinese institute that has ranked among the top ten productive institutes in the world. The journal China Ocean Engineering has published the majority articles produced by China and it is the only journal published by China in the field of Ocean Engineering. In order to give insight into the smaller impact of China in the field, this study has compared the collaborative relationship of China in detail both from the aspects of countries and institutes.", "paper_title": "A comparative study of Ocean Engineering research between China and the world", "paper_id": "WOS:000361992800004"}
