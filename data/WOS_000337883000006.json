In the proposed model, the network is treated as a collection of Rayleigh fading multiple access channels. In this model, rate allocation scheme that is based solely on the statistics of the channels is presented. The rate allocation scheme is aimed at minimizing the outage probability. An upper bound is presented for the probability of outage in the fading multiple access channel. A suboptimal solution based on this bound is given. A distributed primal-dual gradient algorithm is derived to solve the rate allocation problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
