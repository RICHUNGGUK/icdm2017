Extending the method to time-dependent problems can, e.g., be done by backward differentiation formula (BDF) or diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) methods. In this work, we investigate the use of embedded DIRK methods in an HDG solver, including the use of adaptive timestep control. Numerical results demonstrate the performance of the method for both linear and nonlinear (systems of) time-dependent convection-diffusion equations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
