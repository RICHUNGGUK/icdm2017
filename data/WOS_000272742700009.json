Based on social cognitive theory, this study models and tests relationships among self-efficacy in information security, security practice behavior and motivation to strengthen security efforts. This study also explores antecedents to individuals' self-efficacy beliefs in information security. Results provide support for the many hypothesized relationships. This study provides an initial step toward understanding of the applicability of social cognitive theory in a new domain of information security. The results suggest that simply listing what not to do and penalties associated with a wrong doing in the users' information security policy alone will have a limited impact on effective implementation of security measures. The findings may help information security professionals design security awareness programs that more effectively increase the self-efficacy in information security. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
