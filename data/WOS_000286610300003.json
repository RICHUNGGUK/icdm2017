It is a general purpose global pose normalization method; in this paper it is used to enhance the performance of a 3D object retrieval pipeline. Initially, the axis-aligned minimum bounding box of a rigid 3D object is modified by requiring that the 3D object is also in minimum angular difference with respect to the normals to the faces of its bounding box. To estimate the modified axis-aligned bounding box, a set of predefined planes of symmetry are used and a combined spatial and angular distance, between the 3D object and its symmetric object, is calculated. By minimizing the combined distance, the 3D object fits inside its modified axis-aligned bounding box and alignment with the coordinate system is achieved. The proposed method is incorporated in a hybrid scheme, that serves as the alignment method in a 3D object retrieval system. The effectiveness of the 3D object retrieval system, using the hybrid pose normalization scheme, is evaluated in terms of retrieval accuracy and demonstrated using both quantitative and qualitative measures via an extensive consistent evaluation on standard benchmarks. The results clearly show performance boost against current approaches.", "paper_title": "ROSy+: 3D Object Pose Normalization Based on PCA and Reflective Object Symmetry with Application in 3D Object Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000286610300003"}
