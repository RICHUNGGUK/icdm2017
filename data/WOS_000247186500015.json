Specifically, it is shown that upper bounds to the rotation and translation worst-case error for a certain image noise intensity can be obtained through convex optimizations. These upper bounds, contrary to lower bounds provided by standard optimization tools, allow one to design robust visual servo systems.", "paper_title": "Image noise induced errors in camera positioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000247186500015"}
