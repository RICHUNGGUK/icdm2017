Two semi-supervised DR algorithms termed Marginal Semi-Supervised Sub-Manifold Projections ((MSMP)-M-3) and orthogonal (MSMP)-M-3 ((OMSMP)-M-3) are proposed. (MSMP)-M-3 in the singular case is also discussed. We also present the weighted least squares view of (MSMP)-M-3. Based on specifying the types of neighborhoods with pairwise constraints (PC) and the defined manifold scatters, our methods can preserve the local properties of all points and discriminant structures embedded in the localized PC. The sub-manifolds of different classes can also be separated. In PC guided methods, exploring and selecting the informative constraints is challenging and random constraint subsets significantly affect the performance of algorithms. This paper also introduces an effective technique to select the informative constraints for DR with consistent constraints. The analytic form of the projection axes can be obtained by eigen-decomposition. The connections between this work and other related work are also elaborated. The validity of the proposed constraint selection approach and DR algorithms are evaluated by benchmark problems. Extensive simulations show that our algorithms can deliver promising results over some widely used state-of-the-art semi-supervised DR techniques. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
