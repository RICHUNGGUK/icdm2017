These networks are characterized by the volatility of their hosts and connections, which may lead to network fragmentation. Although increasingly common, they remain a challenging target for distributed applications. In this paper, we focus on component-based distributed applications by addressing the distribution and the deployment of software components on dynamic pervasive networks. We present a distribution scheme and some associated middleware mechanisms that allow a component to provide its services in an ubiquitous way. First, an architecture description language extension is proposed in order to specify a deployment, driven by constraints on the resources needed by components. Then, a propagative and autonomic deployment process is explained, which is based on a consensus algorithm adapted for dynamic networks. Lastly, implementation details and experiment results are given.", "paper_title": "Middleware support for the deployment of ubiquitous software components", "paper_id": "WOS:000252389600007"}
