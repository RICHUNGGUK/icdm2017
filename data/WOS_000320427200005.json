Its purpose is to simulate a wide range of Reynolds numbers from Re-theta = 300 to 6800 while showing a linear weak scaling up to 32,768 cores in the BG/P architecture. Special attention has been paid to the generation of proper inflow boundary conditions. The results are in good agreement with existing numerical and experimental data sets. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
