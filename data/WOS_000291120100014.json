The level of disturbance can be particularly significant when the slope is formed using blasting techniques. However, the effects of this disturbance on the overall rock slope stability have not been investigated thoroughly in the current literature. In order to account for rock mass disturbance during construction, a disturbance factor has been included in the Hoek-Brown failure criterion [1]. This paper uses finite element upper and lower bound limit analyses to estimate rock slope stability based on the Hoek-Brown failure criterion whilst including the effect of rock mass disturbance. A rigorous set of analyses have been performed where the level of disturbance is considered as constant or linearly varying throughout the slope. The results are then compared to a number of reported case histories for verification purposes. From the results of this study, the disturbance factor was found to have significant influence on the rock slope stability assessment, especially for poorer quality rock masses. Hence, cautious engineering judgement must be exercised when estimating the level of disturbance. In addition, utilising stability charts to estimate the stability of cut rock slopes without considering the rock mass disturbance may lead to significant overestimations.
