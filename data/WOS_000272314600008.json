If the connectivity of G is k, the IST problem is to construct k ISTs rooted at each vertex. The IST problem has found applications in fault-tolerant broadcasting, but it is still open for general graphs with connectivity greater than four. In this paper, we shall propose a very simple algorithm for solving the IST problem on multidimensional torus networks. In our algorithm, every vertex can determine its parent for a specific independent spanning tree only depending on its own label. Thus, our algorithm can also be implemented in parallel systems or distributed systems very easily.", "paper_title": "Independent Spanning Trees on Multidimensional Torus Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000272314600008"}
