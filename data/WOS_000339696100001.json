Additionally a systematic flow for designing multi-mode architectures (implementing more than one function) of these families is introduced. Compared to the corresponding architectures that are produced by a commercial synthesis tool, the proposed ones are better in terms of both area (at least 40%) and throughput/area (from 32% up to 175%). Finally, the proposed architectures outperform similar existing ones in terms of throughput and throughput/area, from 4.2 x up to 279.4 x and from 1.2 x up to 5.5 x, respectively.
