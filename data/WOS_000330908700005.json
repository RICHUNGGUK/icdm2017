Biological modelling of information/data of an individual, personal and unique nature, namely individual biometrics, leads to extracting information classes necessary for personal data protection processes. Such processes can be used to secure various types of data. Adding semantic data analysis processes to IT system classes which are used to conceal processes of personal data management offers opportunities for semantically analysing and interpreting data while it is being disclosed/decrypted.
