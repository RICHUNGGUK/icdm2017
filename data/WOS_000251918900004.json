In the course of the paper, concepts defined in the realm of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, like joint and marginal random sets and random set inclusion are also generalized. It is shown that the proposed measure is the unique one that fulfills a set of characterizing properties, and in addition corresponds to the one defined in the field of evidence theory when particularized to finite random sets.
