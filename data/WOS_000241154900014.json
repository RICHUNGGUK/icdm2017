Accessibility of the subsystems at the time of connection or handoff request, availability of resources in the subsystems, user preferences, and connection class need to be considered in admission control. In this paper, we first give a general CAC algorithm for NGWS. We also propose the first analytical model in the literature for CAC in NGWS. We point out the major challenges in modeling for NGWS and propose a neat solution to calculate state probabilities in a reasonable way even as the state space proliferates. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
