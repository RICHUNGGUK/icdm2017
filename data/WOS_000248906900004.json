This paper deals with depth averaged turbulence modelling. The most important and widely used depth averaged turbulence models are reviewed and discussed, and a depth averaged algebraic stress model is presented. A finite volume model for solving the depth averaged shallow water equations coupled with several turbulence models is described with special attention to the modelling of wet-dry fronts. In order to asses the performance of the model, several flows are modelled and the numerical results are compared with experimental data.", "paper_title": "Depth averaged modelling of turbulent shallow water flow with wet-dry fronts", "paper_id": "WOS:000248906900004"}
