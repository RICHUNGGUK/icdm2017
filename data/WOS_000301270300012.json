As the literature shows how to do the inverse transformation, these results imply that both representations, state-space and VARMAX, are equally general and freely interchangeable. These algorithms are useful to solve three practical problems: (i) discussing the identifiability of a state-space model, (ii) performing its diagnostic checking, and (iii) calibrating its parameters so that it realizes, exactly or approximately, a given reduced-form VARMAX. These applications are illustrated by means of practical examples with real data. (C) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
