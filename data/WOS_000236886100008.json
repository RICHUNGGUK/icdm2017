The algorithm uses O(n log(2) n log log n + Delta(1/2+epsilon)) bit operations in a ring of discriminant Delta. This appears to be the first gcd algorithm of complexity o(n(2)) for any fixed non-Euclidean number ring. The main idea behind the algorithm is a well known relationship between quadratic forms and ideals in quadratic rings. We also give a simpler version of the algorithm that has complexity O(n(2)) in a fixed ring. It uses a new binary algorithm for reducing quadratic forms that may be of independent interest.", "paper_title": "A new GCD algorithm for quadratic number rings with unique factorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000236886100008"}
