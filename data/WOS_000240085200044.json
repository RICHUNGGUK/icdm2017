The meta-model for workflow resource model presents the constituents of workflow resource model. It is one of the three correlative sub-meta-models for workflow model. Based on the analysis of existed studies and real cases, an extended meta-model for workflow resource model was introduced by extending and modifying the meta-model for organizational model proposed by WfMC. The detail of entities and their relationships were described. The relationships between workflow resource model and process model were discussed. XML was used to describe the meta-model. In the end, a conclusion and proposals for future research directions were presented.", "paper_title": "An extended meta-model for workflow resource model", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085200044"}
