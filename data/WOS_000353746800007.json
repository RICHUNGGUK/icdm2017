In this study, we propose a new variant of RCPSP called RCPSP/pi RC, which can deal with realistic energy constraints such as power restriction during peak hours, contract demand, and energy consumption during setup operations. First, we present an integer programming (IP) model and a constraint programming (CP) model of the RCPSP/pi RC. Next, we present a heuristic mode restriction method called a mask calculation algorithm to achieve efficient searching by restricting selectable modes. Finally, through computational experiments, we evaluate the proposed methods and show their effectiveness. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
