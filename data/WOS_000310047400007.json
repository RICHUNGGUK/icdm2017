When focused on flood events, such an analysis should evidently include the theoretical and practical study of floods and their behavior. Nevertheless, risk assessment is not useful if the results are not subsequently used for more effective management and planning by local authorities and qualified personnel. The risk evaluation process is composed of a set of actions, each of which requires different inputs. In fact, the results of one action are used as the input for another. This paper describes a semantic model for the study and management of floods with a view to elaborating a conceptual framework and designing a knowledge base. The model is based on the environmental assessment ontology and demonstrates how a brief ontology can be generated.", "paper_title": "Semantic model for flood management", "paper_id": "WOS:000310047400007"}
