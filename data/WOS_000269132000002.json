In this paper, we address the problem of energy efficient reliable routing for wireless ad hoc networks in the presence of unreliable communication links or devices or lossy wireless link layers by integrating the power control techniques into the energy efficient routing. We consider both the case when the link layer implements a perfect reliability and the case when the reliability is implemented through the transport layer, e. g., TCP. We study the energy efficient unicast and multicast when the links are unreliable. Subsequently, we study how to perform power control (thus, controlling the reliability of each communication link) such that the unicast routings use the least power when the communication links are unreliable, while the power used by multicast is close to optimum. Extensive simulations have been conducted to study the power consumption, the end-to-end delay, and the network throughput of our proposed protocols compared with existing protocols.", "paper_title": "Reliable and Energy-Efficient Routing for Static Wireless Ad Hoc Networks with Unreliable Links", "paper_id": "WOS:000269132000002"}
