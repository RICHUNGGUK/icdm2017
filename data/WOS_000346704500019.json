In this paper, an efficient method based on quotients of correlation coefficients between local binary patterns (LBPs) coded frames is proposed. This method is composed of two parts: feature extraction and abnormal point detection. In the feature extraction, each frame of a video is coded by LBP. Then, quotients of correlation coefficients among sequential LBP-coded frames are calculated. In the abnormal point detection, insertion and deletion localization is achieved by using Tchebyshev inequality twice followed by abnormal points detection based on decision-thresholding. Experimental results show that our method has high detection accuracy and low computational complexity.
