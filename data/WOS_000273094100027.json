Due to this, accuracy is strongly influenced by the viewpoint of the images, being frontal views the most thoroughly studied. However, when fully automatic face analysis systems are designed, capturing frontal-view images cannot be guaranteed. Examples of this situation can be found in surveillance systems, car driver images or whenever there are architectural constraints that prevent from placing a camera frontal to the subject. Taking advantage of the fact that most facial features lie approximately on the same plane, we propose the use of projective geometry across different views. An active shape model constructed with frontal-view images can then be directly applied to the segmentation of pictures taken from other viewpoints. The proposed extension demonstrates being significantly more invariant than the standard approach. Validation of the method is presented in 360 images from the AV@CAR database, systematically divided into three different rotations (to both sides), as well as upper and lower views due to nodding. The presented tests are among the largest quantitative results reported to date in face segmentation under varying poses. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
