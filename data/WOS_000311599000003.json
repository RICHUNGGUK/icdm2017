In this paper, we propose a sensor network with mobile and static sensor nodes setup for the purpose of collaboratively performing tasks like sensing a phenomenon or monitoring a region. We investigate how the sensor network performs in the case when the sensor nodes move. We compare the simulation results for two cases: the sensor network with stationary sensor nodes and multi mobile sensor nodes. The simulation results have shown that for the multi mobile sensors, the goodput is unstable. Also, the goodput of stationary sensors is better than multi mobile sensors. In case of consumed energy, the consumed energy of multi mobile sensors is better than stationary sensors. The RE of multi mobile sensors is better than stationary sensors. We also consider goodput and routing efficiency metrics to evalute the performance of WSN consider mobile events. The simulation results have shown that for single mobile event, the goodput is better than multi mobile events when the number of sensor nodes is higher. In case of boids model, the goodput of multi mobile events is better than single mobile event. In case of random model, the RE of single mobile event is belief than multi mobile events. The RE of multi mobile events is better than single mobile event in case of boids model.", "paper_title": "Energy-saving in wireless sensor networks considering mobile sensor nodes, single and multi events", "paper_id": "WOS:000311599000003"}
