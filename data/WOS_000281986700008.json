However, the EPON architecture although cost effective is bandwidth limited and quality of service (QoS) support is still a major concern. In this paper, we propose a cost-efficient wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) EPON architecture. We present two wavelength and bandwidth allocation algorithms with full QoS support to fulfill all requirements of new application and services in a converged triple play network. We analyze and compare the presented models and algorithms in terms of delay, jitter, queue occupancy, throughput and overall system performance. We conduct detailed simulation experiments to study the performance and validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and algorithms.", "paper_title": "Novel wavelength and bandwidth allocation algorithms for WDM EPON with QoS support", "paper_id": "WOS:000281986700008"}
