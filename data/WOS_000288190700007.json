Service composition techniques are usually designed as an extension to service discovery. Traditional techniques try to match a user's requirements, often complex, with the available services. However, one-to-one matching is inefficient; it is preferable to meet the request from available services even when one of the basic services is not present. Separating composition and discovery has also led to inefficiency, especially in a highly dynamic environment. With the heterogeneity of networks, users, and applications having multiple sources, constructing service-specific overlays in large distributed networks is challenging. In this article, we propose a new service composition algorithm to deal with the problem of composing multiple autonomic elements to achieve system-wide goals. Using a self-organizing approach, autonomic entities are dynamically and seamlessly composed into service-specific overlay networks. The algorithm combines composition and service discovery into one step, thereby achieving more efficiency and less latency. The decentralized and self-organizing nature of the algorithm allows it to respond rapidly to system changes. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the approach when it is compared to other solutions.", "paper_title": "A Decentralized Self-Organizing Service Composition for Autonomic Entities", "paper_id": "WOS:000288190700007"}
