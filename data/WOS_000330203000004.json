Survivability is one of the key issues in the planning of LR-PON because massive high-rate traffic flows may be interrupted in case of network component failure. However, the survivability issue for LR-PON is addressed in little works. More importantly, most of the previous works focus on single distribution fiber failure and remain untouched the simultaneous failure of multiple distribution fibers, which is a possible failure scenario in LR-PON. In this paper, we focus on the survivability of LR-PON against single Shared-Risk Link Group (SRLG) failure. A reliability model is proposed to represent the disconnection probability of the ONUs. Based on this reliability model, we propose a novel Backup Fibers Protection (BFP) scheme. In the BFP scheme, we deal with the optimization problem of allocating backup capacity and deploying backup fibers. Under the constraint of reliability requirement, our objective is to fully protect all traffic demand in the network with the minimum deployment cost of backup fibers. Both ILP-based approach and heuristic approach are proposed to solve the optimization problem in the BFP scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work regarding the survivability of LR-PON against single SRLG failure. Through extensive simulation, we investigate the performance of BFP and demonstrate its effectiveness in different scenarios. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
