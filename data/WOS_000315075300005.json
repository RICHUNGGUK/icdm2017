Rather than analysing worst-case performance under some assumptions, we prove novel, unconditional performance bounds that are parameterised by a regularisation of the actual dynamics of the price of the asset. The mix algorithm processes T prices in O(T-2) time and O(T) space, but if the employed prior density is exponential, the time requirement reduces to O(T). The fix algorithm does the same in O(T) time and O(1) space, for any prior; its bound is slightly stronger than the bound for mix but only applies to a single regularisation that is determined by the algorithm. The result translates to the prediction with expert advice framework, and has applications in data compression and hypothesis testing. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
