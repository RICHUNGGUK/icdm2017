However, the CBIR systems that employ image classification suffer from the problem of hidden classes. The queries associated with hidden classes cannot be accurately answered using a traditional CBIR system. To address this problem, a robust CBIR scheme is proposed that incorporates a novel query detection technique and a self-adaptive retrieval strategy. A number of experiments carried out on the two popular image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
