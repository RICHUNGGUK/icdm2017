In particular, the well-known Taylor-Hood element pair (continuous piecewise quadratic elements for velocity and continuous piecewise linear elements for pressure) results in highly accuracy velocity and pressure approximations. However, the Taylor-Hood element suffers from poor mass conservation which can lead to significant numerical mass balance errors for long-time simulations. In this paper, we develop and investigate a new finite element Stokes ice sheet dynamics model that enforces local element-wise mass conservation by enriching the pressure finite element space by adding the discontinuous piecewise constant pressure space to the Taylor-Hood pressure space. Through various numerical tests based on manufactured solutions, benchmark test problems, and the realistic Greenland ice-sheet, we demonstrate that, for ice-sheet modeling, the enriched Taylor-Hood finite element model remains highly accurate and efficient, and is physically more reliable and robust compared to the classic Taylor-Hood finite element model.
