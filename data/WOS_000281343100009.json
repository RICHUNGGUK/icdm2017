Although the conventional lifting-based filter banks (LBFBs), which are constructed by lifting structures with integer coefficients and rounding operations, suffer from degradation of coding performance due to much rounding error generated by cascading lifting structures, our proposals can be applied to any PUFB without losing many ones because building blocks can be applied to every lifting block as it is. It is constructed with very simple structures and many rounding operations are eliminated. Additionally, the number of rounding operations is reduced more by using two-dimensional block transform (2DBT) of separated transform to each building block. As result, even though the proposed PUFBs require a little side information block (SIB), they show better coding performance in lossless-to-lossy image coding than the conventional ones.", "paper_title": "M-Channel Paraunitary Filter Banks Based on Direct Lifting Structure of Building Block and Its Inverse Transform for Lossless-to-Lossy Image Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000281343100009"}
