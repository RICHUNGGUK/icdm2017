How to provide fast mounting and consistency of file system and data for flash memory file systems has become important research topics in recent years. In this paper, we design and propose a new flash memory file system called RFFS (Reliable Flash File System), which targets NAND flash memory based embedded systems that require fast mounting and fault tolerant file system. We have experimented on the performance of RFFS and the results showed that RFFS could improve the mounting time by 65%-76% compared with YAFFS. Also RFFS improved mounting time after sudden system faults by 89%-92% compared with JFFS2.", "paper_title": "Fast mounting and recovery for NAND flash memory based embedded systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000072"}
