However, only one kernel scale is used in SVR. We implemented a multi scale support vector regression (MS-SVR), which has several different kernel scales, and tested it on two time series benchmarks: Mackey-Class time series and Laser generated data. In both cases, MS-SVR improves the performance of SVR greatly: fewer support vectors and less prediction error.", "paper_title": "Time series predictions using multi-scale support vector regressions", "paper_id": "WOS:000238091800045"}
