Some of previous studies on fuzzy regression analysis obtain crisp regression coefficients for eliminating the problem of increasing spreads for the estimated fuzzy responses as the magnitude of the independent variable increases; however, they still cannot cope with the situation of decreasing or variable spreads. This paper proposes a three-phase method to construct the fuzzy regression model with variable spreads to resolve this problem. In the first phase, on the basis of the extension principle, the membership functions of the least-squares estimates of regression coefficients are constructed to conserve completely the fuzziness of observations. In the second phase, then they are defuzzified by the center of gravity method to obtain crisp regression coefficients. In the third phase, the error terms of the proposed model are determined by setting each estimated spread equals its corresponding observed spread. Furthermore, the Mamdani fuzzy inference system is adopted for improving the accuracy of its forecasts. Compared to the previous studies, the results from five examples and an application example of Japanese house prices show that the proposed fuzzy linear regression model has higher explanatory power and forecasting performance.
