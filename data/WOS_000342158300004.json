Our main result is a complete characterization of terminal weights for which -CEDP is tractable and admits a combinatorial min-max theorem. We prove that if is a tree metric, then -CEDP is solvable in polynomial time and has a combinatorial min-max formula, which extends Mader's edge-disjoint -paths theorem and its minimum-cost generalization by Karzanov. Our min-max theorem includes the dual half-integrality, which was earlier conjectured by Karzanov for a special case. We also prove that -EDP, which is -CEDP with , is NP-hard if is not a truncated tree metric, where a truncated tree metric is a weight function represented as pairwise distances between balls in a tree. On the other hand, -CEDP for a truncated tree metric reduces to -CEDP for a tree metric . Thus our result is best possible unless P = NP. As an application, we obtain a good approximation algorithm for -EDP with \"near\" tree metric by utilizing results from the theory of low-distortion embedding.", "paper_title": "Tree metrics and edge-disjoint S-paths", "paper_id": "WOS:000342158300004"}
