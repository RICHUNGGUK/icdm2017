Among various solid-fluid interaction schemes being proposed for LBM in recent decades, two simple fluid-solid interaction methods-the momentum exchange algorithm (MEA) and the immersed boundary scheme (IBS)-were developed based on the above concept. In this paper, MEA and IBS are implemented in a D2Q9 LBGK system and applied to measure the wall correction factors of drag force upon a stationary circular particle midway in the Poiseuille channel flow at very low Reynolds number and drag coefficients at low to moderate Reynolds numbers. MEA and IBS are also employed to compare the fluid-induced torque over the cylinder in the Taylor-Couette flow, and the steady velocity of a particle settling under the influence of gravity inside a tube. The above experiments show that IBS seems to be more accurate and less demanding on lattice resolution.
