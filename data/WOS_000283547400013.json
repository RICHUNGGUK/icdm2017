Should global quadratic stability fail for a given nonlinear model, the proposed approach allows the obtaining of progressively better estimations of the stability domain via local asymptotic conditions in the form of linear-matrix inequalities (LMIs), which are efficiently solved by convex optimization techniques. Illustrative examples are presented to emphasize the broadening capabilities of the new stability analysis.", "paper_title": "Generalized Nonquadratic Stability of Continuous-Time Takagi-Sugeno Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000283547400013"}
