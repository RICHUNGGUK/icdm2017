In this article, we first make comparison between OFDM-based passive optical network (PON) and traditional PONs, and then review some previous work of OFDM PON. After that we introduce our physical layer scheme. In addition, network architecture, medium access control (MAC) protocol, and three dynamic bandwidth allocation schedules that optimized for OFDM communication are recommended. At last, computer simulation results are given to demonstrate the performance of the three schedules.", "paper_title": "A novel design of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based passive optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000303463700006"}
