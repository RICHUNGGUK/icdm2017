The robust domain of attraction (RDA) is estimated using the parameter-dependent quadratic Lyapunov function and enlarged by the optimal controlling parameters. The problem of extending the RDA is indicated in a form of three-layer optimization problem. Some examples illustrate the efficiency of the proposed strategy in enlarging RDA.", "paper_title": "Enlarging the guaranteed region of attraction in nonlinear systems with bounded parametric uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000316087700006"}
