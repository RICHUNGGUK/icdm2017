It is reasoned that codes are important for leakage squeezing. But it is necessary to have certain cryptographic properties in leakage squeezing functions as argued in this paper. In this paper we analyze certain Cellular Automata (CA) configurations towards leakage squeezing. We show that certain nonlinear CA configurations have those cryptographic properties and thus are suitable in leakage squeezing applications. We also propose a new leakage squeezing scheme that uses encryption. This encryption based leakage squeezing generates masks using some symmetric key encryption process. It is demonstrated in this paper as well that scan attack on AES can be resisted using leakage squeezing.", "paper_title": "Leakage Squeezing Using Cellular Automata and Its Application to Scan Attack", "paper_id": "WOS:000346543700005"}
