The shape feature is an extension of the D2 shape functions proposed by Osada. Our proposed shape feature is a combination of geometry and texture which is also invariant to similarity transformation. Experiments showed that, our method achieved better performance improvement especially for appearance retrieval of 3d model.", "paper_title": "Content-based 3D model retrieval for digital museum", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300167"}
