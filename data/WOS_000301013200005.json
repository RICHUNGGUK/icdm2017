The low resolution and the inadequate vertical accuracy of such global data present difficulties in differentiating features of hydraulic importance, which necessitate pre-processing of the DEMs before they are used. A vertical bias correction carried out by comparison of elevation points with a high accuracy terrain model produces a considerable improvement to the cross-sections obtained. In a situation where there are some flow/stage measurements at either end of the river reach, an optimization routine combined with a conceptual flow routing method can provide an additional tool to identify the parameters of an equivalent river section. The extracted cross-sections were used in a 1D river modeling tool HEC-RAS/GeoRAS to simulate flooding on a part of the Tisza River, Hungary. Model results are encouraging and show good potential for using the suggested method in the areas of topographic data scarcity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
