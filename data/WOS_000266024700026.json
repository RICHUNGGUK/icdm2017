A delay-dependent robust stochastic stability criterion is given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method and Ito's formula, based on this criterion, a robust state-feedback controller resulting closed-loop system robustly asymptotically stable in mean square is developed in term of linear matrix inequality (LMI). Finally, a design example illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "DELAY-DEPENDENT ROBUST STABILIZATION FOR UNCERTAIN STOCHASTIC FUZZY SYSTEM WITH TIME-VARYING DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000266024700026"}
