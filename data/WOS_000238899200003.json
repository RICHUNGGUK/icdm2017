This research operates with real data from more than 33,000 users. The most significant applications (ftp, http, p2p services,...) have been processed. Also, a model of the traffic generated is implemented, representing the usage that network subscribers make of the system. We demonstrate that this traffic is statistically self-similar, such behaviour having serious implications for the design, control and analysis of high-speed networks. The results in these processes have been validated using the real data provided by the fiber network operator Telecable Asturias, SAU. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
