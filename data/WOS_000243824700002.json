The resulting interpolation curve is the intersection of the given sphere and the composite conical surface patch. Unlike some existing methods, introduced into the method are several free parameters that can be used in subsequent interactive modification such that the resulting curve's shape hits our demand, and the resulting curve can be expressed explicitly. Experiments demonstrate the method is effective and potentially useful in pattern design on sphere, sphere trim, robot, and other industrial and research fields. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
