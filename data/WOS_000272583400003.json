Although pathwidth is the most restrictive among the studied width-parameterizations of SAT, the most time-efficient algorithms known for such SAT instances run in time 2(Omega(w(n))), even when the path-decomposition is given in the input. We wish to better understand the decision complexity of SAT instances of width omega(log n). We provide an exact correspondence between SAT(pw)[w(n)], the problem of SAT instances with given path decomposition of width w(n), and NL[r(n)], the class of problems decided by logspace Turing Machines with at most r(n) passes over the nondeterministic tape. In particular, we show that SAT(pw)[w(n)] is hard for NL[w(n)/log n] under log-space reductions. When NL[w(n)/log n] is closed under logspace reductions, which is the case for the most interesting w(n)'s, we show that SAT(pw)[w(n)] is also complete. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
