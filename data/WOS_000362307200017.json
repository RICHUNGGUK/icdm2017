We propose here to study this problem from the point of view of multivariate analysis, introducing a probabilistic framework with the use of copulas. This approach enables the expression of level lines in the objective space, giving an estimation of the position of the Pareto front when the level tends to zero. In particular, when it is possible to use Archimedean copulas, analytical expressions for Pareto front estimators are available. Several case studies illustrate the interest of the approach, which can be used at the beginning of the optimization when sampling randomly in the design space. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
