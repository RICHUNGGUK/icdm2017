The ST-based SRAM bitcells address the fundamental conflicting design requirement of the read versus write operation of a conventional 6T bitcell. The ST operation gives better read-stability as well as better write-ability compared to the standard 6T bitcell. The proposed ST bitcells incorporate a built-in feedback mechanism, achieving process variation tolerance a must for future nano-scaled technology nodes. A detailed comparison of different bitcells under iso-area condition shows that the ST-2 bitcell can operate at lower supply voltages. Measurement results on ten test-chips fabricated in 130-nm CMOS technology show that the proposed ST-2 bitcell gives 1.6 x higher read static noise margin, 2 x higher write-trip-point and 120-mV lower read-V-min compared to the iso-area 6T bitcell.", "paper_title": "Ultralow-Voltage Process-Variation-Tolerant Schmitt-Trigger-Based SRAM Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000299718000011"}
