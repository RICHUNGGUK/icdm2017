Bio Simulators is a framework for easy online deployment of simulators, providing a uniform web-based user interface to a diverse pool of tools. The framework is demonstrated through two plugins based on the KaSim Kappa simulator, one running directly in the browser and another running in the cloud.", "paper_title": "Bio Simulators: a web UI for biological simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000336530000028"}
