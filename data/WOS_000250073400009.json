The method starts with the mass balance for the fluid phase in its lagrangian form and the corresponding equation for the solid phase; these equations are then used to specify the governing interaction rules of discrete elements, dubbed agents. In the calculation code, ALEAP, the calculation is carried out as a series of cycles in which the agents, representing the adsorption process, interact according to these rules. In this paper we present the results obtained for linear isotherms from no transfer to high transfer rate. The method is surprisingly efficient for finding the right solution for the problem of dispersion with no adsorption and superior, in terms of computer processing time, to other methods for the simulation of the adsorption process with linear or non-linear isotherms.
