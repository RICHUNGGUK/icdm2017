To avoid this fact, several variants of the classical bootstrap have been proposed. In this paper, we consider two of them: the sequential or Poisson bootstrap and the reduced bootstrap. Both of these, like the ordinary bootstrap, can yield second-order accurate distribution estimators, that is, the three bootstrap procedures are asymptotically equivalent. The question that naturally arises is which of them should be used in a practical situation, in other words, which of them should be used for finite sample sizes. To try to answer this question, we have carried out a simulation study. Although no method was found to exhibit best performance in all the considered situations, some recommendations are given.", "paper_title": "A Monte Carlo comparison of three consistent bootstrap procedures", "paper_id": "WOS:000264335700001"}
