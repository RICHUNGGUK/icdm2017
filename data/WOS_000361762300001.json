This study examined why SNS users share information, knowledge, and personal experiences with others on SNSs. Through an online survey, 10 motivation factors were tested with Facebook and Twitter users. The findings indicate that the motivations of SNS users in sharing information could be attributed to various aspects such as demographic characteristics, experiences of SNSs and Internet usage, as well as the characteristics and features of SNSs. SNS users could be highly motivated by the learning and social engagement aspects of SNS services. It is also found that the motivations could vary depending on the characteristics of services. The results of this study could be helpful for researchers in understanding the underlying reasons for social activities as well as for SNS developers in improving SNS services.", "paper_title": "Why do social network site users share information on Facebook and Twitter?", "paper_id": "WOS:000361762300001"}
