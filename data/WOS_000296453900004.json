Two social networks are constructed and compared: a network of coauthorship, representing how researchers write articles with one another, and a network of acquaintanceship, representing how those researchers know each other on a personal level, based on their responses to an online survey. Statistical analyses of the topology and community structure of these networks point to the importance of small-scale, local, personal networks predicated upon acquaintanceship for accomplishing collaborative work in scientific communities.", "paper_title": "The Relationship Between Acquaintanceship and Coauthorship in Scientific Collaboration Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000296453900004"}
