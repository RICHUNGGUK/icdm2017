The product data needs of different stakeholder groups vary significantly among companies. This study aims to find tangible ways to address these different stakeholder needs. This article analyses three high tech companies through interviews and studying their product data documentations. The article presents a tangible way of building separate views for different stakeholder groups for utilising product data. In addition, content examples for these views are presented. This study presents examples on stakeholder specific view contents, including structural illustrations for product structures, and division of product data into business oriented product master data, and other general data required for more operational purposes. Opposed to traditional approach of highlighting the technical aspects of product data, this study shows that companies can potentially benefit of a more business oriented approach in analysing and managing product data.", "paper_title": "DEFINING PRODUCT DATA VIEWS FOR DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000300202700007"}
