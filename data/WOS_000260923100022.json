These watermarking tasks are not mutually exclusive. Moreover, any multimedia document may have been subjected to multiple watermarking, applications or several repetitions of a single goal. For the developments of digital watermarking techniques, robustness enhancement, public verfication and multiple-watermarking applications are three major focuses. In this paper, a watermarking model for multiple-watermarking applications, based on visual secret sharing, is proposed. The feature of the proposed model is to involve the concept of visual secret sharing into multiple watermarking. Furthermore, an implementation instance, aiming at enhancing the robustness of watermarks, is shown for which a series of experiments over both DWT- and DFT-domain were conducted. The proposed scheme has the following advantages: First of all, the proposed scheme is resistant to both common image processing and geometric distortion without losing commercial value of the protected contents. Second, the protection of both the owner's copyright and the customer's ownership is considered. Finally, visual secret sharing is introduced to make user-right-proving publicly verifiable.", "paper_title": "MULTIPLE WATERMARKING BASED ON VISUAL SECRET SHARING", "paper_id": "WOS:000260923100022"}
