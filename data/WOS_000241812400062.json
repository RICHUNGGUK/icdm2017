The core of the proposed framework is a learning object context ontology that leverages a range of other kinds of learning ontologies (e.g. domain, user modeling, learning design etc.) to capture the context-specific metadata. On top of that framework, we develop the architecture of an adaptive educational system, in order to illustrate the benefits of our proposal for personalization of learning design. Finally, we reflect how two present educational tools (iHelp Courses and TANGRAM) correspond to the proposed architecture.", "paper_title": "Ontologies to support learning design context", "paper_id": "WOS:000241812400062"}
