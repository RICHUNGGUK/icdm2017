A wide spectrum of applications like mail delivery, waste collection or street maintenance outlines the relevance of this problem. A realistic variant of the CARP arises from the need of intermediate facilities (IFs) to load up or unload the service vehicle and from tour length restrictions. The proposed Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) is a simple and robust solution technique which tackles the basic problem as well as its extensions. The VNS shows excellent results on four different benchmark sets. Particularly, for all 120 instances the best known solution could be found and in 71 cases a new best solution was achieved.", "paper_title": "A variable neighborhood search for the capacitated arc routing problem with intermediate facilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000259142300002"}
