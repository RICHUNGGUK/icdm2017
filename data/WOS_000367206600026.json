In this article, we dedicate ourselves to event-based scheduling. We first formally define an event-based scheduling policy and propose the notion of the correctness of a scheduling policy in terms of weak termination. Then we investigate the correctness of the decomposition of scheduling controls and finally obtain a decentralized scheduling method. The method can automatically decompose the scheduling policies of a concurrent reactive system into atomic scheduling policies. Every atomic scheduling policy corresponds to one subsystem. Each of the subsystems is a completely independent system, which may be developed and deployed independently. An experiment demonstrates these results that may help engineers to design correct and efficient schedule policies for a concurrent reactive system.", "paper_title": "Analyzing Event-Based Scheduling in Concurrent Reactive Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000367206600026"}
