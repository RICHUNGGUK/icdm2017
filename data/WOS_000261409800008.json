A bank of Kalman filters is used to detect and isolate sensor fault, each of Kalman filter is designed based on a specific hypothesis for detecting a specific sensor fault. lit the event that a fault does occur, all filters except the one using the correct hypothesis will produce large estimation errors, from which a specific fault is isolated. When the Kalman filter is used, failures in the sensors and actuators affect the characteristics of the residual signals of the Kalman filter, While a Robust Kalman filter is used, the decision statistics changes regardless the faults in the sensors or in the actuators, because it is sensitive to sensor fault and insensitive to actuator fault. The proposed FDI approach above, which was previously discussed in literature to distinguish the sensor and actuator fault as an effective approach, is applied to a nonlinear engine simulation in this paper, and the evaluation results show that this approach to detect and isolate sensor and actuator faults is demonstrated.", "paper_title": "APPLICATION OF A BANK OF KALMAN FILTERS AND A ROBUST KALMAN FILTER FOR AIRCRAFT ENGINE SENSOR/ACTUATOR FAULT DIAGNOSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261409800008"}
