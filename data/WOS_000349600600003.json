Various optimized schemes can be obtained. The new scheme shows negligible dissipation. It is illustrated mathematically and numerically that the new scheme preserves fourth-order accuracy, while the recently developed diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta scheme does not. The numerical applications contain the advection equation with and without a stiff nonlinear source term and an oscillatory test. The new scheme is A-stable as desired for the solution of stiff problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
