This study, contrary to some gloomy opinions, suggests that interesting conclusions can be drawn from the above indicators. The utilization of the chosen indicators, tested world-wide in real situations, appears capable to effectively and objectively assess institutions and individual university professors and researchers proving to be quite significant and should be used to provide computer-assisted evaluation criteria for either maintaining or upgrading the given position, maintaining or closing public Institutions, and filtering grant applications.", "paper_title": "Objective assessment of scientific performances world-wide", "paper_id": "WOS:000259374300007"}
