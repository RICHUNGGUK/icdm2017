One of the common problems is the determination of parameters, which are a part of the model description. In the present work, we propose a customized genetic algorithm as a method to determine the parameters such that the underlying oscillatory system exhibits the target behavior. We propose a problem specific, adaptive fitness function evaluation and a method to quantify the effect of a single parameter on the system response. The properties of the algorithm are highlighted and confirmed on two test cases of synthetic biological oscillators.", "paper_title": "An adaptive genetic algorithm for parameter estimation of biological oscillator models to achieve target quantitative system response", "paper_id": "WOS:000331659500008"}
