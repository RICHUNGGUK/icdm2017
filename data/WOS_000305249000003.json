In this paper, based on hardware features and software architecture of the embedded Wi-Fi devices, we focus on dynamic power management, dynamic frequency scaling, and their influences upon the system power and performance. We propose effective and realizable system power management solution and application modes under various application requirements, such as response, bandwidth, and speed. Experimental results show that the proposed solutions can achieve significant energy savings.", "paper_title": "INTELLIGENT POWER MANAGEMENT FOR EMBEDDED WI-FI DEVICES", "paper_id": "WOS:000305249000003"}
