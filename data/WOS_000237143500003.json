The airfoil is placed in air at 10 m/s in the straight section of a duct of 0.457 m x 0.457 m cross-section followed by a 90 degrees bend with a mean radius-to-height ratio of 1.17. The trailing edge is located at one chord length upstream of the bend entry plane. The authors' own measurements are used to define the boundary conditions and for comparison with the predicted results. The numerical models are based on the time-averaged, three-dimensional conservation equations of fluid flow, incorporating the k-epsilon, RNG k-epsilon, realizable k-epsilon and the Reynolds stress turbulence models. The results show that the models are capable of predicting the effects of curvature on the wake development. However, quantitative differences between prediction and experiment exist. The results obtained using the Reynolds stress model show better agreement with the experimental data, compared with the k-epsilon based models, but not consistently for all parameters. There are also better predictions by the RNG k-epsilon and realizable k-epsilon models compared with the standard k-epsilon model. The predicted results using the RNG k-epsilon are closer to experimental data than the realizable k-epsilon.
