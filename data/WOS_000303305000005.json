The calculation of surface tension force is based on the interface reconstruction. The boundary particles for each fluid are detected dynamically. The position of the interface particles are specified in the middle of the boundary particles of each fluid. According to the positions of the interface particles, the interface can be reconstructed. The normal vector and curvature of the interface can be obtained. Then the surface tension force is calculated according to the reconstructed interface. Finally the surface tension force is transferred to the SPH particles near the interface. The accuracy and efficiency of the developed method are investigated. Drop deformation in shear flow, oscillation of square drop, head-on binary collision, and off-center binary collision are simulated. The developed method can be applied to the simulation of surface-tension-driven interfacial flow with high density ratio of up to 797.88 and high viscosity ratio of up to 55.56.
