SHR/Izm and age-matched WKY/Izm were used. Limb lead II electrocardiograms were recorded. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was applied for the time-frequency analysis. The integrated time-frequency power (ITFP) between QRS complexes was measured and compared between groups. The ITFP at low-frequency bands (<= 125 Hz) was significantly higher in SHR/Izm. The percent change of ITFP showed the different patterns between groups. Prominent interstitial fibrosis with an increase in TIMP-1 mRNA expression was also observed in SHR/Izm. These results were partly reproduced in a computer simulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
