Approaches including weighted genetic programming (WGP) and soft computing polynomials (SCP) are utilized to provide accurate prediction and visible formulas/polynomials for the ultimate bearing capacity. Visible formulas facilitate parameter studies, sensitivity analysis, and applications of pruning techniques. Analytical results demonstrate that the proposed SCP is outstanding in both prediction accuracy and provides simple polynomials as well. Notably, the SCP identifies that the shearing resistance angle and foundation geometry impact on improving the Vesic's semi-empirical equations. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
