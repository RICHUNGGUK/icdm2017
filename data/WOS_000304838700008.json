We show how to construct G(1) Bezier surfaces over a boundary curve network with T-junctions. By treating the two micro patches which meet at the edge forming the upright of the T as a single macro patch, we reduce the problem to one of achieving continuity between this composite patch and the third patch which has the crossbar of the T as an edge. Thus we avoid changes to the boundary network, or to any patches except those that meet at the T-junction. Also, we analyze the singularity of the G(1) continuity system with the T-junction, and give the constraint to make a consistent system using free variables of weight functions. This is the first method of surfacing the T-junction. We present examples and verify continuity by drawing reflection lines and checking angles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
