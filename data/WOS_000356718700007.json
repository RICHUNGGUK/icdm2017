Thus, reducing data transfers across the memory hierarchy of a processor (i.e., off-chip memory, on-chip caches, and register file) can greatly improve the energy efficiency. To this end, we propose an architecture, DRAMA, that 3D-stacks coarse-grain reconfigurable accelerators (CGRAs) atop off-chip DRAM devices. DRAMA does not require changes to the DRAM device architecture, apart from through-silicon vias (TSVs) that connect the DRAM device's internal I/O bus to the CGRA layer. We demonstrate that DRAMA can reduce the energy consumption to transfer data across the memory hierarchy by 66-95 percent while achieving speedups of up to 18 x over a commodity processor.", "paper_title": "DRAMA: An Architecture for Accelerated Processing Near Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000356718700007"}
