Human beings are social animals. They tend to form groups and communities, and have repetitive mobility pattern which can be used to disseminate information in PSNs. In this paper, we give a deeper insight to the nature of community formation and how such information can be used to help opportunistic forwarding in mobile opportunistic networks. Using real world mobility traces, we first derive the adjacency list for each node and form the contact graph. Using tools from social network analysis we then determine various node properties like centrality and clustering coefficient and graph properties like average path length and modularity. Based on the derived graph properties, node encounter process and nature of message dissemination in PSNs, we propose two social based routing, known as the contact based routing and community aware two-hop routing. We compare the proposed routing techniques with generic epidemic and prophet routing and Bubble-Rap, a social based routing. Results show that the proposed algorithms is able to achieve better delivery ratio and lower delay than Bubble Rap, while reducing the high overhead ratio of epidemic and prophet routing.", "paper_title": "Analysing social behaviour and message dissemination in human based delay tolerant network", "paper_id": "WOS:000348448900013"}
