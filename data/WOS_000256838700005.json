However, due to its round robin structure, its latency properties are not adequate for latency-critical applications, such as voice. For this reason, router manufacturers implement variants of the DRR algorithm which guarantee lower latencies to one (or a subset of) queue(s). In this paper we evaluate the performance of two such variants, both of which are known as Modified Deficit Round Robin, currently implemented in commercial routers. The comparison is carried out analytically, by deriving the latency and bandwidth guarantees of both algorithms, and by simulation.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of Modified Deficit Round Robin schedulers", "paper_id": "WOS:000256838700005"}
