The application of the proposed GDecap technique on an eight-way clock-gated clustered pipeline showed that on average, 41.7% Decap leakage power was reduced, with negligible (similar to 0.037%) worst-case performance degradation, at the 70-nm technology node. GDecap design incurred an area overhead of around 5.36% when compared with a conventional Decap design.", "paper_title": "Gated Decap: Gate Leakage Control of On-Chip Decoupling Capacitors in Scaled Technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000271958900009"}
