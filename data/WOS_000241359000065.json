In the ImageCLEF2005 ad-hoc task, we investigated the use of learned word association models that represent how pairs of words are related to absorb such mismatches. We compared a precision-oriented simple word-matching retrieval model and a recall-oriented word association retrieval model. We also investigated combinations of these by introducing a new ranking function that generated comparable output values from both models. Experimental results on English and German topics were discouraging, as the use of word association models degraded the performance. On the other hand, word association models helped retrieval for Japanese topics whose translation quality was low.", "paper_title": "Easing erroneous translations in cross-language image retrieval using word associations", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000065"}
