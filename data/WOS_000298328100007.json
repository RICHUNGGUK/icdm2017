Researchers with varying levels of informatics experience are developing technology-delivered measures because of the numerous advantages they offer. Hasty development of technology-delivered measures can present issues that negatively influence administration and psychometric properties. The Method for Technology-delivered Healthcare Measures is designed to systematically guide the development and evaluation of technology-delivered measures. The five-step Method for Technology-delivered Healthcare Measures includes establishment of content, e-Health literacy, technology delivery, expert usability, and participant usability. Background information and Method for Technology-delivered Healthcare Measures steps are detailed.", "paper_title": "Method for Technology-Delivered Healthcare Measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000298328100007"}
