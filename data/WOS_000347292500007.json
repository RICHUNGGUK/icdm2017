It incorporates typical teen behaviors and attitudes about health and wellness while promoting independence, empowerment, and self-care. Our multi-disciplinary team of designers, medical providers, and engineers employed a user-centered design approach to create a PHR prototype based on teen-specific needs, behaviors, and personal experiences. We advocate a human-centered design approach, especially in the collection of data that adolescents find important and insightful, such as peer interactions, short- and long-term aspirations, and goals. These data can be leveraged to be a part of a successful clinical encounter and promote better self-awareness and chronic disease management. Our collaboration that resulted in a semi-working prototype populated by data important both to teen and medical provider became a launch point for more meaningful patient-healthcare provider exchanges.", "paper_title": "Living Profiles: an example of user-centered design in developing a teen-oriented personal health record", "paper_id": "WOS:000347292500007"}
