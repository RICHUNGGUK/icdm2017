Our framework aids the content creator in designing tours where one sees interesting objects for the most part of the tour. Further, the speed of the tour is controlled by what is shown. In particular we consider the designing of walkthroughs of scenes constructed by image-based techniques where such a design framework helps to optimize on the effort needed to create the content.
