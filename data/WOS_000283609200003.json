To obtain a high output power with a good linearity, a new topology called Stacked Folded Differential Structure (SFDS) is proposed. It allows obtaining similar power performances to a PA with DAT in a lower the area. This PA provides 23 dBm of maximum output power (P(max)) with 20% of power added efficiency (PAE) at 1.95 GHz. The linear gain is equal to 11 dB and the output power at 1 dB compression point (OCP(1)) achieves 21 dBm. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
