In this paper, we present a novel, adaptable and real-time projection mapping system, which supports multiple projectors and high quality rendering of dynamic content on surfaces of complex geometrical shape. Our system allows for smooth blending across multiple projectors using a new optimization framework that simulates the diffuse direct light transport of the physical world to continuously adapt the color output of each projector pixel. We present a real-time solution to this optimization problem using off-the-shelf graphics hardware, depth cameras and projectors. Our approach enables us to move projectors, depth camera or objects while maintaining the correct illumination, in real-time, without the need for markers on the object. It also allows for projectors to be removed or dynamically added, and provides compelling results with only commodity hardware.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Pixel Luminance Optimization for Dynamic Multi-Projection Mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000363671200073"}
