It is based on the opinion of different groups of reviewers who socialize with evaluated employees. Multiple criteria are considered in performance appraisal that may have different nature and usually present uncertainty. Therefore, it seems necessary and appropriate to provide a heterogeneous framework adapted to the nature of such criteria. In this context, criteria can be assessed by reviewers, according to their background and degree of knowledge about evaluated employees. Furthermore, Human Resources Department demands the modeling and managing of the interaction among the evaluated criteria, as well as reviewers relevances to ensure an effective aggregation process of the information, providing interpretable, understandable and correct assessments. In this paper, we present an integrated model for 360-degree performance appraisal that can manage heterogeneous information and computes a final linguistic evaluation for each employee, applying an effective aggregation that considers the interaction among criteria and reviewers relevance by means of weights. We also present a real case study to show the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
