Based on a modified disjunctive graph, we further investigate and generalize structural properties for the problem under study. A tabu search algorithm with a sophisticated neighbourhood structure is then developed. Compared to most studies in this research area, we are interested in moving internal critical operations rather than merely focusing on non-internal ones. Moreover, neighbourhood functions are defined using insertion techniques instead of simple swaps. Test results show that our algorithm outperforms a simulated annealing algorithm which is recently published. We have also conducted experiments considering the efficiency of developed propositions.
