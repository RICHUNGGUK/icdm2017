It has three variants, 3-, 4-, and 5-pass HAVAL. Previous results on HAVAL suggested only practical collision attacks for 3-pass HAVAL. In this paper, we present collision attacks for 4 and 5 pass HAVAL. For 4-pass HAVAL, we describe two practical attacks for finding 2-block collisions, one with 2(43) computations and the other with 2(36) computations. In addition, we show that collisions for 5-pass HAVAL can be found with about 2(123) computations, which is the first attack more efficient than the birthday attack.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis of the full HAVAL with 4 and 5 passes", "paper_id": "WOS:000239471600007"}
