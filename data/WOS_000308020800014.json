The TP models are obtained by a transformation of the linear parameter-varying models derived from the first principle nonlinear mathematical models of the controlled processes. Experimental results validate the performance of the proposed TP models.", "paper_title": "Novel Tensor Product Models for Automatic Transmission System Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000308020800014"}
