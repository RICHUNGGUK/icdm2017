First we introduce (U-S, N)-operation by replacing the uninorm U with a semi-uninorm US in the definition of a (U, N)operation. Then the necessary and sufficient conditions that a (U-S, N)-operation is a implication are given out. Furthermore, we characterize the (U-S, N)-implications. Last we generalize the definition of rotation invariant and investigate the intersection between the residual implications and (U-S, N)-implications derived from some semi-uninorms with the generalized rotation invariant.", "paper_title": "Generalization of (U, N)-Implications", "paper_id": "WOS:000355928500003"}
