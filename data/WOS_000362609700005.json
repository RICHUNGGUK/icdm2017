Inspired from challenges faced during the interpretation of low-strain integrity tests on pipe piles, the proposed method moves beyond the widely used one-dimensional wave theory to consider the asymmetric nature of the problem, and stress wave propagation along both the vertical and circumferential directions. Coupling of pipe pile-viscoelastic soil vibration is considered via modeling the outer and inner soil as a series of infinitesimally thin layers in perfect contact with the pile, and their low-strain properties are directly introduced in the solution. The methodology is validated against numerical results, before discussing the mechanisms governing the dynamic response of the pipe pile-soil system to the impact load, with emphasis on the vertical velocity measured at a hypothetical receiver placed on the pile head. Additional results from a parametric analysis are used to provide insights on the accurate estimation of the arrival time of the receiving wave, and the optimal location of the receiver.
