The objective of this work is to design and validate a system that, given some constraints on traffic bandwidth, generates the worst-case traffic for a given computer network and finds the traffic configuration (critical background traffic) that minimises throughput in that computer network. The proposed system is based on a meta-GA, which is combined with an adaptation strategy that finds the optimum values for the GA control parameters and adjusts them to improve the GA's performance. To validate the approach, different comparisons are performed with the goal of assessing the acceptable optimisation power of the proposed system. Moreover, a statistical analysis was conducted to ascertain whether differences between the proposed system and other algorithms are significant. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system and prove that, when the background traffic is driven by a GA that uses the parameters obtained from the system, the computer network's performance is much lower than when the traffic is generated by Poisson statistical processes or by other algorithms. This system has identified the worst traffic pattern for the protocol under analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
