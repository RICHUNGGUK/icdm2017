Enjoying the low cost of RFID tags, modern RFID systems tend to be deployed for large-scale mobile objects. Both the theoretical and experimental results suggest that when tags are in large numbers, most existing collision arbitration protocols do not satisfy the scalability and time-efficiency requirements of many applications. To address this problem, we propose Adaptively Splitting-based Arbitration Protocol (ASAP), a scheme that provides efficient RFID identification for both small and large deployment of RFID tags, in terms of time and energy cost. Theoretical analysis and simulation evaluation show that the performance of ASAP is better than most existing collision-arbitration solutions and the time efficiency is close to the theoretically optimal values.", "paper_title": "ASAP: Scalable Collision Arbitration for Large RFID Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000319678800002"}
