The SAOG structure was formed by two key steps, i.e. an isotropic photoresist trimming and an additional gate fringe etching. The fabricated SAOG devices with this proposed method exhibit a significantly suppressed off-current increase with gate bias compared with the non-offset ones, and have identical bi-directional transfer characteristics under reversed source/drain biases. It is also shown that the performances of poly-Si TFTs with metal-induced lateral crystallization can be improved significantly by annealing in forming gas.", "paper_title": "Self-aligned offset gate poly-Si TFTs using photoresist trimming technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000353817800007"}
