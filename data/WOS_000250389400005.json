We show that their notion of quiescence as a necessary and sufficient condition for safe runtime changes is too strict and results in a significant disruption in the application being updated. In this paper, we introduce a weaker condition: tranquillity. We show that tranquillity is easier to obtain and less disruptive for the running application but still a sufficient condition to ensure application consistency. We present an implementation of our approach on a component middleware platform and experimentally verify the validity and practical applicability of our approach using data retrieved from a case study.", "paper_title": "Tranquillity: A low disruptive alternative to quiescence for ensuring safe dynamic updates", "paper_id": "WOS:000250389400005"}
