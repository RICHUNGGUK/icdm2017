However, OSNs do not exploit all different length paths of the network. Instead, they consider only pathways of maximum length 2 between a user and his candidate friends. On the other hand, there are global-based approaches, which detect the overall path structure in a network, being computationally prohibitive for huge-sized social networks. In this paper we provide friend recommendations, also known as the link prediction problem, by traversing all paths of a limited length, based on the \"algorithmic small world hypothesis\". As a result, we are able to provide more accurate and faster friend recommendations. We also derive variants of our method that apply to different types of networks (directed/undirected and signed/unsigned). We perform an extensive experimental comparison of the proposed method against existing link prediction algorithms, using synthetic and three real data sets (Epinions, Facebook and Hi5). We also show that a significant accuracy improvement can be gained by using information about both positive and negative edges. Finally, we discuss extensively various experimental considerations, such as a possible MapReduce implementation of FriendLink algorithm to achieve scalability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
