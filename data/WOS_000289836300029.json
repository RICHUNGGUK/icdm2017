In this paper, the capacity region of a class of multiway relay channels is derived, where the channel inputs and outputs take values over finite fields. The cut-set upper bound to the capacity region is derived and is shown to be achievable by our proposed functional-decode-forward coding strategy. More specifically, for the general case where the users can transmit at possibly different rates, functional-decode-forward, combined with rate splitting and joint source-channel decoding, is proved to achieve the capacity region; while for the case where all users transmit at a common rate, rate splitting and joint source-channel decoding are not required to achieve the capacity. That the capacity-achieving coding strategies do not utilize the users' received signals in the users' encoding functions implies that feedback does not increase the capacity region of this class of multiway relay channels.", "paper_title": "The Capacity Region of Multiway Relay Channels Over Finite Fields With Full Data Exchange", "paper_id": "WOS:000289836300029"}
