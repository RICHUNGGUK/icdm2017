To bridge the gap, this research takes previous popular visiting behaviours as the suggestion foundation and develops a sequential pattern based route suggestion system to generate personalized tours. First, to increase suggestion feasibility, exhibits are grouped into a set, of exhibit sections. Based on the exhibit sections, time-interval sequential patterns are determined from a museum historical route database using the I-Prefix,Span algorithm If the time-interval sequential patterns meet visitors, intended visiting tune and must-see exhibits, they are regarded as candidate,routes and ranked according to their expected crowd degree, time variance degree and incompleteness degree The candidate routes with higher rankings are suggested to visitors' mobile devices. It as believed that the proposed system will increase museum visitor satisfaction", "paper_title": "A SEQUENTIAL PATTERN BASED ROUTE SUGGESTION SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000282919400010"}
