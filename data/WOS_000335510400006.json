A new set of test problems accounting for the different types of robustness cases is presented in this study. Non-dominated solutions are classified according to their degree of robustness and are distributed along the Pareto front according to specific algorithm parameter values. Verification of the proposed method is carried out using the developed test problems and artificial and real world benchmark test problems present in the literature.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary robustness analysis for multi-objective optimization: benchmark problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000335510400006"}
