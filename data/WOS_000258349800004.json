It involves embedding important data into a cover image in digital form with minimal perceptible degradation. In this paper, we first propose an improved data hiding method for side-match vector quantization (SMVQ) compressed images, which utilizes the codeword-pairing procedure to modulate the index code of each image block. In order to take it a step further and obtain a larger embedding capacity, we remodel the first proposed method into a new one with the power of variable-rate data embedding through the use of a multiple-base notational system. According to the experimental results, the two proposed methods are indeed capable of providing a larger embedding capacity without causing noticeable distortions of stego-images in comparison with previous methods. Moreover, our methods also maintain a low compression bit-rate without auxiliary data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
