In the discrete system, both the covertext and the attack channel are memoryless and have finite alphabets. In the Gaussian system, the covertext is memoryless Gaussian and the attack channel has additive memoryless Gaussian noise. In both cases, our bounds on the error exponent are positive in the interior of the achievable quantization and watermarking rate region.", "paper_title": "Random-Coding Lower Bounds for the Error Exponent of Joint Quantization and Watermarking Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000267222000023"}
