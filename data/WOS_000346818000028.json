In both type of crowdsourcing models (for simple and complex tasks), voting is a technique that is widely used for quality control [9]. For example, 5 workers are asked to write 5 outlines for an article, and another 5 workers are asked to vote for the best outline among the 5 outlines. However, we argue that voting is actually a technique that selects a high quality answer from a set of answers. It does not directly enhance answer quality. In this paper, we propose a new quality control approach for crowdsourcing that can incrementally improve answer quality. The new approach is based upon two principles - evolutionary computing and slow intelligence, which help the crowdsourcing system to propagate knowledge among workers and incrementally improve the answer quality. We perform explicitly 2 experimental case studies to show the effectiveness of the new approach. The case study results show that the new approach can incrementally improve answer quality and produce high quality answers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
