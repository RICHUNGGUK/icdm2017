By encapsulating diverse implementations of physical and software resources in the interface that standardizes the functions, loosely coupled services have show great potential to support a versatile integration platform for complex applications. Existing techniques can successfully support integrating services from different providers to provide applications with more complex user requirements. However, to automatically composite services with guaranteed QoS is not trivial. In this paper, the authors propose Q-SAC, a QoS optimized service automatic composition model. Two main features of Q-SAC include automatic service composition, and multidimensional QoS optimization for the composition plan. The authors show that the problem of Q-SAC QoS optimization is NP-hard, and design a heuristic simulated annealing algorithm. Through simulation the authors show that this design is practical and efficient.", "paper_title": "Efficiently Compositing and Optimizing the Quality of Heterogeneous Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000353297000004"}
