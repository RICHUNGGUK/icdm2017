We propose two types of quantisers. For the first quantiser, quantised input and quantised state are considered. For the second quantiser, quantised control input is only investigated. A designed state feedback controller guarantees that the resulting closed-loop system is convergent to a small neighbourhood around the origin for every initial condition emanating from the large admissible domain. Sufficient conditions for feasibility are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Quantised feedback control for bilinear systems with actuator saturation", "paper_id": "WOS:000347548400004"}
