The proposed architecture mitigates major shortcomings with existing architectures through wider memory bandwidth, reconfigurable controller, and flexible word-length support. VLSI implementation of FleXilicon indicates that the proposed pipeline architecture can achieve a high speed operation up to 1 GHz using 65-nm SOI CMOS process with moderate silicon area. To estimate the performance of FleXilicon, we modeled the processor in SystemC and implemented five different types of applications commonly used in wireless communications and multimedia applications and compared its performance with an ARM processor and a TI digital signal processor. The simulation results indicate that FleXilicon reduces the number of clock cycles and increases the speed for all five applications. The reduction and speedup ratios are as large as two orders of magnitude for some applications.", "paper_title": "FleXilicon Architecture and Its VLSI Implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000268282700005"}
