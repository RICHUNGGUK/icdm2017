We show that a point is a vertex if, and only if, a directed hypergraph, constructed from the subdifferentials of the active constraints at this point, admits a unique strongly connected component that is maximal with respect to the reachability relation (all the other strongly connected components have access to it). This property can be checked in almost linear-time. This allows us to develop a tropical analogue of the classical double description method, which computes a minimal internal representation (in terms of vertices) of a polyhedron defined externally (by half-spaces or hyperplanes). We provide theoretical worst case complexity bounds and report extensive experimental tests performed using the library TPLib, showing that this method outperforms the other existing approaches.", "paper_title": "Computing the Vertices of Tropical Polyhedra Using Directed Hypergraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000314700500007"}
