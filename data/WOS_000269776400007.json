In feature extraction, the histogram difference and its modified versions are calculated from the effectiveness of detecting cuts and reducing the impact of fleeting lights. We propose a hybrid algorithm composed of adaptive thresholding, parameter calculation, and transition duration refinement to measure model parameters. Some properties of the associated model parameters of each transition are computed as features. A feature measuring the time gap between two consecutive shots is also adopted. After feature extraction, a fuzzy classifier integrates these features to distinguish nontransitions, cuts, and dissolve-type features from one to another. Many test videos having different types of shots are used for performance evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only detects cuts, dissolves, and fades well, but also accurately locates the duration of each dissolve-type transition. In addition, the proposed scheme outperforms some existing methods in terms of cut and dissolve detection.", "paper_title": "A FEATURE-BASED SCHEME FOR DETECTING AND CLASSIFYING VIDEO-SHOT TRANSITIONS BASED ON SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS AND FUZZY CLASSIFICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000269776400007"}
