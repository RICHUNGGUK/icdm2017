It presents a wind turbine (WT) and photovoltaic (PV) solar panels as primary energy sources, and an energy storage system (ESS) based on hydrogen (fuel cell-FC-, hydrogen tank and electrolyzer) and battery. All of the energy sources use dc/dc power converters in order to connect them to a central DC bus. An ANFIS-based supervisory control system determines the power that must be generated by/stored in the hydrogen and battery, taking into account the power demanded by the grid, the available power, the hydrogen tank level and the state-of-charge (SOC) of the battery. Furthermore, an ANFIS-based control is applied to the three-phase inverter, which connects the hybrid system to grid. Otherwise, this new EMS is compared with a classical EMS composed of state-based supervisory control system based on states and inverter control system based on PI controllers. Dynamic simulations demonstrate the right performance of the ANFIS-based EMS for the hybrid system under study and the better performance with respect to the classical EMS.", "paper_title": "ANFIS-Based Control of a Grid-Connected Hybrid System Integrating Renewable Energies, Hydrogen and Batteries", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800025"}
