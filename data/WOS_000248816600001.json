A graph T is H-universal if it contains a copy of each H is an element of H as a subgraph. Let H(k, n) denote the family of graphs on it vertices with maximum degree at most k. For all positive integers k and n, we construct an H(k,n)-universal graph T with O-k (n(2-2/k) log (4/k) n) edges and exactly n vertices. The number of edges is almost as small as possible, as Omega(n(2-2/k)) is a lower bound for the number of edges in any such graph. The construction of T is explicit, whereas the proof of universality is probabilistic and is based on a novel graph decomposition result and on the properties of random walks on expanders.", "paper_title": "Sparse universal graphs for bounded-degree graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000248816600001"}
