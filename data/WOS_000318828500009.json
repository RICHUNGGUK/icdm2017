Maintenance records are vital for on-site building managers in a comparable sense when planning the operational life cycle of the buildings housing health facilities. Unlike their medical counterparts though, these records are compromised by a lack of systematization and empirical verification. With a view to redressing these shortcomings, this paper introduces a knowledge extraction method that combines semantic indexing and clustering analysis, referred to as the Building Diagnosis Navigation System (BDN System).
