As a small, economical yet reasonably efficient device, wireless sensors can conveniently serve for this purpose. In this paper(1), we investigate how to deploy wireless sensor networks in buses to gather traffic data for intelligent city traffic. The paper presents a selforganization mechanism and a routing protocol for the proposed sensor networks. Our work has three advantages: (1)adaptive network topology, which satisfies highly mobile city traffic environment, (2)directed data transmission, saving energy consumption of sensor nodes with limited power resource, and (3)longer lifetime because of fewer redundant network communication and balanced power usage of sensor nodes in a network.", "paper_title": "Combining wireless sensor network with grid for intelligent city traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000241449500020"}
