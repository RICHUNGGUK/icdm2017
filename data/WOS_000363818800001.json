Subsequently, we examine the ways in which four case study teachers utilized iPads and educational apps in their classrooms to support their students' learning experiences. Data included observations of professional development activities, classroom observations, teacher interviews, and student focus groups. Findings revealed that students used iPads and educational apps to (a) access online content, (b) create learning artifacts, and (c) reinforce content learning through personalized instruction. Findings also indicated that use of iPads and educational apps supported student academic growth and empowerment. Results have implications for mobile learning researchers, practitioners, and policy makers, particularly those charged with the design and implementation of professional development programs.
