In this protocol, an EPR pair and a quantum memory storage are made use of, and losses in the quantum communication channel and quantum memory storage are all analyzed. We obtain the bias in the fair scenario as a function of p, where p is the probability that the particle in Bob's quantum memory storage is lost, which means our bias varies as the degree of losses in the quantum memory storage changes. Therefore we call our protocol semi-loss-tolerant. We also show that the bias decreases with decreasing p. When p approaches 0, the bias approaches 0.3536, which is less than that of all the previous loss-tolerant protocols. Details of both parties' optimal cheating strategies are also given and analyzed. What's more, experimental feasibility is discussed and demonstrated.", "paper_title": "SEMI-LOSS-TOLERANT STRONG COIN FLIPPING PROTOCOL USING EPR PAIRS", "paper_id": "WOS:000304380700009"}
