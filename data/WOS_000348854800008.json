Complex-valued recurrent neural networks is an extension of real-valued recurrent neural networks that includes complex-valued states, connection weights, or activation functions. This paper explains sufficient condition for the existence and uniform stability analysis of such networks. Three numerical simulations are delineated to substantiate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Existence and Uniform Stability Analysis of Fractional-Order Complex-Valued Neural Networks With Time Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000348854800008"}
