The approach leads to a generalization of the link between sinc functions and the Lagrange interpolation in the multivariate setting. Our geometric approach also provides a frequency partition of the spectrum that leads to a nonseparable extension of the 1-D Shannon (sinc) wavelets to the multivariate setting. Moreover, we propose a generalization of the Lanczos window function that provides a practical and unbiased approach for signal reconstruction on sampling lattices. While this framework is general for lattices of any dimension, we specifically characterize all 2-D and 3-D lattices and show the detailed derivations for 2-D hexagonal body-centered cubic (BCC) and face-centered cubic (FCC) lattices. Both visual and numerical comparisons validate the theoretical expectations about superiority of the BCC and FCC lattices over the commonly used Cartesian lattice.", "paper_title": "A Geometric Construction of Multivariate Sinc Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000304159800005"}
