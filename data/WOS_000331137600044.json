These definitions do not rely on the structure of the basis lattice L and no distributivity in L is required. The notions of pre-compactness and semi-compactness in L-fuzzy topological spaces can be viewed as special cases of compactness in L-fuzzy pretopological spaces. Their properties are investigated. Further when L is completely distributive, their characterizations are presented.", "paper_title": "Measures of compactness in L-fuzzy pretopological spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000331137600044"}
