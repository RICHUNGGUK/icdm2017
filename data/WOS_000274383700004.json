The method employed well-known single variable or multivariable techniques of discrimination and regression but also presented a synopsis of analysis results in a colored map of p-values very similar to a DNA microarray. This framework provides a systematic method of drawing inferences from the available evidence without interrupting the normal process operation. The proposed concept is illustrated by two industrial examples.", "paper_title": "Fault Detection Based on Statistical Multivariate Analysis and Microarray Visualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000274383700004"}
