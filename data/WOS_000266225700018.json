The toolbox accepts a variety of input data formats, arranged in either matrices or vectors (i.e., unfolded matrices), and contained in ASCII files. It allows one to manually select working sensor regions and plot landscapes for selected samples. The development of each model and its subsequent application to unknown samples is straightforward. Prediction results are produced along with analytical figures of merit and standard concentration errors, as calculated by modern concepts of uncertainty propagation. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
