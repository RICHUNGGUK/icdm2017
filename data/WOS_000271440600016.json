The polytopic and the norm-bounded uncertainties are separately taken into consideration. An appropriate discretized Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and some free-weighting matrices are utilized to establish some delay-dependent sufficient conditions for designing delayed state-feedback control as a synchronization law in terms of linear matrix inequalities under less restrictive conditions. The controller guarantees the exponential H-infinity synchronization of the two coupled MSNNs regardless of their initial states. Detailed comparisons with existing results are made, and numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the established synchronization laws.", "paper_title": "New Delay-Dependent Exponential H-infinity Synchronization for Uncertain Neural Networks With Mixed Time Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000271440600016"}
