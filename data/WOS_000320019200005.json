A dynamic consensus protocol with non-uniform time-varying delays is adopted to deal with the practical consensus problem. Using state space decomposition, practical consensus problems of a swarm system are converted into stability problems of a disagreement subsystem. Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach and the linear matrix inequality technique, sufficient conditions for swarm systems to achieve practical consensus are proposed where the time-varying external disturbance can be in L-2 or L. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Practical consensus for high-order linear time-invariant swarm systems with interaction uncertainties, time-varying delays and external disturbances", "paper_id": "WOS:000320019200005"}
