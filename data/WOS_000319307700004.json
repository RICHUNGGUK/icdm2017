This method combines biometric feature extraction and random number generation in a novel way. Firstly, we get the non-deterministic source-iris image by iris acquisition equipment, then, we use chaotic function to eliminate the similar pattern in iris from the same person and get the unpredictable random sequence. We use auto-correlation function method and correlation coefficients method to show that ICRNG is linearly independent, then, we use BDS statistical test method to verify ICRNG is nonlinearly independent. Finally, the randomness of ICRNG is verified by histogram analysis, information analysis, sensitivity analySis, FIPS 140-2 tests and NIST SP 800-22 tests. Hence, ICRNG possess satisfactory performance and can be implemented on common PC platform. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
