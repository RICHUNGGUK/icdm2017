The two methods each have their strengths and weaknesses, especially in terms of generalizability and the lessons we can derive from them. Both also point to different problems that need to be addressed in methods for analyzing interaction such analysis being, in turn, a precondition for improving the usability of CVEs, The paper concludes with an argument for a combination of the two methods, and some reflections about the relationship between the analysis of inter-action and the usability of CVEs.", "paper_title": "The usability of collaborative virtual environments and methods for the analysis of interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000242718700005"}
