To protect the receiver's benefit, the receiver can easily convert the signature into an ordinary one that can be verified by anyone. Several feasible attacks will be discussed, and the security analysis will prove that none of them can successfully break the proposed scheme. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
