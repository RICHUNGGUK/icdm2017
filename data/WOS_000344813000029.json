To fill this gap, this paper presents a Process-aware disk predictive scheduling algorithm, where the VM manager indirectly learns and utilizes the process information. The process awareness is based on the relationship between the process and the address space. As a consequence, the I/O request can be distinguished. Moreover, the Process-aware predictive scheduling scheme is implemented and the result is tested. The experimental results illustrate that the Process-aware predictive scheduling algorithm is feasible and the disk I/O speed can also be improved significantly.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of process-aware predictive scheduling scheme for virtual machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000344813000029"}
