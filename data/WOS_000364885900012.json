Considering the respective advantages of DPCA and DICA in different data distribution characteristics, this paper proposes a novel process monitoring algorithm named DPCA, DICA and Bayesian Inference (DPCA-DICA-BI). The main idea of DPCA-DICA-BI is to put the process variables with same distribution characteristic (Gaussian or non-Gaussian) into a block on the basis of the variable normality by Jarque-Bera test and then to respectively apply DPCA and DICA in Gaussian and non-Gaussian blocks. Finally, to combine the monitoring performance of both blocks, Bayesian inference is employed to make an integrated decision. The DPCA-DICA-BI as well as PCA, ICA, DPCA, and DICA has been used to a numerical example and Tennessee Eastman process. The simulation results show the superiority of DPCA-DICA-BI.
