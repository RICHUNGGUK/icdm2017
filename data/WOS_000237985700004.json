We present a linear programming model of the protection method and a column-generation algorithm. For six real-world networks, the minimal restoration overbuild network capacity is between 13% and 78%. We further study the importance of the density of the network, derive analytical bounds, and study methods to speed up the column-generation algorithm. We expect that the suggested protection method will be used for calculating lower bounds required for protection, but not as a functioning protection method.
