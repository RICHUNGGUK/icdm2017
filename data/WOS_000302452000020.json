However, when pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras are used, the tracking object can be brought into the FOV by adjusting its intrinsic parameters: consequently, selection of the best-performing camera is critical. Performance is determined by the relative positions of the camera and the tracking objects, image quality, lighting and how much of the front side of the object faces the camera. In a multi-camera surveillance system, both camera hand-off and camera assignment play an important role in automated and persistent tracking, which are typical surveillance requirements. This study investigates the use of automatic methods for tracking an object across cameras in a surveillance network using PTZ cameras. An automatic, efficient continuous tracking scheme is developed. The goal is to determine the decision criteria for hand-off using Sight Quality Indication (SQI) (which includes information on the position of the object and the proportion of the front of object faces the camera), and to perform the camera handoff task in a manner that optimizes the vision effect associated with monitoring. Experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm can be efficiently executed, and the handoff method for feasible and continuously tracking active objects under real-time surveillance.
