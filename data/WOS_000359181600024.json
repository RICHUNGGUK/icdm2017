It works in a multi-scale framework with an adaptive-interpolative thresholding technique. Instead of computing a global threshold value, it computes the local threshold values for a small set of grid points by observing the intensity pattern of the pixels lying in the concerned grid cells. Estimated thresholds are used, in turn, to compute the threshold values of all the remaining pixels using a fast-yet-efficient interpolation procedure. To handle noises in degraded images, this grid-based adaptive thresholding is applied in successively reducing scales to obtain the near-optimal binarization as a set of connected components. After a post-processing meant for stroke preservation with these connected components, we get the final output. Exhaustive experimentation and comparison with other existing methods have been successfully carried out with benchmark datasets and also with our own datasets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
