However, the standard notation does not support the concept of time, and consequently its application is limited to non-real-time systems. To overcome this limitation we extend the notation to timed Behavior Trees. We provide an operational semantics which is based on timed automata, and thus serves as a formal basis for the translation of timed Behavior Trees into the input notation of the timed model checker UPPAAL. System-level timing properties of a Behavior Tree model can then be automatically verified using UPPAAL. Based on the notational extensions with model checking support, we introduce timed Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, a process for identifying cause-consequence relationships between component failures and system hazards in real-time safety critical systems.
