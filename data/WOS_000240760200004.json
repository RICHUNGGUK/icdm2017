Presented is an example of a large hydroelectric dam, highlighting the need for 3D visualization and modeling as a requirement for the engineering design and construction process. Due to the complex nature of these projects, geological analysis using 3D modeling is commonly necessary. In this paper we present an integrated 3D geological modeling methodology for the analysis of large amounts of exploration data, and subsequent geological interpretation based on the non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) technique, the triangulated irregular network (TIN) algorithm and boundary representation. The procedural details and application of the proposed approach are demonstrated with reference to an actual hydropower engineering project. The new approach offered a good scheme to solve the inconsistencies among storage, accuracy and operational speed of the model. A 3D model was developed and validated using testing data from the engineering project. Visual analysis of the 3D model helps engineers to comprehend the complexity of geological structures, and enables arbitrary cutting, rock-mass quality classification, and digital drilling.
