By allowing users to import videos and re-share them through the social connections, a large number of videos are available to users in the online social network. The rapid growth of the user-generated videos provides enormous potential for users to find the ones that interest them; while the convergence of online social network service and online video sharing service makes it possible to perform recommendation using social factors and content factors jointly. In this paper, we design a joint social-content recommendation framework to suggest users which videos to import or re-share in the online social network. In this framework, we first propose a user-content matrix update approach which updates and fills in cold user-video entries to provide the foundations for the recommendation. Then, based on the updated user-content matrix, we construct a joint social-content space to measure the relevance between users and videos, which can provide a high accuracy for video importing and re-sharing recommendation. We conduct experiments using real traces from Tencent Weibo and Youku to verify our algorithm and evaluate its performance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show that our approach can substantially improve the recommendation accuracy.", "paper_title": "Joint Social and Content Recommendation for User-Generated Videos in Online Social Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000316410900019"}
