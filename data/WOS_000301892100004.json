This paper presents a simple yet effective multi-layered multi-view business process modeling framework that integrates organizational aspects, behavioral aspects, and input and output of business processes. The ultimate goal of this framework is to structure modeling efforts and to improve the usability of business process models in day-to-day decision making. A set of relationships between the layers are defined to support round-tripping as much as possible. A financial services based example is presented as a proof-of-concept in which the modeling framework was tested and assessed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
