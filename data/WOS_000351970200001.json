By using polynomial or rational curves, and specifying the homogeneous coordinates of the swept surface as bilinear forms in the profile and sweep curve homogeneous coordinates, the outcome is guaranteed to be a rational surface compatible with the prevailing data types of CAD systems. However, this approach does not accommodate many geometrically intuitive sweep operations based on differential or integral properties of the sweep curve - such as the parametric speed, tangent, normal, curvature, arc length, and offset curves - since they do not ordinarily have a rational dependence on the curve parameter. The use of Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) sweep curves surmounts this limitation, and thus makes possible a much richer spectrum of rational swept surface types. A number of representative examples are used to illustrate the diversity of these novel swept surface forms - including the oriented-translation sweep, offset-translation sweep, generalized conical sweep, and oriented-involute sweep. In many cases of practical interest, these forms also have rational offset surfaces. Considerations related to the automated CNC machining of these surfaces, using only their high-level procedural definitions, are also briefly discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
