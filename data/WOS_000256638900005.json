The molten glass is modeled by ail incompressible Newtonian liquid undergoing flow. And a three-dimensional finite element method is used to perform the simulation of the fluid and heat flow. A local one-dimensional transient analysis in the thickness direction is adopted for the part cooling stage after pressing, which employs the finite-difference method. The mold heat transfer is established by boundary conditions analysis and its numerical implementation is a three-dimensional boundary element method. The glass and mold simulations are coupled by matching the temperature and heat flux on the glass-mold interface. For residual stresses analysis, a thermo-rheologically simple viscoelastic material model is introduced to consider the stresses relaxation effect and to describe the mechanical behavior according to the temperature change. The shrinkage of formed parts induced by the residual stresses is calculated based oil the theory of shells, represented as ail assembly of flat elements formed by combining the constant strain and the discrete Kirchhoff triangular elements. A thermoelastic model is presented to predict the deformation of the mold blocks during pressing, which is based oil the steady mold temperature field and thermoelastic boundary element method.
