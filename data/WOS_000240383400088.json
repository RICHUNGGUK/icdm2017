The results indicate SVMs outperform the three-layer Backpropagation (BP) neural network in predicting burn-through point with better generalization performance, and are satisfactory. The model can be used as plant model for the burn-through point control of on-strand sinter machines.", "paper_title": "Prediction of sinter burn-through point based on support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400088"}
