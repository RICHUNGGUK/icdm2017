It is inconvenient and inefficient for an ordinary user to invoke multiple search engines and identify useful documents from the returned results. Meta-search engines could provide a unified access for their users. In this paper, a novel meta-search engine, named as WebFusion, is introduced. WebFusion learns the expertness of the underlying search engines in a certain category based on the users' preferences. It also uses the \"click-through data concept\" to give a content-oriented ranking score to each result page. Click-through data concept is the implicit feedback of the users' preferences, which is also used as a reinforcement signal in the learning process, to predict the users' preferences and reduces the seeking time in the returned results list. The decision lists of underling search engines have been fused using ordered weighted averaging (OWA) approach and the application of optimistic operator as weightening function has been investigated. Moreover, the results of this approach have been compared with those achieve by some popular meta-search engines such as ProFusion and MetaCrawler. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement on average click rate, and the variance of clicks as well as average relevancy criterion. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
