We introduce a basic algorithmic approach for inductive programming and illustrate it with three systems: dialogs learns logic programs by combining inductive and abductive reasoning; the classical thesys system and its extension igor1 learn functional programs based on a recurrence detection mechanism in traces; igor2 learns functional programs over algebraic data-types making use of constructor-term rewriting systems. Furthermore, we give a short history of inductive programming, discuss related approaches, and give hints about current applications and possible future directions of research.", "paper_title": "An introduction to inductive programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000268424100002"}
