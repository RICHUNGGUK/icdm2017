As a consequence of the development of computer technology, mathematical programming models of practical-sized ALB problems can be solved by commercial optimisation software very efficiently. Therefore, the focus of research in ALB can be shifted to practice-driven model formulation and to the investigation of new areas of application. The objective of this paper is to show how cycle-time related operations management decisions can be supported with quick solution of ALB models through the case of a bicycle assembly process. Practical ALB problems related to workforce skill and to production quantity changes are presented and management implications of the results are explained.", "paper_title": "Application of the results of simple assembly line balancing models in practice: the case of a bicycle manufacturer", "paper_id": "WOS:000337245200006"}
