The periodic change of flow patterns can be observed. The recirculation zone near the wall of the injectors upstream increases in size and moves gradually upstream, whereas the vortex breakdown in the injector downstream shifts slowly towards the nozzle outlet during the whole period. A low axial velocity in the core region moves gradually away from the centerline, and the magnitude of the center reverse flow and the area occupied by it increase with axial distance due to the vortex breakdown. From the tangential velocity profile, there is a very small free-vortex zone. With increasing nozzle pressure, the velocity increases and the location of vortex breakdown is moved slightly downward. However, the increase in the velocity tends to decline at nozzle pressure up to a high level.
