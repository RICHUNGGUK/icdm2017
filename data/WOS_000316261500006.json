The whole input image collection is represented as an imaging sample space (ISS) consisting of globally indexed image features extracted by a new efficient multi-view image feature matching method. By making an analogy between image capturing and observation of ISS, each image is represented as a binary sequence, in which each bit indicates the visibility of a corresponding feature. Based on information theory-inspired image popularity and dissimilarity measures, we show that the image content and distance can be quantitatively described, guided by which an input image collection is organized into multilevel clusters automatically. The effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated using three real image collections and promising results were obtained from both qualitative and quantitative evaluation.", "paper_title": "A novel unsupervised approach for multilevel image clustering from unordered image collection", "paper_id": "WOS:000316261500006"}
