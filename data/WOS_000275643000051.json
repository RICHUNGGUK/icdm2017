However, because of the well-known outlier-sensitiveness disadvantage of the L2-norm, conventional graph embedding is not robust to outliers which occur in many practical applications. In this paper, an improved graph embedding algorithm (termed LPP-L1) is proposed by replacing L2-norm with L1-norm. In addition to its robustness property, LPP-L1 avoids small sample size problem. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate these advantages. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
