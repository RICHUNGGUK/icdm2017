In a single- radix code, all dimensions have the same base, say, k, whereas, in a mixed- radix code, the base in one dimension can be different from the base in another dimension. Constructions of new classes of mixed- radix Gray codes are presented. It is shown how these codes can be used as a basis for constructing edge- disjoint Hamiltonian cycles in mixed- radix toroidal networks when the number of dimensions n = 2r for some r >= 0. Efficient algorithms for the generation of these codes are then shown.", "paper_title": "Mixed-radix gray codes in lee metric", "paper_id": "WOS:000248891000001"}
