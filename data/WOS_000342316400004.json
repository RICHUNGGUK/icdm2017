The optimal solution to meet these goals is non-deterministic polynomial-time hard and therefore cannot be solved in acceptable polynomial time. For this reason, both optimal and polynomial time heuristic solutions are introduced. Simulation experiments are used to evaluate and compare the proposed policies.
