We show for the first time, under the assumption of no slipping, that the path of the rear wheels depends only on the path of the front wheels and not on the vehicle speed. We examine motion along straight, circular and winding roads, giving closed form solutions in the first two cases. We also provide a straight forward algorithm for computing vehicle off tracking for any road geometry. We believe these results will be of significant benefit to road designers.
