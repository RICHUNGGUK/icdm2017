We obtain a limit theorem that this QW exhibits localization with not an exponential but a \"power-law\" decay around the origin and a \"strongly\" ballistic spreading called bottom localization in this paper. This limit theorem implies the weak convergence with linear scaling whose density has two delta measures at x = 0 (the origin) and x = 1 (the bottom) without continuous parts.", "paper_title": "ONE-DIMENSIONAL QUANTUM WALKS VIA GENERATING FUNCTION AND THE CGMV METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000340579900008"}
