In the process of decision making, each expert provides his/her evaluation over the alternatives depending on a finite set of attributes and constructs an individual fuzzy decision matrix. The proposed technique establishes an iterative process to aggregate the fuzzy information, given by individual expert, into group consensus opinion by using the fuzzy similarity measure. Then, based on group consensus opinion, the proposed approach utilizes the fuzzy similarity measure to find out the most desirable alternative through approximate reasoning. The proposed decision making technique is more flexible due to the fact that it considers the degrees of confidence of experts' opinions. Finally an example has been shown to highlight the proposed methodology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
