However, it reduces the performance benefit of buffer caching as journaling accounts for a bulk of the storage writes in real system environments. To relieve this problem, we present a novel buffer cache architecture that subsumes the functionality of caching and journaling by making use of nonvolatile memory such as PCM or STT-MRAM. Specifically, our buffer cache supports what we call the in-place commit scheme. This scheme avoids logging, but still provides the same journaling effect by simply altering the state of the cached block to frozen. As a frozen block still provides the functionality of a cache block, we show that in-place commit does not degrade cache performance. We implement our scheme on Linux 2.6.38 and measure the throughput and execution time of the scheme with various file I/O benchmarks. The results show that our scheme improves the throughput and execution time by 89% and 34% on average, respectively, compared to the existing Linux buffer cache with ext4 without any loss of reliability.", "paper_title": "A Unified Buffer Cache Architecture that Subsumes Journaling Functionality via Nonvolatile Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000331879400001"}
