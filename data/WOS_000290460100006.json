Each file may be input for more than one task. Examples of Bag-of-Tasks (BoT) applications include Monte Carlo simulations, massive searches (such as key breaking), image manipulation applications and data mining algorithms. A common framework to execute BoT applications is the master-slave topology, in which the user machine is used to control the execution of tasks. In this scenario, a large number of concurrent tasks competing for resources (e.g.. CPU and communication links) severely limits application execution scalability. This paper is devoted to study the scalability of BoT applications running on multi-node systems (such as clusters and multi-clusters) organized as hierarchical platforms, considering several communication paradigms. Our study employs a set of experiments that involves the simulation of various large-scale platforms. The results presented provide important guidelines for improving the scalability of practical applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
