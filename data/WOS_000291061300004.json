As TV program is a real-time video/audio service, in comparison with either traditional video/audio file downloads or network video/audio streams, there are more technical difficulties to be overcome, in particular, how to satisfy the playback functions of TV programs in hand-held device. OpenCore is a multimedia framework, which has recently been widely applied in hand-held devices, but it does not offer functions of mobile TV. To solve this problem, this study incorporates the function of mobile TV into the OpenCore framework, in order to support both formats of TV signals, i.e. DVB-H and DVB-T. The incorporated function, DVB-H/T, has different characteristics, so that users can select TV signals according to their receiving environments and fulfill their needs in TV programs selection.", "paper_title": "Design and integration of the OpenCore-based mobile TV framework for DVB-H/T wireless network", "paper_id": "WOS:000291061300004"}
