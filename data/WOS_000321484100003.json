The PDA performs pitch estimation and voiced/unvoiced (V/UV) detection via novel signal processing schemes that are designed to enhance the MBSC's peaks at the most likely pitch period. These peak-enhancement schemes include comb-filter channel-weighting to yield each individual subband's summary correlogram (SC) stream, and stream-reliability-weighting to combine these SCs into a single MBSC. V/UV detection is performed by applying a constant threshold on the maximum peak of the enhanced MBSC. Narrowband noisy speech sampled at 8 kHz are generated from Keele (development set) and CSTR - Centre for Speech Technology Research-(evaluation set) corpora. Both 4-kHz full-band speech, and G.712-filtered telephone speech are simulated. When evaluated solely on pitch estimation accuracy, assuming voicing detection is perfect, the proposed algorithm has the lowest gross pitch error for noisy speech in the evaluation set among the algorithms evaluated (RAPT, YIN, etc.). The proposed PDA also achieves the lowest average pitch detection error, when both pitch estimation and voicing detection errors are taken into account. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
