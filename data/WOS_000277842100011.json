Considering all these limitations, this paper is targeted to control energy consumption without compromising system's performance in mobile grid. In this paper, we focus on using the mobile devices on the mobile grid environment. Mobile devices can serve two important functions in mobile grid environment either as service consumer or as valuable service providers. The proposed approach is not only to reduce energy consumption, but also to improve system performance in mobile grid environment. Utility functions are used to express grid users' requirements, resource providers' benefit function and system's objectives. Dynamic programming is used to optimize the total utility function of mobile grid. A distributed controlling energy algorithm in mobile grid environment is proposed which decomposes mobile grid system optimization problem into sub-problems. In order to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, in the experiment, the performance evaluation of controlling energy algorithm is conducted. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
