Assuming that all entries of payoff matrices are uncertain variables, this paper introduces a concept of uncertain bimatrix game. Within the framework of uncertainty theory, three solution concepts of uncertain equilibrium strategies as well as their existence theorem are proposed. Furthermore, a sufficient and necessary condition is presented for finding the uncertain equilibrium strategies. Finally, an example is provided for illustrating the usefulness of the theory developed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Uncertain bimatrix game with applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000314837800007"}
