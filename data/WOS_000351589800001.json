As people rely heavily on such mobile and wearable devices, the need for seamless and secure communication across these spectra of devices becomes increasingly important. In order to provide secure communication, mutually trusted authentication becomes the first line of protection to guard our personal information. We propose an acoustic-based signcryption mutual authentication (ASMA), which is a key-agreement protocol by employing timestamp and owning functions of multiple-times identity authentication, password change, and devices addition and alteration. Through series of experiments verifying the reliability and accuracy, the protocol shows that it can ensure secure data transmission and data sharing for multiwearable devices.", "paper_title": "Making It Trustable: Acoustic-Based Signcryption Mutual Authentication for Multiwearable Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000351589800001"}
