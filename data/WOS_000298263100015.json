Well-known expressions for the characteristic impedance of a regular microstrip line have been modified to incorporate the effect of this aperture. The accuracy of these expressions for various values of substrate thickness, permittivity and line width has been studied in detail by fullwave simulations. This has been further verified by measurements. These expressions are easier to compute and find immense use in the design of broadband filters, tight couplers, power dividers, transformers, delay lines, and matching circuits. A broadband filter with aperture in ground plane is demonstrated in this article. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
