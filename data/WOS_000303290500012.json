The method consisted of (1) comparison of true ultrasound B-mode images with corresponding ultrasound-like images, and (2) modification of tissue properties to decrease the difference between these images. Ultrasound-like images that reproduced many, but not all the properties of corresponding true ultrasound images were generated. The tissue model could be used for real-time simulation of ultrasound-like B-mode images on a moderately priced computer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
