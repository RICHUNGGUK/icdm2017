The asymptotical behavior of such bounds for r >= 2 differs from that of the classical Feng-Rao distance (r = 1) by the so-called Feng-Rao numbers. This paper is addressed to compute the Feng-Rao numbers for numerical semigroups of embedding dimension two (with two generators), obtaining a closed simple formula for the general case by using numerical semigroup techniques. These involve the computation of the Apery set with respect to an integer of the semigroups under consideration. The formula obtained is applied to lower bounding the generalized Hamming weights, improving the bound given by Kirfel and Pellikaan in terms of the classical Feng-Rao distance. We also compare our bound with a modification of the Griesmer bound, improving this one in many cases.", "paper_title": "On the Weight Hierarchy of Codes Coming From Semigroups With Two Generators", "paper_id": "WOS:000330282600020"}
