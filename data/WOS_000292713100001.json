Design/methodology/approach - TK is a novel Kriging model where Taylor expansion is used to identify the base functions of drift function in Kriging. The paper explains the methodology of TK, illustrates the development of software, and reports the results of two case studies by comparing TK with several regression methods. Findings - TK has the advantage of interpolation accuracy, and the developed Kriging software system is useful and can be conveniently manipulated by users. Practical implications - The developed software system can benefit practical engineering applications that need accurate interpolations under limited observations. Originality/value - This paper develops an application software interpolation system based on a novel TK metamodel, and the practical engineering applications show that it can provide accurate interpolations under limited observations.", "paper_title": "System development and application of Taylor Kriging metamodeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000292713100001"}
