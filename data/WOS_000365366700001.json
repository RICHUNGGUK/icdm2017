For stabilization and swing-up, reaction wheels are placed within the cube along with the actuation, electronics and sensors. This allows the cube to swing up from a rest position and to balance around the unstable steady-state positions. We first conducted a design assessment to review different design approaches. For the most promising design, we then formulated a parameter optimization to calculate the most suitable dimensions for the cube and the inertia elements. These results were then used in the mechanical design stage to obtain the optimal design parameters for the cube in an iterative process. In addition to this mechatronic design, we also focused on the control of swing-up and the stabilization of the cube. We considered a proportional control law using virtual springs with feed-forward control. The performance of the proposed control was first evaluated in simulations and then extensively tested on the real system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
