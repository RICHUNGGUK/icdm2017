This makes efficient sensitivity analysis essential and for this the adjoint variable method (AVM) is indispensable. For transient problems it has been observed that the traditional AVM, based on a differentiate-then-discretize approach, may lead to inconsistent sensitivities. Herein this effect is explicitly demonstrated for a single dof system and the source of inconsistency is identified. Additionally, we outline an alternative discretize-then-differentiate AVM that inherently produces consistent sensitivities.", "paper_title": "On the consistency of adjoint sensitivity analysis for structural optimization of linear dynamic problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000335510400009"}
