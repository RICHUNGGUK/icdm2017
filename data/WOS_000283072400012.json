Often, G is supported by a single F-rational point and the resulting code is called a one-point code. Recently, there has been interest in allowing the divisor G to be more general as this can result in superior codes. In particular, one may obtain a code with better parameters by allowing G to be supported by m distinct F-rational points, where m > 1. In this paper, we demonstrate that a multipoint algebraic geometry code C may be embedded in a one-point code C'. Exploiting this fact, we obtain a minimum distance decoding algorithm for the multipoint code C. This is accomplished via list decoding in the one-point code C'.", "paper_title": "Minimum Distance Decoding of General Algebraic Geometry Codes via Lists", "paper_id": "WOS:000283072400012"}
