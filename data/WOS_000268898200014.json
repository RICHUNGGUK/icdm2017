A suitable cost functional is minimized via solving the derived Euler-Lagrangian equation, of which the discretization is conducted on unstructured triangular meshes by employing a simple and effective finite volume scheme. Through adaptive refinement of the mesh. the geometry features of the given curve can be well resolved in a cost-effective way. Various numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
