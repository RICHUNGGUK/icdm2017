By combining two methods, the proposed algorithm can reduce noise problem in the ART ANN and the local minima problem in the delta-bar-delta method. The proposed method can extend itself based on new information contained in input patterns that require nodes of hidden layers in neural networks and effectively find characters. We experiment with various real-world documents such as a student ID and an identifier on a container. The experimental results show that the proposed self-generation. ART algorithm reduces the possibility of local minima and accelerates learning speed compared with existing.", "paper_title": "Self-generation ART neural network for character recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000041"}
