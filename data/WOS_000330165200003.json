An online inspection method is suggested to reach a Bayes decision prior the termination time of life test. Bayesian sampling plans (BSPs) with quadratic loss function are established to illustrate the use of the proposed method. Some BSPs are tabulated, and the performance of the proposed BSPs is compared with two existing competitive methods. Numerical results indicate that a significant reduction in the experimental time over the conventional BSP can be achieved when the online inspection method is applied.", "paper_title": "Efficient Bayesian sampling plans for exponential distributions with type-I-censored samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000330165200003"}
