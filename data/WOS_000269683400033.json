Such a problem is parameterized by a set Gamma of rational-valued functions, which generalize constraints. Each function assigns a weight to every assignment to a set of Boolean variables. Our dichotomy extends previous work in which the weight functions were restricted to being non-negative. We represent a weight function as a product of the form (-1)(s)g, where the polynomial s determines the sign of the weight and the non-negative function g determines its magnitude. We show that the problem of computing the partition function (the Sum of the weights of all possible variable assignments) is in polynomial time if either every function in Gamma can be defined by a \"pure affine\" magnitude with a quadratic sign polynomial or every function can be defined by a magnitude of \"product type\" with a linear sign polynomial. In all other cases, computing the partition function is FOP-complete. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
