Research on the technology acceptance model (TAM) confirms that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are relevant criteria for users evaluating organizational software. However, information technology has changed considerably since TAM's 1989 inception, so an upgraded evaluation framework may apply. The web of system performance (WOSP) model suggests eight evaluation criteria, based on a systems theory definition of performance. This paper compares WOSP and TAM criterion frameworks in a performance evaluation experiment using the analytic hierarchy process method. Subjects who used both TAM and WOSP criteria preferred the WOSP criteria, were more satisfied with its decision outcomes, and found the WOSP evaluation more accurate and complete. As sociotechnical software becomes more complex, users may need (or prefer) more comprehensive evaluation,criterion frameworks.", "paper_title": "Expanding the criteria for evaluating socio-technical software", "paper_id": "WOS:000257020200004"}
