We propose a new methodology for monitoring quality in the earliest phases of real-time reactive system (RTRS) development. The targeted quality characteristics are functional complexity, performance, reliability, architectural complexity, maintainability, and test coverage. All these characteristics should be continuously monitored throughout the RTRS development cycle, to provide decision support and detect the first signs of low or decreasing quality as the system design evolves. The ultimate goal of this methodology is to assist developers in dealing with complex user requirements and ensure that the formal development process yields a high-quality application. Each aspect of quality monitoring is formalized mathematically and illustrated using a train-gate-controller case study. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
