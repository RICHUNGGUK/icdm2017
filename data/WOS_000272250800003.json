A random fuzzy multi-objective programming model was established which can describe the integrated logistics as a cycle of production, distribution, consumption, collection, transportation, recycling, disposal, reuse and redistribution. We then used the expected value operator and the chance-constrained operator to handle the random fuzzy objective functions and the random fuzzy constraints. The solution scheme was pursued by a genetic algorithm based on random fuzzy simulation and compromise approach. And an application to a Chinese beer company was given as an illustration.", "paper_title": "A CLASS OF INTEGRATED LOGISTICS NETWORK MODEL UNDER RANDOM FUZZY ENVIRONMENT AND ITS APPLICATION TO CHINESE BEER COMPANY", "paper_id": "WOS:000272250800003"}
