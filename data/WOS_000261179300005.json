Our framework provides context adaptation with the aid of a middleware service to improve the quality of resource location. A resource location protocol suitable to each type of network locates resource effectively by means of dynamic reconfiguration to the current context. Our framework is also refined by support for interoperability between different types of resource location protocols occurring across a hybrid ubiquitous network. These characteristics also reduce the control overhead for resource location, saving resource, decreasing latency and permitting a considerable degree of scalability.", "paper_title": "URECA: Efficient Resource Location Middleware for Ubiquitous Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000261179300005"}
