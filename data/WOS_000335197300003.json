Due to large fluctuations in the wind velocity, the proposed scheme would handle system unreliable operational conditions. In such system, which has multi-input, multi-output and is also represented as a nonlinear control system, the uncertain parameters would affect the operational conditions. So, in order to have a robust controlling scheme, the mentioned characteristics should be considered in the proposed method. The adaptive control scheme proposed in this paper satisfies the expected constraints and could also be implemented in real-world platforms, especially in large-scale wind farms with DFIG turbines.", "paper_title": "An adaptive control scheme for doubly fed induction generators - wind turbine implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000335197300003"}
