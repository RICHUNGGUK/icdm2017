We propose ail intelligent mobility protocol benefiting from Cellular IP. To speed up the entire handover procedure, our proposed scheme enables 1.2 and L3 handovers to be performed in parallel by utilising power-save mode of IEEE 802.11. We provide analytical considerations on the handover latency and packet delivery cost of each protocol. Through our simulation experimental results, we have verified that our proposed scheme shows much better performance over the others under various parameter sets.", "paper_title": "An approach to mobility management in Cellular IP networks utilising power-save mode of IEEE 802.11", "paper_id": "WOS:000264119400008"}
