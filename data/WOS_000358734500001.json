We devise a new linear-time algorithm for computing the V -comparison of two finite strings. In comparison with the previous algorithm in the literature, our algorithm is both conceptually simpler, based on recording letter positions in increasing order, and more straightforward to implement, requiring only linked lists.", "paper_title": "Simple Linear Comparison of Strings in V -order", "paper_id": "WOS:000358734500001"}
