The adsorption energy of NO2. E-ads, is about 50 % larger on nanoparticles than on the metal perfect surfaces, following the almost general rule stating that the lower coordinated sites are those where the interaction is the largest. Interestingly for the co-adsorption and oxidation of CO an increase of reactivity is found for the Au nanoparticles, which is attributed to the large number of low coordinated sites due to the specific shape of this nanoparticle induced by the adsorbates.", "paper_title": "Comparative density functional theory based study of the reactivity of Cu, Ag, and Au nanoparticles and of (111) surfaces toward CO oxidation and NO2 reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000341865300042"}
