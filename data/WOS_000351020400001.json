Combined, it can accurately represent the social world and enable novel socially aware applications. We present Prometheus, a socially aware peer-to-peer service that collects social information from multiple sources into a multigraph managed in a decentralized fashion on user-contributed nodes, and exposes it through an interface implementing nontrivial social inferences while complying with user-defined access policies. Simulations and experiments on PlanetLab with emulated application workloads show the system exhibits good end-to-end response time, low communication overhead, and resilience to malicious attacks.", "paper_title": "Enabling Social Applications via Decentralized Social Data Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000351020400001"}
