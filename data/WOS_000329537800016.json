Drivers assume that hardware devices always work normally, but this assumption may cause drivers or systems to crash, since hardware device failures occur frequently. This can lead to incorrect values for drivers and cause them to malfunction. This paper proposes an advanced graph model for tainted variable tracking. The proposed approach can efficiently find variables, which are related to values read from hardware devices. It can also be used for variable assignment tracking, which is of great benefit in improving the reliability of hardware devices and drivers.", "paper_title": "Advanced graph model for tainted variable tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000329537800016"}
