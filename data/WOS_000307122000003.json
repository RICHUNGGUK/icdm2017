In this bounded domain, the inverse energy cascade, and a net torque exerted by the boundary, results in a spontaneous spin-up of the fluid, leading to a typical end state of a large monopole vortex that fills the domain. The SPH simulations were compared against published results using a high-accuracy pseudo-spectral code. Ensemble averages of the kinetic energy, enstrophy and average vortex wavenumber compared well against the pseudo-spectral results, as did the evolution of the total angular momentum of the fluid. However, although the pseudo-spectral results emphasised the importance of the no-slip boundaries as generators of long-lived coherent vortices in the flow, no such generation was seen in the SPH results. Vorticity filaments produced at the boundary were always dissipated by the flow shortly after separating from the boundary layer. The kinetic energy spectrum of the SPH results was calculated using an SPH Fourier transform that operates directly on the disordered particles. The ensemble kinetic energy spectrum showed the expected k-3 scaling over most of the inertial range. However, the spectrum flattened at smaller length scales (initially less than 7.5 particle spacings and growing in size over time), indicating an excess of small-scale kinetic energy.Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Direct numerical simulation of decaying two-dimensional turbulence in a no-slip square box using smoothed particle hydrodynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000307122000003"}
