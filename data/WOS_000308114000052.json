Treatment with a simple alkylating agent such as [2-C-13] bromoethylamine would result in labeled thialysine at the epsilon-position. This chemical modification of proteins would allow investigations via both C-13 NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. However [2-C-13] labeled bromoethylamine is not available commercially. We investigated its synthesis at acid pH with the goal of obtaining singly labeled bromoethylamine and understanding the mechanistic details of the reaction. Based on our experimental and theoretical results, bromination of [2-C-13] labeled ethanolamine in acidic conditions takes place via exclusive attack of the nucleophile (HBr) at the hydroxyl bearing C. Moreover, hydrogen bonding guides the nucleophilic attack, resulting in no label scrambling of the bromoethylamine product. Protein alkylation at cysteine residue with the synthesized (BrCH2CH2NH2)-C-13-HBr is successful. Ab initio calculations in which CH3SH serves as a model for the cysteine residue suggest that in gas phase intermolecular attack by the sulfur bearing nucleophile is favored over the intramolecular substitution by the amino group by 15.4 kJ mol(-1). Solution modeling shows that the trend is preserved at basic pH, which is the experimental one, but is reversed at neutral pH.", "paper_title": "Selectivity of labeled bromoethylamine for protein alkylation", "paper_id": "WOS:000308114000052"}
