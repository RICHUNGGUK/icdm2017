It has recently received tremendous attention clue to its capabilities of self-configuration and self-maintenance. However, attenuation and interference caused by node mobility and wireless channel sharing weaken the stability of communication links. A mathematical exploring model for the next hop has been established based on the optimal exploring theory. The negative impact of wireless routes discontinuity has been alleviated by a novel fast local routing repair scheme (FLRRS) proposed in this paper, wherein the route requirement zone has been restricted into a pie slice region on intermediate nodes according to the solution of exploring equations. The scheme is an effective approach in reducing the average end-to-end delay during routing maintenance. It also allows continuous packet forwarding for fault resilience. NS-2 based simulation results showed remarkable successful packet delivery rate and end-to-end delay improvements of source-initiated routing protocol with the fast local repair scheme, especially in the case of high dynamic environments with heavy traffic loads.", "paper_title": "A fast local routing repair scheme for wireless mobile ad hoc network", "paper_id": "WOS:000286497800010"}
