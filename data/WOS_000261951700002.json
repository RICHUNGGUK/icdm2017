The intersection numbers with lines and planes characterize H(3, q (2)), and H(4, q (2)) is characterized by its intersection numbers with planes and solids. This result is then extended to characterize all Hermitian varieties in dimension at least 4 by their intersection numbers with planes and solids.", "paper_title": "Characterizations of Hermitian varieties by intersection numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000261951700002"}
