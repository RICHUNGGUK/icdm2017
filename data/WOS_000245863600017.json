These hash tables are derived from a trie-representation of the multidimensional classifier. The height of this trie is O(W), where W is the sum of the maximum possible length, in bits, of each of the fields of a filter. The leaves at level iota of the trie together with markers for some of the leaves at levels j such that j > i are stored in a hash table H-iota. The placement of markers is such that a binary search of the H-iota's successfully locates the highest-priority filter that matches any given packet. The number of hash tables equals the trie height, O(W). Hence, a packet may be classified by performing O(log W) hash-table lookups. So the expected lookup-complexity of our data structure for multidimensional packet classification is O(log W). Our proposed scheme affords a memory advantage over the O(log W) 1-D scheme of Waldvogel et al For multidimensional packet classification, our proposed scheme provides both a time and memory advantage over the extended grid-of-tries scheme of Baboescu et al.", "paper_title": "O(log W) multidimensional packet classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000245863600017"}
