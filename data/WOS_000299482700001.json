We present near-linear-time approximation algorithms for the hitting set problem in the following geometric settings: (i) R is a set of planar regions with small union complexity. (ii) R is a set of axis-parallel d-dimensional boxes in R-d. In both cases X is either the entire R-d, or a finite set of points in Rd. The approximation factors yielded by the algorithm are small; they are either the same as, or within very small factors off the best factors known to be computable in polynomial time.", "paper_title": "Near-Linear Approximation Algorithms for Geometric Hitting Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000299482700001"}
