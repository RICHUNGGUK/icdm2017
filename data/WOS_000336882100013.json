In terms of graphs it can be formulated as a problem of finding a triangulation of a given graph with the minimum number of edges. In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of local search for the MINIMUM FILL-IN problem in the following form: Given a triangulation H of a graph G, is there a better triangulation, i.e. triangulation with less edges than H, within a given distance from H? We prove that this problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) being parameterized by the distance from the initial triangulation, by providing an algorithm that in time f(k)vertical bar G vertical bar(O(1)) M decides if a better triangulation of G can be obtained by swapping at most k edges of H. Our result adds MINIMUM FILL-IN to the list of very few problems for which local search is known to be FPT. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
