Intuitively, our results correspond to synthesizing alternative, more economical, interconnection networks by reducing the number of dimensions and/or link density of existing networks via mapping and pruning. We discuss applications of these results to well-known and useful interconnection networks such as hexagonal and honeycomb meshes.", "paper_title": "Further properties of Cayley digraphs and their applications to interconnection networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238091800018"}
