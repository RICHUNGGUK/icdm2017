Contrarily to other approaches for data dissemination, our approach uses a viral programming model. Data performs an active role in the storage process. It acts as a virus or a mobile agent, finding its own storage and relocating when necessary. We consider geographical areas of any shape and size. Simulation results show that our algorithms are scalable and converge quickly, even though none of them outperform the others for all performance metrics considered.", "paper_title": "Infrastructure less Spatial Storage Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000292708200005"}
