Singly exponential algorithms for computing the zeroth Betti number, and the Euler-Poincare characteristic, were known before. No singly exponential algorithm was known for computing any of the individual Betti numbers other than the zeroth one. As a consequence we also obtain algorithms for computing semi-algebraic descriptions of the semi-algebraically connected components of any given real algebraic or semi-algebraic set in singly exponential time, which improves on the complexity of the previously published algorithms for this problem.", "paper_title": "Computing the first Betti number of a semi-algebraic set", "paper_id": "WOS:000256081900004"}
