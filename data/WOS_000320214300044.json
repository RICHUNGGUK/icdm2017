The proposed SRT was built on one specific class, which decides whether a sample belongs to a certain class. The forest can make a final decision on classification by ensembling all the specific trees. Compared with the original random forest, our method has higher strength, but lower correlation and upper error bound. The experimental results based on 10 different public datasets demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Specific Random Trees for Random Forest", "paper_id": "WOS:000320214300044"}
