This paper presents an approximate performance methodology for self-routing MLMINs that consist of two segments, each of which is composed of symmetrical switch elements. The first segment is subject to blocking situations with one mode of packet transmission policy (unicast). The second segment-the multilayer-is blocking free and employs double modes of transmission policy (unicast and multicast replication). Applying the current analytical model, which is based on a convergence method on the above types of MLMINs, an estimate can be made of their performance indicators. This model was applied to variable network size MLMINs under different multicasting patterns of traffic. It was also validated by extensive simulations. All the MLMINs under study apply special packet (traffic) management techniques, which allow for the integration of sub-networking into larger networks such as grids. The results are accurate and useful for network engineering, especially in the service of local area networks.
