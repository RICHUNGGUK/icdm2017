For this means, a feedforward compensator is designed to ensure system passivity and then a new model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) is developed to provide good performance. The developed system demonstrates good stability and force tracking capabilities. A command generator tracker (CGT) is designed for a sample teleoperation system and the results are compared with the proposed system. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
