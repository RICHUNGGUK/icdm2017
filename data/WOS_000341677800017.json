Also, the Tikhonov regularization term is incorporated to the objective of our approach to reduce the singularity problems of Quadratic Programming Problems (QPPs), and then to minimize its 1-norm measure. This approach leads to a strong feature suppression capability, called as Feature Selection for Least Squares Projection Twin Support Vector Machine (FLSPTSVM). The solutions of FLSPTSVM can be obtained by solving two smaller QPPS arising from two primal QPPs as opposed to two dual ones in Twin Support Vector Machine (TWSVM). Thus, FLSPTSVM is capable of generating sparse solutions. This means that FLSPTSVM can reduce the number of input features for a linear case. Our linear FLSPTSVM can also be extended to a nonlinear case with the kernel trick. When a nonlinear classifier is used, the number of kernel functions required for the classifier is reduced. Our experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our FLSPTSVM has comparable classification accuracy to that of LSPTSVM and obtains sparse solutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
