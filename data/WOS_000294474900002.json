This paper presents the results of a multi-case study investigating the effectiveness of TDD within an industrial environment. Three comparable medium-sized projects were observed during their development cycle. Two projects were driven without TDD practice, while the third one introduced TDD into the development process. The effectiveness of TDD was expressed in terms of external code quality, productivity, and maintainability. Our results indicate that the TDD developers produced higher quality code that is easier to maintain, although we did observe a reduction in productivity.", "paper_title": "The effectiveness of test-driven development: an industrial case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000294474900002"}
