The vertical connection, which is generally implemented by the through-the-si I icon via, is a key technology for 3-D ICs. In this paper, given 3-D circuit placement or floorplan results with white space reserved between blocks for inter-layer interconnections, we proposed methods for assigning inter-layer signal via locations. Introducing a grid structure on the chip, the inter-layer via assignment of two-layer chips can be optimally solved by a convex-cost max-flow formulation with signal via congestion optimized. As for 3-D ICs with three or more layers, the inter-layer signal via assignment is modeled as an integral min-cost multi-commodity flow problem, which is solved by a heuristic method based on the lagrangian relaxation. Relaxing the capacity constraints in the grids, we transfer the min-cost multi-commodity flow problem to a sequence of lagrangian sub-problems, which are solved by finding a sequence of shortest paths. The complexity of solving a lagrangian sub-problem is O(n(nt)n(g)(2)), where n(nt) is the number of nets and n(g) is the number of grids on one chip layer. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the method.", "paper_title": "Lagrangian Relaxation Based Inter-Layer Signal Via Assignment for 3-D ICs", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701700020"}
