A sufficient condition ensuring a discrete singular fuzzy system to be regular, causal and stable is proposed in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities. Based on this, a robust stability condition is obtained. Both of these conditions can be checked by using recently developed algorithms in solving LMIs. Examples are provided to demonstrate the reduced conservatism and effectiveness of the proposed conditions. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
