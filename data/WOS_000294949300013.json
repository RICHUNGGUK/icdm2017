While this freedom leads to many potential benefits, the running services must be minimally disrupted by the migration. Unfortunately, current solutions for wide-area migration incur too much disruption as they will significantly slow down storage I/O operations during migration. The resulting increase in service latency could be very costly to a business. This paper presents a novel storage migration scheduling algorithm that can greatly improve storage I/O performance during wide-area migration. Our algorithm is unique in that it considers individual virtual machine's storage I/O workload such as temporal locality, spatial locality and popularity characteristics to compute an efficient data transfer schedule. Using a fully implemented system on KVM and a trace-driven framework, we show that our algorithm provides large performance benefits across a wide range of popular virtual machine workloads.", "paper_title": "Workload-Aware Live Storage Migration for Clouds", "paper_id": "WOS:000294949300013"}
