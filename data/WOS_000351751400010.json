An area-efficient power stage that can be configured to four different conversion ratios (2x/2.5x/3x/4x) under different input voltages, is proposed to maintain high power efficiencies and small output ripples of the regulator over a wide input voltage range caused by coupling variations. Instead of using a low-dropout regulator for post regulation, a fixed on-time regulation scheme is developed to provide output regulation and reduce the switching power loss under the light load condition. Implemented in a standard 0.35-mu m n-well CMOS process, the proposed regulator delivers a maximum output current of 10 mA and achieves the peak power efficiency of 82%. When the input voltage varies by 1.6 V, the power efficiency of the proposed regulator can be improved by 40% compared with the regulator efficiency with a fixed-ratio 4x power stage. The output ripple reaches 24 mV that is 0.5% of the output regulated voltage.", "paper_title": "A Reconfigurable 2x/2.5x/3x/4x SC DC-DC Regulator With Fixed On-Time Control for Transcutaneous Power Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000351751400010"}
