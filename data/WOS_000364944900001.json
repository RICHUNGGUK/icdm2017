At this point in time, there is a growing need for big data-based energy-IoT technology that can reduce energy consumption. However, despite the emergence of these technologies for IoT, there is still a lack of control systems to surmount the energy efficiency problem of hyperconnected IoT applications. In this paper, we attempt to reduce energy consumption by automatically controlling the communication between each device by establishing three different energy-IoT-based chains regarding the relationship of connections between devices.", "paper_title": "Design of Building Energy Autonomous Control System with the Intelligent Object Energy Chain Mechanism Based on Energy-IoT", "paper_id": "WOS:000364944900001"}
