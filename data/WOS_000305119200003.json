We prove a lower bound of 1 - 1/n(Omega(1)) on the statistical distance between (i) the output distribution of any small constant-depth (a.k.a. AC(0)) circuit f : {0, 1}(poly(n)) -> {0, 1}(n), and (ii) the uniform distribution over any code C subset of {0, 1}(n) that is \"good,\" that is, has relative distance and rate both Omega(1). This seems to be the first lower bound of this kind. We give two simple applications of this result: (1) any data structure for storing codewords of a good code C subset of {0, 1}(n) requires redundancy Omega(log n), if each bit of the codeword can be retrieved by a small AC(0) circuit; and (2) for some choice of the underlying combinatorial designs, the output distribution of Nisan's pseudorandom generator against AC(0) circuits of depth d cannot be sampled by small AC(0) circuits of depth less than d.", "paper_title": "BOUNDED-DEPTH CIRCUITS CANNOT SAMPLE GOOD CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000305119200003"}
