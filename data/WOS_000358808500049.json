Firstly, a definition for the fuzzy systems to be D stable is given from the viewpoint of Lyapunov functions. Then a new sufficient condition is proposed to guarantee all the poles of the fuzzy systems located within a prescribed LMI region by using the fuzzy Lyapunov functions method and introducing some free matrices. And then the controller design approach is given by solving a set of LMIs. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
