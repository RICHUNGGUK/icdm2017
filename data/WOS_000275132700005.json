Searching for content in unstructured P2P networks is a challenging task because the distribution of objects has no association with the organization of peers. Proposed methods in recent years either depend too Much on objects replication rate or suffer from a sharp decline in performance when objects stored in peers change rapidly, although their performance is better than flooding or random walk algorithms to some extent. In this paper, we propose a novel query routing mechanism for improving query performance in unstructured P2P networks. We design a data Structure called traceable gain matrix (TGM) that records every query's gain at each peer along the query hit path, and allows for optimizing query routing decision effectively. Experimental results show that our query routing mechanism achieves relatively high query hit rate with low bandwidth consumption in different types of network topologies under static and dynamic network conditions.
