In the present article a modification of the question of expressive completeness is considered-the question of whether there exists a basis consisting of a finite number of modal-logical connectives for monadic second-order logic. The notion of k-dimensional basis that Gabbay (1981, Aspects of Philosophical Logic, 91-117) defined relative to FO is generalized to arbitrary abstract logics, and it is shown that a finite 2-dimensional basis exists for MSO on the class of all finite linear structures. Beauquier and Rabinovich (2002, J. Logic. Comput., 12, 243-253) have proven that there is no finite 1-dimensional basis for MSO on . Thus, the result yielding a 2-dimensional basis cannot be improved.", "paper_title": "On the existence of a modal-logical basis for monadic second-order logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000314123100007"}
