The idea of using intelligent products to ensure an information continuum all along the product life cycle is more and more shared today. However, it is not that easy to identify the information that must be linked to the product. As a result, this paper proposes an information dissemination process for selecting information sensitive to the context of use of the product. This information is then stored on the products themselves using a new type of augmented material, referred to as \"communicating material\".", "paper_title": "Embedding data on \"communicating materials\" from context-sensitive information analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000341501800017"}
