After combining the analysis of the data generated from neuronal network model and that evoked by acupuncture, it is found that features of neuronal chaotic rate time series induced by periodic stimuli can be characterized by complex network approach. The features of signals evoked by MA 'nb' 'nx' (twisting) and MA 'tb' 'tx' (lifting and thrusting) are shown to be different according to the topologies of the mapped networks. This study provides us a new perspective on the analysis of acupuncture and may give potential helps on clinical treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
