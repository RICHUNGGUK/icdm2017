The theoretical background for the specification of content requirements is based on action and activity theory. The framework enables the division of complex activities into smaller functional units in order to analyse the information needs of user groups with different types of functional limitations. The approach provides results in the form of information elements and attributes which can be easily translated into a machine-readable language.", "paper_title": "Development of a mobile tourist information system for people with functional limitations: User behaviour concept and specification of content requirements", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000046"}
