The recently developed interior tomography methods have produced encouraging results. A particular scenario for theoretically exact interior reconstruction from truncated projections is that there is a known subregion in the region of interest (ROI). In this paper, we improve a novel continuous singular value decomposition (SVD) method for interior reconstruction assuming a known subregion. First, two sets of orthogonal eigen-functions are calculated for the Hilbert and image spaces respectively. Then, after the interior Hilbert data are calculated from projection data through the ROI, they are projected onto the eigen-functions in the Hilbert space, and an interior image is recovered by a linear combination of the eigen-functions with the resulting coefficients. Finally, the interior image is compensated for the ambiguity due to the null space utilizing the prior subregion knowledge. Experiments with simulated and real data demonstrate the advantages of our approach relative to the projection onto convex set type interior reconstructions.", "paper_title": "Interior Tomography With Continuous Singular Value Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000313689400010"}
