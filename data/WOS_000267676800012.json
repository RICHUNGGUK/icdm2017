First, we present some new lemmas and dominance properties for this NP-hard problem, and then a memetic algorithm using these properties is developed. We compare the solutions of the memetic algorithm with optimal solutions obtained from complete enumeration. The results show that the average percentage error of the proposed algorithm from optimal solutions is about 2% and as the variance of processing time increase, the percentage errors decrease.
