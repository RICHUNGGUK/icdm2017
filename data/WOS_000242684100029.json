For further enhancement of noisy speech in the DCT domain, we consider multiple statistical distributions (i.e., Gaussian, Laplacian and Gamma) as a set of candidates to model the noise and speech. We first use the goodness-of-fit (GOF) test in order to measure how far the assumed model deviate from the actual distribution for each DCT component of noisy speech. Our evaluations illustrate that the best candidate is assigned to each frequency bin depending on the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) and the Power Spectral Flatness Measure (PSFM). In particular, since the PSFM exhibits a strong relation with the best statistical fit we employ a simple recursive estimation of the PSFM in the model selection. The proposed speech enhancement algorithm employs a soft estimate of the speech absence probability (SAP) separately for each frequency bin according to the selected distribution. Both objective and subjective tests are performed for the evaluation of the proposed algorithms on a large speech database, for various SNR values and types of background noise. Our evaluations show that the proposed soft decision scheme based on multiple statistical modeling or the PSFM provides further speech quality enhancement compared with recent methods through a number of subjective and objective tests.
