In order to design efficient scheduling algorithms for such workloads, it is required to have a good in-depth knowledge of basic random scheduling strategies. This paper analyzes the distribution of sequential jobs and the system behavior in heterogeneous computational grid environments where the brokering is done in such a way that each computing element has a probability to be chosen proportional to its number of CPUs and (new from the previous paper) its relative speed. We provide the asymptotic behavior for several metrics (queue sizes, slowdowns, etc.) or, in some cases, an approximation of this behavior. We study these metrics for a variety of workload configurations (load, distribution, etc.). We compare our probabilistic analysis to simulations in order to validate our results. These results provide a good understanding of the system behavior for each metric proposed. This will enable us to design advanced and efficient algorithms for more complex cases.", "paper_title": "On the distribution of sequential jobs in random brokering for heterogeneous computational grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000234122000003"}
