This mainly includes optimal combination of different color components from the original color space. Recently proposed discriminate color space (DCS) is theoretically optimal for classification, in which one seeks a set of optimal coefficients in terms of linear combination's of the R, G and B components (based on a discriminate criterion). This work proposes an innovative block-wise DCS (BWDCS) method, which allows each block of the image to be in a distinct DCS. This is an interesting alternative to the methods relying on converting whole image to DCS. This idea is evaluated with four appearance-based subspace state-of-the-art methods on five different publicly available databases including the well-known FERET and FRGC databases. Experimental results Show that the performance of these four gray-scale based methods can be improved by 17% on average when they are used with the proposed color space.
