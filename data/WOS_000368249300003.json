To construct the Kriging model accurately and efficiently in the region of significance, a local sampling method with variable radius (LSVR) is proposed. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In LSVR, the sequential sampling points are mainly selected within the local region around the current design point. The size of the local region is adaptively defined according to the target reliability and the nonlinearity of the probabilistic constraint. Every probabilistic constraint has its own local region instead of all constraints sharing one local region. In the local sampling region, the points located on the constraint boundary and the points with high uncertainty are considered simultaneously. Findings - The computational capability of the proposed method is demonstrated using two mathematical problems, a reducer design and a box girder design of a super heavy machine tool. The comparison results show that the proposed method is very efficient and accurate. Originality/value - The main contribution of this paper lies in: a new local sampling region computational criterion is proposed for Kriging. The originality of this paper is using expected feasible function (EFF) criterion and the shortest distance to the existing sample points instead of the other types of sequential sampling criterion to deal with the low efficiency problem.", "paper_title": "A local sampling method with variable radius for RBDO using Kriging", "paper_id": "WOS:000368249300003"}
