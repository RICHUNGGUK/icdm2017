First, we introduce a general algorithmic framework for a class of covering problems with submodular penalties, extending the recent result of Geunes et al. (Math Program 130:85-106, 2011) with linear penalties. This framework leverages existing approximation results for the original covering problems to obtain corresponding results for their counterparts with submodular penalties. Specifically, any LP-based -approximation for the original covering problem can be leveraged to obtain an -approximation algorithm for the counterpart with submodular penalties. Consequently, any LP-based approximation algorithm for the classical FLP (as a covering problem) can yield, via this framework, an approximation algorithm for the counterpart with submodular penalties. Second, by exploiting some special properties of submodular/linear penalty function, we present an LP rounding algorithm which has the currently best -approximation ratio over the previously best by Li et al. (Theoret Comput Sci 476:109-117, 2013) for the FLPSP and another LP-rounding algorithm which has the currently best -approximation ratio over the previously best by Xu and Xu (J Comb Optim 17:424-436, 2008) for the FLPLP, respectively.", "paper_title": "Improved Approximation Algorithms for the Facility Location Problems with Linear/Submodular Penalties", "paper_id": "WOS:000360668100010"}
