This paper tries to provide an alternative for bankruptcy prediction by using neuro, fuzzy, a hybrid approach combining the functionality of fuzzy logic and the learning ability of neural networks. The empirical results show that neuro fuzzy demonstrates a better accuracy rate, lower misclassification cost and higher detecting power than does logit regression, meaning neuro fuzzy could be a great help in providing warnings of impending bankruptcy. Also, its comprehensive explanation about mapping functions among variables presumably provides a foundation for further development of theory and testing of the membership function shape, the transfer function, the methods to aggregate, the methods to defuzzify, and so on.
