The relaxed strain energy function is reformulated using the interior-point method. This formulation is proven to be quasi-convex with respect to the deformation gradient. A set of governing equations for the membrane is developed in the standard finite element format. The solution to this set of equations is obtained using the interior-point method, and several numerical examples are presented for validation. The proposed method is shown to converge and to be robust and efficient. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
