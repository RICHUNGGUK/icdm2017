This study makes two contributions. First, two extensions are given based on the results in Fang et al., where the max-min or max-product fuzzy relational equation constraint is considered. Second, a procedure for solving optimization problems with the max-Archimedean t-norm, fuzzy relational equation constraint is provided. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the procedure.
