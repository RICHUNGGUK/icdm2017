The querying time significantly increases the packet delay even if some methods have been proposed to shorten the table size. In mesh-based NoC, statistics shows that two neighbor routers have the same routing options for over 50% packets, on average. In this paper, we propose a technique to let packets pass through some routers without querying the routing table. Consequently, the time to query the routing table is significantly decreased. Simulation results show that this leads up to 16% decrease of average packet delay.", "paper_title": "RQRT: REDUCE QUERYING ROUTING TABLE FOR MESH-BASED NETWORK-ON-CHIP", "paper_id": "WOS:000299250500005"}
