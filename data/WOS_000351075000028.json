In fact, the functioning of a port is made possible due to the interaction of a certain number of subsystems, which in turn depend on other subsystems. The goal of this paper is to model and simulate, by adopting the System Dynamics methodology, a subsystem of the port context: the rail port cycle. The model has been applied to some important container terminals located in Italy. \"What-if\" scenarios have been tested with the objective of underlining system bottlenecks.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Simulation of the Rail Port Cycle", "paper_id": "WOS:000351075000028"}
