Given the difficulty of formulating a bilevel decision problem by mathematical functions, a rule sets-based bilevel decision (RSBLD) model was proposed. This article presents an algorithm to solve a RSBLD problem. A case-based example is given to illustrate the functions of the proposed algorithm. Finally, a set of experiments is analyzed to further show the functions and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "AN ALGORITHM FOR SOLVING RULE SETS-BASED BILEVEL DECISION PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000290267600004"}
