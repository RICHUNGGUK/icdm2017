It yields several drawbacks: only offering the partial traffic information and yielding a low reliability because of using a centralised TIC. This paper thus proposes a fully distributed approach, namely the Distributed Wireless sensor network-based Adaptive least-travel-time Navigation approach (D-WAN). In D-WAN, the real-time traffic information is collected from diverse types of sensors equipped on vehicles and exchanged among neighbour vehicles, and then build a fully distributed and reliable navigation environment. Numerical results demonstrate D-WAN outperforms the compared approaches in travel time, exhausted gasoline, and traffic load balancing index while yielding competitive travel distance. The worst case running-time is analysed, which requires O(N . R) and O(M-2) time under the high-density and sparse vehicle environments, respectively.", "paper_title": "Distributed wireless sensing-based routing and adaptive least-travel-time navigation in VANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000315943300002"}
