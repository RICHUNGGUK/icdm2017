A rule in an adaptive star grammar is actually a rule schema which, via the so-called cloning operation, yields a potentially infinite number of concrete rules. Adaptive star grammars are motivated by application areas such as modeling and refactoring object-oriented programs. We prove that cloning can be applied lazily. Unrestricted adaptive star grammars are shown to be capable of generating every type-0 string language. However, we identify a reasonably large subclass for which the membership problem is decidable.", "paper_title": "Adaptive star grammars", "paper_id": "WOS:000241436800007"}
