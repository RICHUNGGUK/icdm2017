For this reason, several techniques have been proposed for ranking them. Each of these techniques has shown non-intuitive results in specific cases. Cheng employed \"distance method\" for ranking fuzzy numbers in Ref [3]. Then Chu and Tsao in [5] found another method. In this article, some problems of Cheng distance method is indicated and then a new revised method for ranking fuzzy numbers has been proposed which can avoid problem for ranking fuzzy numbers. The considerable priority of the proposed method is its simplicity and easiness in calculation with distance method. For showing the superiority of this method some numerical examples illustrated, recognizing its dominance over the deficiencies existing in other resembled ranking approaches.", "paper_title": "Proposing a revised method for ranking fuzzy numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000319616400011"}
