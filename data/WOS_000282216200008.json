Known as the partial randomized response based on probability matrix, or PRRPM, this method chooses different data transition strategies to find frequent 1-itemsets and k-itemsets (k > 1). The PRRPM algorithm is explored and its validity examined through theoretical analysis and experiments.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL PRIVACY-PRESERVING ASSOCIATION RULES MINING METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000282216200008"}
