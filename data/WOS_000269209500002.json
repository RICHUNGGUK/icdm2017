Our model considers the gain saturation effect and amplified spontaneous emission depletion in optical amplifiers, coherent crosstalk in optical switches, and four-wave mixing in transmission fibers. We apply our model to investigate the impact of different physical impairments on the performance of all-optical networks. The simulation results show the impact of each impairment on network performance in terms of blocking probability as a function of device parameters. We also apply the model as a metric for impairment-constraint routing in all-optical networks. We show that our proposed routing and wavelength assignment algorithm outperforms two common approaches.", "paper_title": "OSNR model to consider physical layer impairments in transparent optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000269209500002"}
