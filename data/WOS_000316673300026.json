A major challenge of this task arises from the fact that most indoor scenes are cluttered by furniture and decorations, whose appearances vary drastically across scenes, thus can hardly be modeled (or even hand-labeled) consistently. In this paper we tackle this problem by introducing latent variables to account for clutter, so that the observed image is jointly explained by the room and clutter layout. Model parameters are learned from a training set of images that are only labeled with the layout of the room geometry. Our approach enables taking into account and inferring indoor clutter without hand-labeling of the clutter in the training set, which is often inaccurate. Yet it outperforms the state-of-the-art method of Hedau et al.(7) that requires clutter labels. As a latent variable based method, our approach has an interesting feature that latent variables are used in direct correspondence with a concrete visual concept (clutter in the room) and thus interpretable.", "paper_title": "Discriminative Learning with Latent Variables for Cluttered Indoor Scene Understanding", "paper_id": "WOS:000316673300026"}
