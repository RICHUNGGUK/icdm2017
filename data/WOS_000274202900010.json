They provide us with additional degrees of freedom to represent the uncertainty and the fuzziness of the real world. In this paper, we present an interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS method to handle fuzzy multiple attributes group decision-making problems based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets. We also use some examples to illustrate the fuzzy multiple attributes group decision-making process of the proposed method. The proposed method provides us with a useful way to handle fuzzy multiple attributes group decision-making problems in a more flexible and more intelligent manner due to the fact that it uses interval type-2 sets rather than traditional type-1 fuzzy sets to represent the evaluating values and the weights of the attributes.
