Using these results we provide improved distributed name-independent routing schemes. Specifically, given a graph excluding a minor on r vertices and a parameter rho > 0 we obtain the following results: (1) a polynomial algorithm that constructs a set of clusters such that each cluster has a strong-diameter of O(r (2) rho) and each vertex belongs to 2 (O(r)) r! clusters; (2) a name-independent routing scheme with a stretch of O(r (2)), headers of O(log n+rlog r) bits, and tables of size 2 (O(r)) r! log (4) n/log log n bits; (3) a randomized algorithm that partitions the graph such that each cluster has strong-diameter O(r6 (r) rho) and the probability an edge (u,v) is cut is O(r d(u,v)/rho).", "paper_title": "Strong-Diameter Decompositions of Minor Free Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000281684900003"}
