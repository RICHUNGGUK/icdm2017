The motivation for utilizing supervised learning in the form of a Bayesian classifier is to reduce the overhead of the PM which has to repetitively determine and assign voltage-frequency settings for each processor core in the system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed supervised learning based power management technique ensures system-wide energy savings under rapidly and widely varying workloads.", "paper_title": "Supervised Learning Based Power Management for Multicore Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000283145400008"}
