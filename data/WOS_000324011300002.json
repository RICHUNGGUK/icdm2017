Interpretation is usually relegated to a second stage, after model estimation, where its parameters and related quantities are scrutinized for relevant information regarding the process and phenomena under analysis. Network-Induced Supervised Learning (NI-SL) is a recently proposed framework that balances the goals of prediction accuracy and interpretation 111, by adopting a modelling formalism that matches more closely the dependency structure of variables in current complex systems. This framework computes interpretable features that are incorporated in the final model, which effectively constrain the predictive space to be used. However, this restriction does not compromise prediction ability, which quite often is enhanced. Both classification and regression problems can be handled. Four widely different real world datasets were used to illustrate the main features claimed for the NI-SL framework. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
