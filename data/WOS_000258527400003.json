Strictly related to the appearance of the ellipsoid is the stereokinetic phenomenon of the tilted bar, elicited by a line segment of constant length rotating at uniform speed in the frontal plane. We present a mathematical model of these phenomena, based on an assumption of minimization by the Visual System of the differences between the lengths of the velocity vectors of the stimulus (minimum relative motion assumption): the \"rigidity hypothesis\" is able to explain the appearance of the tilted disk but not the appearance of the ellipsoid and of the tilted bar. The theoretical results obtained by our modelling are in good agreement with the experimental observations.", "paper_title": "Modelling stereokinetic phenomena by a minimum relative motion assumption: the tilted disk, the ellipsoid and the tilted bar", "paper_id": "WOS:000258527400003"}
