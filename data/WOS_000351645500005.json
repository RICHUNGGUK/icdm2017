MTPs are widely adopted in manufacturing industry for fabricating rotary workpieces. In this paper, a generic framework for three-dimensional variation propagation modeling for MTPs of rotary workpieces based on differential motion vectors (DMVs) is developed. The explicit three-dimensional datum error and fixture error expressions are derived. By a series of homogeneous transformations of different error sources, a three-dimensional variation propagation model for MTPs is built, in which the datum error, fixture error and so on are described and transmitted in six degrees of freedom. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by an example of MTPs of valve shell. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
