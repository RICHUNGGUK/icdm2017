As such, Concept-Oriented Design (COD) was created as a theory of software development for both natural and executable design and development. Instantiated in the toolkit Chasm, Chasm is a natural, tiered, executable User Interface Description Language (UIDL) for 3DUIs resulting in improved understandability, as well as reduced complexity and reuse. Chasm's utility is shown through evaluations by domain experts, case studies of long-term use, and an analysis of spaces.", "paper_title": "A Natural, Tiered and Executable UIDL for 3D User Interfaces Based on Concept-Oriented Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000272721600006"}
