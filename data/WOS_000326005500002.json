They enable robots to acquire richer functionalities and open the way for the composition of a variety of robotic services with three functions: semantic perception, reasoning and actuation. Ubiquitous robots (ubirobots) overcome the limitations of stand-alone robots by integrating them with web services and ambient intelligence technologies. The overlap that exists now between ubirobots and ambient intelligence makes their integration worthwhile. It targets to create a hybrid physical digital space rich with a myriad of proactive intelligent services that enhance the quality and the way of our living and working. Furthermore, the emergence of cloud computing initiates the massive use of a new generation of ubirobots that enrich their cognitive capabilities and share their knowledge by connecting themselves to cloud infrastructures. The future of ubirobots will certainly be open to an unlimited space of applications such as physical and virtual companions assisting people in their daily living, ubirobots that are able to co-work alongside people and cooperate with them in the same environment, and physical and virtual autonomic guards that are able to protect people, monitor their security and safety, and rescue them in indoor and outdoor spaces. This paper introduces the recent challenges and future trends on these topics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
