In this paper, we develop a new framework based on directional local sequency analysis and a filter bank structure. We decompose a halftone image into subband images, from which we can easily reconstruct the original halftone. Based on these subband images, we define the directional sequency spectrum which is analogous to the two-dimensional Fourier spectrum, and formulate several texture measures. Two test image sets are used to justify these measures.", "paper_title": "A new framework for characterization of halftone textures", "paper_id": "WOS:000236807100022"}
