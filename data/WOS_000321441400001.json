Moment based methods have demonstrated advantages such as reduced computational effort especially for applications that couple population balance (PB) simulation with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The methods, however, suffers from two main drawbacks: the inability to yield the number density directly and limitation to system models that only consider size independent growth expression and certain breakage and aggregation kernels. This article presents an extension to the standard MOM (SMOM), the extended method of moment (EMOM), which not only allows the prediction of the number density directly in most cases, but also makes it applicable to systems with size dependent growth and any particle aggregation and breakage kernels. The method is illustrated and tested by reference to case studies that were well studied systems in the literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
