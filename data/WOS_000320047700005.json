There is currently a strong trend for decision-making applications such as Data Warehousing (DW) and Business Intelligence (BI) to move onto the Web, especially in the cloud. Integrating data into DW/BI applications is a critical and time-consuming task. To make better decisions in DW/BI applications, next generation data integration poses new requirements to data integration systems, over those posed by traditional data integration. In this paper, we propose a generic, metadata-based, service-oriented, and event-driven approach for integrating Web data timely and autonomously. Beside handling data heterogeneity, distribution and interoperability, our approach satisfies near real-time requirements and realize active data integration. For this sake, we design and develop a framework that utilizes Web standards (e.g., XML and Web services) for tackling data heterogeneity, distribution and interoperability issues. Moreover, our framework utilizes Active XML (AXML) to warehouse passive data as well as services to integrate active and dynamic data on-the-fly. AXML embedded services and changes detection services ensure near real-time data integration. Furthermore, the idea of integrating Web data actively and autonomously revolves around mining events logged by the data integration environment. Therefore, we propose an incremental XML-based algorithm for mining association rules from logged events. Then, we define active rules dynamically upon mined data to automate and reactivate integration tasks. Finally, as a proof of concept, we implement a framework prototype as a Web application using open-source tools.", "paper_title": "Active XML-based Web data integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000320047700005"}
