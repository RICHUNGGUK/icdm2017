However, not all of the generated rules are interesting, and some unapparent rules may be ignored. We have introduced an \"extracted probability\" measure in this article. Using this measure, 3 models are presented to modify the confidence of rules. An efficient method based on the support-confidence framework is then developed to generate rules of interest. The adult dataset from the UCl machine learning repository and a database of occupational accidents are analyzed in this article. The analysis reveals that the proposed methods can effectively generate interesting rules from a variety of association rules. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
