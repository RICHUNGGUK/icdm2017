Let sigma and rho be two sets of non-negative integers. A vertex subset S subset of V of an undirected graph G = (V, E) is called a (sigma, rho)-dominating set of G if |N(v) boolean AND S| is an element of sigma for all v is an element of S and |N(v) boolean AND S| is an element of rho for all v is an element of V \\ S. In this paper, we prove that decision, optimization, and counting variants of ({p}, {q})-domination are solvable in time 2(|V|/2), |V|(0(1)). We also show how to extend these results for infinite sigma = {p + M . l: l is an element of N(0)} and rho = {q + m . l: l is an element of N(0)}. For the case |sigma| + |rho| = 3, these problems can be solved in time 3(|V|/2). |V|(0(1)), and similarly to the case |sigma| = |rho| = 1 it is possible to extend the algorithm for some infinite sets.
