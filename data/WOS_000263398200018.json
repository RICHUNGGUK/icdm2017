Finding which sensor or data complies with criteria such as specific times, locations, and scales has become a bottleneck for Sensor Web-based applications, especially remote-sensing observations. In this paper, an architecture for use of the integration Sensor Observation Service (SOS) with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Catalogue Service-Web profile (CSW) is put forward. The architecture consists of a distributed geospatial sensor observation service, a geospatial catalogue service based on the ebXML Registry Information Model (ebRIM), SOS search and registry middleware, and a geospatial sensor portal. The SOS search and registry middleware finds the potential SOS, generating data granule information and inserting the records into CSW. The contents and sequence of the services, the available observations, and the metadata of the observations registry are described. A prototype system is designed and implemented using the service middleware technology and a standard interface and protocol. The feasibility and the response time of registry and retrieval of observations are evaluated using a realistic Earth Observing-1 (EO-I) SOS scenario. Extracting information from SOS requires the same execution time as record generation for CSW. The average data retrieval response time in SOS+CSW mode is 17.6% of that of the SOS-alone mode. The proposed architecture has the more advantages of SOS search and observation data retrieval than the existing sensor Web enabled systems.
