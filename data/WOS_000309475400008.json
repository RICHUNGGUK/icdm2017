On the one hand, the grid-based methods generate high-quality hexahedra in the inner part of the domain using an inside-outside approach. On the other hand, advancing front methods generate high-quality hexahedra near the boundary using an outside-inside approach. To combine the advantages of both methodologies, we extend the receding front method: an inside-outside mesh generation approach by means of a reversed advancing front. We apply this approach to generate unstructured hexahedral meshes of exterior domains. To reproduce the shape of the boundaries, we first pre-compute the mesh fronts by combining two solutions of the Eikonal equation on a tetrahedral reference mesh. Then, to generate high-quality elements, we expand the quadrilateral surface mesh of the inner body towards the unmeshed external boundary using the pre-computed fronts as a guide.", "paper_title": "The receding front method applied to hexahedral mesh generation of exterior domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000309475400008"}
