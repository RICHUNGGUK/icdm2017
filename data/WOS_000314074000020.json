For these objectives we analysed the spatio-temporal patterns produced by wildfire incidences in Catalonia, located in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula. The methodology used has allowed us to quantify and assess possible spatial relationships between the distribution of risk of ignition and causes. These results may be useful in fire management decision-making and planning. The methods shown in this paper may contribute to the prevention and management of wildfires, which are not random in space or time, as we have shown here. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
