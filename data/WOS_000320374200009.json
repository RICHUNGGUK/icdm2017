The NNAs are classified using two characteristic chemical properties based on different regions of the molecules. A table of periodic properties of inhibitors of DU-145 human prostate carcinoma cell line is obtained based on structural features from the amine moiety and from the oxadiazole ring. Inhibitors in the same group and period of the periodic table are predicted to have highly similar properties, and those located only in the same group will present moderate similarity. The results of a virtual screening campaign are presented.", "paper_title": "Information Theoretic Entropy for Molecular Classification: Oxadiazolamines as Potential Therapeutic Agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000320374200009"}
