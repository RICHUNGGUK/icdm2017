The (n, k, d, m) secure regenerating code is based on an (n, k, d) minimum bandwidth regenerating (MBR) code, which was proposed by Rashmi, Shah and Kumar as optimal exact-regenerating codes, for all values of the parameters (n, k, d). The (n, k, d, m) secure regenerating codes have the security as a secret sharing scheme such that even if an eavesdropper knows either data stored in at most m storage nodes or downloaded data for repairing at most in failed nodes, no information about data leaks to the eavesdropper.", "paper_title": "Secure Regenerating Codes Based on Rashmi-Shah-Kumar MBR Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000315244800028"}
