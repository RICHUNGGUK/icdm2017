These different sets of features have been used as sample descriptors to relate the images to an 11 grade skin quality measure using multivariate statistical projection models. These methodologies are employed in a colour-texture integrating scheme, in order to combine both spectral and spatial types of information. The results obtained have been used to compare the methodologies and to confirm the usefulness of MIA for prediction purposes. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
