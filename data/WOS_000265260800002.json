However the way of modeling the regulation of calcium fans (Ca(2+)) has not been established yet. Therefore, we try to construct a physiologically plausible pyramidal cell model of the primary visual cortex which contains many regulating systems of the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration [Ca(2+)]. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of the nonlinear dynamical system theory such as global bifurcation and slow/fast decomposition analyses for a construction of the neuron Model.", "paper_title": "BIFURCATION-BASED MODEL CONSTRUCTION OF A PYRAMIDAL CELL OF THE PRIMARY VISUAL CORTEX", "paper_id": "WOS:000265260800002"}
