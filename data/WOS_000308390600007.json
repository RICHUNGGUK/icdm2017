We show it is insecure against partition attacks, whereby the adversary can guess the correct password off-line. Thereafter we propose an enhanced protocol that can resist the attack described and yet is quite efficient. Furthermore, we prove its security in a widely accepted model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
