A number of technologies are examined, that can be used in the movement of urban freight by rail and look at case studies which have adopted this very methodology to deliver urban freight. More specifically the model developed is used to analyse the current situation, evaluate alternatives and maximise utilisation of the proposed rail system. The information obtained is put to use by designing a freight system for the city of Newcastle upon Tyne, at the very core of which will utilise rail infrastructure. This system aims to be market competitive and to restore faith in transporting urban freight by rail. By doing so, we hope that our results achieve a significant level of usefulness and practicality so that they could be considered when designing future urban freight systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
