An efficient Metropolis-Hasting (MH) particle filter algorithm was proposed to process the signal for ensures the monotonic increasing relationship between RSSI value and the distance between nodes. The coordinate space quantised with RSSI value was selected to describe the state and position of robots to avoid model error. The navigation system consists of several beacon nodes, and each of them is a distributed measurement and control unites. The outputs from every beacon nodes are collected by the navigation control centre, and the final outputs for mobile robots are calculated based on data fusion. Therefore, the real-time performance of this navigation system is enhanced. Furthermore, this system could adapt dynamic or unknown scenarios due to the coordinate of beacon node is not required before navigation. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of this navigation algorithm.", "paper_title": "Navigation algorithm for WSN mobile node on MH particle filtering improvement", "paper_id": "WOS:000325149500003"}
