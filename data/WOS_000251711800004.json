The effect of random phase for these systems is examined. The interested system demonstrates unstable periodic attractors when the intensity of random noise equals zero, and we show that the unstable dynamical behavior will be stabilized as the intensity of random noise properly increases. The phase plot and the time evolution are carried out to confirm the obtained results of Poincare map analysis and top Lyapunov exponent on the dynamical behavior of stability. Excellent agreement is found between these results.", "paper_title": "The control of stochastic complex damped nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000251711800004"}
