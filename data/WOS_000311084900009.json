In the proposed method, wavelet packet transform is applied on the input data to produce approximation and detail sub-bands of the input data and the output is used as the input vector of the proposed network. This network uses a hierarchical structure same as wavelet packet decomposition tree, in which adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system is used as sub-model. Also, gradient descent algorithm is chosen for training the parameters of antecedent and conclusion parts of the sub-models. In order to evaluate the capability of the proposed method, its applications in pattern classification, system identification and time-series prediction have been studied. The results show that the proposed method performs better than the other conventional models.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical wavelet packet fuzzy inference system for pattern classification and system identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000311084900009"}
