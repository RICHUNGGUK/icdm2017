We demonstrate that such irregularities and aberrations, when properly applied, can improve the quality and usability of light field cameras. Examples include spherical aberrations for the mainlens, and misaligned sampling patterns for the microlens and photosensor elements. These observations are a natural consequence of a key difference between conventional and light field cameras: optimizing for a single captured 2D image versus a range of reprojected 2D images from a captured 4D light field. We propose designs in mainlens aberrations and microlens/photosensor sample patterns, and evaluate them through simulated measurements and captured results with our hardware prototype.", "paper_title": "Improving Light Field Camera Sample Design with Irregularity and Aberration", "paper_id": "WOS:000358786600118"}
