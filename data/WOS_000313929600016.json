Behind robot path discretization is the ability to have a robot adjusting the traversed paths so that the contact between robot tool and work-piece is properly maintained. In addition, a hybrid force/motion control system based on Fuzzy-PI control is proposed to adjust robot paths with external sensory feedback. All these capabilities allow to facilitate the robot programming process and to increase the robot's autonomy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
