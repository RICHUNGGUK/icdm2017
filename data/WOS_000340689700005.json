In this paper several capital allocation principles are examined to demonstrate how such principles can be used to distribute aggregated capital across the various constituents that generate operational risk. Proportional allocation, for example, allows a cost per unit to be calculated. An application to fraud risk in the banking sector is presented and correlation scenarios between business lines are compared. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
