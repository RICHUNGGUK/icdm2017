Since it measures the alterations of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal in the presence of paramagnetic molecules, a customized program is usually needed in FC-DNP experiments to extract spectral information from the acquired NMR signals. While this program can be designed to calculate the spectrum after all the NMR signals are collected, the batch-processing mode inevitably causes delay and is not convenient for in vivo applications. In this paper, we report the development of a real-time DNP spectrum calculation and visualization program, called RT-DNP, for FC-DNP experiments. A dynamic data exchange (DDE) client was implemented to enable real-time receipt of the system information and the NMR signals from a commercial NMR console. The received NMR signals and experimental parameters were then used to calculate the DNP spectrum during the data acquisition. The real-time DNP spectrum calculation and visualization program was tested in experiments. A seamless integration of the program into a commercial NMR console has been achieved.
