However, the current BR-based methods still lack efficient multicast management and suffer from a long join latency, leading to a disappointing mobility performance. In this paper, we propose a novel BR-based multicast architecture with a corresponding multicast routing protocol supporting multicast receiver mobility. In the proposed multicast architecture, a new management entity called multicast controller (MC) is used to handle most of the multicast management-related tasks, while other routers in the network construct a multicast tree according to the proposed Branching-Router-based Multicast routing protocol with Mobility support (BRMM). Besides, the fast handover of multicast service can be supported by BRMM through the pre-establishment of temporary multicast paths. Through extensive simulation and analysis, we show that BRMM outperforms existing protocols and has many other attractive features.", "paper_title": "Novel Branching-Router-Based Multicast Routing Protocol with Mobility Support", "paper_id": "WOS:000323503500014"}
