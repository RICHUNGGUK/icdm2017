To facilitate this evaluation, we have developed a vehicle routing algorithm that considers the existence of access time windows and adapts tours to this restriction in the best possible manner. The procedure is based on a genetic algorithm, which we calibrate by analyzing several experiments in a test network. We then apply the algorithm to a real case study in the city of Seville, where local authorities are considering increases in the duration of the time window restriction and the size of the restricted area.
