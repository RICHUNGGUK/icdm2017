It is hard and time consuming to render these effects with scattering, caustic, and shaft because of the complex interaction between light and different media. This paper presents a new rendering method based on adaptive lattice for lighting participating media of translucent materials such as marble, wax, and shaft light. Firstly, on the basis of the lattice-based photon tracing model, multi-scale hierarchical lattice was constructed by mixed lattice types sampling combined cubic Cartesian and face-centered cubic with view-dependent adaptive resolution. Then, an adaptive method to trace diffuse photons and marked specular photons with different phase functions was suggested. Multiple lights and heterogeneous materials were also considered here. Further, the mixed rendering method and GPU accelerate technology were introduced to render different light effects under different participating media.
