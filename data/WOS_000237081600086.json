Recent initiatives such as Google Earth are likely to encourage other companies or state agencies to publish their (satellite) data over the Internet. To fulfill this demand, we need at minimum an efficient geographic integration system. The goal of this demonstration is to show some new and enhanced features of the VirCIS geographic mediation system.", "paper_title": "Querying mediated geographic data sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000237081600086"}
