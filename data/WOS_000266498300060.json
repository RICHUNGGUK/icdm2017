Several algorithms have been used to date in the identification of these kinds of gene organization. Here, we present a web tool called CROC that aims to help in the identification and analysis of genomic gene clusters. This method has been successfully used before in the identification of chromosomal clusters in different eukaryotic species.", "paper_title": "CROC: finding chromosomal clusters in eukaryotic genomes", "paper_id": "WOS:000266498300060"}
