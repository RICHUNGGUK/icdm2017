To meet this demand, there has been much research and many practical developments for providing multimedia services. A push-to-talk (PTT) service is one of the multimedia streaming services that have been deployed not only over IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) but also in peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networks. The benefit of PTT has been demonstrated in the literature. However, the need for using PTT service in communication can be arbitrary among users, regardless what kind of PTT services they use. This demand does not support current PTT systems, so an expansion of PTT services still be limited. Moreover, the combination of PTT services in IMS and P2P networks will help operators to provide more scalable PTT services. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a model to support PTT service interworking between IMS and P2P overlay networks. We also introduced our system design and some interworking service scenarios. We confirmed our architecture through implementation and testing.", "paper_title": "PTT Service Interworking Between IMS Based Networks and P2P Overlay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000322528700007"}
