Combination of a piecewise quadratic reconstruction and a flux corrected remapping approach provides a simple, symmetry-preserving and bounds-preserving method. The positivity of density and specific internal energy is guaranteed. The complete description of the method and both cyclic remapping and full hydrodynamic 2D numerical examples are given.
