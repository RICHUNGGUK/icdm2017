The sensor is just as useful in water as it would be on Mars for material identification. A successful terrestrial application of the sensor will lead to many new applications of the device and possible technology transfer to the private sector.", "paper_title": "Dynamic contaminant identification in water", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300053"}
