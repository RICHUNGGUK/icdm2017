The system design is based on a mobile agent, collecting and distributing information, during a random walk. Three possible settings for modeling the location of the mobile nodes ( processors) in the ad hoc network are presented: slow location change, complete random change, and neighbors with probability. The group membership algorithm is based on a mobile agent collecting and distributing information. The new techniques support group membership and multicast, and also support resource allocation.", "paper_title": "Random walk for self-stabilizing group communication in ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237543900010"}
