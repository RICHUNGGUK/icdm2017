Blocking of LOS may significantly affect the quality of service of on-going UWB communications. Based on the Angular Power Spectrum Density and the human blocking models, we build a packet-level UWB channel model considering the shadowing processes based on a Finite-state Markov Chain. The model is simple enough to be incorporated into existing network simulators like NS-2 and it can be used to facilitate protocol design and quality of service analysis for UWB based wireless personal area networks.", "paper_title": "A markov model for indoor ultra-wideband channel with people shadowing", "paper_id": "WOS:000256912500013"}
