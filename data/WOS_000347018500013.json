Apart from mapping texture to desired positions with low distortions, which has been considered by existing works, few work considered the intuitive need to distribute distortions according to the texture contents. In this work, we present a texture mapping method guided by importance map to preserve the shape of the prominent content. We formulate it as an importance-value-weighted parameterization. The mapping distortions are measured by LSCM+ energy, which is capable of decreasing the appearance of shrunken and fold-over triangles as well as shape preservation; and the weights are efficiently calculated by transforming the area integral into a line integral. To solve the parameterization, we employ the 'L-M' (Levenberg-Marquardt) method and alternately update the weights and the coordinates since they are dependent on each other. Finally, we show some examples to demonstrate the content-aware effect by comparison to traditional parameterization. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
