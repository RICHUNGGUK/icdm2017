To mask faulty sensors, the K-coverage configuration is widely exploited to ensure that each location is covered by at least K sensors. However, increasing K effectively reduces detection misses but incurs high false alarm rate. Little work evaluates the K-coverage configuration in terms of explicit metrics. In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant model, which determines the value of K according to a desired QoSu while maximizing the system lifetime. Experimental results show that (1) the K-coverage configuration is insufficient to meet the QoSu without adopting any fusion scheme, and (2) the derived configuration minimizes power consumption while meeting the QoSu.", "paper_title": "Determination of K-Coverage Configuration for Meeting Desired Quality of Surveillance on WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000291504300010"}
