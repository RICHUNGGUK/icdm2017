Only by simply choosing proper coefficients in constructions and optimal known sequences, two constructions transform the chosen sequences into optimally required ones with two or four times periods as long as the original sequences', respectively. These two constructions result in binary and quaternary sequences with optimal autocorrelation values (OAVs), perfect QPSK+ sequences, and multilevel perfect sequences, depending on choices of the known sequences employed. In addition, Construction 2 is a generalization of Construction B in [5] so that the number of distinct sequences from the former is larger than the one from the latter.", "paper_title": "Several Types of Sequences with Optimal Autocorrelation Properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000314080500048"}
