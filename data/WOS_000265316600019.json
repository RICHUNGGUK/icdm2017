In this paper, we classify the video frames by the average frame size and estimate the bit loss for each class when the bitrate exceeds the capacity of the bottleneck link. The video stream under study is encoded using the explicit slice-based H.264/AVC encoding scheme. This scheme reduces the burstiness of regular H.264/AVC encoded video by removing the traditional GOP structure. Instead, a repetitive combination of intracoded and predicted slices is employed, thereby introducing a specific dependence structure in the video data. We consider a bufferless model of the communication system and evaluate the channel capacity required to give a maximum allowed loss rate for each class. Due to the high variability, non-stationarity and non-homogeneity of the underlying video data, the obtained classes are checked regarding the dependence and distribution structure of the data. The high quantiles of the losses are estimated for each class. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
