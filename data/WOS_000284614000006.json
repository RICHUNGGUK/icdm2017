In this methodology, the generalized ordered weighted averaging (GOWA) operator is extended to develop the Atanassov's IF set (IFS) generalized ordered weighted averaging (IFSGOWA) operator, which can aggregate vague or imprecise information expressed with the Atanassov's IFSs. The Atanassov's IFSGOWA operator based methodology is further developed to solve group decision making problems with Atanassov's IF preference relations. A real example of the agroecological region assessment problem is used to illustrate the implementation and applicability of the proposed methodology. It is also shown that the obtained decision results could be affected by the choice of the parameter lambda and the nature of the weights.", "paper_title": "GROUP DECISION MAKING METHODOLOGY BASED ON THE ATANASSOV'S INTUITIONISTIC FUZZY SET GENERALIZED OWA OPERATOR", "paper_id": "WOS:000284614000006"}
