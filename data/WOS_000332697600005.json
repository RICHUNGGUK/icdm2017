Results have been extended to different databases, regions, and perspectives. This paper explores how bibliometrics and text mining can inform Triple Helix analyses. It engages Competitive Technical Intelligence concepts and methods for studies of Newly Emerging Science & Technology (NEST) in support of technology management and policy. A semantic TRIZ approach is used to assess NEST innovation patterns by associating topics (using noun phrases to address subjects and objects) and actions (via verbs). We then classify these innovation patterns by the dominant categories of origination: Academy, Industry, or Government. We then use TRIZ tags and benchmarks to locate NEST progress using Technology Roadmapping. Triple Helix inferences can then be related to the visualized patterns. We demonstrate these analyses via a case study for dye-sensitized solar cells.", "paper_title": "Triple Helix innovation in China's dye-sensitized solar cell industry: hybrid methods with semantic TRIZ and technology roadmapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000332697600005"}
