The basic idea underpinning this family of multicast mechanisms is to encode the multicast routing information into a Bloom filter carried in the packet. Thus, the routers are relieved from maintaining per-group forwarding states and able to support multicasting with improved scalability, compared to traditional IP multicast. In this article, we first review the evolution path of multicast protocols to shed light on the impetus that had driven the multicasting technology forward. We then discuss several representative Bloom filter based multicast protocols, with revealing their core design issues. While multicast is normally considered the most efficient way for delivering multimedia services, how to fully leverage the advantages of Bloom filter based multicast protocols to facilitate multimedia delivery is still an open issue. In this regard, we present a design that exploits a Bloom-filter based multicast protocol to accelerate the channel zapping in an IPTV system. Moreover, we point out the open research issues hoping to promote new development in the field.", "paper_title": "Bloom Filter-Based Scalable Multicast: Methodology, Design and Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000328643600014"}
