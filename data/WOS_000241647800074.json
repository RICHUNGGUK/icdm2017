This simulation uses an individual, transaction-based voting mechanism to help the system estimate the importance of each variable at the system/aggregate level. Two variations of information gain - one using entropy and one using similarity - were used to demonstrate that the resulting estimates can be computed using a smaller subset of the data and greater accommodation for missing and erroneous data than traditional methods.", "paper_title": "Complex adaptive systems: Using a free-market simulation to estimate attribute relevance", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800074"}
