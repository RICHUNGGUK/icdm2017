In this comment, we correct several errors in the formulation of the models of Soni and Shah and modify some assumptions to increase the model's applicability. Numerical examples illustrate the benefits of our modifications.", "paper_title": "Ordering policy for stock-dependent demand rate under progressive payment scheme: a comment", "paper_id": "WOS:000346069500009"}
