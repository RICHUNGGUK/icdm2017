Suppose a Boolean function g : {0, 1}(n) -> {0,1} cannot be computed on more than 1 - delta fraction of inputs by any deterministic time T and space S algorithm, where delta <= 1/t for some t. Then, for t-step walks w = (v(1),..., v(t)) in some explicit d-regular expander graph on 2(n) vertices, the function g'(w) = g(v(1))... g(v(t)) cannot be computed on more than 1 - Omega(t delta) fraction of inputs by any deterministic time approximate to T/d(t) - poly(n) and space approximate to S - O(t). As an application, by iterating this construction, we get a deterministic linear-space \"worst-case to constant average-case\" hardness amplification reduction, as well as a family of logspace encodable/decodable error-correcting codes that can correct up to a constant fraction of errors. Logspace encodable/decodable codes (with linear-time encoding and decoding) were previously constructed by Spielman [14]. Ourcodes have weaker parameters (encoding length is polynomial, rather than linear), but have a conceptually simpler construction. The proof of our Direct Product Lemma is inspired by Dinur's remarkable recent proof of the PCP theorem by gap amplification using expanders [4].", "paper_title": "Hardness amplification via space-efficient direct products", "paper_id": "WOS:000236886100052"}
