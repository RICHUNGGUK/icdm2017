The way to reach software product quality is often structured approaches for software quality such as SPI and CMM which have been criticized for lack of a knowledge perspective. The view taken in this study is that software product quality is related to interpretations and understanding in practice, and thus on practical knowledge. Based on a qualitative study of practising software developers' understanding of the concept of quality and quality assessment, it is shown why quality resists definition and why expcrience-based, practical knowledge is important.
