Based on the free matrix approach and stochastic analysis techniques, some sufficient criteria are derived to ensure cluster synchronization of the network model if a single linear or adaptive feedback controller is added to each cluster. Furthermore, two specific methods are given to achieve desired cluster synchronization pattern. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
