It is named as the inside-out grid-based method and involves the following four steps. The first step is the generation of an initial grid structure which envelopes the analyzed solid model completely. And the elements size and density maps are constructed based on the surface curvature and local thickness of the solid model. Secondly, the core mesh is generated through removing all the undesired elements using even and odd parity rules. The third step is to magnify the core mesh in an inside-out manner through a surface node projection process using the closest position approach. To match the mesh to the characteristic boundary of the solid model, a minimal Scaled Jacobian criterion is employed. Finally, in order to handle the degenerated elements and improve the quality of the resulting mesh, two comprehensive techniques are employed: the insertion technique and collapsing technique. The present method was applied in the mesh construction of different engineering problems. Scaled Jacobian and Skew metrics are used to evaluate the hexahedral element mesh quality. The application results show that all-hexahedral element meshes which are well-shaped and capture all the geometric features of the original solid models can be generated using the inside-out grid-based method presented in this paper.
