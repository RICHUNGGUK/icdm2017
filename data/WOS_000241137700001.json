The scheme is based on fast generation of steering trajectories that inherently fulfill the contraints while showing a \"translatability\" property which is generally needed to derive stability results in receding-horizon schemes. The corresponding open-loop optimization problem can be solved very efficiently making possible a real-time implementation on fast systems (The resulting optimization problem is roughly scalar). The whole framework is shown to hold for the well known challenging problem of a snakeboard constrained stabilization. Illustrative simulations are proposed to assess the efficiency of the proposed solution under saturation constraints and model uncertainties.", "paper_title": "Re-injecting the structure in NMPC schemes - Application to the constrained stabilization of a snakeboard", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137700001"}
