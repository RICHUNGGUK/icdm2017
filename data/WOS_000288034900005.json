The Brinkman-Forchheimer-extended Darcy model is adopted for the entire flow field with the solid, fluid, and porous medium. The effects of several parameters, such as porous layer thickness, Darcy number, porosity, and Reynolds number on flow field are discussed. Compared with the case of a solid cylinder, the present work shows that the porous layer may play an important role on the flow, the lift and drag force exerted on the cylinder. The numerical results indicate that the maximal drag coefficient C-d and maximal amplitude of lift coefficient C-1 exist at certain Darcy number which is in the range of 10(-6)-10(-2).
