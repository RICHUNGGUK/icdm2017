In performing array redistribution using synchronous communication mode, data communications among the processors should be properly arranged to avoid incurring higher data transfer cost. Some efficient communication scheduling methods for the Block-Cyclic redistribution have been proposed. On the other hand, the processor mapping technique can help reduce the data transfer cost of redistribution. To avoid degrading the benefit of data transfer cost reduction, it is needed to construct optimal communication schedules for the redistribution in which the processor mapping technique is applied. In this paper, we present a unified approach to constructing optimal communication schedules for the processor mapping technique applied Block-Cyclic redistribution. The proposed method is founded on the processor mapping technique and can more efficiently construct the required communication schedules than other optimal scheduling methods.", "paper_title": "An efficient communication scheduling method for the processor mapping technique applied data redistribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000240262500004"}
