This is surprisingly difficult for AI as it requires similar capabilities to what humans need for successfully interacting with the physical world, one of the grand challenges of AI. As such the competition offers a simplified and controlled environment for developing and testing the necessary AI technologies, a seamless integration of computer vision, machine learning, knowledge representation and reasoning, reasoning under uncertainty, planning, and heuristic search, among others. Over the past three years there have been significant improvements, but we are still a long way from reaching the ultimate aim, and thus, there are great opportunities for participants in this competition.", "paper_title": "The Angry Birds AI Competition", "paper_id": "WOS:000357055000009"}
