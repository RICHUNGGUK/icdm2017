It is observed that inclusion of a few more biological phenomenon in the formulation of artificial neural networks make them more prevailing. Several benchmark and real-life problems of classification and furiction-approximation are illustrated.", "paper_title": "A learning algorithm for a novel neural network architecture motivated by Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000243696600005"}
