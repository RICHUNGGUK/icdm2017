Due to relatively low heights of the antennas, V2V communication is often influenced by topographic features, man-made structures, and other vehicles located between the communicating vehicles. On highways, it was shown experimentally that vehicles can obstruct the line of sight (LOS) communication up to 50 percent of the time; furthermore, a single obstructing vehicle can reduce the power at the receiver by more than 20 dB. Based on both experimental measurements and simulations performed using a validated channel model, we show that the elevated position of antennas on tall vehicles improves communication performance. Tall vehicles can significantly increase the effective communication range, with an improvement of up to 50 percent in certain scenarios. Using these findings, we propose a new V2V relaying scheme called tall vehicle relaying (TVR) that takes advantage of better channel characteristics provided by tall vehicles. TVR distinguishes between tall and short vehicles and, where appropriate, chooses tall vehicles as next hop relays. We investigate TVR's system-level performance through a combination of link-level experiments and system-level simulations and show that it outperforms existing techniques.", "paper_title": "TVR-Tall Vehicle Relaying in Vehicular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000337151500014"}
