In this paper we introduce a new library of HEMET (HEpatocyte METabolism) software that allows the insulin effects on hepatic metabolism to be simulated. This new set of nonlinear differential equations, derived from biochemical reactions which involve this pancreatic hormone, allows the catabolites concentration in hepatic cell culture after insulin infusion to be predicted. The validation procedures were carried out using data obtained from specifically designed cell experiments and from literature. A user friendly interface allows to easily change model parameters, rate constants and inputs simulating a wide range of physiological and pathological scenarios. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
