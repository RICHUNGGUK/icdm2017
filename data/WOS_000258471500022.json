Its probability distribution enables statistical tests in detecting whether significant evolutionary signal remains in the marker order. In this article, we derive the probability distributions of the number of adjacencies for a number of types of genomesigned or unsigned, circular or linear, single-chromosome or multichromosomal. Generating functions are found for single-chromosome cases, from which exact counts can be calculated. Probability approaches are adopted for multichromosomal cases, where we find the exact values for expectations and variances. In both cases, the limiting distributions are derived in term of numbers of adjacencies. For all unsigned cases, the limiting distribution is Poisson with parameter 2; for all signed cases, the limiting distribution is Poisson with parameter 1/2.", "paper_title": "Poisson adjacency distributions in genome comparison: multichromosomal, circular, signed and unsigned cases", "paper_id": "WOS:000258471500022"}
