Current standard Web search is essentially based on a combination of textual keyword search with an importance ranking of the documents depending on the link structure of the Web. For this reason, it has many limitations, and there are a plethora of research activities towards more intelligent forms of search on the Web, called semantic search on the Web, or also Semantic Web search. In this paper, we give a brief overview of existing such approaches, including own ones, and sketch some possible future directions of research.", "paper_title": "Semantic search on the Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000209436300014"}
