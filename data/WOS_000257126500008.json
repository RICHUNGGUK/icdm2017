However, alternative planning strategies that lead to more efficient network configurations are necessary due to the fact that the traffic density is generally far from constant throughout the service area, making necessary the relocation of base stations inside the traffic hotspots. If the traffic is characterized in a discrete way, the optimization of base stations location resembles vector quantization, a well-known problem in signal processing. In this paper, we use this analogy to propose a mobile radio network planning algorithm. Simulation results show that higher trunking efficiency as well as improved frequency assignment can be obtained if an existing mobile radio network is redesigned using the presented strategy.", "paper_title": "Enhanced efficiency and frequency assignment by optimizing the base stations location in a mobile radio network", "paper_id": "WOS:000257126500008"}
