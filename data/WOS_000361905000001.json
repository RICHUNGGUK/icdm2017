Even though there were substantial cross country variations, our results indicate presence of systematic gender based differences in frequency of computer use at home for entertainment related tasks with the mean frequency of use of boys exceeding that of girls for most tasks. By using an identical set of items, and a uniform sample selection procedure across all sampled countries our analytical procedures provide stronger evidence of cross country gender based differences in computer use for entertainment at home, as compared to evidence obtained from samples based on non-uniform sets of items and sampling procedures.
