Here, we present a novel approach to categorize 3D objects. The method described in this article, is a belief-function-based approach and consists of two stages: the training stage, where 3D objects in the same category are processed and a set of representative parts is constructed, and the labeling stage, where unknown objects are categorized. The experimental results obtained on the Tosca-Sumner and the Shrec07 datasets show that the system efficiently performs in categorizing 3D models.", "paper_title": "A Parts-Based Approach for Automatic 3D Shape Categorization Using Belief Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000321223100015"}
