The transparency of data distribution allows programmers to be able to access and allocate shared data using the same user interface as is used in shared-memory systems. The transparency of workload distribution and reconfiguration can optimize the parallelism at both the user-level and the kernel-level, and also improve the efficiency of run-time reconfiguration. In this paper, a transparent DSM system referred to as Teamster is proposed and is implemented for clustered symmetric multiprocessors. With the transparency provided by Teamster, programmers can exploit all the computing power of the clustered SMP nodes in a transparent way as they do in single SMP computer. Compared with the results of previous researches, Teamster can realize the transparency of cluster computing and obtain satisfactory system performance.", "paper_title": "A transparent distributed shared memory for clustered symmetric multiprocessors", "paper_id": "WOS:000238835700002"}
