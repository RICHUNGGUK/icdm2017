After presenting a brief state-of-the art of the literature on the heterarchical concept we propose a semi-heterarchical control structure (composed of DAP: dynamic allocation process and of DRP: dynamic routing process), and explain the objective of our study. After presenting the concept of stigmergy, we focus in this paper on our innovative approach to routing in DRP including the active product concept. We then describe our two levels model and its main components (a virtual level VL in which virtual active products evolve stochastically in accelerated time, and a physical level PL in which physical active products evolve deterministically in real time). Our innovative approach exploits the capacity of a stigmergic routing control model to automatically find efficient routing paths for active products in FMS undergoing perturbations. After a brief presentation of the Netlogo simulation context, the qualitative and quantitative results are presented. The results illustrate the advantages of our routing approach and its capacity to surmount perturbations. The integration and implementation of our approach at the AIP-PRIMECA center in Valenciennes France is then detailed. Finally, we provide a brief overview of our future research concerning: firstly, a way to link our DRP model with the DAP distributed control system, secondly, the re-formulation of our model within the HMS (holonic manufacturing system) concept, and thirdly, the development of a new challenging and innovative concept of \"hypervision\".", "paper_title": "Semi-heterarchical Allocation and Routing Processes in FMS Control: A Stigmergic Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000275441300002"}
