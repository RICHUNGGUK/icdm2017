White noise is added to the data in order to achieve a noise to signal ratio of 5%. 100 Monte Carlo analysis sequences are carried out and the modal parameters (the frequencies, the mode shapes and the damping ratios) are identified at each Monte Carlo run for both techniques. The results are compared with the identifications obtained from the simulated data using stochastic subspace based system identification technique. The overall results of the study show that the mode shapes are clearly identified the best by using the CMIF technique. The damping ratios are estimated better by using the stochastic subspace based system identification technique whereas the frequencies are best determined by the CMIF. The results also show that both the CMIF and the Hilbert Transform techniques are sensitive to the type of window used as well as the averaging and the decimation process. It is apparent that the CMIF technique is as robust as the frequently used stochastic subspace based system identification technique and can be confidently used for modal parameter estimation of stiff low to mid rise reinforced concrete structures.
