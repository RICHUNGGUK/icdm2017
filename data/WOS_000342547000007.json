The major problems in analyzing various modality of medical image are the inconsistent orientation and position of the body-parts of interest. In this research, local descriptor of texture, shape and color are used to extract features from multi-modality medical image in patches and interest point's descriptor. The main advantage of using local descriptor is that these features do not need preprocessing method of segmentation and also robust to local changes These features are then will be classified based on its modality using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighborhood (k-NN) classifiers. It shows that different modality have different characteristic and the importance of selecting significance features.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Visual Features in Local Descriptor for Multi-Modality Medical Image", "paper_id": "WOS:000342547000007"}
