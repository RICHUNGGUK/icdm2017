The proposed methodology manages multimedia information with the use of an extended attributed relational graph. SM technique is adopted to graphically integrate the multimedia information with decision models and hence to support 'pervasive and seamless decision on demand': making decision at the time of gazing multimedia objects as if all data and models for decision support are closely at hand.", "paper_title": "Integrating extended attributed relational graph and structured modeling: Toward multimedia-based decision support in virtual product design", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300059"}
