Double and partial digest problems are two intractable problems used to construct physical maps of DNA molecules in bioinformatics. Several approaches, including exponential algorithms and heuristic algorithms, have been proposed to tackle these problems. In this paper we present two polynomial time molecular algorithms for both problems. For this reason, a molecular model similar to Adleman and Lipton model is presented. The presented operations are simple and performed in polynomial time. Our algorithms are computationally simulated.", "paper_title": "MOLECULAR SOLUTIONS FOR DOUBLE AND PARTIAL DIGEST PROBLEMS IN POLYNOMIAL TIME", "paper_id": "WOS:000273224600002"}
