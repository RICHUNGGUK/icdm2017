In this paper, we proposed and tested a new Rayleigh wave dispersion curve inversion scheme called the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) approach, which is based on a synthesis of four global optimization strategies that have proved successful for global optimization: (a) combination of probabilistic and deterministic approaches; (b) the strategy of clustering; (c) systematic evolution of a complex of points spanning the space, in the direction of global improvement; and (d) competitive evolution. Incorporating these four global optimization strategies into the inverse procedure greatly enhances the performance of the SCE method because these steps not only can effectively locate the promising areas in the solution space for a global minimum but also avoid its wandering near the global minimum in the final stage of search. The proposed inverse procedure was applied to nonlinear inversion of fundamental-mode Rayleigh wave dispersion curves for near-surface shear (S)-wave velocity profiles. The calculation efficiency and stability of the inversion scheme are tested on four synthetic models and a real-world example from a waste disposal site in NE Italy. A comparative analysis with genetic algorithms (GA), marginal posterior probability density (MPPD) estimation, and simulated annealing (SA) is also made in the present study to further evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Results from both synthetic and actual field data demonstrate that shuffled complex evolution algorithm promises to be robust, effective, and efficient for high-frequency surface wave analysis.
