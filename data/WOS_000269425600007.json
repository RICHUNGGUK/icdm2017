As observed from the literature, context handling in service engineering has been during recent years a field of intense research, which has produced several interesting approaches. In this paper, we present research efforts that attempt mainly to decouple context handling from the service logic. We enumerate all context management categories, but focus on the most appropriate for service engineering, namely source code level, model-driven and message interception, taking also into account the fact that these have not been dealt with in detail in other surveys. A representative example is used to illustrate more precisely how these approaches can be used. Finally, all three categories are compared based on a number of criteria. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
