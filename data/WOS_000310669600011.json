Since SSD is organized into multiple flash memory packages, it deploys peculiar device characteristics that do not occur in HDD, such as block-unit erasure overhead. Also, its high cost per capacity is the main obstacle to building a large-scale storage subsystem with only SSDs. An alternative is to build a hybrid storage subsystem where a small portion of SSDs are integrated with HDDs so as to utilize SSD's performance advantages in a cost-effective way. This study introduces a new form of file system, called N-hybrid (New-Form of hybrid file system), that enables us to support the hybrid device structure combined with both HDD and SSD. Our primary objectives in developing N-hybrid are to provide better I/O bandwidth by exploiting the characteristics of HDD and SSD and to provide a flexible data layout maximizing the usage of tight SSD storage resources. Several experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness and suitability of N-hybrid. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
