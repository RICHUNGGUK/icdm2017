In this article, we define a hybrid trader as a type of new user who behaves as both the buyer and the seller. Also, we analyze the trading models and develop a trading mechanism. In the volume-discount trading scheme, hybrid traders form coalitions to purchase items, because a coalition has a greater budget for purchases than a single hybrid trader does. Therefore, we create an incentive for coalitions by using a side payment policy and propose a decision-making method for efficient side payment values. To analyze decisions about side payment value's, we consider two situations: one is a dynamic mechanism based on participation probability, and the other is a systematic mechanism based on the coalition's contribution. Also, in multiple-item trading, we discuss the strategy analyses.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT TRADING MODEL FOR HYBRID TRADERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000308869000001"}
