For an efficient force method of structural analysis, a special cycle basis corresponding to sparse cycle adjacency matrix is required. The purpose of this paper is to develop an ant colony system (ACS) algorithm for the generation of a cycle basis, leading to suboptimal cycle bases. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, an ACS algorithm is developed for the generation of a cycle basis, leading to suboptimal cycle basis corresponding to highly sparse flexibility matrices. Examples are included to illustrate the efficiency of the developed algorithm. Findings - A new approach is developed which uses the recently developed ACS algorithm for the optimization. Originality/value - Previously, graph theoretical method had been used for the formation of suboptimal cycle bases. Here, optimization is performed using ACS algorithm for the first time.", "paper_title": "Suboptimal cycle bases of graphs using ant colony system algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000281276000009"}
