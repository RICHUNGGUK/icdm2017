The agent dynamic is described by a second-order nonlinear system with uncertain time-varying control coefficients and unknown nonlinear perturbations. Based on the finite-time control technique and graph theory, a class of distributed finite-time control laws are proposed which are only based on the neighbors' information. Under the proposed controller, it is shown that the states of all the agents can reach consensus in a finite time and the final consensus state is the desired signal. As an application of the proposed theoretic results, the problem of distributed finite-time attitude cooperative control for the roll channels of multiple bank-to-turn (BTT) missiles is solved. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "FINITE-TIME COOPERATIVE TRACKING CONTROL FOR A CLASS OF SECOND-ORDER NONLINEAR MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000325506900001"}
