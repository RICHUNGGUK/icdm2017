We obtain a sufficient condition of ensuring existence and uniqueness of equilibrium point for delay BAM neural networks with impulses basing on nonsmooth analysis. And we give a criteria of global asymptotic stability of the unique equilibrium point for delay BAM neural networks with impulses using Lyapunov method. At last, we present examples to illustrate that our results are feasible. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
