A novel hybrid intelligent optimization model, integrating a multi-objective memetic optimization (MOMO) process, a Monte Carlo simulation technique and a heuristic pruning technique, is developed to tackle this problem. The MOMO process, combining a NSGA-II optimization process with a tabu search, is proposed to provide Pareto optimal solutions. Extensive experiments based on industrial data are conducted to validate the proposed model. Results show that (1) the proposed model can effectively solve the investigated problem by providing effective production decision-making solutions; (2) the MOMO process has better capability of seeking global optimum than an NSGA-II-based optimization process and an industrial method.
