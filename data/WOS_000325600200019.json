CGN combines the Column Generation (CG) algorithm and the Newton Linear Programming SVM (NLPSVM) method. NLPSVM was proposed for solving 1-norm SVM, and CG is frequently used in large-scale integer and linear programming algorithms. In each iteration of the kernel 1-norm SVM, NLPSVM has a time complexity of O(l(3)), where l is the sample number, and CG has a time complexity between O(l(3)) and O(n'(3)), where n' is the number of columns of the coefficient matrix in the subproblem. CGN uses CG to generate a sequence of subproblems containing only active constraints and then NLPSVM to solve each subproblem. Since the subproblem in each iteration only consists of n' unbound constraints, CGN thus has a time complexity of O(n'(3)), which is smaller than that of NLPSVM and CG. Also, CGN is faster than CG when the solution to 1-norm SVM is sparse. A theorem is given to show a finite step convergence of CGN. Experimental results on the Ringnorm and UCI data sets demonstrate the efficiency of CGN to solve the kernel 1-norm SVM. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
