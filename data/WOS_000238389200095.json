A number of different analytical models for fault-free routing algorithms have been suggested in the past literature. However, there has not been reported any similar analytical model of fault-tolerant routing in the presence of faulty components. This paper presents a new analytical model to capture the effects of failures in wormhole-switched k-ary n-cubes using Software-Based fault-tolerant routing algorithm. The validity of the model is demonstrated by comparing analytical results with those obtained through simulation experiments.", "paper_title": "A performance model of fault-tolerant routing algorithm in interconnect networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200095"}
