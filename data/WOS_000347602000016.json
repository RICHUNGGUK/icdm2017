This result improves the previous primal-dual 6-approximation algorithm for the multilevel facility location problem, and also matches the previous primal-dual approximation ratio for the single-level facility location problem. One of the major merits of primal-dual type algorithms is their easy adaption to other variants of the facility location problems. As a demonstration, our primal-dual approximation algorithm can be easily adapted to several variants of the 2-LFLP, including models with stochastic scenario, dynamically arrived demands, and linear facility cost.
