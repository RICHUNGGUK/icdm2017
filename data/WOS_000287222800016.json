Design/methodology/approach - Finite element method has been used in order to compute the induced current density in a suitable human body model and a simplified model a homogeneous cylinder due to a time-varying magnetic field. Findings - In the practical case of a resistance welding equipment, the implemented computational technique has been used in order to evaluate both the magnetic flux density and the induced current density in different tissues. Their values have been also compared with the ones obtained in a homogeneous cylinder. Practical implications - The proposed method can be used in order to evaluate the compliance of the magnetic field produced by resistance welding equipments with ICNIRP limits. Originality/value - A realistic model of human body has been used. In the paper, the difference on magnetic flux density and corresponding current density values is pointed out for various source positions using a heterogeneous tetrahedral human body model.", "paper_title": "A numerical evaluation of electromagnetic fields exposure on real human body models until 100 kHz", "paper_id": "WOS:000287222800016"}
