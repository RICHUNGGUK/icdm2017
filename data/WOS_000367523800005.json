The results demonstrate that multilevel social structures, with a few strong relationships, more medium ties, and large numbers of weak ties, emerge in an evolutionary simulation when well-being and alliances are rewarded with high levels of social interaction. 'Favour-the-few' trust strategies were more competitive than others under a wide range of fitness conditions, suggesting that the development of complex, multilevel social structures depends on capacity for high investment in social time and preferential social interaction strategies.", "paper_title": "Modelling the Role of Trust in Social Relationships", "paper_id": "WOS:000367523800005"}
