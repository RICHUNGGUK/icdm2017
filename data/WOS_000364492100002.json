In this survey, we highlight some advances in the coevolution of CPS, CPSS, and ITS, with an emphasis on traffic data. We first explain the hierarchical architecture of CPS-ITS in terms of five layers: perception, communication, computing, control, and application. Then, we analyze the characteristics of traffic data in CPS-ITS, and enumerate some new technologies for data operation and management. Two typical cases of CPS-ITS, vehicular-communication-based traffic control systems and smart parking systems, are illustrated to describe how CPS is changing our lives and influencing the development of future ITS.", "paper_title": "The Integration of CPS, CPSS, and ITS: A Focus on Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000364492100002"}
