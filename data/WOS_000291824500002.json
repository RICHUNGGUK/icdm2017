This is a challenging computational task, due to the vast impreciseness associated with the handwritten patterns of different individuals. Therefore, to be successful, any solution should employ techniques that can effectively handle this imprecise knowledge. Fuzzy Logic, with its ability to deal with the impreciseness arisen due to lack of knowledge, could be successfully used to develop automated systems for handwritten character recognition. This paper presents an approach towards the development of a customizable fuzzy system for offline handwritten character recognition.", "paper_title": "A CUSTOMIZABLE FUZZY SYSTEM FOR OFFLINE HANDWRITTEN CHARACTER RECOGNITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000291824500002"}
