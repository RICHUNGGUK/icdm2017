Therefore, compression techniques are inevitable also in the field of moving object databases. Related work is relatively limited and mainly driven by line simplification and data sequence compression techniques. Moreover, due to the (unavoidable) erroneous measurements from GPS devices, the problem of matching the location recordings with the underlying traffic network has recently gained the attention of the research community. So far, the proposed compression techniques have not been designed for network constrained moving objects, while on the other hand, existing map matching algorithms do not take compression aspects into consideration. In this paper, we propose solutions tackling the combined, map matched trajectory compression problem, the efficiency of which is demonstrated through an extensive experimental evaluation on offline and online trajectory data using synthetic and real trajectory datasets.
