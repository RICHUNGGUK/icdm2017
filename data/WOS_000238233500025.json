The electromagnetic coupling method using two coils has been adopted for the transfer of electrical power to recharge internal battery of the implant module. To increase the efficiency of power transfer, the switching frequency of recharging system is determined by the consideration of the resonance of LC tank circuits. The bidirectional signal transmission between the recharging system and the implant module has been designed through the on-off keying modulation of switching signal in the recharging system and the impedance variation of LC tank circuit in the implant module. Through the demonstration of the implemented system, it has been verified that the proposed system has the performance of bidirectional signal transmission with the implant module of F-IMEHDs as well as the battery recharging.", "paper_title": "A transcutaneous recharging system with the function of bi-directional signal transmission for fully-implantable middle ear hearing devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500025"}
