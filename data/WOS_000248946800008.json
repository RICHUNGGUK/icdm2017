Twenty semistructured, open-ended interviews were conducted in February 2005 to collect data. Grounded theory was used to guide data analysis. Major findings include the following: First, within this particular group of older American Internet users, there is little online interaction. The Internet is used primarily as a handy tool to obtain information rather than for developing online relationships. Second, weak tie relationships that develop as a result of face-to-face interactions in computer club meetings facilitate the exchange of information among members. Third, social interactions in the offline environment also provide rich opportunities for older adults to form and maintain companionship relationships. These findings reveal a previously ignored phenomenon: In addition to creating online social relationships, the Internet can also affect relationship formation in the physical world.", "paper_title": "Using the Internet for offline relationship formation", "paper_id": "WOS:000248946800008"}
