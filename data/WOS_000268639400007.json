The proposed circuit is based on a new universal passive filter topology. This passive filter is generated from a classical well known current-mode universal passive filter applying a transformation procedure. Two Fully Differential Current Conveyors (FDCCII) are used to construct a universal active-RC filter from this passive filter. The FDCCII based proposed filter has only grounded resistors and capacitors as the passive elements. The circuit simultaneously provides the three basic filter characteristics, namely high-pass (HP), bandpass (BP) and low-pass (LP). SPICE simulation results are given to verify the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Simulation of a novel current-mode universal filter using FDCCIIs", "paper_id": "WOS:000268639400007"}
