The approach is based on the orthogonal least-squares technique for estimating the fundamental matrix. Using eigenvectors corresponding to the two smallest eigenvalues achieved by the technique mentioned above, we construct a 3x3 generalized eigenvalue problem. The solutions to the problem give not only the fundamental matrix but also the corresponding epipoles. The performance of the new approach is compared with several existing linear methods. It is shown that the approach achieves the higher accuracy. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
