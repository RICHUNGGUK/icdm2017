Measurements can be corrupted or interrupted due to sensor failure, broken or bad connections, bad communication, or malfunction of some hardware or software. This paper proposes a novel robust artificial neural network identifier (RANNI) by combining a sensor evaluation and (missing sensor) restoration scheme (SERS) and an ANN identifier (ANNI) in a cascading structure. This RANNI is able to provide continuous on-line identification of nonlinear plants when some crucial sensor measurements are unavailable. A static synchronous series compensator (SSSC) connected to a power system is used as a test system to examine the validity of the proposed model. Simulation studies are carried out with single and multiple phase current sensors missing; results show that the proposed RANNI continuously tracks the plant dynamics with good precision during the steady state, the small disturbance, the transient state after a large disturbance and the unbalanced three-phase operations. The proposed RANNI is readily applicable to other plant models in power systems. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
