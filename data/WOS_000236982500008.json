For the first time, the concept of unit input bit rate is introduced to improve universality. In addition, various factors limiting burst length are discussed, while considering service requirement and hardware architectures. Then, a novel burst assembly algorithm with a buffer safety space is proposed. Based on the above, the assembly process in optical burst switching at edge routers is simulated, and its influence on burst creation, burst length distribution, packet loss ratio, total output data, and valid data ratio are discussed. The results show that the scheme can provide more efficient QoS guarantee in optical burst switched networks, even for 32 random packet sources at an edge router, the packet loss ratio is to 5 x 10(-5), and the valid data ratio reaches 99.7%.", "paper_title": "Improved OBS burst assembly with a buffer safety space in unit input bit rate", "paper_id": "WOS:000236982500008"}
