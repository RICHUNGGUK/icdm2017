Each primitive has been already used in at least one language appeared in literature; however, to uniformly reason on such primitives, we plugged them in a common framework inspired by the asynchronous pi-calculus. By means of possibility/impossibility of 'reasonable' encodings, we compare every pair of primitives to obtain a hierarchy of languages based on their relative expressive power.", "paper_title": "On the relative expressive power of asynchronous communication primitives", "paper_id": "WOS:000237082000004"}
