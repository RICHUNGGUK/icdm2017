However, in this, paper, multiple real-valued NNCs based on different feature subsets are combined by fuzzy integral so that the bias of NNC in high dimensionality is minimized, which is called FI-MRNNC. In FI-MRNNC, the feature set is partitioned into several low dimensionality feature subsets, where fuzzy measure is used to measure the importance of each feature subset and the interaction between feature subsets in its decision making process. According to the FI-MRNNC's classification accuracy, CA not only partitions the feature set into several feature subsets but also defines a density value for the corresponding feature subset. Experimental results on some UCI databases illustrate that FI-MRNNC can reduce the bias of NNC, especially in high dimensionality.", "paper_title": "Combination of multiple real-valued nearest neighbor classifiers based on different feature subsets with fuzzy integral", "paper_id": "WOS:000253272000015"}
