Analyzing the performance of the canonical tester on specific properties resolves two open problems, establishing lower bounds that match known upper bounds: we show that distinguishing between entropy < alpha or > beta on distributions over [n] requires n(alpha/beta-o(1)) samples, and distinguishing whether a pair of distributions has statistical distance < alpha or > beta requires n(1-o(1)) samples. Our techniques also resolve a conjecture about a property that our canonical tester does not apply to: distinguishing identical distributions from those with statistical distance > 1/2 requires Omega(n(2/3)) samples.", "paper_title": "TESTING SYMMETRIC PROPERTIES OF DISTRIBUTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000298377900017"}
