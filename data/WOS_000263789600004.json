This model includes capillary effects and the gas high diffusivity. Moreover, it is written in variables (total hydrogen mass density and liquid pressure) chosen in order to be consistent with gas appearance or disappearance. We discuss the well possedness of this model and give some computational evidences of its adequacy to simulate gas generation in a water-saturated repository.", "paper_title": "Two-phase, partially miscible flow and transport modeling in porous media; application to gas migration in a nuclear waste repository", "paper_id": "WOS:000263789600004"}
