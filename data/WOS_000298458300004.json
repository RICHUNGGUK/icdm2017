Values of Vz indices allow distinction between sub-ore and supra-ore anomalies, which are associated with outcropping and blind deposits, respectively. In this paper, we used a map of a Vz index (Zn*Pb/Cu*Ag) in weights-of-evidence analysis of regional-scale prospectivity for porphyry-Cu deposits in the area covered by 1:100,000 scale map sheet of Jebal-Barez (Kerman province, southern Iran). For comparison, we used a Cu map instead of the Vz map in the weights-of-evidence (WofE) analysis. The Vz-in-WofE prospectivity model outperforms the Cu-in-WofE prospectivity model. In fact, prior to writing this paper, blind porphyry-Cu mineralization was intersected at depth by borehole exploration in a high prospectivity zone delineated by the Vz-in-WofE model. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the Vz-in-WofE for regional-scale targeting of blind mineral deposits. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
