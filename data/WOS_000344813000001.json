The problem of robust exponential stabilization for the hybrid systems is addressed, which are composed of impulsive subsystems with time-delay and parameter uncertainties. Using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach and linear matrix inequality method, an adaptive robust controller is designed to stabilize the uncertain continuous subsystems. Then the delay-dependent exponential stability conditions for the whole hybrid system are derived by analyzing the stability of the subsystems. An example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed design method.", "paper_title": "Research on robust control and exponential stabilization for large scale impulsive hybrid network systems with time-delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000344813000001"}
