Based on the error system between the master and slave systems, Lyapunov theory and the finite-time stability are utilised to synthesise the controller such that the robust synchronisation is achieved within a finite convergence time, where the convergence time depends on two constants and which are called the exponential convergence and finite-time convergence rates, respectively. In the proposed theorem, the postive values of and can be assigned by the designer such that the proposed control low can guarantee the master system which is synchronised by the slave system within a finite convergence time. Moreover, the design procedure and numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the validity and the robustness of the proposed synchronisation scheme.", "paper_title": "Convergence time guarantee for uncertain chaotic systems synchronisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000320356300005"}
