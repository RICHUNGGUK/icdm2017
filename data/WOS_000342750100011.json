The deforming material boundaries are represented using the moment-of-fluid method. The new algorithm uses a semi-implicit pressure update scheme that asymptotically preserves the standard incompressible pressure projection method in the limit of infinite sound speed. The asymptotically preserving attribute makes the new method applicable to compressible and incompressible flows including stiff materials; enabling large time steps characteristic of incompressible flow algorithms rather than the small time steps required by explicit methods. Shocks are captured and material discontinuities are tracked, without the aid of any approximate or exact Riemann solvers. Simulations of underwater explosions and fluid jetting in one, two, and three dimensions are presented which illustrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm at efficiently computing multiphase flows containing shock waves and material discontinuities with large \"impedance mismatch.\" (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
