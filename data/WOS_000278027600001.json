The geometric structures optimized by HF/6-31G* and B3LYP/6-31G* models and the absorption and emission maxima were in good agreement with existed experimental measurements. It was also found that the lowest singlet states corresponded mainly to the electronic transition from the highest occupied orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Intramolecular charge transfer occurred between substituents and naphthalimic rings. Study also showed that most compounds with low absorption excitation energies had low vertical ionization potentials. Finally, the delocalization electronic energies between substituents and naphthalimic rings of isomers were investigated to obtain further sight into their stability.", "paper_title": "Density functional studies of the substituent effect on absorption and emission properties of 1, 8-naphthalimide derivatives", "paper_id": "WOS:000278027600001"}
