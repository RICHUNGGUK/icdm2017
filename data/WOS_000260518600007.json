The embedding procedure combines the DCT and SVD. The SVD is applied on the low frequency AC coefficients of block DCT of the frame. Then the relation of neighbor coefficients of those middle frequency bands in the singular values is modified. The hidden information can be extracted without the original video or the order of the original singular values, i.e., this is a blind watermarking algorithm. Experiments show that the algorithm is very robust against MPEG-2 compression, median filtering, small shift, and rotation, etc.", "paper_title": "A fast SVD based video watermarking algorithm compatible with MPEG2 Standard", "paper_id": "WOS:000260518600007"}
