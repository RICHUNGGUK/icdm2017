We give a structural characterization of minimal deficient sets of (V, f, d) under certain conditions. We show that all such sets form a tree hypergraph if f is posimodular and d is modulotone (i.e., each nonempty subset X of V has an element v is an element of X such that d(Y) >= d(X) for all subsets Y of X that contain v), and that conversely any tree hypergraph can be represented by minimal deficient sets of (V, f, d) for a posi-modular function f and a modulotone function d. By using this characterization, we present a polynomial-time algorithm if, in addition, f is submodular and d is given by either d(X) = max{p(v) vertical bar v is an element of X} for a function p : V -> R+ or d(X) = max{r(v, w) vertical bar v is an element of X, w is an element of V - X} for a function r : V-2 -> R+. Our result provides first polynomial-time algorithms for the source location problem in hypergraphs and the external network problems in graphs and hypergraphs. We also show that the problem is intractable, even if f is submodular and d 0.", "paper_title": "Minimum transversals in posi-modular systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241478200050"}
