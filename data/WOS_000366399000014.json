Integrating mobile networks of different RATs to provide seamless and smooth mobility service will be the target of future mobile converged network. Generally, handover from high-speed networks to low-speed networks faces many challenges from application perspective, such as abrupt bandwidth variation, packet loss, round trip time variation, connection disruption, and transmission blackout. Existing inter-RAT handover solutions cannot solve all the problems at the same time. Based on the high-layer convergence sublayer design, a new receiver-aided soft inter-RAT handover is proposed. This soft handover scheme takes advantage of multihoming ability of multi-mode mobile station (MS) to smooth handover procedure. In addition, handover procedure is seamless and applicable to frequent handover scenarios. The simulation results conducted in UMTS-WiMAX converged network scenario show that: in case of TCP traffics for handover from WiMAX to UMTS, not only handover latency and packet loss are eliminated completely, but also abrupt bandwidth/wireless RTT variation is smoothed. These delightful features make this soft handover scheme be a reasonable candidate of mobility management for future mobile converged networks.", "paper_title": "A Receiver-Aided Seamless And Smooth Inter-RAT Handover At Layer-2", "paper_id": "WOS:000366399000014"}
