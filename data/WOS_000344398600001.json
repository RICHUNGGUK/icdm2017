In this paper, we provide a review of studies on PPDM in the context of association rules (PPARM). This paper systematically defines the scope of this survey and determines the PPARM models. The problems of each model are formally described, and we discuss the relevant approaches, techniques and algorithms that have been proposed in the literature. A profile of each model and the accompanying algorithms are provided with a comparison of the PPARM models.", "paper_title": "Comprehensive Survey on Privacy Preserving Association Rule Mining: Models, Approaches, Techniques and Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000344398600001"}
