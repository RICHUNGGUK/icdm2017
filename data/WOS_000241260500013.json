Also, in terms of dialectical systems thinking, to recommend the use of individual and group methods and software supporting this process. Design/methodology/approach - In 1974, Mulej invented and introduced the \"Dialectical System\" concept (DS), and in 1998 Mulej and Kajzer fortified DS with \"the Law of Requisite Holism.\" The concept was well-verified in practice, but lacked the support of quantitative versions of systems thinking. In this paper, we eliminate that deficiency: we complete and extend Belton and Stewart's general multi-criteria decision-analysis process to a process of generating ideas and developing them into innovations. Findings - Methods and software supportive of creativity can help generate ideas. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods can be used to complement intuition, verify ideas, and support their development into innovations. The point is in reaching the requisite holism with only a requisite effort by applied systems thinking and innovation. Research limitations/implications - Quantitative methods are considered necessary and helpful, but are not sufficient conditions for innovations or for holism. Practical implications - This paper demonstrates that the modem operations research methods can help strengthen innovation and holistic thinking capacity much more than traditional ones. Originality/value - The innovative aspect of this paper is that it extends a general multiple criteria decision-analysis process to the process of generating ideas and developing them into innovations. It combines the Dialectical Systems Theory and the MCDM methods, which provides an interesting new synergy.", "paper_title": "Systemic decision analysis approaches - Requisite tools for developing creative ideas into innovations", "paper_id": "WOS:000241260500013"}
