Therefore, a reconsideration of the current Internet has begun and is being actively discussed worldwide with the goals of enabling efficient share of limited network resources (i.e., the link bandwidth) and improved performance. To directly address the inefficiency of TCP's congestion mitigation solely on the end-to-end basis, in this paper we propose an adaptive split connection scheme on advanced relay nodes; this scheme dynamically splits end-to-end TCP connections on the basis of congestion status in output links. Through simulation evaluations, we examine the effectiveness and potential of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Splitting TCP Connections Adaptively Inside Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000300471900029"}
