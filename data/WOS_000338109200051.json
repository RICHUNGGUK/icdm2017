Therefore, the ability to automatically identify arrhythmias from ECG recordings is important for clinical diagnosis and treatment. In this article, classification by using associative Petri net (APN) for personalized ECG-arrhythmia-pattern identification is proposed for the first time in literature. Results: A rule-based classification model and reasoning algorithm of APN are created for ECG arrhythmias classification. The performance evaluation using MIT-BIH arrhythmia database shows that our approach compares well with other reported studies.", "paper_title": "An APN model for Arrhythmic beat classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000338109200051"}
