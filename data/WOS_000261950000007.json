The results indicate a tendency towards greater equality in the number of men and women successfully completing doctoral studies. However, the gender imbalance among thesis supervisors and on thesis assessment boards is more apparent, with a predominance of male academics. Moreover, the gender of the PhD student is clearly related to the gender of the supervisor, and both are related to the gender of the members of the assessment boards of PhD theses in Spain.", "paper_title": "PhD theses in Spain: A gender study covering the years 1990-2004", "paper_id": "WOS:000261950000007"}
