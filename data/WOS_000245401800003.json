Such TCP behavior is a result of two components (i) the cumulative packet losses that a flow experiences at each router along its path; (ii) the longer round trip times (RTTs) suffered by such flows due to non-negligible queueing delays at congested routers. This double \"bias\" against connections with MCLs has been shown to approximate the so-called minimum potential delay fairness principle in the current Internet. Despite the recent proliferation of new congestion control proposals for TCP in high-speed networks, it is still unclear what kind of fairness principle could be achieved with such newly proposed congestion control protocols in high-speed networks with large-delays. Studies already show that some high-speed TCP variants may cause surprisingly severe RTT unfairness in high-speed networks with DropTail routers. This paper studies the problem of unfairness in high-speed networks with some well-known high-speed TCP variants in presence of multiple congested links and highlights the severity of such unfairness when DropTail queue management is adopted. Through a simple synchronized loss model analysis, we show how synchronized losses with DropTail in high-speed networks could lead to severe RTT unfairness and drop probability (DP) unfairness; while random marking AQM schemes, which break the packet loss synchrony mitigate such unfairness dramatically by ensuring that the packet loss probability of a flow is the sum of the loss probabilities on the congested routers it crosses. Extensive simulations are carried out and the results support our findings. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
