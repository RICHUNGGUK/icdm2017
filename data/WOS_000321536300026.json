The objective of this work is to generate s-boxes that meet the Strict Avalanche Criteria (SAC), are non-linear and possess a high degree of resistance to differential cryptanalysis. Our approach shows that it is possible to generate s-boxes that exhibit a SAC compliance of 70% without compromising on the robustness. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
