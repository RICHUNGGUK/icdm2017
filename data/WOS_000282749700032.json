ICPS supports both public data and user's in-house data, and performs meta-analysis at a cancer subtype level by combining heterogeneous datasets. Finally, ICPS returns the robust gene signature containing potential cancer biomarkers that may be useful to carcinogenesis study and clinical cancer diagnosis.", "paper_title": "ICPS: an integrative cancer profiler system", "paper_id": "WOS:000282749700032"}
