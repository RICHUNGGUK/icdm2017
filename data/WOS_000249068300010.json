These conditions are significant in graphically designing the simplest T-S fuzzy controller in the frequency domain. Four numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of our two frequency domain-based conditions. Furthermore, this T-S fuzzy controller and the linear proportional controllers are also compared. It is concluded that the simplest T-S fuzzy controller can outperform the linear proportional controllers in a noisy environment with external disturbances. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
