This study reports on the development of a quantitative marking system for the automated assessment of visuo-spatial neglect. Using a clinically established pencil-and-paper based method as a marking benchmark, a set of features are extracted and selected from a battery of computer-captured drawing tasks. Through the application of linear regression and data transformation, the novel system is shown to be effective in correlating against a clinically recognised scale, while simultaneously improving the efficiency of the testing process.", "paper_title": "A computer-based quantitative assessment of visuo-spatial neglect using regression and data transformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000283304500004"}
