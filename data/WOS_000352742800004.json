The face database consists of both visual and thermal face images of 84 persons with varying poses, expressions and occlusions (39 different variations for each type, visual or thermal). A new thermal face image recognition technique based on Gappy Principal Component Analysis and Linear Regression Classifier has also been presented here. The recognition performance of this technique on the thermal face images of this database is found to be 98.61 %, which can be considered as the initial benchmark recognition performance this database.", "paper_title": "UGC-JU face database and its benchmarking using linear regression classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000352742800004"}
