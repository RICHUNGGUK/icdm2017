The antecedent part in each fuzzy rule of an IT2FNN-SVR uses interval type-2 fuzzy sets, and the consequent part is of the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type. The use of interval type-2 fuzzy sets helps improve the network's noise resistance. The network inputs may be numerical values or type-1 fuzzy sets, with the latter being used for further improvements in robustness. IT2FNN-SVR learning consists of both structure learning and parameter learning. The structure-learning algorithm is responsible for online rule generation. The parameters are optimized for structural-risk minimization using a two-phase linear SVR algorithm in order to endow the network with high generalization ability. IT2FNN-SVR performance is verified through comparisons with type-1 and type-2 fuzzy-logic systems and other regression models on noisy regression problems.", "paper_title": "An Interval Type-2 Fuzzy-Neural Network With Support-Vector Regression for Noisy Regression Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283547400004"}
