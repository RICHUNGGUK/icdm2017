Savings of dynamic energy can be obtained by accessing frequently used data from smaller on-chip memories rather than from large background memories. This paper focuses on the reduction of the dynamic energy consumption in the memory subsystem of multidimensional signal processing systems, starting from the high-level algorithmic specification of the application. The paper presents a formal model. which identities those parts of arrays more intensely accessed, taking also into account the relative lifetimes of the signals. Tested on a two-layer memory hierarchy, this model led to savings of dynamic energy from 40% to over 70% relative to the energy used in the case of flat memory designs.", "paper_title": "Formal Model for the Reduction of the Dynamic Energy Consumption in Multi-Layer Memory Subsystems", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164800020"}
