The imagers embed an ALOHA MAC interface for unfettered self-timed pixel read-out targeted to energy-aware sensor network applications. Collision on the output is monitored using contention detector circuits. The image sensors present very high dynamic range and ultra-low power operation. This characteristics allow the sensor to operate in different lighting conditions and for years on the sensor network node power budget.", "paper_title": "CMOS image sensors for sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239755000006"}
