In the proposed extension, we implicitly map input patterns into a possibly high-dimensional space by means of positive semidefinite kernels. In this new space, we model the mapped data by means of the possibilistic clustering algorithm. We study in more detail the special case where we model the mapped data using a single cluster only, since it turns out to have many interesting properties. The modeled memberships in kernel-induced spaces yield a modeling of generic shapes in the input space. We analyze in detail the connections to one-class support vector machines and kernel density estimation, thus, suggesting that the proposed algorithm can be used in many scenarios of unsupervised learning. In the experimental part, we analyze the stability and the accuracy of the proposed algorithm on some synthetic and real datasets. The results show high stability and good performances in terms of accuracy.", "paper_title": "Applying the Possibilistic c-Means Algorithm in Kernel-Induced Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000278538000011"}
