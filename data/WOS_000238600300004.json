Current mechanisms for service evaluation lack expressiveness as regards the representation of service requesters' expectations. In this paper, we present a model for the quantitative expression of service attributes, for the association of the possible values of these attributes with the requester satisfaction and for the aggregation of a set of satisfactions in an overall score by means of different aggregation logics. The proposed approach enriches the expressiveness of the mechanisms for the evaluation of Grid services.
