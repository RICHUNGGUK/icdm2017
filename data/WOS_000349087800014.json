CASP is a biennial worldwide experiment created 20years ago to advance the field of protein folding, one of the grand challenges in modern science. The WeFold experiment was started in CASP10 (the 10th CASP) to bring together scientists from different disciplines to brainstorm online, share ideas and codes, and synergistically develop new methodologies. The goal is to positively shake up the field to stimulate breakthrough advances.
