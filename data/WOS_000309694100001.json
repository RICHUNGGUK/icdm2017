Especially the structural representation, independent of brightness and contrast, of the local phase is interesting for numerous image processing tasks. Recently, the extension of the analytic signal from 1D to 2D, covering also intrinsic 2D structures, was proposed. We show the advantages of this improved concept on ultrasound RF and B-mode images. Precisely, we use the 2D analytic signal for the envelope detection of RF data. This leads to advantages for the extraction of the information-bearing signal from the modulated carrier wave. We illustrate this, first, by visual assessment of the images, and second, by performing goodness-of-fit tests to a Nakagami distribution, indicating a clear improvement of statistical properties. The evaluation is performed for multiple window sizes and parameter estimation techniques. Finally, we show that the 2D analytic signal allows for an improved estimation of local features on B-mode images. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
