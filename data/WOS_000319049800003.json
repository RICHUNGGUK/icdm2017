The main purpose is to formulate and test a model wherein the macroscale flow is resolved while the effects of the microscopic region near a contact line are represented using asymptotic theories. The model covers viscous as well as inertial regimes. Test simulations include axisymmetric displacement flow in a tube and droplet spreading on a flat surface. The results show that the present approach leads to excellent convergence properties even with very coarse grids; furthermore, the results agree well with asymptotic analysis, with those obtained with a method for direct numerical simulations (wherein an adaptive grid is used) and also with experiments.
