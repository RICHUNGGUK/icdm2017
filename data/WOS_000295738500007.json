Perfect secrecy is achieved when the transmitter and the legitimate receiver can communicate at some positive rate, while insuring that the eavesdropper gets zero bits of information. In this paper, we compute the perfect secrecy capacity of the multiple antenna MIMO broadcast channel, where the number of antennas is arbitrary for both the transmitter and the two receivers. Our technique involves a careful study of a Sato-like upper bound via the solution of a certain algebraic Riccati equation.", "paper_title": "The Secrecy Capacity of the MIMO Wiretap Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000295738500007"}
