Whereas probability theory tries to quantify uncertainty that is caused by variability (or equivalently randomness), possibility theory tries to quantify uncertainty that is caused by incomplete information. A specific case of incomplete information is that of ill-known sets, which is of particular interest in the study of temporal databases. However, the construction of possibility distributions in the case of ill-known sets is known to be overly complex. This paper contributes to the study of ill-known sets by investigating the inference of uncertainty when constraints are specified over ill-known values. More specific, in this paper it is investigated how the knowledge about constraint satisfaction can be inferred if the constraints themselves are defined by means of ill-known values. It is shown how such reasoning can contribute to the study of (fuzzy) temporal databases.", "paper_title": "POSSIBILISTIC EVALUATION OF SETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000320617600001"}
