The class of errors considered is general enough to include human rational processes, logical reasoning, scientific progress and data processing in some functional programming languages. The aim is to reach a full taxonomy of error states by analysing the recovery and processing of data. We conclude by presenting machine-readable checking and resolve algorithms.", "paper_title": "A Taxonomy of Errors for Information Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000340525800001"}
