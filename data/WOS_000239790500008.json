Our goal is to compare models based on Markovian processes (where the occurrence of a symbol in a given position only depends on a finite number of previous occurrences) and the stochastic models that can generate a word of given length from a regular language under uniform distribution. We present some results that show the differences between these two stochastic models and their relationship with the rational probabilistic measures.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic models for pattern statistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000239790500008"}
