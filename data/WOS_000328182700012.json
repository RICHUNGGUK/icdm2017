Building upon previous research, this paper proposes a novel sensor-based context-aware system with a focus on three inference processes: rule, inference and pattern driven. Using pattern data derived from five families for a working week and establishing rules and inferences, the proposed context-aware system is demonstrated using electrical lighting as an example. The processes to develop an intelligent house are described so as to ameliorate personalized services in response to inhabitants' needs.
