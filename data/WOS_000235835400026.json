The proposed scheme consists of four stages: data-level fusion, space creation of fuzzy features, fusion of fuzzy features and fuzzy decision. Several fuzzy operators are proposed to create the feature-level fusion. The fuzzy information models describing the characteristics of tumor areas in human brain are also established. A fuzzy region growing based on fuzzy connecting is presented to obtain the final segmentation result. The comparison between the result of our method and the hand-labeled segmentation of a radiology expert shows that this scheme is efficient. The experimental results (based on 4 patients studied) show an average probability of correct detection equal to 96% and an average probability of false detection equal to 5%.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy information fusion scheme used to segment brain tumor from MR images", "paper_id": "WOS:000235835400026"}
