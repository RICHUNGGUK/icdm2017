In SC-FDMA, a mapping strategy of user's spectrum has an enormous impact on system performance. In the relay communication, the optimum mapping strategy may differentiate from that in direct communication because of the independently distributed channels among nodes. In this letter, how each link should be considered in subcarrier mapping is studied and the impact of mapping strategies on the average bit error rate (BER) performance of single-user SC-FDMA relay communications will be given.", "paper_title": "Subcarrier Mapping for Single-User SC-FDMA Relay Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304800036"}
