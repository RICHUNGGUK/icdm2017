We distinguish two quality-of-service packet models. In the first, each subpacket of a same packet can be routed independently, and in the second, each subpacket has to be routed in consecutive slots (no jitter). We evaluate performances in terms of jitter and delay of routed packets. First, we study the algorithmic complexity of minimizing delay in the second model and show it is NP incomplete. Then, we propose distributed and online algorithms for the two models. Finally, we compare these algorithms using an OMnet++ simulator.
