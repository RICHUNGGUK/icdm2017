Indeed, analyses of real dimension networks need simulation algorithms that allow network conditions and performances to be rapidly determined. Hence, we developed, an MSA (Method of Successive Averages) algorithm based on the Ant Colony Optimisation paradigm that allows transportation systems to be simulated in less time but with the same accuracy as traditional MSA algorithms. Finally, by moans of Blum's theorem, we stated theoretically the convergence of the proposed ACO-based algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Stochastic traffic assignment algorithm based on ant colony optimisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241466100003"}
