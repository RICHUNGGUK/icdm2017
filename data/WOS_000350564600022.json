Open vSwitch, Open Flow controllers, network namespaces, cgroups) into a framework, which can automatically set up and configure customized Open Flow testbeds scaling up to hundreds of nodes. Standing on the shoulders of Mininet, we implement a similar prototyping system called ESCAPE, which can be used to develop and test various components of the service chaining architecture. Our framework incorporates Click for implementing Virtual Network Functions (VNF), NETCONF for in Click-based NINFs and PDX for taking care of traffic steering. We also add our extensible Orchestrator module, which can accommodate mapping algorithms from abstract service descriptions to deployed arid running service chains.", "paper_title": "ESCAPE: Extensible Service ChAin Prototyping Environment using Mininet, Click, NETCONF and POX", "paper_id": "WOS:000350564600022"}
