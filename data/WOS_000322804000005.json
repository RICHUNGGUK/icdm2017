This approach is based on the replacement of the usual algebraic manipulation of the polynomials (and their roots) appearing in the topology determination of the given curve with the computation of numerical matrices (and their eigenvalues). Such numerical matrices arise from a typical construction in Elimination Theory known as the Bezout matrix which in our case is specified by the values of the defining polynomial equations on several sample points.
