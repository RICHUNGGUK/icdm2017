We show that every multigraph can be assembled by DNA such that there is a single strand that traces each edge in the graph at least once. This strand corresponds to a boundary component of a two-dimensional orientable surface that has the given graph as a deformation retract. This boundary component traverses every edge at least once, and it defines a circular path in the graph that \"preserves the graph structure\" and traverses each edge. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
