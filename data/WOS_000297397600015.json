As these shocks occur, the system experiences one of two types of failures: a type-I failure (minor), rectified by a minimal repair; or a type-II failure (catastrophic) that calls for a replacement. In this study, we consider a multi-criteria replacement policy based on system age, nature of failure, and entire repair-cost history. Under such a policy, the system is replaced at planned life time T, or at the nth type-I failure, or at the kth type-I failure (k < n) at which the accumulated repair cost exceeds the pre-determined limit, or at the first type-II failure, whichever occurs first. An optimal policy over the control parameters is studied analytically by showing its existence, uniqueness, and structural properties. This model is a generalization of several existing models in the literature. Some numerical examples are presented to show several useful insights. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
