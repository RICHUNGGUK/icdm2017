The sub-carriers though, experience different degrees of fading and thus, the received power is different for different sub-carriers; while some frequencies experience deep fades, others are relatively unaffected. In this paper, we make a case for redistributing the power across the sub-carriers (subject to a fixed power budget constraint) to better cope with this frequency selectivity. Specifically, we design a joint power and rate adaptation scheme (called JPRA for short) wherein power redistribution is combined with sub-carrier level rate adaptation to yield significant throughput benefits. We further consider three variants of JPRA: (a) JPRA-Basic where, the power is redistributed across sub-carriers so as to support a maximum common rate across all the sub-carriers (b) JPRA-Intermediate where, the power is redistributed across sub-carriers so as to support a maximum common rate across a \"subset\" of sub-carriers such that the aggregate rate is maximized. (c) JPRA-Adaptive where, the goal is to redistribute power such that the transmission time of a packet is minimized. While the first two variants decrease transceiver complexity and are simpler, the third is geared towards achieving the maximum throughput possible. We implement all three variants of JPRA on our WARP radio testbed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that JPRA can provide a 35 percent improvement in total network throughput in testbed experiments compared to FARA, a scheme where only sub-carrier level rate adaptation is used. We also perform simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of JPRA in larger scale networks.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Sub-Carrier Level Power Allocation in OFDMA Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345990600003"}
