This approach asymptotically approaches the entropy at the fastest possible rate of 1/2 log (n) bits per unknown parameter. We show that the complexity of this algorithm is ohm(n log(n)), which is comparable to existing sequential universal algorithms. We provide a sequential O(n log (log (n))) algorithm by modifying Rissanen's block partitioning scheme. The redundancy with our approach is greater than with Rissanen's block partitioning scheme by a multiplicative factor 1 + O(1/log(log(n))), hence it asymptotically approaches the entropy at the fastest possible rate.", "paper_title": "Faster sequential universal coding via block partitioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000236714000031"}
