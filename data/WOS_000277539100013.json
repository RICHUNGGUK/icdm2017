Design/methodology/approach - The characteristics of spin of the general systemic yoyo model, combined with the traditional analytic tools, are employed as the method and thinking logic for this work of quantitative representations. Findings - Formulae are developed for calculating the inductance, intensity of the magnetic field, the total magnetic yoyo flux, and induced magnetomotive force of a coil. For LC networks of canals of electric yoyos, by analyzing the relationship between the electric yoyo charge Q of the capacitor and the induced electric yoyo current I in the network, the following problem is addressed: when the switch of the network is turned on, what will be the reaction of the network? For LR networks of canals of electric yoyo flows, the problem considered is: when the switch is turned off, how would the electric yoyo current evolve? Analysis shows that at the moment of the time constant, the electric yoyo current drops to the level of about 37 percent of its initial strength. Originality/value - It is expected that some properties of the general systemic yoyo model can be reasonably expressed by using numbers and quantities so that good amount of the traditional quantitative analysis will become useful in the study of this general and intuitive systemic model. This end will become useful when this model is applied to investigate problems and phenomena considered in social science and humanities.", "paper_title": "LC and LR networks of canals of yoyo flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000277539100013"}
