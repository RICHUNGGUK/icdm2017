We developed a standardized pipeline for annotating TFs in fungal genomes. Resulting data have been archived in a new database termed the Fungal Transcription Factor Database (FTFD). In FTFD, 31 832 putative fungal TFs, identified from 62 fungal and 3 Oomycete species, were classified into 61 families and phylogenetically analyzed. The FTFD will serve as a community resource supporting comparative analyses of the distribution and domain structure of TFs within and across species.", "paper_title": "FTFD: an informatics pipeline supporting phylogenomic analysis of fungal transcription factors", "paper_id": "WOS:000254470900022"}
