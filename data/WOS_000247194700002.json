Unlike the well-established client-server model, where there is only one server sending the requested data, the available bandwidth of multiple senders when combined together does exhibit consistent properties and thus can be modeled and estimated. Through extensive experiments conducted in the Internet this work proposed to model the aggregate available bandwidth using a normal distribution and then illustrates its application through a hybrid download-streaming algorithm and a playback-adaptive streaming algorithm for video delivery under different bandwidth availability scenarios. This new multi-source bandwidth model opens a new way to provide probabilistic performance guarantee in best-effort networks such as the Internet, and is particularly suitable for the emerging peer-to-peer applications, where having multiple sources is the norm rather than the exception.", "paper_title": "On aggregate available bandwidth in many-to-one data transfer-modeling and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000247194700002"}
