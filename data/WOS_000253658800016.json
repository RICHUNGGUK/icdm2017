With the ongoing momentum of service science, management, and engineering, the discrete choice modeling approach provides a sophisticated tool kit for assessing the needs and preferences of service customers. We provide directions for designing and executing discrete choice studies for services and discuss several examples for a number of industries including health care, financial services, retail, hospitality, and online services. We conclude with a discussion of the many managerial implications of the discrete choice approach.", "paper_title": "Predicting customer choice in services using discrete choice analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000253658800016"}
