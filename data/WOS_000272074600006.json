The study ascertains the extent of difficulty in applying the DC metadata elements encountered by these professionals and examines factors engendering such difficulties during the metadata application process. Comments drawn from the survey participants (n = 141) show that conceptual ambiguities (41%) and semantic overlaps (45%) of the surveyed DC metadata elements are the most frequently cited factors causing difficulty and confusion, in turn leading to variant interpretations of DC metadata elements. This has the potential to bring forth inconsistent and inaccurate applications and implementation of the DC standard across institutions which can directly affect semantic interoperability across digital repositories. The high degree of difficulty (55.3%) engendered by the Relation field indicates that further examination of this element is needed.", "paper_title": "Dublin Core metadata semantics: an analysis of the perspectives of information professionals", "paper_id": "WOS:000272074600006"}
