We show that it is feasible to reconstruct the shape of the heart at discrete points in the cardiac cycle. Provided we are given a small number of shape instances representing the same heart at different points in the same cycle, we can use the bilinear model to establish this. Using a temporal and a spatial alignment step in the preprocessing of the shapes, around half of the reconstruction errors were on the order of the axial image resolution of 2 mm, and over 90% was within 3.5 mm. From this, we conclude that the dynamics were indeed separated from the inter-subject variability in our dataset.", "paper_title": "Bilinear Models for Spatio-Temporal Point Distribution Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000270432200004"}
