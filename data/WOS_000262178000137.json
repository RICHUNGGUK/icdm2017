A set of attributes Of file apparel items for coordination are identified and formulated. The evaluation of these attributes can be accomplished by a knowledge-based expert system which can handle the difficulty of processing linguistic and categorical information effectively. A fuzzy clustering technique and a new hybrid learning algorithm combining the PSO and GA techniques are proposed to reduce the coordination rules and the training time for the TSFNN. The experimental results show that rules reduction can shorten the TSFNN training time while keeping a very satisfactory and low MSE value. The proposed hybrid algorithm Outperforms file Back Propagation, the Genetic Algorithm, and the Particle Swarm Optimization. The apparel pairs recommended by file decision support tool arc now integrated with it smart dressing system of it fashion retailing company in Hong Kong and practically used. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
