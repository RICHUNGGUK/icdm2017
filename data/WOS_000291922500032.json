In this paper, four general constructions for optimal cyclic packings and optimal variable-weight OOCs are presented. Many new infinite classes of optimal (v, W, 1,Q)-OOCs are obtained. New infinite classes of optimal (v, W, 1,Q)-OOCs for vertical bar W vertical bar >= 4 are easily obtained by the constructions.", "paper_title": "General Constructions of Optimal Variable-Weight Optical Orthogonal Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000291922500032"}
