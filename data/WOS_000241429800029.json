It is used to evaluate the system performance, assess enrollment acceptability, and evaluate fingerprint sensors. This paper presents a novel methodology for fingerprint image quality measurement. We propose limited ring-wedge spectral measure to estimate the global fingerprint image features, and inhomogeneity with directional contrast to estimate local fingerprint image features. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.", "paper_title": "Image quality measures for fingerprint image enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800029"}
