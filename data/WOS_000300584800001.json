However, most of existing tagging algorithms often don't differentiate between tags used to describe visual content, and neglect the semantic correlation of the assigned tag set. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic tagging algorithm which tags a test image or video with an Informative and Correlative Tag (ICTag) set. The assigned ICTag set can provide a more precise description of the multimedia object by exploring both the information capability of individual tags and the tag-to-set correlation. Measures to effectively estimate the information capability of individual tags and the correlation between a tag and the candidate tag set are designed. To reduce the computational complexity, we also introduce a heuristic method to achieve efficient automatic tagging. We conduct extensive experiments on the NUS-WIDE web image dataset downloaded from Flickr and the MCG-WEBV web video dataset downloaded from YouTube. The results confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Automatic tagging by exploring tag information capability and correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000300584800001"}
