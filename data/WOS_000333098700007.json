Typical image classification methods explore image appearances without considering the spatial causality among distinctive domains in an image. To address the issue, we introduce an ordered-patch-based image representation and use the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model to characterize the representation. First, each image is encoded as a sequence of ordered patches, integrating both the local appearance information and spatial relationships of the image. Second, the sequence of these ordered patches is described by an ARMA model, which can be further identified as a point on the image Grassmannian manifold. Then, image classification can be conducted on such a manifold under this manifold representation. Furthermore, an appropriate Grassmannian kernel for support vector machine classification is developed based on a distance metric of the image Grassmannian manifold. Finally, the experiments are conducted on several image data sets to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other existing image classification methods.", "paper_title": "An Ordered-Patch-Based Image Classification Approach on the Image Grassmannian Manifold", "paper_id": "WOS:000333098700007"}
