This letter presents research using algorithms and scenarios. We propose an EA-LLS that offers not only On/Off and dimming control, but dimming control through daylight, space, and user behavior analysis.", "paper_title": "Design of an Energy-Aware LED Light System (EA-LLS) for Energy Saving and User Satisfaction through Daylight, Space and User Movement Analysis in Buildings", "paper_id": "WOS:000364422400016"}
