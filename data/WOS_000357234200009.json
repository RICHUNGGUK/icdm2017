With the rapid growth of storage system scales in volume, traditional full-size index trees cannot offer high-performance metadata search due to hierarchical indexing bottleneck. In order to alleviate the long latency and improve the quality-of-service (QoS) in cloud storage service, we proposed a novel provenance based metadata-search system, called PROMES. The metadata search in PROMES is split into three phases: (i) leveraging correlation-aware metadata index tree to identify several files as seeds, most of which can satisfy the query requests, (ii) using the seeds to find the remaining query results via relationship graph search, (iii) continuing to refine and rerank the whole search results, and sending the final results to users. PROMES has the salient features of high query accuracy and low latency, due to files' tight and lightweight indexing in relationship graph coming from provenance's analysis. Compared with state-ofthe-art metadata searching schemes, PROMES demonstrates its efficiency and efficacy in terms of query accuracy and response latency.
