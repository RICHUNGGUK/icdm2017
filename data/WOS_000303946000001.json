These providers may call for the connectivity service which fulfills the specificity of their services, for instance a multicast transmission with allocated bandwidth. On the other hand, network operators want to make profit by trading the connectivity service of requested quality to their customers and to limit their infrastructure investments (or do not invest anything at all). We focus on circuit switching optical networks and work on repetitive multicast demands whose source and destinations are A priori known by an operator. He may therefore have corresponding trees \"ready to be allocated\" and adapt his network infrastructure according to these recurrent transmissions. This adjustment consists in setting available branching routers in the selected nodes of a predefined tree. The branching nodes are opto-electronic nodes which are able to duplicate data and retransmit it in several directions. These nodes are, however, more expensive and more energy consuming than transparent ones. In this paper we are interested it, the choice of nodes of a multicast tree where the limited number of branching routers should be located in order to minimize the amount of required bandwidth. After formally stating the problem we solve it by proposing a polynomial algorithm whose optimality we prove. We perform exhaustive computations to show an operator gain obtained by using our algorithm. These computations are made for different methods of the multicast tree construction. We conclude by giving dimensioning guidelines and outline our further work. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
