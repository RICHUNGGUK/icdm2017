The uncertainties are assumed to be time-invariant, norm-bounded, and exist in the system, time-delay and output matrices. Our interest is focused on dynamic output feedback. A sufficient condition for the uncertain multi-channel discrete-time descriptor system with tine-delay to be admissible with a specified disturbance attenuation level is derived based on Lyapunov stability theory. By setting the Lyapunov matrix as block diagonal appropriately according to the desired order of the controller, the problem is reduced to linear matrix inequalities which are sufficient to the existence condition but much more tractable.", "paper_title": "ROBUST DECENTRALIZED H-infinity CONTROL OF MULTI-CHANNEL DISCRETE-TIME DESCRIPTOR SYSTEMS WITH TIME-DELAY", "paper_id": "WOS:000265260800015"}
