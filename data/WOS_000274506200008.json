This paper develops it simple 3-D Markov chain model for queuing analysis of IEEE 802.11 MAC layer, The model is applied for performance analysis of voice communications over IEEE 802.11 single-hop ad hoc networks. By Using the model. we finish the performance optimization of IEEE MAC layer and obtain the maximum number of voice calls in IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks as well as the statistical performance bounds. Furthermore. we design a fully distributed call admission control (CAC) algorithm which can provide strict statistical QoS guarantee for voice communications over IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks. Extensive simulations indicate the accuracy of the analytical model and the CAC scheme.", "paper_title": "Voice Communications over 802.11 Ad Hoc Networks: Modeling, Optimization and Call Admission Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000274506200008"}
