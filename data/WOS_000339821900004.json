Therefore, we focus on the development of approximated algorithms to find high quality triangulations of minimum dilation. For an initial approach, we design a greedy strategy able to obtain approximate solutions to the optimal ones in a simpleway. We also propose an operator to generate the neighborhood which is used in different algorithms: Local Search, Iterated Local Search, and Simulated Annealing. Besides, we present an algorithm called Random Local Search where good and bad solutions are accepted using the previous mentioned operator. For the experimental study we have created a set of problem instances since no reference to benchmarks for these problems were found in the literature. We use the sequential parameter optimization toolbox for tuning the parameters of the SA algorithm. We compare our results with those obtained by the OV-MDT algorithm that uses the obstacle value to sort the edges in the constructive process. This is the only available algorithm found in the literature. Through the experimental evaluation and statistical analysis, we assess the performance of the proposed algorithms using this operator.", "paper_title": "Approximated algorithms for the minimum dilation triangulation problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000339821900004"}
