The main street and the minor street join at the intersection. As to the traffic flow is not controlled by traffic lights, conflict happens between the vehicles from minor street and that from main street. Two different crash avoiding rules are used to dispose the conflicts. In the first rule, the priorities are given to the driving-ahead vehicle and the vehicle on the main street. In the second rule, the vehicle that reaches the conflicting point earlier enters into the intersection. The flux on each lane depending on the inflow rates is studied in detail. The capacity of the system is also investigated. Our simulation results suggest that the two rules do not take the same effect on the capacity under different traffic conditions.", "paper_title": "CELLULAR AUTOMATA MODEL FOR UNSIGNALIZED T-SHAPED INTERSECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000266126300001"}
