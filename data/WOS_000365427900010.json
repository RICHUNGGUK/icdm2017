This paper presents a proposal for a Framework for Qualitative Assessment of DSLs (FQAD). FQAD is used for determining the perspective of the evaluator, understanding the goal of the assessment and selecting fundamental DSL quality characteristics to guide the evaluator in the process. This framework adapts and integrates the ISO/IEC 25010: 2011 standard, CMMImaturity level evaluation approach and the scaling approach used inDESMETinto a perspective-based assessment. A detailed list of domain-specific language quality characteristics is elaborated, and a novel assessment method is proposed. Two case studies through which FQAD is matured and evaluated are reported. The case studies have shown that stakeholders find the FQAD process beneficial.", "paper_title": "A framework for qualitative assessment of domain-specific languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000365427900010"}
