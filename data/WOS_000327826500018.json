With such conceptual setting, a general framework is developed for studying uniformity behaviors under reparameterization via proper parameter transformation and for computing reparameterizations with improved uniformity of quasi-speed by means of optimal single-piece, C-0 piecewise, and C-1 piecewise Mobius transformations. Algorithms are described for uniformity-improved reparameterization using different Mobius transformations with different optimization techniques. Examples are presented to illustrate the concepts, the framework, and the algorithms. Experimental results are provided to validate the framework and to show the efficiency of the algorithms.", "paper_title": "A framework for improving uniformity of parameterizations of curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000327826500018"}
