As feature sizes decrease to nanometer scales, an increase in switching activity per unit of area and time is observed. When extreme switching activity occurs in a small region of an integrated circuit, malfunctions may be triggered that compromise behavior. This can be either a consequence of a decrease in bias levels in the power grid caused by IR-Drop, or due to unexpected glitching on gates' outputs caused by ground bounce. For proper circuit verification, both conditions have to be accurately estimated and accounted for. Achieving this in an accurate manner for a large circuit is a very challenging problem. In this paper we propose and compare methods for the identification of the conditions leading to extreme situations of switching activity in integrated circuits. Our approach is based on both spatial and time partitioning which are used to address the accuracy and computational requirements. We propose a method for determining the exact conditions for worst case switching activity in a small circuit area during a short time interval. We then show how this method can be combined with partitioning to allow for accurate full circuit verification.", "paper_title": "Analysis of the conditions for the worst case switching activity in integrated circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000300360900007"}
