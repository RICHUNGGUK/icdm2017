This method is synthesized with integrated nested Laplace approximation to compute maximum likelihood estimates efficiently via a fast implementation in generalized linear mixed models. Asymptotic behavior of the hybrid data cloning method is discussed. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated through a simulation study and real examples. It is shown that the proposed method performs well and rightly justifies the theory. Supplemental materials for this article are available online.", "paper_title": "On a hybrid data cloning method and its application in generalized linear mixed models", "paper_id": "WOS:000297543600019"}
