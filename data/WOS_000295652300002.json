By splitting a single qubit into some wavepackets with some Mach-Zehnder interferometers, we can obtain an uncorrupted state with a success probability approaching 100% via postselection in different time bins, independent of the parameters of collective noise. It is simpler and more flexible than the schemes utilizing decoherence-free subspace and those with additional qubits. One can directly apply this scheme to almost all quantum communication protocols based on single photons or entangled photon systems against a collective noise.", "paper_title": "PASSIVELY SELF-ERROR-REJECTING QUBIT TRANSMISSION OVER A COLLECTIVE-NOISE CHANNEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000295652300002"}
