The enumeration was performed on several computer clusters and required the equivalent of 70 years of single CPU time. Furthermore, a classification of Costas arrays in four classes is proposed,and it is conjectured, based on the results of the enumeration combined with further evidence,that two of them eventually become extinct.", "paper_title": "THE ENUMERATION OF COSTAS ARRAYS OF ORDER 28 AND ITS CONSEQUENCES", "paper_id": "WOS:000287238100007"}
