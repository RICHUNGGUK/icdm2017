A geometric approach is introduced to construct and characterize relative constant-weight codes, using the finite projective geometry. A sufficient and necessary condition is derived for linear codes to be relative constant-weight codes, based on the geometric approach. A family of infinite number of relative constant-weight codes are constructed, which includes dual Hamming codes and subcodes of punctured Reed-Muller codes as special instances. It is well known that determining all the minimal codewords is a hard problem for an arbitrary linear code. For relative constant-weight codes, minimal codewords are completely determined in this paper. Based on the above-mentioned results, applications of relative constant-weight codes to wire-tap channel of type II and secret sharing are discussed. A comparative study shows that relative constant-weight codes form a new family. They are not covered by the previously well-known three-weight codes or linear codes for which minimal codewords can be determined.", "paper_title": "On relative constant-weight codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000351158100010"}
