In this paper, a new dataflow-based design tool called the targeted dataflow interchange format is introduced for retargetable design, analysis, and implementation of embedded software for multimedia systems. Our approach provides novel capabilities, based on principles of task-level dataflow analysis, for exploring and optimizing interactions across design components; object-oriented data structures for encapsulating contextual information for components; a novel model for representing parameterized schedules that are derived from repetitive graph structures; and automated code generation for programming interfaces and low-level customizations that are geared toward high-performance embedded-processing architectures. We demonstrate our design tool for cross-platform application design, parameterized schedule representation, and associated dataflow graph-code generation using a case study centered around an image registration application.", "paper_title": "Design and Synthesis for Multimedia Systems Using the Targeted Dataflow Interchange Format", "paper_id": "WOS:000304166300014"}
