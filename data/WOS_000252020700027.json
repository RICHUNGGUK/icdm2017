Kalman filter algorithm is applied to estimate the electric load composition on a consumer side of a distributed power system. The electric load supplied from the different voltage level by using a non-ideal delta-wye transformer is also studied with consideration of the practical environment for a distributed power system.", "paper_title": "Kalman-filter based estimation of electric load composition with non-ideal transformer modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020700027"}
