We suppose that in a large enough document collection the answer to a given question may appear in several different forms. Therefore, it is possible to find one or more sentences that contain the answer and that also include tokens from the original question. The Passage Retrieval engine is almost language-independent since it is based on n-gram structures. Question classification and answer extraction modules are based on shallow patterns.", "paper_title": "Answering questions with an n-gram based passage retrieval engine", "paper_id": "WOS:000275161000001"}
