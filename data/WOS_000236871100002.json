The proposed approach can be applied to both linear and nonlinear designs. By analyzing the resulting sensitivity values, the proposed procedure is able to determine an appropriate distinct word-length for each internal variable in a fixed-point hardware implementation. In addition, the power-optimizing capabilities of word-length optimization are studied. Application of the proposed procedure to adaptive filters and polynomial evaluation circuits realized in a Xilinx Virtex FPGA has resulted in area reductions of up to 80% (mean 66%) combined with power reductions of up to 98% (mean 87%) and speed-up of up to 36% (mean 20%) over common alternative design strategies.", "paper_title": "Word-length optimization for differentiable nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000236871100002"}
