According to many studies which showed that optimized diagnostic process can considerably improve efficiency in health care industry, we present a new approach to data integration within a diagnostic process. It is our belief that a unified access to data resources throughout the whole diagnostic process considerably improves the efficiency of the process itself. When combining the optimized data access with an existing algorithmic optimization method an optimized process can be achieved that takes into account the quality of a diagnosis, the individual needs of each patient, the associated costs, and the utilization of personnel/equipment. To enable an efficient management of data, we developed a semantic web based system for the integration of data resources within a medical diagnostic process. Then we combined the unified data access with our existing diagnostic process optimization framework that uses machine learning techniques and evolutionary algorithms. The new defined diagnostic process framework is finally used in a case-study for optimizing the diagnosing of the mitral valve prolapse syndrome in a regional hospital department.
