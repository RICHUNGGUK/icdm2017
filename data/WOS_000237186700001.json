For non-stationary problems such schemes should possess the same approximation order in space and time. In the present article we propose for electromagnetic applications an explicit class of robust finite-volume (FV) schemes for the Maxwell equations. To achieve high accuracy we combine the FV method with the so-called ADER approach resulting in schemes which are arbitrary high order accurate in space and time. Numerical results and convergence investigations are shown for two and three-dimensional test cases on Cartesian grids, where the used FV-ADER schemes are up to 8th order accurate in both space and time.
