Its capabilities are shown with proper reference to the underlying model, as well as a description of the relevant input variables and associated test-case simulations. The various interactions included in the electrospinning model implemented in JETSPIN are discussed in detail. The code is designed to exploit different computational architectures, from single to parallel processor workstations. This paper provides an overview of JETSPIN, focusing primarily on its structure, parallel implementations, functionality, performance, and availability.
