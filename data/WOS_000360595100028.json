First, a new state space Model based on the process state and output error variables is derived to provide more information of the system. The PFC is then designed through a linear quadratic form that makes the controller optimal. Thus, the control performance can be improved under partial actuator faults and unknown disturbances. Finally, an injection molding process is adopted to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that satisfactory control performance can be obtained by comparing with traditional PFC. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
