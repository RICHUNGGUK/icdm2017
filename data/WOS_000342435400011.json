They disregard spatial information within a scene and are not able to discern categories that share similar sub-scenes but different in layout; or categories that are ambiguous by nature. To address this issue, we propose to incorporate subscene attributes within global descriptions to improve categorization performance, especially in ambiguity cases. This is achieved by encoding sub-scenes with layout prototypes that capture the geometric essence of scenes more accurately and flexibly. The proposed method improves categorization accuracy to 92.26 % in the widely used eight scenes dataset, and outperforms all the other published methods. It is also observed that the proposed method is more accurate at detecting and evaluating ambiguity images.", "paper_title": "Improve scene categorization via sub-scene recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000342435400011"}
