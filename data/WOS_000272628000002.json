Application performance issues have an immediate impact on customer experience and satisfaction. A sudden slowdown of enterprise-wide application can effect a large population of customers, lead to delayed projects, and ultimately can result in company financial loss. Significantly shortened time between new software releases further exacerbates the problem of thoroughly evaluating the performance of an updated application. Our thesis is that online performance modeling should be a part of routine application monitoring. Early, informative warnings on significant changes in application performance should help service providers to timely identify and prevent performance problems and their negative impact on the service. We propose a novel framework for automated anomaly detection and application change analysis. It is based on integration of two complementary techniques: (i) a regression-based transaction model that reflects a resource consumption model of the application, and (ii) an application performance signature that provides a compact model of runtime behavior of the application. The proposed integrated framework provides a simple and powerful solution for anomaly detection and analysis of essential performance changes in application behavior. An additional benefit of the proposed approach is its simplicity: It is not intrusive and is based on monitoring data that is typically available in enterprise production environments. The introduced solution further enables the automation of capacity planning and resource provisioning tasks of multitier applications in rapidly evolving IT environments.", "paper_title": "Automated Anomaly Detection and Performance Modeling of Enterprise Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000272628000002"}
