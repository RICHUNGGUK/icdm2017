The estimation of PHN is performed by a cross-correlation between the received and locally generated pilots in frequency-domain. Simulations show that the proposed scheme can effectively ameliorate the impairment due to PHN, at the cost of acceptable additional transmission bandwidth and low implementation complexity.", "paper_title": "Novel Consecutive-Pilot Design for Phase Noise Suppression in OFDM System", "paper_id": "WOS:000268506600020"}
