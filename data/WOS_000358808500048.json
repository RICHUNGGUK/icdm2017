The recently proposed method, diversified one-against-one (DOAO), constructs a one-against-one classifier by selecting the best classifier for each class pair from the set of heterogeneous base classifiers. It was found to yield better classification accuracy than other one-against-one classifiers that are based on individual classification algorithms. This paper presents a novel method, called optimally diversified one-against-one (ODOAO) which is an improvement of DOAO. ODOAO, is based on meta-learning, and seeks to construct a multiple classifier system where a meta-classifier effectively combines the outputs from all the heterogeneous base classifiers that are trained using various classification algorithms for every class pair. Experimental results show that ODOAO outperforms DOAO and other one-against-one based methods with statistical significance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
