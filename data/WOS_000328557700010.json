In this review, we initially give a brief recapitulation of relevant basic MD theories, followed by an additional introduction of the current state-of-the-art MD methodologies, mainly involving steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD). Both of the methods extend research field of conventional MD simulations. In the end, some interesting examples using these latest MD approaches are also presented to demonstrate their practicability and validity for the study on the ligand-receptor interaction.", "paper_title": "Drug Design Benefits from Molecular Dynamics: Some Examples", "paper_id": "WOS:000328557700010"}
