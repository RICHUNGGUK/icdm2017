Design/methodology/approach - Optimisation of a tubular linear generator with longitudinal flux topology has been undertaken using a finite element method. The computational models used have been verified experimentally. Findings - The use of an oversized stator linear generator design as opposed to an oversized translator design has the potential to increase the output electromotive force per unit material cost by 25 per cent for slotless iron core topologies and approximately 14 per cent for air core topologies. For cogging force minimisation, optimisation of the length of the stator core is an effective technique for both oversized stator and oversized translator constructions. Comparisons of magnet materials also indicate that the higher cost of rare earth magnets to ferrites is compensated by their superior specific performances. Originality/value - In this paper, a broader range of design parameters than in previous investigations has been optimised for the slotless iron core and air core topologies. The result relating to cogging force reduction and cost savings (in particular) has the potential to make direct drive wave energy extraction a more competitive technology in terms of reliability and cost.", "paper_title": "Optimisation of a tubular linear machine with permanent magnets for wave energy extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000292715900021"}
