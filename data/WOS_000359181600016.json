The task is highly challenging due to occlusions, complex backgrounds, and variation of human poses. We propose a cascade-structured approach to real-time human detection in cluttered and dynamic environments with both color and depth data seamlessly incorporated. The first stage efficiently exploits depth data which generates a set of physically plausible yet over-detected candidates. These candidates are then purified by another two filters: a knowledge based human upper portion locator and a data-driven learning based filter. Experimental results show high detection accuracy achieved by the proposed method at 80-140 fps on a single CPU core (without GPU acceleration). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
