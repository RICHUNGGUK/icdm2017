Referring to the trust relationship models of social persons, trust relationship is built among Grid nodes, and the trustworthiness of nodes is evaluated by utilizing the Bayes method. Integrating the trustworthiness of nodes into a Dynamic Level Scheduling (DLS) algorithm, the Trust-Dynamic Level Scheduling (Trust-DLS) algorithm is proposed. Theoretical analysis and simulations prove that the Trust-DLS algorithm can efficiently meet the requirement of Grid tasks in trust, sacrificing fewer time costs, and assuring the execution of tasks in a security way in Grid environment.", "paper_title": "Trusted dynamic level scheduling based on Bayes trust model", "paper_id": "WOS:000247829800015"}
