BCH codes form a special class of cyclic codes, and are usually among the best cyclic codes. A subclass of good BCH codes is the narrow-sense primitive BCH codes. However, the dimension and minimum distance of these codes are not known in general. The main objective of this paper is to study the dimension and minimum distances of a subclass of the narrow-sense primitive BCH codes with design distance delta = (q - l(0))q(m-l1-1) - 1 for certain pairs (l(0), l(1)), where 0 <= l(0) <= q - 2 and 0 <= l(1) <= m - 1. The parameters of other related classes of BCH codes are also investigated, and some open problems are proposed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Parameters of Several Classes of BCH Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000361486800007"}
