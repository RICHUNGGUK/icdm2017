We propose (to the best of our knowledge) the first loss bound for kernel matching pursuit using a novel application of sample compression and Vapnik-Chervonenkis bounds. For sparse kernel principal components analysis, we find that it can be bounded using a standard sample compression analysis, as the subspace it constructs is a compression scheme. We demonstrate empirically that this bound is tighter than previous state-of-the-art bounds for principal components analysis, which use global and local Rademacher complexities. From this analysis we propose a novel sparse variant of kernel canonical correlation analysis and bound its generalization performance using the results developed in this paper. We conclude with a general technique for designing matching pursuit algorithms for other learning domains.", "paper_title": "Design and Generalization Analysis of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000295738500028"}
