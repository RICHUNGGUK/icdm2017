For example, it is becoming easier for criminals to store incriminating files in the cloud computing environment but it may be extremely difficult for LEAs to seize these files as the latter could potentially be stored overseas. Two of the most widely used and accepted forensic frameworks - McKemmish (1999) and NIST (Kent et al., 2006) - are then reviewed to identify the required changes to current forensic practices needed to successfully conduct cloud computing investigations. We propose an integrated (iterative) conceptual digital forensic framework (based on McKemmish and NIST), which emphasises the differences in the preservation of forensic data and the collection of cloud computing data for forensic purposes. Cloud computing digital forensic issues are discussed within the context of this framework. Finally suggestions for future research are made to further examine this field and provide a library of digital forensic methodologies for the various cloud platforms and deployment models.
