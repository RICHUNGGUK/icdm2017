Bioinformatic analyses indicate that many ta-siRNA-producing loci (TASs) are present in plants, implying the existence of as yet undiscovered ta-siRNAs and related regulatory pathways. To expand our knowledge of these plant gene regulators, we applied high-throughput computational and experimental methods to grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.). Results: Based on bioinformatic predictions, we identified 49 TASs from 49 055 small RNA clusters. Using RNA degradome analysis, we experimentally validated 5 TASs, 22 ta-siRNAs and 37 ta-siRNA targets. The cis-activities of ta-siRNAs were also confirmed, which suggested an inactive mechanism of TAS transcription, and a produced mechanism of multiple forms of small RNA from same TAS. We examined the conservation of newly identified ta-siRNA regulatory cascades and found that while the cascade related to vviTAS3 was conserved, cascades related to vviTAS7, vviTAS8, vviTAS9 and vviTAS10 were grape-specific. These results broaden the known scope of ta-siRNA regulation.", "paper_title": "Identification of trans-acting siRNAs and their regulatory cascades in grapevine", "paper_id": "WOS:000309881200001"}
