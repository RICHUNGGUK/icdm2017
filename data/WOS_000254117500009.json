We have spent the past year enhancing existing open software to create a software-defined data radio. This radio extends the notion of software-defined behavior to higher layers in the protocol stack: most importantly through the media access layer. Our particular approach to the problem has been guided by the desire to allow fine-grained cognitive control of the radio. We describe our system, Adaptive Dynamic Radio Open-source Intelligent Team (ADROIT).
