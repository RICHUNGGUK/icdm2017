These developments have considered an interval arithmetic-based linear model between the random interval-valued sets and a least squares regression analysis. The least squares approach involves a generalized L-2-metric between interval data; this metric weights squared distances between data location (mid-points/centers) and squared distances between data imprecision (spread/radius). As a consequence, estimators of the parameters in the linear model depend on the choice of the weights in the metric. To investigate about a suitable choice of weighting in the generalized mid/spread metric, a theoretical conclusion is first obtained. Finally, the impact of varying the weights is discussed by considering a Monte Carlo simulation study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
