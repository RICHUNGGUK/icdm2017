This bound, conjectured by Brass, cannot be improved, apart from the value of the constant. We strengthen and generalize this result to the case when the graph has a crossing-free drawing on an orientable surface of higher genus and there is no restriction on the degrees of the vertices.", "paper_title": "Crossing number of toroidal graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000235806300030"}
