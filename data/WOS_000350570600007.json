However, when multiple VMs are required to be migrated, an arbitrary migration sequence will possibly congest the inter-site links. To avoid such congestion and also maximize the number of successful migrations, in this paper, we formulate VM migration sequence planning problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming(MILP) problem, which considers both inter-VM communication traffic and migration traffic. Due to the high computational complexity to get the optimal results, we further propose a heuristic algorithm referred as MinUti-O to approximate the optimal results with low complexity. The extensive simulation results show that the success ratio achieved by MinUti-O is close to the optimal results with less than 5 % gap under different topology with variation of migration requests and network conditions.", "paper_title": "Traffic Aware Cross-Site Virtual Machine Migration in Future Mobile Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000350570600007"}
