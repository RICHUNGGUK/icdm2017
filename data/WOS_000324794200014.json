In this method, the scalar signals are used to instead the output variables of every node as the feedback variables and transmitted signals between every two coupling nodes. As a result, it not only simplifies the topological structure but also saves channel resources at the same time. Especially, some of the criteria are expressed in normal algebraic inequalities instead of matrix inequalities, which means that the original computational effort required is greatly decreased. Finally, several simulation examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Synchronization in complex dynamical networks based on the feedback of scalar signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000324794200014"}
