Further, by using the probabilistic perspective of P2DPCA, we extend P2DPCA to a mixture of local P2DPCA models (MP2DPCA). MP2DPCA offers us a method of being able to model faces in unconstrained (complex) environment with possibly large variation. The model parameters could be fitted on the basis of maximum likelihood (ML) estimation via the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The experimental recognition results on UMIST face database confirm the effectivity of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Face recognition using probabilistic two-dimensional principal component analysis and its mixture model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600048"}
