To this end, a theoretical framework is established. The authors first generalise the division algorithm, and then present a generalised definition of the remainder of integer division. Finally, a generalised Chinese remainder theorem is used to achieve their initial goal. As a by-product of the generalised remainder of integer division, the authors rediscover Montgomery's N-residue and present a systematic interpretation of definitions of Montgomery's multiplication and addition operations.", "paper_title": "Obtaining more Karatsuba-like formulae over the binary field", "paper_id": "WOS:000312961600003"}
