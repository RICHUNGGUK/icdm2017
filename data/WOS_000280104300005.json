(2003). They propose an exact polynomial-time algorithm, which is however very slow, and faster heuristics, where an approximation ratio is not guaranteed. In this paper, we demonstrate an alternative approach based on the Garg and Konemann (1998) algorithm for packing linear programs, combined with the exact computation of minimum cost arborescence. For any epsilon > 0, our approach obtains a solution achieving at least 1 c times the optimum lifetime with significantly faster running time than that of the exact algorithm. The simulation result also shows that our algorithm achieves a solution that is within 0.02% of optimum and is not slower than the heuristics previously proposed by Kalpakis et al.
