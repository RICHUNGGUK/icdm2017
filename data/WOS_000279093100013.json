In this paper our goal is to develop theoretical tools that will enable us to relax this assumption and obtain explicit expressions for the rate of growth of the number of connections at the system, the rate at which TCP connections leave the system, as well as the time needed for the completion of a connection. To that end, we model the system as a discriminatory processor sharing (DPS) system which we analyze under very mild assumptions on the probability distributions related to different classes of arrivals: we only assume that the arrival rates of connections exist, and that the amount of information transmitted during a connection of a given type forms a stationary ergodic sequence. We then proceed to obtain explicit expressions for the growth rate of the number of connections at the DPS system for several specific probability distributions. We check through simulations the applicability of our queueing results for modeling TCP connections sharing a bottleneck. (C) 2009 Elsevier By.
