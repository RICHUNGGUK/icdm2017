In this paper, we consider the problem to schedule computational jobs efficiently regarding system resource constraint and introduce a cuckoo search (CS) algorithm. Experimental results show that CS outperforms the genetic algorithm in terms of fitness value.", "paper_title": "Cuckoo Search Algorithm for Job Scheduling in Cloud Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464400026"}
