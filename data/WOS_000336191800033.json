However, unimodal biometrics have limited usage since no single biometric is sufficiently robust and accurate in real-world applications. Iris and face biometric authentication often deals with non-ideal scenarios such as off-angles, reflections, expression changes, variations in posing, or blurred images. These limitations imposed by unimodal biometrics can be overcome by incorporating multimodal biometrics. Therefore, this paper presents a method that combines face and iris biometric traits with the weighted score level fusion technique to flexibly fuse the matching scores from these two modalities based on their weight availability. The dataset use for the experiment is self established dataset named Universiti Teknologi Malaysia Iris and Face Multimodal Datasets (UTMIFM), UBIRIS version 2.0 (UBIRIS v.2) and ORL face databases. The proposed framework achieve high accuracy, and had a high decidability index which significantly separate the distance between intra and inter distance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
