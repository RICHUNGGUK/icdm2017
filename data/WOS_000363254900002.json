We generalize these two bounds to the case of repeated-root cyclic codes and present a syndrome-based burst error decoding algorithm with guaranteed decoding radius based on an associated folded cyclic code. Furthermore, we present a third technique for bounding the minimum Hamming distance based on the embedding of a given repeated-root cyclic code into a repeated-root cyclic product code. A second quadratic-time probabilistic burst error decoding procedure based on the third bound is outlined.", "paper_title": "Decoding of repeated-root cyclic codes up to new bounds on their minimum distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000363254900002"}
