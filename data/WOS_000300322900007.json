We show that all irreducible factors of 2 (n) r-th cyclotomic polynomials can be obtained easily from irreducible factors of cyclotomic polynomials of small orders. In particular, we obtain the explicit factorization of 2 (n) 5-th cyclotomic polynomials over finite fields and construct several classes of irreducible polynomials of degree 2 (n-2) with fewer than 5 terms.", "paper_title": "On explicit factors of cyclotomic polynomials over finite fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000300322900007"}
