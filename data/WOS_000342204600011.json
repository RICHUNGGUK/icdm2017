This paper addresses the Petri net approach to formally model the departure routine of the aircraft which ensures the organized flow of air traffic during departure. First, the high-level design of the system is presented by identifying key objects involved in departure routine, and then, its detailed model is presented. Moreover, the verification of the underlying methodology has been made using coverability tree. The proposed model is verified to be safe (bounded), potentially reversible and deadlock free which ensures reliability of the system and guarantees the efficient and controlled communication between the aircraft and local and ground controllers.", "paper_title": "Modeling and analysis of departure routine in air traffic control based on Petri nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000342204600011"}
