Most of existing lossless predictive coding techniques mainly focus on suitability of prediction model for training set with the underlying assumption of local consistency, which may not hold well on object boundaries and cause large predictive error. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the assumption that local consistency and patch redundancy exist simultaneously in natural images. We derive a family of linear models and design a new algorithm to automatically select one suitable model for prediction. From the Bayesian perspective, the model with maximum posterior probability is considered as the best. Two types of model evidence are included in our algorithm. One is traditional training evidence, which represents the models' suitability for current pixel under the assumption of local consistency. The other is target evidence, which is proposed to express the preference for different models from the perspective of patch redundancy. It is shown that the fusion of training evidence and target evidence jointly exploits the benefits of local consistency and patch redundancy. As a result, our proposed predictor is more suitable for natural images with textures and object boundaries. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed predictor achieves higher efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art lossless predictors.", "paper_title": "Lossless Predictive Coding for Images With Bayesian Treatment", "paper_id": "WOS:000345565000003"}
