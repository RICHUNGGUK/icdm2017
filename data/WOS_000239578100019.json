A new smoothness constraint set (SCS) is used to remove the unnecessary high frequencies. In addition, an adaptive quantization constraint set (AQCS) is employed to suppress error in the smoothing process. The proposed size and position of new SCS are different from traditional ones. Extensive experimental results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better image quality with fewer iterations.", "paper_title": "De-blocking artifacts in DCT domain using projection onto convex sets algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000239578100019"}
