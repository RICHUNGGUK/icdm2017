Using these ECPs, some maximally entangled states in polarization can be reconstructed deterministically from less-hyperentangled ones shared between remote participants. Both of the success probabilities are 100% in principle, and they do not require additional single photons. The former is implemented with the passive linear optics, which is achievable with current technology. The later adopts the cross-Kerr nonlinearity media to complete this task, which can increase the efficiency of the entanglement concentration process since it does not require the sophisticated single-photon detectors for measurements. The two ECPs are useful for practical long-distance quantum communication due to the fact that the entangled state in either the spatial degree of freedom or the frequency degree of freedom suffers little from channel noise in optical fiber.", "paper_title": "POLARIZATION ENTANGLEMENT CONCENTRATIONS WITH LESS-HYPERENTANGLED PHOTON PAIRS IN MULTIPLE DEGREES OF FREEDOM", "paper_id": "WOS:000314425000003"}
