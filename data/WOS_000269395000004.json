The proposed methodology applies the FCM-FBPN approach with multiple buckets to estimate both the cycle time and the step cycle time of a job, and then derives the remaining cycle time with the proportional adjustment approach. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, production simulation is used to generate some test data. According to the experimental results, the estimation accuracy of the proposed methodology was significantly better than those of many existing approaches.", "paper_title": "A FUZZY-NEURAL APPROACH FOR REMAINING CYCLE TIME ESTIMATION IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACTORY-A SIMULATION STUDY", "paper_id": "WOS:000269395000004"}
