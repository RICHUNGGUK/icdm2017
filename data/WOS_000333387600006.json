An n-fold L(j,k)-labeling of a graph G is an assignment f of sets of nonnegative integers of order n to the vertices of G such that, for any two vertices u,v and any two integers aaf(u), baf(v), |a-b|a parts per thousand yenj if uvaE(G), and |a-b|a parts per thousand yenk if u and v are distance two apart. The span of f is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum integers used by f. The n-fold L(j,k)-labeling number of G is the minimum span over all n-fold L(j,k)-labelings of G. Let n,j,k and m be nonnegative integers. An n-fold circular m-L(j,k)-labeling of a graph G is an assignment f of subsets of {0,1,aEuro broken vertical bar,m-1} of order n to the vertices of G such that, for any two vertices u,v and any two integers aaf(u), baf(v), min{|a-b|,m-|a-b|}a parts per thousand yenj if uvaE(G), and min{|a-b|,m-|a-b|}a parts per thousand yenk if u and v are distance two apart. The minimum m such that G has an n-fold circular m-L(j,k)-labeling is called the n-fold circular L(j,k)-labeling number of G. This paper provides upper and lower bounds for the n-fold L(j,1)-labeling number and the n-fold circular L(j,1)-labeling number of the triangular lattice and determines the n-fold L(2,1)-labeling number and n-fold circular L(2,1)-labeling number of the triangular lattice for na parts per thousand yen3.", "paper_title": "Multiple L(j,1)-labeling of the triangular lattice", "paper_id": "WOS:000333387600006"}
