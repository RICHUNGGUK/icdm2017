The purpose is to verify if the model is able to deliver statistically meaningful parameter values in order to classify the two groups. The data are gathered with the non-invasive lung function test of forced oscillations technique, by means of a multisine signal within the 4-48 Hz frequency range. Based on our previous work, a fractional order model for this range of frequencies is obtained. Additional parameters are proposed to evaluate the two groups. The results indicate that the model was unable to detect significant changes between the asthmatic children with normal spirometry results (as result of medicadon) and the healthy children. Due to medication intake during the hours prior to the exam, bronchial challenge did not modify substantially the respiratory parameters. Our findings correspond to similar studies reported in the specialized literature. Combined model parameters, such as the tissue damping and the tissue elastance were significantly different in the two groups (p < 0.01). Two extra indexes are introduced: the quality factor and the power factor, providing significantly different results between the two groups (p << 0.01). We conclude that the model can be used in the respective frequency range to characterize the two groups efficiently. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
