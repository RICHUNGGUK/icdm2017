To analyze the static structure and dynamic behavior of fuzzy ECA rules, a fuzzy colored time Petri net model (FCTPN) is proposed. The FCTPN is able to model the fuzzy ECA rules with characteristics such as fuzzy composite events, fuzzy composite conditions, event consumption modes and rule coupling modes. Based on the FCTPN, termination analysis of fuzzy ECA rules is examined, and an efficient termination analysis algorithm is proposed with consideration of all the characteristics of fuzzy ECA rules. Compared with existing termination analysis algorithms of ECA rules, the proposed algorithm has higher accuracy and lower time complexity, and thus it is more suitable for pervasive computing environments.
