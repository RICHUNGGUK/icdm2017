As it happens in the physical economy, the grid economy must be supported by services that locate resources based not only on their characteristics, but also on market-related properties, the properties and constraints of offers and requests, as well as on declarative specifications of peers' (providers and consumers) features. Resource retrieval in the context of a grid economy extends the notion of resource matchmaking to the process of discovering those markets that trade resources through market orders. This paper describes an ontology that represents resource orders (offers and requests) in a market-oriented resource retrieval process, and describes the Semantic Information System (SIS) that exploits this ontology for the retrieval of markets. The paper describes the retrieval process thoroughly.", "paper_title": "The Grid4All ontology for the retrieval of traded resources in a market-oriented grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000271426800006"}
