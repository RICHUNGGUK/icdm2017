The study, run with 7th grade students in the United States, found that use of visual signaling was significantly associated with lower levels of student self-reported cognitive load versus students in a no-signaling version of the assessment. Further, the efficiency of the virtual world-based assessment was significantly higher, as measured by in-world object interaction rates, for students in the visual signaling version of the assessment than for those in the no-signaling treatment. In the paper, we discuss the results and their meaning for the design of virtual world and game-based assessments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
