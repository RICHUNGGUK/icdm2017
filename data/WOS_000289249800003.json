Following the conceptual model of social presence proposed by Hassanein and Head (2007), this study discusses social presence in a virtual environment as a complex multidimensional construct characterized by directed relationships among a set of uni-dimensional constructs. Given the rising importance of security, this study investigates the influence of social presence on perceived security in virtual activities. A prototype of the virtual shopping mall is designed as an experimental medium for which the user interface consists of both 3D graphics and an avatar. Valid questionnaires were gathered from student samples, and hypotheses were then tested to measure this set of constructs and fit a series of structural equation models that test Hassanein and Head's (2007) theory. The proposed model is strongly supported, and it provides additional insight into the effect and consequences of social presence. The results of the model show that social presence is a key behavioral antecedent to using virtual malls and user perception of security is a focal feature of user attitude. The results further suggest that perceived social presence can be a key factor of the virtual shopping activities by enhancing user perception of security and behavioral attitude in virtual malls. This study provides a more intensive view of virtual reality users and is an important step toward a better understanding of user behaviors in virtual environments.", "paper_title": "Consumers' Trust in Virtual Mall Shopping: The Role of Social Presence and Perceived Security (Retracted article.
