In peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, this operation is particularly hard due to churn-the continuous process of node arrival and departure. Key issues here include how churn impacts newcomers' perceptions and which key factors result in a slowing of uncertainty decay. New research explores these issues, and experimental results show the impact of churn on uncertainty reduction.", "paper_title": "The Impact of Churn on Uncertainty Decay in P2P Reputation Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000281547800005"}
