Modelling of such a system needs a unified approach to represent the nonlinear behavior model in a generic and systematic way. Bond graph modelling is well suited for this task. The developed model allows to estimate the longitudinal impact forces at tire-road contact in interaction with its environment. A simulation model in modular and hierarchical form is developed in Symbols 2000 software and used for model integration and validation. Finally, comparison with experimental results are presented.
