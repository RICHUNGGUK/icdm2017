The library is implemented in the modelling language Modelica, emulating thermal building dynamics in a comprehensive way. This includes the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system as well as solar radiation and user behaviour. The way in which the dynamic behaviour of many coupled subsystems can be investigated in only one universal modelling and simulation environment will be illustrated. At the same time, the object-oriented and acausal language Modelica, ensures a high degree of reusability. The library is free and can be downloaded from the website of the Modelica Association: http://www.modelica.org/libraries.shtml.", "paper_title": "Modular modelling of thermal building behaviour using Modelica", "paper_id": "WOS:000234717700004"}
