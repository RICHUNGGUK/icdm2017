Disturbances produced by nonlinear exosystems are nonharmonic and periodic. A new internal model is proposed to deal with these disturbances. Furthermore, an adaptive output feedback controller is designed to ensure that the system's state variables asymptotically converge to zero, and disturbances can be completely rejected. The proposed algorithm has various applications, such as active vibration control. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated to completely reject the nonharmonic periodic disturbances produced by a van der Pol oscillator.", "paper_title": "Rejection of nonharmonic disturbances for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with nonlinear exosystems", "paper_id": "WOS:000318197000017"}
