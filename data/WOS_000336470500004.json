Moreover, the direction of the perturbation is a convex subset of the positive cone instead of a single positive vector. In our general version, the assumption that the objective function is lower semi-continuous and one that the range of the function is lower bounded are both weakened. From the general Ekeland's variational principle, we obtain several particular set-valued Ekeland's variational principles in fuzzy metric spaces, which generalize and improve some related known results. From these, we deduce the corresponding Caristi's fixed point theorems for set-valued maps and the corresponding Takahashi's non-convex minimization theorems in set-valued optimization. Finally, we extend the obtained results to F-type topological spaces. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
