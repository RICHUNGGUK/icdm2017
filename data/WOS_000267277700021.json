The purpose of this paper is to show a modification in the J-A hysteresis model in order to improve the minor and inner loops representation. The proposed technique allows the J-A model representing non-centred minor loops with accuracy as well as improving the symmetric inner loops representation. Design/methodology/approach - Only the irreversible magnetization component is slightly modified keeping unchanged the other model equations and the model simplicity. The high-variation rate of the irreversible magnetization, which causes the non-physical behaviour of minor loops, is limited by introducing a new physical parameter linked to the losses. Contrarily to other modifications of the original model found in the literature, the previously knowledge of the magnetic field waveform is not needed in this case. Findings - The modified hysteresis model is validated by comparison with experimental results. A good agreement is observed between calculations and measurements. The modified model retains the low-computational effort and numerical simplicity of the original one. Originality/value - This paper shows that a classical scalar hysteresis model can be suitably used to take into account the minor loops behaviour and be included in a finite element code. The methodology is useful for the design and analysis of electromagnetic devices under distorted flux patterns.", "paper_title": "Accurate minor loops calculation with a modified Jiles-Atherton hysteresis model", "paper_id": "WOS:000267277700021"}
