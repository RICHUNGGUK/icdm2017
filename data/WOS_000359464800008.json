The proposed CS-based differential measuring method is performed through the differential operation on the inter-block-interference-free regions of the received adjacent training sequences. The sparse NBI signal can be accurately recovered from a time-domain measurement vector of small size under the CS framework, without requiring channel information or dedicated resources. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed method is robust to NBI under multi-path fading channels.", "paper_title": "Narrowband Interference Mitigation Based on Compressive Sensing for OFDM Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464800008"}
