The geometrical optimizations indicate that a transition point from preferentially planar (two-dimensional) to three-dimensional (3D) structures occurs at n = 6. The relative stabilities of Au (n) Be+ clusters for the ground-state structures are analyzed based on the averaged binding energies, fragmentation energies, and second-order difference of energies. The calculated results reveal that the AuBe+ and Au5Be+ clusters possess higher relative stability for small size Au (n) Be+ (n = 1-8) clusters. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps as a function of the cluster size exhibit a pronounced even-odd alternation phenomenon. Sequently, the natural population analysis and polarizability for our systems have been analyzed and compared further.", "paper_title": "Equilibrium geometries, stabilities, and electronic properties of the cationic AunBe+ (n=1-8) clusters: comparison with pure gold clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000307276900011"}
