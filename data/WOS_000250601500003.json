Due to an absence of relevant test data, the model is validated using non-linear finite element analyses (NLFEA). The results indicate that the use of the proposed model would lead to safe and economical designs. The proposed model can be easily extended to any number of piles, providing a rational procedure for the design of wide range of pile caps.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear finite element analysis of four-pile caps supporting columns subjected to generic loading", "paper_id": "WOS:000250601500003"}
