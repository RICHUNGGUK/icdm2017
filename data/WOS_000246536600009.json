This article focuses on the notions of \"place'' and \"conceptual spatial relation'' to present a formal model of space supporting common-sense spatial reasoning. The model can be viewed as the semantic specification for a hybrid logic, whose formulas represent spatially qualified information. Interesting classes of common-sense spatial models are identified according to the properties of their characteristic relations and an axiomatization of the associated hybrid language is given; a sound and complete tableau-based calculus for these classes of models is provided.", "paper_title": "Common-sense spatial reasoning for information correlation in pervasive computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000246536600009"}
