Discontinuous friction function is an unavoidable nonlinear effect that can limit control performance in mechanical systems. In this paper, adaptive WNN is used to design a friction compensator for a single joint mechanical system. Then asymptotically stability of the system is assured by adding a PD controller and adaptive robust terms. The simulation results show the validity of the control scheme.", "paper_title": "Adaptive wavelet neural network friction compensation of mechanical systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000166"}
