In this work [S. Jin, X. Wen, A Hamiltonian-preserving scheme for the Lionville equation of geometric optics with partial transmissions and reflections, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 44 (2006) 1801-1828], a Hamiltonian-preserving scheme for the Liouville equation was constructed to capture partial transmissions and reflections at the interfaces. This scheme is extended by incorporating diffraction terms derived from Geometric Theory of Diffraction into the numerical flux in order to capture diffraction at the interface. We give such a scheme for curved interfaces. This scheme is proved to be positive under a suitable time step constraint. Numerical experiments show that it can capture diffraction phenomena without fully resolving the wave length of the original wave equation. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
