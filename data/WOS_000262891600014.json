Our model utilizes appearance features together with short- and long-term motion information. In particular, we boost Integral Gradient Orientation histograms of appearance and short-term motion. Outputs from the detector are maintained by a tracker to correct any misdetections. A Bayesian model is then deployed to further fuse long-term motion information based on correlation. Experiments show that our model is more robust with better detection rate compared to the model of Viola et al. [Michael J.
