In response, we propose an evolutionary based dynamic energy management framework that reduces the overall energy consumption without degrading network performance. The main concept is to combine infrastructure sleeping with virtual router migration. During off-peak hours, the virtual routers are moved onto fewer physical platforms and the unused resources are placed in a sleep state to save energy. The sleeping physical platforms are then reawakened during busy periods. In particular, an evolutionary based algorithm called MOEA_VRM is developed to determine where to move the virtual routers in question. The algorithm is then evaluated using a multi-layer fluid flow event-driven simulator to assess its potential. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
