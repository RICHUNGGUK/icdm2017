STAR (R) has three phases: a preliminary phase involving the setting up of an enterprise framework; a technology data collection phase; and a project creation and assessment phase. STAR (R) utilises the analytic hierarchy process to rank company technology requirements, several non-financial factors to determine the alignment of proposed projects and visual representations to select a portfolio of projects. Project evaluations have demonstrated that statistically significantly different project selection outcomes arise from the additional non-financial factors included in STAR (R). Elements of STAR (R) are being implemented at a major collaborator, and it is planned to implement the whole STAR (R) methodology within a year. An integrated enterprise level roadmapping methodology such as STAR (R) offers an objective way of selecting and evaluating projects and, later, of re-evaluating and improving the process.", "paper_title": "Strategic technology alignment roadmapping STAR (R) aligning R&D investments with business needs", "paper_id": "WOS:000260326100007"}
