For this purpose, we propose a novel image SR method by learning both non-local and local regularization priors from a given low-resolution image. The non-local prior takes advantage of the redundancy of similar patches in natural images, while the local prior assumes that a target pixel can be estimated by a weighted average of its neighbors. Based on the above considerations, we utilize the non-local means filter to learn a non-local prior and the steering kernel regression to learn a local prior. By assembling the two complementary regularization terms, we propose a maximum a posteriori probability framework for SR recovery. Thorough experimental results suggest that the proposed SR method can reconstruct higher quality results both quantitatively and perceptually.", "paper_title": "Single Image Super-Resolution With Non-Local Means and Steering Kernel Regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000310140700005"}
