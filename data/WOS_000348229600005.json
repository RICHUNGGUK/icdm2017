This contribution presents the underlying concepts and ideas to provide the predictability, flexibility, and creative freedom in order to elevate analog circuit design to the next step. A circuit generation algorithm is presented, which allows a full design-space exploration. Furthermore, an isomorphism algorithm is developed, which reduces a given set of circuits to its unique being one of the first methodologies addressing this issue. Thus, the algorithm handles vast amounts of circuits in a very efficient manner. The results demonstrate the claimed feasibility and applicability of the synthesis framework in general and in the context of system design.", "paper_title": "FEATS: Framework for Explorative Analog Topology Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000348229600005"}
