Wang, S. Ruan, Bifurcations in an epidemic model with constant removal rate of the refectives, J. Math. Anal. Appl. 291 (2004) 775-793]. We first prove the uniqueness of closed orbits if they exist for this epidemic model. Then we discuss the qualitative properties of equilibria at infinity for global tendencies. Therefore, global dynamical behaviors of this system are obtained in the end. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
