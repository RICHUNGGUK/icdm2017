The proposed ANN GA algorithm is able to find a stochastic frontier based on a set of input-output observational data and do not require explicit assumptions about the functional structure of the stochastic frontier. Furthermore, it uses a similar approach to econometric methods for calculating the efficiency scores. Moreover, the effect of the return to scale of decision making unit (DMU) on its efficiency is included and the unit used for the correction is selected based on its scale (under constant return to scale assumption). Also, in this algorithm, GA is used to cluster DMUs to increase DMUs' homogeneousness. It should be noted that data envelopment analysis (DEA) is sensitive to the presence of the outliers and statistical noise. It is also not capable of performing prediction and forecasting. This is shown by two examples related to outlier situations. However, the proposed algorithm is capable of handling outliers and noise and DEA is used as a benchmark to show advantages of the proposed algorithm. Also, the proposed algorithm and conventional algorithm are compared in viewpoint of DEA through statistical t-test. The proposed approach is applied to a set of actual conventional power plants to show its applicability and superiority.", "paper_title": "An integrated artificial neural network-genetic algorithm clustering ensemble for performance assessment of decision making units", "paper_id": "WOS:000288222000009"}
