We first develop an analytic closed-form model for the failure probability (FP) of a large digital circuit due to this phenomenon. The new approach accounts for the fact that not every breakdown leads to circuit failure, and shows a 4.8-6.2x relaxation of the predicted lifetime with respect to the pessimistic area-scaling method for nominal process parameters. Next, we extend the failure analysis to include the effect of process variations, and derive that the circuit FP at a specified time instant has a lognormal distribution due to process variations. Circuits with variations show 19%-24% lifetime degradation against nominal analysis and 4.7-5.9x life-time relaxation against area-scaling method under variations. Both parts of our work are verified by extensive simulations and proved to be effective, accurate and scalable.", "paper_title": "Scalable Methods for Analyzing the Circuit Failure Probability Due to Gate Oxide Breakdown", "paper_id": "WOS:000307125500004"}
