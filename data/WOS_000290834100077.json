An alternative approach is presented which uses the control points of the boundary representation (BRep) as design parameters. The sensitivity of the objective function with respect to the design variables is calculated using automatic differentiation (AD). Results for a 2-D aerofoil are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
