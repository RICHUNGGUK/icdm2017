It is intended to help train operators of the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) including astronauts, operators involved in ground-based control of SSRMS and technical support staff. Currently, there is only a single training facility for SSRMS operations and it is heavily scheduled. The training staff time is in heavy demand for teaching students, planning training tasks, developing teaching material, and new teaching tools. For example, all SSRMS simulation exercises are developed by hand and this process requires a lot of staff time. Once in an orbit ISS astronauts currently have only simple web-based material for skill development and maintenance. For long duration space flights, astronauts will require sophisticated simulation tools to maintain skills. Roman Tutor addresses these challenges by providing a portable training tool that can be installed anywhere and anytime to provide \"just in time\" training. It incorporates a model of the system operations curriculum, a kinematic simulation of the robotics equipment, and the ISS, a high performance path planner and an automatic task demonstration generator. For each element of the curriculum that the student is supposed to master, Roman Tutor generates example tasks for the student to accomplish within the simulation environment and then monitors its progression to provide relevant feedback when needed. Although motivated by the SSRMS application, Roman Tutor remains applicable to any telerobotics system application.", "paper_title": "An Intelligent Simulator for Telerobotics Training", "paper_id": "WOS:000301424500003"}
