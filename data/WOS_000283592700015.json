By changing the aspect ratio of the elliptic cylinder, the influence of the initial shape on the evolution of the interface is visualized by a series of dynamic photos utilized by a high-speed camera. It is found that the longer the axis perpendicular to the shock front, the faster and the severer the deformation of the gas cylinder. This can be explained mainly by the different amount of vorticity produced by the misalignment between the density gradient and the pressure gradient. When the vertical axis is much longer than the horizontal axis, the vorticity production is mainly concentrated at the upper and lower corners, which rolls up in time, and results in a structure of big vortex-pair. When the horizontal axis is much longer than the vertical axis, the baroclinic vorticity production distributes at almost every position along the interface, which leads to a faster rolling up of vortices, and even second vortex may develop at later times.", "paper_title": "On interaction of shock wave with elliptic gas cylinder", "paper_id": "WOS:000283592700015"}
