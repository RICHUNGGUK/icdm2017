The validation was performed in three aspects including accuracy, precision and reliability. The accuracy and precision were investigated using a plaster model with 19 marked landmarks. The accuracy was determined by comparing the coordinates from the 3D images and from the coordinates measure machine (CMM). The precision was quantified through the repeated landmarks location on 3D images. The reliability was investigated in 10 adult volunteers. Each was scanned five times in 3 weeks. The 3D images acquired at different times were compared with each other to measure the reliability. We found that the accuracy was 0.93 mm, the precision was 0.79 mm, the reliability was 0.2 mm. These findings suggested that the structured light scanning system was accurate, precise and reliable to record the facial morphology for both clinic and research purposes.
