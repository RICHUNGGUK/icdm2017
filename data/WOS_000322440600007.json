CoCreation can upload the user's pictures and can cluster them as a function of the time at which the pictures were taken. Pictures taken within a short period of time are assumed to highlight a single activity. The user is able to select a cluster and can edit the pictures by dragging icons or drawing on top of them, or by typing words to create a caption. The pictures set the context for a story, while the additional tools such as keyboard and drawing pad allow the user to add information that is considered useful for sharing the experience. The paper presents the detailed design process and the preliminary evaluation of CoCreation with an experienced speech therapist.", "paper_title": "Expressing through digital photographs: an assistive tool for persons with aphasia", "paper_id": "WOS:000322440600007"}
