Traditionally, algorithms of this kind are based on a single condition to search for similar users. In recent years, some scholars have proposed the popular multi-criteria algorithm Skyline Query to search for similar users. However, their proposed methods might have found users not similar to the target user and are subject to the problem of slow execution. To solve these issues, this paper introduces the concepts of neural-based skyline region and neural network. The simulation results have verified the effectiveness and execution efficiency of the target method.", "paper_title": "Finding Similar Users in Social Networks by Using the Neural-Based Skyline Region", "paper_id": "WOS:000359695200001"}
