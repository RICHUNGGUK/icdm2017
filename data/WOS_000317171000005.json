These characteristics can be measured by real life longevity tests. In the present work a bespoke optimization software framework for the design of optimal bicycle frames with respect to the EFBe standard taking into account rider specific demands is developed. For improved efficiency the size and shape optimization are decomposed. The optimization scheme is realized by means of surrogate based optimization where the design of experiments are Optimum Latin Hypercubes created in the feasible portion of the design space.
