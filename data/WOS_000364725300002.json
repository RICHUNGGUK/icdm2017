It is well known that there are many different criteria around. this concept, the complexity being one of them. In this paper, we focus our efforts in reducing the complexity of the fuzzy rule sets. One of the most interesting approaches for learning fuzzy rules is the iterative rule learning approach. It is mainly characterized by obtaining rules covering few examples in final stages, being in most cases useless to represent the knowledge. This behavior is due to the specificity of the extracted rules, which eventually creates more complex set of rules. Thus, we propose a modified version of the iterative rule learning algorithm in order to extract simple rules relaxing this natural trend. The main idea is to change the rule extraction process to be able to obtain more general rules, using pruned searching spaces together with a knowledge simplification scheme able to replace learned rules. The experimental results prove that this purpose is achieved. The new proposal reduces the complexity at both, the rule and rule base levels, maintaining the accuracy regarding to previous versions of the algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
