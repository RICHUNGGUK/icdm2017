In this paper, different Z-type (Zhang type) models based on different Zhang functions (ZFs) are proposed, investigated and simulated for solving the time-varying inverse square root (or in short, TVISR) problem. Then, for the same problem-solving task, different G-type (gradient type) models based on different energy functions (EFs) are developed and investigated as well. Moreover, the convergence analyses of Z-type and G-type models are studied in-depth for the completeness of this paper. Besides, for possible circuit and/or computer realization, Matlab Simulink modeling of Z-type and G-type models is illustrated. Through illustrative examples, the efficacy and superiority of the proposed Z-type and G-type models for TVISR problem solving are verified and substantiated.", "paper_title": "Z-type and G-type models for time-varying inverse square root (TVISR) solving", "paper_id": "WOS:000325822900005"}
