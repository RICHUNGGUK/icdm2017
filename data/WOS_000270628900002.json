It allows intuitive specification and creation of plant structures with L-systems. Construction lines inspired by concept sketches are employed as a way to define and manipulate global-to-local characteristics of L-system models. The overall structure, posture and proportions of the plant are initially sketched by the user as 2D construction line arrangements. They are automatically encoded as a set of positional functions controlling intemode lengths, branching angles, organ sizes, and stem shape. The depth in the stem is specified while sketching its construction line, by modulating input pen pressure as depth values. This is also inspired by line depth modulation techniques used in traditional illustration. The resulting positional functions are then used to parameterize pre-defined L-system templates representing phyllotactic patterns guiding the positioning of lateral organ surfaces such as leaves and petals. Results are presented for single monopodial plant structures, all generated from simple input construction line sketches. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
