Specifically, a method called loop flattening, which reduces the evaluation of the timing statistics in the complex highly structured circuit to that of a single chain of component circuits, is justified. Then, to very quickly evaluate the timing delay of a single chain, a statistical method based on importance sampling augmented with targeted high-dimensional spherical sampling can be employed. The overall methodology has shown 650x or greater speedup over the nominal Monte Carlo approach with 10.5% accuracy in probability. Examples based on both the large-signal and small-signal SRAM read path are discussed, and a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art accelerated statistical simulation techniques is given.", "paper_title": "Technique for Efficient Evaluation of SRAM Timing Failure", "paper_id": "WOS:000322380600019"}
