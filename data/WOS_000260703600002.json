We consider the case where all order is picked and shipped only when all items in the order is available in the inventory; and the unfulfilled orders are transferred to the next day with higher priority. Given daily inventory and a set of orders arrived during a day, the problem is to assign the inventory to the orders so as to maximize the order fill rate (OFR). We formulate this problem as a linear programming problem. We also consider the weighted OFR to reflect the importance of each order. Simulation results indicate that the proposed LP approach outperforms the existing simple rules; and, more importantly, the improvement ratio increases as the number of items and/or orders increases.
