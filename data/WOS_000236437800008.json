More precisely, in a lattice network augmented by extra random edges (but not chosen uniformly), a short path of polylogarithmic expected length can be found using a greedy algorithm with a local knowledge of the nodes. We call such a graph a navigable small-world since short paths exist and can be followed with partial knowledge of the network. In this paper, we show that a wide class of graphs can be augmented into navigable small-worlds. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
