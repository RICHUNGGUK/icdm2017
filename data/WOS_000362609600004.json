This paper presents an approach, called the \"bag of lemons\", which enables crowd to filter ideas with accuracy superior to conventional (Likert scale) rating approaches, but in only a fraction of the time. The key insight behind this approach is that crowds are much better at eliminating bad ideas than at identifying good ones. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
