It consists of two phases. The algorithm first minimizes a piecewise linear approximation of the Lagrangian, subject to a linearization of the constraints, to determine a working set. Then, an equality constrained subproblem based on this working set and using second derivative information is solved in order to promote fast convergence. A study of the local and global convergence properties of the algorithm highlights the importance of the placement of the interpolation points that determine the piecewise linear model of the Lagrangian.", "paper_title": "On the use of piecewise linear models in nonlinear programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000313797100012"}
