The practical implementation of the method has been recently optimized by means of efficient and reliable relays. However, two problems remain still open. The first is to determine the optimal electrical connection among the panels that ensures the maximum power produced at the actual irradiance conditions, while the latter is to constrain the computation time of such optimal configuration to fit the need of real time applications. We present an evolutionary approach to the first problem. It is designed for allowing a straightforward porting to an embedded system and it is aimed at reconfiguring photovoltaic panels, thus not modules like some other approaches do in literature. Simulation results confirm the reliability and convergence capabilities of the proposed method and encourage further work for the adoption of the algorithm in real time applications. The problem of minimizing the computation time is also addressed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
