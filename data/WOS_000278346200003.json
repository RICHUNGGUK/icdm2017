The core spreading method with spatial adaptation is selected as the viscous diffusion scheme of the vortex method. The shear rate is chosen so that it matches the maximum value observed in a fully developed channel flow. The isosurface, anisotropy tensors, and joint probability density functions reflect the ability of the present vortex method to quantitatively reproduce the anisotropic nature of strongly sheared turbulence, both instantaneously and statistically.
