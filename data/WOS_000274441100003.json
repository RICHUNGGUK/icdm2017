Using a real-world WSN deployment and a realistic implementation of an attacker, we analyze this protection scheme and demonstrate that neither position change, transmission power manipulation, nor complete knowledge of wireless parameters can help an attacker to successfully attack the network. As a result, this work demonstrates how the chaotic nature of radio communication, which is often considered a disadvantage in regard to security objectives, can be exploited to enhance protection and support implementation of lightweight security mechanisms.
