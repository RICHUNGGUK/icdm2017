Noise introduced and noise propagation has been analyzed according to the integral formula of reconstructing CT image. Through analyzing and deducing we get the Signal Noise Ratio which is influenced by position noise in the special position of some simple situation. Furthermore, having provided the result of SNR in other position by utilizing the method of numerical computation and having got the conclusion that the SNR is dropped in the position of edge of image and the main part of the image is almost not impacted. The simulative image agrees well with the conclusion. The result provides theoretic reference for confining the shaking quantity of the rotating axis in large CT system.", "paper_title": "Effects on density resolution of CT image caused by nonstationary axis of rotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300097"}
