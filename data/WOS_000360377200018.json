Pixel positions permutation and pixel values shuffling are both implemented via the cryptosystem proposed. In the permutation process, H,non map is employed. In the shuffling stage, the merits of spatiotemporal chaos and compound chaos are combined. To enhance the security, an interception key and a modulation key based on the plain image are designed, which make the scheme robust against the known- and chosen-plaintext attacks and enlarge the key space as well. Experimental results and relevant security analysis show that the proposed cipher algorithm can provide adequate security for the confidentiality of images. In addition, compared with other competitive existing chaos-based image encryption schemes, the new algorithm has superiority in aspects such as key space, key sensitivity, plaintext sensitivity, and execution efficiency.", "paper_title": "A novel image encryption scheme based on Henon map and compound spatiotemporal chaos", "paper_id": "WOS:000360377200018"}
