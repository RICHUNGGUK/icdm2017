Wildland simulators, used to predict fire behavior, can give erroneous forecasts due to lack of precision for certain dynamic input parameters. Developing methods to avoid such parameter problems can improve significantly the fire behavior prediction. In this paper, two methods are evaluated, involving statistical and uncertainty schemes. In each one, the number of simulations that must be carried out is enormous and it is necessary to apply high-performance computing techniques to make the methodology feasible. These techniques have been implemented in parallel schemes and tested in Linux cluster using MPI.", "paper_title": "Improved prediction methods for wildfires using high performance computing: A comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200069"}
