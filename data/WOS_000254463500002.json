We outline modest extensions to a commercial workflow engine so it will automatically capture provenance at workflow runtime. We also present an approach to store this provenance data in a relational database. Finally, we demonstrate how core provenance queries in the challenge can be expressed in SQL and discuss the merits of our layered representation.
