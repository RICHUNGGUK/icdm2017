Due to its inherent complexity, many theoretical and applied techniques have been applied to the investigation of agent team architecture with respect to coordination, cooperation, and learning skills. In this paper, we discuss agent team architecture and analyse how to adapt the simulation system for investigating agent team architecture, learning abilities, and other specific behaviors.", "paper_title": "Teamwork and simulation in hybrid cognitive architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600061"}
