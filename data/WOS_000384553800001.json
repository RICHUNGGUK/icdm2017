This process is called ltering, where pixels are ltered through a color lter array, and the Bayer lter is perhaps the most common lter used today. This means that the missing color channels must be restored in the image or the video frame in a post-processing step, i.e., a process referred to as debayering. In a live video scenario, this operation must be performed eciently in order to output each video frame in real-time, while also yielding acceptable visual quality. Here, the authors evaluate debayering algorithms implemented on a GPU for realtime panoramic video recordings using multiple 2K-resolution cameras.", "paper_title": "An Experimental Evaluation of Debayering Algorithms on GPUs for Recording Panoramic Video in Real-Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000384553800001"}
