The proposed placement and routing relies on reducing the switching activities in local regions in the FPGA fabric to improve the pro. le of the supply voltage distribution. The proposed techniques reduce IR-drops and the variance of the supply voltage distribution across all the nodes in the power grid network. The proposed CAD techniques are efficient as they do not require solving the power grid model at every placement and routing iteration. A reduction of up to 53% in maximum IR-drop and up to 66% reduction in standard deviation of V-dd is obtained from the design techniques proposed in this paper with an average impact of 3% on circuit delay.", "paper_title": "IR-Drop Management in FPGAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000278038300012"}
