Besides, owing to the increasing complexity of decision, the uncertainty of evaluation also increases. Therefore, this study proposes a dynamic decision making model which takes the TOPSIS technique as main structure, integrating the concepts of grey number and Minkowski distance function into it to deal with the uncertain information and aggregate the multi-period evaluations. A subcontractor selection example is adopted to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed model. Results show that the proposed model is efficient and robust, and quite good for real-world applications. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
