A Conjecture of Nowicki (Conjecture 6.9.10 in [Nowicki, A. 1994. Polynomial derivations and their rings of constants, Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Mikolaja Kopernika, Torun]) states the following ker delta(n) = k[X(1) , . . . , X(n), X(i)Y(j)-XjYi: 1 <= i < j <= n] in which case we say that delta(n) is standard. In this paper, we use the elimination theory of Groebner bases to prove that Nowicki's conjecture holds in the more general case of the derivation D = Sigma(n)(i=1) X(i) partial derivative/partial derivative Y(i), t(i) is an element of Z(>= 0). In [Kojima, H. Miyanishi, M. 1997. On Robert's counterexample to the fourteenth problem of Hilbert, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 122, 277-292], Kojima and Miyanishi argued that D is standard in the case where t(i) = t (i = 1, . . . n) for some t >= 3. Although the result is true, we show in this paper that their proof is not complete. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
