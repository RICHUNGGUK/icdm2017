Many biomedical systems use heterogeneous data structures and incompatible software components, so integration of software components into a system can be hindered by incompatibilities between the components of the system. This paper presents an XML web service and web application program for predicting ribosomal frameshifts from genomic sequences. Experimental results show that the web service of the program is useful for resolving many problems with incompatible software components as well as for predicting frameshifts of diverse types. The web service is available at http://wilab.inha.ac.kr/fsfinder2.", "paper_title": "Web service for finding ribosomal frameshifts", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200037"}
