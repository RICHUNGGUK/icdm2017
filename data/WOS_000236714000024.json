The peak envelope power (PEP) of 64-QAM Golay sequences is shown to be bounded by 4.66n. The new construction of 64-QAM Golay sequences of length n = 2(m) is based on our earlier construction of new offsets of 16-QAM Golay sequences which are also presented here. The total number of offsets of 64-QAM Golay sequences is 496 for m = 2,808 for m = 3 and 976 for m = 4, obtained by computer search. We also computed the PEP distribution for 64-QAM Golay sequences for m = 2, m = 3, and m = 4.", "paper_title": "A new construction of 64-QAM Golay complementary sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000236714000024"}
