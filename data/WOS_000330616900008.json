Latent variable models, or embedding methods, that simultaneously learn semantic representations of object labels and image representations can provide tractable solutions on such tasks. In this work, we are interested in jointly learning representations both for the objects in an image, and the parts of those objects, because such deeper semantic representations could bring a leap forward in image retrieval or browsing. Despite the size of these datasets, the amount of annotated data for objects and parts can be costly and may not be available. In this paper, we propose to bypass this cost with a method able to learn to jointly label objects and parts without requiring exhaustively labeled data. We design a model architecture that can be trained under a proxy supervision obtained by combining standard image annotation (from ImageNet) with semantic part-based within-label relations (from WordNet). The model itself is designed to model both object image to object label similarities, and object label to object part label similarities in a single joint system. Experiments conducted on our combined data and a precisely annotated evaluation set demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Learning semantic representations of objects and their parts", "paper_id": "WOS:000330616900008"}
