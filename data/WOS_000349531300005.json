We explicitly distinguish between observations, i.e., facts that an epistemic agent observes or is being told, and rules representing general knowledge about the considered world. When new information becomes available respective sets are being altered in a different way to preserve parts of knowledge during the revision process. Such an approach allows us to deal with difficult and complex scenarios, involving defeasible information and derivation filtering, with common-sense results.", "paper_title": "Consistency-based Revision of Structured Belief Bases", "paper_id": "WOS:000349531300005"}
