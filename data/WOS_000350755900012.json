The algorithm sets the initial step size and the final step size as the adaptive step size to guide the global search of the algorithm, and it is applied to 20 famous benchmark functions for a test, the results of which show that the AIWO algorithm owns better global optimization search capacity, faster convergence speed and higher computation accuracy compared with other advanced algorithms.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Invasive Weed Optimization Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000350755900012"}
