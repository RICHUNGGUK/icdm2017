However, it still lacks a physically plausible explanation about why SSC is a better model than conventional sparse coding for the class of natural images. Meanwhile, the problem of sparsity optimization, especially when tangled with dictionary learning, is computationally difficult to solve. In this paper, we take a low-rank approach toward SSC and provide a conceptually simple interpretation from a bilateral variance estimation perspective, namely that singular-value decomposition of similar packed patches can be viewed as pooling both local and nonlocal information for estimating signal variances. Such perspective inspires us to develop a new class of image restoration algorithms called spatially adaptive iterative singular-value thresholding (SAIST). For noise data, SAIST generalizes the celebrated BayesShrink from local to nonlocal models; for incomplete data, SAIST extends previous deterministic annealing-based solution to sparsity optimization through incorporating the idea of dictionary learning. In addition to conceptual simplicity and computational efficiency, SAIST has achieved highly competent (often better) objective performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods in image denoising and completion experiments. Our subjective quality results compare favorably with those obtained by existing techniques, especially at high noise levels and with a large amount of missing data.", "paper_title": "Nonlocal Image Restoration With Bilateral Variance Estimation: A Low-Rank Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000314717800024"}
