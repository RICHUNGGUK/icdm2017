In this method a grid coarsening algorithm is required. Here, an agglomeration scheme is introduced which is applicable in both cell-center and cell-vertex 2 and 3D discretizations. A new implicit formulation is presented which results in better computation efficiency when added to the multigrid scheme. A few simple procedures are also proposed and applied to provide even higher convergence acceleration. The Euler equations are solved on an unstructured grid around standard transonic configurations to validate the algorithm and to assess its superiority to conventional explicit agglomeration schemes. The scheme is applied to 2 and 3D test cases using both cell-center and cell- vertex discretizations.
