Various topologies with different properties have been proposed so far and each one is suitable for specific applications. Pyramid interconnection networks have potentially powerful architecture for many applications such as image processing, visualization, and data mining. The major advantage of pyramids which is important for image processing systems is hierarchical abstracting and transferring the data toward the apex node, just like the human being vision system, which reach to an object from an image. There are rapidly growing applications in which the multidimensional datasets should be processed simultaneously. For such a system, we need a symmetric and expandable interconnection network to process data from different directions and forward them toward the apex. In this paper, a new type of pyramid interconnection network called Non-Flat Surface Level (NFSL) pyramid is proposed. NFSL pyramid interconnection networks constructed by L-level A-lateral-base pyramids that are named basic-pyramids. So, the apex node is surrounded by the level-one surfaces of NFSL that are the first nearest level of nodes to apex in the basic pyramids. Two topologies which are called NFSL-T and NFSL-Q originated from Trilateral-base and Quadrilateral-base basic-pyramids are studied to exemplify the proposed structure. To evaluate the proposed architecture, the most important properties of the networks are determined and compared with those of the standard pyramid networks and its variants.", "paper_title": "Nonflat surface level pyramid: a high connectivity multidimensional interconnection network", "paper_id": "WOS:000329111400002"}
