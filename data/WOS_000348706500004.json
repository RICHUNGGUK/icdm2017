The D2D user can reuse the uplink resource of the cellular system. With the help of the stochastic geometry, we model the HetNets by homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP) and get a system capacity optimisation issue with cellular and D2D outage constraints. By utilising convex optimisation we first derive the optimal value of the user density on each band in closed-form. Then, we proposed an algorithm to search the optimal HetNets transmission capacity on the feasible region of the user mode proportion. Combine the results before, the maximum transmission capacity of the HetNets is obtained. Finally from the simulation, we not only verify the convergence of the algorithm but also show the maximum transmission capacity of the HetNets on multiple bands as well.", "paper_title": "Optimal user and mode proportion allocation for cellular and device-to-device (D2D) heterogeneous networks on multi-bands with outage constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000348706500004"}
