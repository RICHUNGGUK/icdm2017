The effect of self-gravity of the gas in the 2D disk can be important in confronting observations and numerical simulations in detail. For use in such applications, a new method for the calculation of the gravitational force of a 2D disk is presented. Instead of solving the complete potential function problem, we calculate the force in infinite planes in Cartesian and polar coordinates by a reproducing kernel method. Under the limitation of a 2D disk, we specifically represent the force as a double summation of a convolution of the surface density and a fundamental kernel and employ a fast Fourier transform technique. In this method, the entire computational complexity can be reduced from O(N-2 x N-2) to O(N-2(log(2)N)(2)), where N is the number of zones in one dimension. This approach does not require softening. The proposed method is similar to a spectral method, but without the necessity of imposing a periodic boundary condition. We further show this approach is of near second order accuracy for a smooth surface density in a Cartesian coordinate system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
