The proposed control strategy enables the CP circuit free of the threshold-voltage drops, the body effect, and the floating substrate terminals of pass devices. The on-resistance of each pass device is also reduced to improve the gain and the power efficiency of the CP circuit. Implemented in a 0.35-mu m single n-well CMOS process, the proposed four-stage monolithic CP circuit can operate with a supply voltage down to 0.9 V and deliver a maximum output current of about 100 mu A. The proposed CP circuit also achieves a high voltage gain of 4 with two complementary-phase nonoverlapping clock signals.", "paper_title": "Gain-Enhanced Monolithic Charge Pump With Simultaneous Dynamic Gate and Substrate Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000315639900022"}
