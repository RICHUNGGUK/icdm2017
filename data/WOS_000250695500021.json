Given an image, many previous interest point detectors first assign interest strength to each image point using a certain filtering technique, and then apply non-maximum suppression scheme to select a set of interest point candidates. However, we observe that non-maximum suppression tends to over-suppress good candidates for a weakly textured image such as a face image. We propose a new candidate selection scheme that chooses image points whose zero-/first-order intensities can be clustered into two imbalanced classes (in size), as candidates. Our tests of repeatability across image rotations and lighting conditions show the advantage of imbalance oriented selection. We further present a new face recognition application-facial identity representability evaluation-to show the value of imbalance oriented selection. (c) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society.
