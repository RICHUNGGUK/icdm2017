Successful application of sensor-based fixtures depends on the development of new variation reduction methodologies to predict part quality in MMPs and detect the critical machining stations whose critical manufacturing variations can be estimated by installing a suitable sensor-based fixture. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to facilitate the implementation of sensor-based fixtures in MMPs. This methodology involves three key steps: (1) an identification of station-induced variations: (2) a sensor placement optimization method for designing sensor-based fixtures; and (3) a compensability analysis. A case study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
