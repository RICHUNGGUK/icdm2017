Such a tool can provide increased familiarity with unknown third party entities, e.g. service providers, especially when those entities neither project completely trustworthy nor totally untrustworthy behaviour. Indeed, developing some metrics for trust evaluation under uncertainty can come handy, e.g., for customers interested in evaluating the trustworthiness of an unknown service provider throughout queries to other customers of unknown reliability. In this research, we propose an evaluation metric to estimate the degree of trustworthiness of an unknown agent, say a(D), through the information acquired through a group of agents who have interacted with agent a(D). This group of agents is assumed to have an unknown degree of reliability. In order to tackle the uncertainty associated with the trust of these set of unknown agents, we suggest to use possibility distributions. Later, we introduce a new certainty metric to measure the degree of agreement in the information reported by the group of agents in A on agent a(D). Fusion rules are then used to measure an estimation of the agent a(D)'s degree of trustworthiness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that estimates trust, out of empirical data, subject to some uncertainty, in a discrete multi-valued trust domain. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to validate the proposed tools and metrics.", "paper_title": "UNCERTAINTY-BASED TRUST ESTIMATION IN A MULTI-VALUED TRUST ENVIRONMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000326345900004"}
