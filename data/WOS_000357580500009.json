It saves citizens and the government both time and money. This study examined adoption of e-Government supply side by looking at the UTAUT as a model of technology acceptance. Furthermore, specific variables that were proposed to moderate relationships within the UTAUT were analyzed including locus of control, perceived organizational support, affective and normative commitment, and procedural justice. Data from one sample indicated that in general, the UTAUT model was supported, however, the moderators proved non-significant. Implications are discussed for the technology acceptance process as technologies are implemented within countries and suggestions for future research in this area are discussed. This research sought to demonstrate the robustness of trust-based UTAUT to address e-Government adoption concerns. As a consequence, it was the responsibility of the researcher to select research questions, operational variables, research approaches, and research techniques, within the scope of the study. The research hypotheses formulated in this study were based on the technology acceptance literature covering the original UTAUT model with the inclusion of the trust construct. This quantitative study was conducted with help of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model.
