The spectral equations of plate elements containing in-plane and out-of-plane components are established using spectral element method (SEM). The spectral stiffness matrix of whole structure is assembled. Frequency responses are obtained by calculating the spectral equations. Numerical results show that SEM can be effectively applied to study vibration band gap properties of sandwich panels with corrugated cores. Comparing with the results by finite element method (FEM) indicates that more accurate results can be achieved by SEM. The unit cell number, structural damping, material property, plate thickness and core form have obvious influences on structural dynamic characteristics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
