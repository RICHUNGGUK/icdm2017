As one of the most popular approaches to simulate realistic fluid effects, physically-based fluid animation has spurred a large number of new results in recent years. We classify and discuss the existing methods within three categories: Lagrangian method, Eulerian method and Lattice-Boltzmann method. We then introduce techniques for seven different kinds of special fluid effects. Finally we review the latest hot research areas and point out some future research trends, including surface tracking, fluid control, hybrid method, model reduction, etc.", "paper_title": "Physically-based fluid animation: A survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000266094200001"}
