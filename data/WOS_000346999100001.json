The models of cooperative localization with incomplete measurements are presented and the Kalman filtering algorithm is applied for target tracking. For improving tracking precision, a strategy of observers path planning based on the gradient of circular error probability (CEP) is integrated into the Kalman filtering algorithm. Several numerical examples are used to illustrate the tracking performance of the proposed algorithm with the corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) and Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). The Monte Carlo simulation results validate the effectiveness of the presented algorithm.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Target Localization and Tracking with Incomplete Measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000346999100001"}
