Our algorithm, conceptually similar to shadow mapping, consists of two main parts: creation of a caustic map texture, and utilization of the map to render caustics onto nonshiny surfaces. Our approach avoids performing any expensive geometric tests, such as ray-object intersection, and involves no precomputation; both of which are common features in previous work. The algorithm is well suited for the standard rasterization pipeline and runs entirely on the graphics hardware.", "paper_title": "Caustics mapping: An image-space technique for real-time caustics", "paper_id": "WOS:000243389100007"}
