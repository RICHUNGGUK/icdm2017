ENC translates the requirements of the application layer into messages that are diffused locally with the purpose of clustering multi-modal sensor nodes in the vicinity of an event and dynamically changing the local network topology, all to enhance the quality of the multi-modal data fusion. ENC is implemented in NS-2 to show its applicability for tracking a mobile target in an urban scenario using a network of pressure, video, and magnetic sensors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
