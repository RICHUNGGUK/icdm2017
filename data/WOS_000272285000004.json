A good process plan of a part is built up based on two elements: (1) optimized sequence of the operations of the part; and (2) optimized selection of the machine, cutting tool and tool access direction (TAD) for each operation. On the other hand, two levels of planning in the process planning is suggested: (1) preliminary and (2) secondary and detailed planning. In this paper for the preliminary stage, the feasible sequences of operations are generated based on the analysis of constraints and using a genetic algorithm (GA). Then in the detailed planning stage, using a genetic algorithm again which prunes the initial feasible sequences, the optimized operations sequence and the optimized selection of the machine, cutting tool, and TAD for each operation are obtained. By applying the proposed GA in two levels of planning, the CAPP system can generate optimal or near-optimal process plans based on a selected criterion. A number of case studies are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed algorithm. This algorithm performs well on all the test problems, exceeding or matching the solution quality of the results reported in the literature for most problems. The main contribution of this work is to emerge the preliminary and detailed planning, implementation of compulsive and additive constraints, optimization sequence of the operations of the part, and optimization selection of machine, cutting tool and TAD for each operation using the proposed GA, simultaneously.
