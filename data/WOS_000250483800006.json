This work presents a new formulation for tackling the fringing field, in which the effect of fringing field is modeled as a variable serial capacitor. Based on this model, a robust control scheme is constructed using the theory of input-to-state stabilization (ISS) and backstepping state feedback design. This method allows loosening the stringent requirements on modeling accuracy without compromising the performance. The stability and the performance of the system using this control scheme are demonstrated through both stability analysis and numerical simulation.", "paper_title": "A new formulation of fringing capacitance and its application to the control of parallel-plate electrostatic micro actuators", "paper_id": "WOS:000250483800006"}
