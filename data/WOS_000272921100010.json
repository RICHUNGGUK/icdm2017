A first order well-balanced finite volume numerical scheme for 2D shallow-water systems is considered. The potential data parallelism of this method is identified and the scheme is efficiently implemented on GPUs for one-layer shallow-water systems. Numerical experiments performed on several GPUs show the high efficiency of the GPU solver in comparison with a highly optimized implementation of a CPU solver. (C) 2009 IMACS.
