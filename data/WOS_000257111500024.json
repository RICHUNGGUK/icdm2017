After the piecewise analysis of extrinsic information transfer functions for Gallager decoding algorithm B (GB), the normalized switch scheme (NSS), for which the majority-based algorithms and GB are two examples, is proposed. Then, several other examples of NSSs are presented and their convergence properties are analyzed based on the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) functions. In simulations, the proposed NSSs show meaningful performance improvements and less sensitivity to channel parameter underestimations compared with GB for mall and moderate block length codes.", "paper_title": "Switch-type hybrid hard decision decoding algorithms for regular low-density parity-check codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000257111500024"}
