However, before elicited knowledge can be represented, it must be integrated and transformed so the knowledge engineer can understand it. This research identifies the need to separate knowledge representation into human comprehension and computational reasoning and shows that this will lead to better knowledge representation. Modeling of human comprehension is called conceptual knowledge representation. The Conceptual Knowledge Representation Scheme is developed and validated by conducting a combined qualitative/quantitative repeated-measures experiment comparing the Conceptual Knowledge Representation Scheme to two computation-oriented ones. The results demonstrate that the Conceptual Knowledge Representation Scheme better facilitates human comprehension than existing representation schemes. Four principles of the Conceptual Knowledge Representation Scheme emerge that help to attain effective knowledge representation. These are: (1) a focus on human comprehension only, (2) design around natural language, (3) addition of constructs common in the domain, and (4) constructs for representing abstract versions of detailed concepts.", "paper_title": "Knowledge Representation: A Conceptual Modeling Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000308600100001"}
