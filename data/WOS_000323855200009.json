Therefore, in nano-scaled CMOS technology, the reduction of soft error rate and leakage current is the most important challenge in designing field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). To overcome these difficulties, based on the observations that most configuration bit-streams of FPGA are zeros across different designs and that configuration memory cells are not directly involved with signal propagation delays in FPGA, this paper presents a new family of configuration memory cells for FPGAs in nano-scaled CMOS technology. When zeros are stored in the cells, the injected glitch due to particle strike is removed from the stroked node by pull-up or pull-down network of the cells. Thus, our proposed cells are completely hardened and cannot flip from particle strikes at the sensitive cell nodes when zeros are stored in the cells. Furthermore, in the proposed cells, when zeros are stored, the sub-threshold leakage current components are reduced by using stacks of transistors in series. These new cells are port-less and the storage nodes of cells are manipulated through the transistors which apply the supply voltages to the cell. Simulation results show that the proposed cells are working correctly during their configuration and idle cycles and that our cells have a lower soft error rate and leakage current in 22-nm, as well as 65-nm technologies.
