Cutout of those repeated elements usually involves tedious and laborious user interaction by previous image segmentation methods. In this paper, we present RepSnapping, a novel method oriented to cutout of repeated scene elements with much less user interaction. By exploring inherent similarity between repeated elements, a new optimization model is introduced to thread correlated elements in the segmentation procedure. The model proposed here enables efficient solution using max-flow/min cut on an extended graph. Experiments indicate that RepSnapping facilitates cutout of repeated elements better than the state-of-the-art interactive image segmentation and repetition detection methods.", "paper_title": "RepSnapping: Efficient Image Cutout for Repeated Scene Elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000296915400021"}
