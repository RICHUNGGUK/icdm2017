We consider threats from malicious adversaries that can deviate from the designated protocol and change their input databases. We classify malicious adversaries into two widely existing subclasses, namely, weakly and strongly malicious adversaries, and propose protocols that can effectively and efficiently protect privacy against malicious adversaries.", "paper_title": "Privacy protection against malicious adversaries in distributed information sharing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000256894000003"}
