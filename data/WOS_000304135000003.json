The paper discusses the architecture of the Cell Broadband Engine from an image processing perspective. The results of the implementation are also presented and compared to the results obtained using desktop processing devices such as CPUs and GPUs, and shows that the computational power of the Cell Broadband Engine can be used to implement image processing algorithms in real-time.", "paper_title": "Real-time disparity map computation using the cell broadband engine", "paper_id": "WOS:000304135000003"}
