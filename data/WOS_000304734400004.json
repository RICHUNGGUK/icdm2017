For many applications visualizing such images on computer screens is sufficient, however there are cases where there is a need to combine the chemical images more naturally with human vision. This is especially true for interactive work where chemical images are being rapidly updated to the user. Effective integration of spatial information in general from external sources with vision is a challenge. One approach is to overlay the view of the real physical world with computer-generated graphics as in augmented reality. However such cluttering of the visual field with computer-generated graphics may confuse the user and reduce functionality. Another is projecting the chemical images back onto the scene under study in order to render the chemical information in situ to the user. This approach, however has challenges in connection with very small and very large scenes under investigation. An alternative approach is here investigated based on the possibility of enhancing the human vision system using a sensory substitution device. Such devices enables a person to sense spatial information conveyed through sensory channels other than the eye, such as hearing and sense of touch. Results presented support the claim that spatial chemical information from a hyperspectral camera can be conveyed to the brain through a sensory channel different from the eyes. As this is tested on a sighted subject it effectively provides an extension of the human vision system to incorporate chemical information which otherwise is invisible to the naked eye.
