These grammars are investigated with respect to their descriptional complexity, i.e., we determine the number of nonterminal symbols and the number of production rules of G(n) as functions of n. As in the case of Chomsky normal form, these descriptional complexity measures grow faster than any polynomial function. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
