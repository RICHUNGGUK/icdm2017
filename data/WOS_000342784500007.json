This paper proposes a novel personality model based on the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R). Compared to the popular Big-Five-Personality Factors (Big5) model, our proposed model is more capable than Big5 on describing a variety of personalities. Combining with emotion models it helps to produce more reasonable emotional reactions to external stimuli. A novel Resistant formulation is also proposed to effectively simulate the complicated negative emotions. Emotional reactions towards multiple stimuli are also effectively simulated with the proposed personality model.", "paper_title": "A Personality Model Based on NEO PI-R for Emotion Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784500007"}
