However, methods used for this purpose, their accuracy, and their dependence on the sampling and averaging schemes are still ambiguous. Macroscopic properties at any point of a molecular domain can be extracted via sampling and averaging of molecular behavior within a control region around that point, called a bin. The size of this bin has a significant impact on the accuracy of the macroscopic properties' measurement. In this research, we will focus on the measurement of mean flow velocity using binning method'. On the basis of the results of this study, the most appropriate range of the bin size in which mean velocity can be measured accurately is determined. Although this range is determined based on the measurement of mean flow velocity, we believe that it can be used to estimate the proper range for the measurement of other flow quantities as well.
