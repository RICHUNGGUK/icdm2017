It has turned out that continuous choice is unnecessary in this context, and that a weak form of the fan theorem suffices which holds in the presence of countable choice. In particular, the contrapositive of countable binary choice is valid in Bishop-style constructive mathematics. We further discuss a generalisation of this result and link it to Ishihara's boundedness principle BD-N.", "paper_title": "On Choice Principles and Fan Theorems", "paper_id": "WOS:000289720300005"}
