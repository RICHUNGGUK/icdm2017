Although it is possible to carry out exact inference using partial observations of a stochastic process, it is often computationally impractical. In this paper we use the moment closure approximation of the underlying stochastic process as a fast approximation of the likelihood. We show that this approximation is fast and accurate, even when the population numbers are small.", "paper_title": "Moment closure based parameter inference of stochastic kinetic models", "paper_id": "WOS:000313731700012"}
