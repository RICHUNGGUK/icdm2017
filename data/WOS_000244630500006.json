Econometrica 61, 123-137] from the econometrics point of view, and most recently attracted much attention from the classification literature due to its close relationship with the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve [Baker, 2003.

Compared with its nice theoretical properties and successful applications, the MRC estimator's computational aspects are not trivial. This is because the MRC objective function is neither smooth nor continuous. Therefore, the traditional Newton-Raphson type algorithm cannot be used to find the MRC estimator. As an easy solution, we propose it. this article a very simple fitting algorithm named iterative marginal optimization (IMO), which guarantees a monotone increasing of the MRC objective function at each iteration step in a very efficient manner. We show via extensive simulation that the proposed IMO algorithm is not only computationally stable but also reasonably fast. Moreover, real data about the China stock market are analyzed to further illustrate the usefulness of the proposed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
