Taking into account the increasing number of sensors vehicles are provided with, the present work states that it is possible to perceive the context of a vehicle by processing and fusioning the data of some of them. As a result, an on-board context-aware application that processes the usual itineraries of the Ego Vehicle as part of the vehicular context has been implemented. Particularly, the system follows a Complex Event Processing (CEP) approach, and it is able to detect the vehicular occupancy along with the meaningful points of the frequent itineraries whereby a density-based-cluster algorithm. Test results from simulations and real environments show the accuracy of the system when it comes to detect different types of itineraries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
