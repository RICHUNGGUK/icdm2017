To secure communications between a client and a server through a low power computing device, several AKE-LPC (Authenticated Key Exchange - for Low Power Computing clients) protocols have been proposed recently. This paper proposes a new efficient AKE-LPC protocol, which requires the client to perform only one hash operation during the execution phase. An augmented protocol which can additionally provide explicit mutual authentication is also presented. Furthermore, the security of the proposed protocols is formally proven in the random oracle model. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
