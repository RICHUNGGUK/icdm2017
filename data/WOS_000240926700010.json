However, Vdd-level converters used in the existing Vdd-programmable method consume a large amount of leakage. This paper proposes two ways to avoid using level converters in interconnects, namely; 1) tree-based level converter insertion (TLC) and 2) dual-Vdd tree-based level converter insertion (dTLC). TLC enforces that there is only one Vdd level within each routing tree, while dTLC can have different Vdd levels within a routing tree, but no VddL switch drives VddH switches. Dual-Vdd assignment algorithms were developed considering chip-level time slack allocation for maximum power reduction. The algorithms include TLC-S and dTLC-S, two power sensitivity-based algorithms with implicit time slack allocation, and dTLC-LP, a linear programming (LP)-based algorithm with explicit time slack allocation., All allocate time slack first to interconnects with higher power sensitivity and assign low Vdd to them for more power reduction. Experiments show that dTLC-LP obtains the lowest power consumption. Compared to dTLC-LP, dTLC-S obtains a slightly higher power consumption but runs three times faster. Compared to the existing segment-based level converter insertion for dual Vdd, dTLC-LP reduces interconnect power by 52.90% without performance loss for Microelectronics Center of North Carolina benchmark circuits.", "paper_title": "Dual-Vdd interconnect with chip-level time slack allocation for FPGA power reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000240926700010"}
