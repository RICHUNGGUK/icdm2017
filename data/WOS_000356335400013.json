The model proposed in this paper also regards the elastic increment of decision-making risk, background risk, and other financial risks. In order to solve this model, we present a modified evolutionary algorithm called modified chaos fruit fly optimization algorithm, which is more adequate when a quick and efficient solution is needed. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effect of the background risk on portfolio selection.", "paper_title": "A New Fuzzy Portfolio Model Based on Background Risk Using MCFOA", "paper_id": "WOS:000356335400013"}
