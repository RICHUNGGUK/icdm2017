This work addresses this problem using antibody responses to protein markers measured by a novel high-throughput microarray technology. The findings from this study have direct relevance to rapid, broad-based diagnostic and vaccine development. Results: Protein microarray chips are probed with sera from individuals infected with the bacteria Francisella tularensis, a category A biodefense pathogen. A two-step approach to the diagnostic process is presented ( 1) feature ( antigen) selection and ( 2) classification using antigen response measurements obtained from F. tularensis microarrays ( 244 antigens, 46 infected and 54 healthy human sera measurements). To select antigens, a ranking scheme based on the identification of significant immune responses and differential expression analysis is described. Classification methods including k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines (SVM) and k-Means clustering are applied to training data using selected antigen sets of various sizes. SVM based models yield prediction accuracy rates in the range of similar to 90% on validation data, when antigen set sizes are between 25 and 50. These results strongly indicate that the top-ranked antigens can be considered high-priority candidates for diagnostic development.", "paper_title": "From protein microarrays to diagnostic antigen discovery: a study of the pathogen Francisella tularensis", "paper_id": "WOS:000248620400084"}
