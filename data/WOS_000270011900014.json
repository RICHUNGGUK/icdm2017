First, an overview is given of specific areas of Slovenia's land, considered as zones. Then. the system, which explores the computational power of today's clients is briefly introduced. Some features of the geometric and topological system (GTS), is introduced. This application has been used successfully for 3 years and has turned out to be effective and stable.
