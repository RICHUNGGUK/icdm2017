This paper presents a covariance matrix based detection approach to detecting multiple known and unknown network anomalies. It utilizes the difference of covariance matrices among observed samples in the detection. A threshold matrix is employed in the detection where each entry of the matrix evaluates the covariance changes of the corresponding features. As case studies, extensive experiments are conducted to detect multiple DoS attacks - the prevalent Internet anomalies. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach achieves high detection rates in detecting multiple known and unknown anomalies.", "paper_title": "A covariance matrix based approach to Internet anomaly detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100072"}
