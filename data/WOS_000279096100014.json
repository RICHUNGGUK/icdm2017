The aim is to find an allocation for each operation and to define the sequence of operations on each machine, so that the resulting schedule has a minimal completion time. We propose a variant of the climbing discrepancy search approach for solving this problem. We also present various neighborhood structures related to assignment and sequencing problems. We report the results of extensive computational experiments carried out on well-known benchmarks for flexible job shop scheduling. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the best-known algorithms for the FJSP on some types of benchmarks and remains comparable with them on other ones.
