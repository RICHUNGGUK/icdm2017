The SIMPLEC algorithm is applied to deal with the coupling between pressure and velocity, and a new high-order stability-guaranteed second-order difference (SGSD) scheme is adopted to discretize the convection term. The influence of four parameters is studied: Richardson number, heat source distribution, channel height and inclination angle. The numerical results are analysed from the viewpoint of the field synergy principle, which says that the enhanced convective heat transfer is related not only to the velocity field and temperature field, but also to the synergy between them. It is found that the effects of the four parameters on the thermal performance can all be explained with the field synergy principle. To obtain better electronic cooling, the synergy between the velocity and temperature gradient should be increased when other conditions are unchanged.
