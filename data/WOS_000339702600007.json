We prove that, to any such sequence, we can associate a compact set (Rauzy fractal) by projection of the stepped line associated with an element of the symbolic system on the contracting space of the matrix. We show that this Rauzy fractal depends continuously on the sequence of substitutions, and investigate some of its properties; in some cases, this construction gives a geometric model for the symbolic dynamical system.
