Measurement results show that the antenna has an ultrawide impedance bandwidth from 3 to 12 GHz and omnidirectional radiation pattern. Next, we introduce two U-shaped slots in the ground plane of the antenna to provide an improved band rejection in the wireless local area network frequency band. Experimental results indicate that the proposed band notch antenna has maximum voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) of 25 in the desired rejection band. Measured gain for the proposed band notch antenna is around 0 dB and reduces to -15dB in the desired rejection band. Time domain performance of both the initial antenna and band notch antenna is also examined and the best detection template is presented. Computed total fidelity factors for both the initial and band notch antenna are greater than 0.9. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
