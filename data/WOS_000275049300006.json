Based on the open IP stack, it is similarly susceptible to Denial-of-Service Attacks launched against SIP servers. More than 20 different research works have been published to address SIP-related DOS problems. In this survey we explain three different types of DOS attacks on SIP networks, called SIP message payload tampering, SIP message flow tampering and SIP message flooding. We survey different approaches to counter these three types of attacks. We show that there are possible solutions for both payload and flow tampering attacks, and partial solutions for message flooding attacks. we conclude by giving hints how open flooding attacks issues could be addressed.
