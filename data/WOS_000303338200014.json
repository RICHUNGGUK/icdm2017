We need to visualize complex ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq features such as polarity as well as coverage across whole 3 Gbp genomes such as Human. We have addressed these problems in a lightweight visualization system called SAMSCOPE accelerated by OpenGL. The extensive pre-processing and fast OpenGL interface of SAMSCOPE provides instantaneous and intuitive browsing of complex data at all levels of detail across multiple experiments.", "paper_title": "SAMSCOPE: an OpenGL-based real-time interactive scale-free SAM viewer", "paper_id": "WOS:000303338200014"}
