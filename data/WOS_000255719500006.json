We propose two main constructions. The first construction, models with rational PH curves of algebraic class 3 (T-quartics) and is based on the fact that T-quartics are exactly the involutes of T-cubic curves. The second construction, models with rational PH curves of algebraic class m > 4 and is based on the dual control structure of offsets of rational PH curves. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
