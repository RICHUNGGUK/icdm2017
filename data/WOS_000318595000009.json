However, the source code of JavaScript programs can be easily obtained and plagiarism of JavaScript programs is a serious threat to the industry. There are techniques like code obfuscation and watermarking which can make the source code of a program difficult to understand by humans and prove the ownership of the program. However, code obfuscation cannot avoid the source code being copied and a watermark can be defaced. In this paper, we use a relatively new technique, software birthmark, to help detect code theft of JavaScript programs. A birthmark is a unique characteristic a program possesses that can be used to identify the program. We extend two recent birthmark systems that extract the birthmark of a software from the run-time heap. We propose a redesigned system with improved robustness and performed extensive experiments to justify the effectiveness and robustness of it. Our evaluation based on 200 large-scale websites showed that our birthmark system exhibits 100% accuracy. We remark that it is solid and ready for practical use.", "paper_title": "Heap Graph Based Software Theft Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000318595000009"}
