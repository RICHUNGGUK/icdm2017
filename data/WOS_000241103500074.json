We use the weights of the observation probabilities of semi-continuous HMMs that were adapted to the current speaker as input. Experiments on laryngectomized speakers with tracheo-esophageal substitute voice, hoarse, and normal speakers show encouraging results. Different speaker groups are separated in 2-D space, and the projection of a new speaker into the Sammon map allows prediction of his or her kind of voice pathology. The method can thus be used as an objective, automated support for the evaluation of voice disorders, and it visualizes them in a way that is convenient for speech therapists.", "paper_title": "Visualization of voice disorders using the Sammon Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500074"}
