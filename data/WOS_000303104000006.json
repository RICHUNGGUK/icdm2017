In a circuit with clock gating, the clock signal can be shut off without changing the functionality under certain clock-gating conditions. In this article, we observe that the clock-gating conditions and the next-state function of a Flip-Flop (FF) are correlated and can be used for sequential circuit optimization. We also show that the implementation of the next-state function of any FF can be just an inverter if the clock signal is appropriately gated. By exploiting the flexibility between the clock-gating conditions and the next-state function, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm to improve the timing of sequential circuits. We present experimental results of a set of benchmark circuits with a timing improvement of 10.20% on average.", "paper_title": "Timing Optimization in Sequential Circuit by Exploiting Clock-Gating Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000303104000006"}
