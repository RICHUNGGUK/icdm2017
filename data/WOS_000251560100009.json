The necessary condition for Boolean fuzzy systems as universal approximators with minimal system configurations is then discussed. Two examples are provided to demonstrate how to design a Boolean fuzzy system in order to approximate a given continuous function with a required approximation accuracy. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
