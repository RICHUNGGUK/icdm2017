The model is intended as a key part of a pilot project to develop a verified file store system based on flash memory. The project was proposed by Joshi and Holzmann as a contribution to the Grand Challenge in Verified Software, and involves constructing a highly assured flash file store for use in space-flight missions. The model is at a level of abstraction that captures the internal architecture of NAND flash devices. In this paper, we focus Oil mechanising the state model and its initialisation operation, where most of the Conceptual Complexity resides. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
