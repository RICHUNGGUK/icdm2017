However, while scan-based DFT improves test efficiency, it also leaves a side channel to the privacy information stored in the chip. This paper investigates the side channel and proposes a simple but powerful scan-based attack that can reveal the key and/or state stored in the chips that implement the state-of-the-art stream ciphers with less than 85 scan-out vectors.", "paper_title": "Scan-Based Attack on Stream Ciphers: A Case Study on eSTREAM Finalists", "paper_id": "WOS:000339302600009"}
