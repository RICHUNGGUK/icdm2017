Our algorithm first segments the input mesh into a set of quadrilateral patches, whose boundaries form a quadrangle mesh. For each boundary of each quadrilateral patch, we construct a normal curve and a boundary-fitting curve, which fit the normal and position of its boundary vertices respectively. By interpolating the normal and boundary-fitting curves of each quadrilateral patch with a Bezier patch, an initial G, smoothly stitching Bezier patches is generated. We perform this patch-based fitting scheme in an adaptive fashion by recursively subdividing the underlying quadrilateral into four sub-patches. The experimental results show that our algorithm achieves precision-ensured Bezier patches with G(1) continuity and meets the requirements of reverse engineering. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
