The main goals of this experiment are to create, in a collaborative way, a well-formed ontology for a Water Resources domain and evaluate the ontology integration process. The motivation of our work came from the development of knowledge management and information systems for the hydrological domain, where ontologies can be used as a broker between heterogeneous systems, to facilitate tasks inter-mediation and to help in knowledge storage, being used to publish semantic enriched documents. Since the development of a great ontology has a high cost, ontology re-use becomes an important activity; and consequently, so does the integration process. For this reason, tool support is essential.", "paper_title": "An empirical study on groupware support for water resources ontology integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000108"}
