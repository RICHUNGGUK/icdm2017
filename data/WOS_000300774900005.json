More precisely speaking, the integrated optimization method in 1) derives a unified objective function optimizing only sensor rules given a unified fusion rule; the method in 2) derives a unified objective function optimizing both the sensor quantization rule and the final estimation in the MSE sense, and the method in 3) integrates all associated targets and their valid observations into a whole random measurement matrix dynamic system so that the optimal random matrix Kalman filtering can be applied to estimate the states of all associated targets.", "paper_title": "Integrated optimization methods in multisensor decision and estimation fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000300774900005"}
