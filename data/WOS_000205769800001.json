Innovative techniques that improve energy efficiency to prolong the network lifetime are highly required. Clustering is an effective topology control approach in wireless sensor networks, which can increase network scalability and lifetime. Ill this paper, we propose a novel energy efficient Clustering scheme (EECS) for single-hop wireless sensor networks, which better Suits the periodical data gathering applications. Out approach elects cluster heads with more residual energy in all autonomous manner through local radio communication with no iteration while achieving good cluster head distribution: further more, it introduces a novel distance-based method to balance the load among, the cluster heads. Simulation results Show that EECS prolongs the network lifetime significantly against the other Clustering protocols such as LEACH and HEED.", "paper_title": "An Energy Efficient Clustering Scheme in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000205769800001"}
