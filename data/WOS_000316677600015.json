For the unimolecular decomposition mechanism of NG, we find two main mechanisms: (I) homolytic cleavage of O-NO2 to form aEuro cent NO2 and CH(2)ONO(2)CHONO(2)CH(2)OaEuro cent, which subsequently decomposes to form aEuro cent CHO, aEuro cent NO2, and 2CH(2)O; (II) successive HONO eliminations to form HONO and CHO-CO-CHO, which subsequently decomposes to form CH2O + 2CO(2) and aEuro cent CHO + CO. We also find that the former channel has slightly smaller activation energy than the latter one. In addition, the rate constants of the initial process of the two decomposition channels were calculated. The results show that the O-NO2 cleavage pathway occurs more easily than the HONO elimination.", "paper_title": "Theoretical studies on the unimolecular decomposition of nitroglycerin", "paper_id": "WOS:000316677600015"}
