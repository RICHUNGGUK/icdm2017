The problem of determining the sizes for optimal quaternary constant-weight codes with length n, weight 4, and minimum Hamming distance 5 ((n, 5, 4)(4) codes) has been investigated in several papers. Although some constructions and several infinite families for such codes with length n equivalent to 0, 1 (mod 4) have been given, the problem is still far from complete. In this paper, we determine the size of an optimal (n, 5, 4)(4) code for each integer n >= 4 leaving 55 lengths unsolved. Especially, for length, n equivalent to 0, 1 (mod 4), the existence problem of the equivalent combinatorial object, namely the generalized Steiner system, is solved leaving only seven values undetermined.", "paper_title": "Optimal Quaternary Constant-Weight Codes With Weight Four and Distance Five", "paper_id": "WOS:000315120400026"}
