The vector space is constructed over the real field, where the algebraic operations of vector addition and the associated scalar multiplication operations are defined on a probability measure space, and implications of these algebraic operations are interpreted. The zero element of this vector space is semantically equivalent to a PFSA, referred to as symbolic white noise. A norm is introduced on the vector space of PFSA, which provides a measure of the information content. An application example is presented in the framework of pattern recognition for ;identification of robot motion in a laboratory environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
