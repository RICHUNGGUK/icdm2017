The first method presents an embedded fuzzy logic approach in the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm robots and the second method presents a swarm of fuzzy logic controllers, one on each robot. The framework of both strategies has been inspired by natural swarms such as the school of fish or the flock of birds. In addition to the target search using the above methods, a hierarchy for the coordination of a swarm of robots has been proposed. The robustness of both strategies is evaluated for failures or loss in swarm members. Results are presented with both strategies and comparisons of their performance are carried out against a greedy search algorithm. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
