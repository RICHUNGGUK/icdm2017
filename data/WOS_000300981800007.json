Since services can be developed independently, the integration of services requires an adaptation mechanism for bridging any incompatibilities. Behavioral adapters aim to adjust the communication between some services to be composed in order to establish proper interaction between them. We present a novel approach for specifying such adapters, based on domain-specific transformation rules that reflect the elementary operations that adapters can perform. We also present a novel way to synthesize complex adapters that adhere to these rules, viz., by consistently separating data and control, and by using existing controller-synthesis algorithms. Our approach has been implemented, and we discuss some example applications, including real business processes in WS-BPEL.", "paper_title": "Reducing Adapter Synthesis to Controller Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000300981800007"}
