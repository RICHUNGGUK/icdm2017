Power and user allocation at both base stations is jointly performed by the proposed algorithm to maximize the overall throughput of the setup while satisfying, at the same time, the imposed rate constraints. Our proposal, which stems from an hybridization of the harmony search (HS) and differential evolution (DE) algorithms along with a greedy local repair method, is shown - through computer simulations over the extended vehicular A ITU channel model - to be an effective and practical resource allocation procedure for cognitive OFDMA downlinks.
