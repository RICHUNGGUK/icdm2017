The relationship between the time-varying delay and its lower and upper bounds is taken into account when estimating the upper bound of the derivative of Lyapunov functional. As a result, some improved delay/interval-dependent stability criteria for NNs with time-varying interval delay are proposed. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and the merits of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis for neural networks with time-varying interval delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000250789100025"}
