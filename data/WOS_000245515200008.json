First we show that a countable product of topological quotients yields a quotient map between the product spaces. Then we show that the reflection from sequential spaces to its subcategory of monotone (omega-convergence spaces preserves countable products. These results are motivated by applications to the modelling of computation on non-discrete spaces.", "paper_title": "Two preservation results for countable products of sequential spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000245515200008"}
