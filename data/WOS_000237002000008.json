One distribution models the transport of the Schvab-Zeldovich coupling function, or the mixture fraction to combine the energy and species equations. The other distribution models the quasi-incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with the low Mach number approximation. In the quasi-incompressible flows, the thermodynamics quantities depend on the coupling function but not on the hydrodynamic pressure, and the fluid components are assumed to be compressible only in the mixing/reaction region. A systematic and consistent approach to deriving LBEs for the general advection-diffusion equation and the quasi-incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are also presented. The streaming step of the LBEs are discretized by the total variation diminishing (TVD) Lax-Wendroff scheme. Numerical simulations are carried out to reproduce the low frequency flame oscillation (or flame flicker) of buoyant jet diffusion flame. Comparison between the quasi-incompressible model and the incompressible model is presented and the role of non-solenoidal velocity is examined. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
