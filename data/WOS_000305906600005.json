The net flow scores of fuzzy preference relations and multiplicative preference relations are introduced. The mean deviation method is developed to determine the relative weights of individual different preference relations objectively and then select the most desirable alternative(s) according to the aggregated net flow scores. The method does not need to transform the experts' preference relations into the same format and also does not produce any loss of information. Finally, the proposed method is tested and examined with three examples and proved to be simple, effective and practical.", "paper_title": "A METHOD BASED ON MEAN DEVIATION FOR WEIGHT DETERMINATION FROM FUZZY PREFERENCE RELATIONS AND MULTIPLICATIVE PREFERENCE RELATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000305906600005"}
