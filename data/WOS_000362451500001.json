The elastic object is represented as a Lagrangian structure, exerting point forces on the fluid. The forces on the structure are often determined by a bending or tension model, previously calculated using finite difference approximations. In this paper, we study spherical basis function (SBF), radial basis function (RBF), and Lagrange-Chebyshev parametric models to represent and calculate forces on elastic structures that can be represented by an open curve, motivated by the study of cilia and flagella. The evaluation error for static open curves for the different interpolants, as well as errors for calculating normals and second derivatives using different types of clustered parametric nodes, is given for the case of an open planar curve. We determine that SBF and RBF interpolants built on clustered nodes are competitive with Lagrange-Chebyshev interpolants for modeling twice-differentiable open planar curves. We propose using SBF and RBF parametric models within the MRS for evaluating and updating the elastic structure. Results for open and closed elastic structures immersed in a 2D fluid are presented, showing the efficacy of the RBF-Stokeslets method.
