Systematic modifications of geometrical parameters (distances and angles) of the coordination sphere of the T1 Cu site were carried out within a density functional theory (DFT) framework, to evaluate their effects on electron affinity directly related to redox potential. The most promising result in terms of redox potential increment was distortion of the dihedral angle C-methylthiolate-S-Cu-N-ImA (omega), which can be rationalized as a decrease in the overlap of imidazole orbitals in the redox-active molecular orbital (beta-LUMO). This overlap is minimized when omega achieves the value of 10A degrees, therefore, this conformation might have the highest redox potential. From the molecular orbital viewpoint, a parallelism was found between the effect caused by the presence of a fourth ligand and the distorted three-coordination, which could be extrapolated to spectroscopic properties. It was also found that solvation effects on the redox potentials during geometrical distortions produce a very similar tendency, independently of the polarity of the solvent.", "paper_title": "Geometric distortions on a three-coordinated T1 Cu site model as a potential strategy to modulate redox potential.
