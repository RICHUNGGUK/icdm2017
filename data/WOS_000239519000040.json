Single-character multilingual domain-names are easy for the disabled and elderly people to memorize and type in to access social information. Multi-lingual single-character domain names with text-based social information are more convenient than long URL strings to retrieve information and to give short notice of information for social networking. We introduce a ubiquitous social community portal 'ktrip.net', that has real-time Text to Speech (TTS) functionality with text-based contents in social networking service, using a tiny 'hand-board' for alumni, relatives and any special groups.", "paper_title": "A ubiquitous social community portal service for social networking with convenient accessibility", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000040"}
