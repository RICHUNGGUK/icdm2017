Our research found that testers qualify their relation to the Metro in a way that is both depersonalized and efficient, as well as deeply personal and social. We also found that mobility is experienced not only as controlled circulation but also as a meaningful journey that can be articulated and shared. To account for this dual perception of physical space and motion, we propose to use the anthropological concepts of non-place and place. This theoretical framework offers useful guidelines for the design of what we propose to call place-centered services that, first combine the dynamic synchronization of the journey and users' dual relation to spaces, and second categorize the actors that contribute to the information system and services.
