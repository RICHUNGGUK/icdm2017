One of the key services that operators seek to provide is streaming of rich multimedia content. However, network characteristics make the use of streaming applications very difficult with an unacceptable quality of service (QoS). The 3GPP standardization body has standardized streaming services that will benefit operators and users. There is a need for a mechanism that will enable a good quality multimedia streaming that uses the 3GPP standard. This paper describes an adaptive streaming algorithm that uses the 3GPP standard. It improves significantly the QoS in varying network conditions while monitoring its performance using queueing methodologies. The algorithm utilizes the available buffers on the route of the streaming data in a unique way that guarantees high QoS. The system is analytically modeled: the streaming server, the cellular network and the cellular client are modeled as cascaded buffers and the data is sequentially streamed between them. The proposed Adaptive streaming algorithm (ASA) controls these buffers' occupancy levels by controlling the transmission and the encoding rates of the streaming server to achieve high QoS for the streaming. It overcomes the inherent fluctuations of the network bandwidth. The algorithm was tested on General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) and Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) networks. The results showed substantial improvements over other standard streaming methods used today.", "paper_title": "Transmission algorithm for video streaming over cellular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000278968500016"}
