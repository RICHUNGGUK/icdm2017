The second generation added tools to view and validate the data defined by the STEP Application Protocols. A third generation is emerging that aggregates information from different systems. Unlike the previous generations, this one creates new types of data to enable new types of functionality. It builds on the first two by using their code to read and write STEP data, and then adds value by merging data to create new information for the new STEP Application Protocols. We describe an example that creates new information for intelligent machining from data made by CAD and CAM systems.", "paper_title": "Third-generation STEP systems that aggregate data for machining and other applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000282129700003"}
