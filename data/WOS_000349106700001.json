The majority of the existing approaches use pre-defined mappings provided by a domain expert. To overcome this limitation and enable autonomous transfer learning, this paper introduces a method for weighting and using multiple inter-task mappings based on a probabilistic framework. Experimental results show that the use of multiple inter-task mappings, accompanied with a probabilistic selection mechanism, can significantly boost the performance of transfer learning relative to 1) learning without transfer and 2) using a single hand-picked mapping. We especially introduce novel tasks for transfer learning in a realistic simulation of the iCub robot, demonstrating the ability of the method to select mappings in complex tasks where human intuition could not be applied to select them. The results verified the efficacy of the proposed approach in a real world and complex environment.", "paper_title": "Transfer learning with probabilistic mapping selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000349106700001"}
