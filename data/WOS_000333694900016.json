Therefore, the operation of the synchronization blocks causes delays ranging from several hundred milliseconds to a few seconds until the start of the radio service after frequency tuning. Furthermore, if spectrum inversed signals are transmitted in digital radio broadcasting systems, the receivers are unable to decode them, even though most receivers can demodulate the spectral inversed signals in analog radio broadcasting systems. Accordingly, fast synchronization techniques and a method for spectral inversion detection are required in digital radio broadcasting systems that are to replace the analog radio systems. This paper presents a joint detection method of frame, integer carrier frequency offset, and spectrum inversion for DRM Plus digital broadcasting systems. The proposed scheme can detect the frame and determine whether the signal is normal or spectral inversed without any carrier frequency offset and sampling frequency offset compensation, enabling fast frame synchronization. The proposed method shows outstanding performance in environments where symbol timing offsets and sampling frequency offsets exist.", "paper_title": "An Improved Joint Detection of Frame, Integer Frequency Offset, and Spectral Inversion for Digital Radio Mondiale Plus", "paper_id": "WOS:000333694900016"}
