Consolidated studies in topic and trend detection from text streams have concentrated so far mainly on identifying and visualizing dynamically evolving text patterns. From the knowledge modeling perspective identifying and de. ning new, relevant features that are able to synchronize the emergent user intentions to the dynamicity of the system's structure is a need. Additionally the advanced KBS have to remain highly sensitive to the content change, marked by evolution of trends in topics extracted from text streams. In this paper, we are describing a three-layered approach called the \"user-system-content method\" that is helping us to identify the most relevant knowledge mapping features derived from the USER, SYSTEM and CONTENT perspectives into an overall \"context model\", that will enable the advanced KBS to automatically streamline the query enrichment process in a much more user-centered, dynamical and flexible way. After a general introduction to our three-layered approach, we will describe into detail the necessary process steps for the implementation of our method and will present a case study for its integration on a real multimedia web-content portal using news streams as major source of unstructured information.", "paper_title": "EMERGING USER INTENTIONS: MATCHING USER QUERIES WITH TOPIC EVOLUTION IN NEWS TEXT STREAMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000268447700005"}
