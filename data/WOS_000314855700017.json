In this work, the security of certificate has been significantly enhanced by using improved GDH signature and interactive secret-sharing, that is, any attacker cannot forge a valid certificate for the untrusted nodes. The proposed scheme can effectively reduce the storage and computation amounts of each node, and some security problems (e.g., passive attack, man-in-the-middle attack and so on) can also be solved. Compared to the congener schemes, ours is much more efficient in the process of certificate generating.", "paper_title": "BILINEAR PAIRINGS-BASED THRESHOLD IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION SCHEME FOR AD HOC NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000314855700017"}
