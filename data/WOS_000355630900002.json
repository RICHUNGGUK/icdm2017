In order to reduce traffic congestion and communication delay, a routing-cost constrained minimum CDS (ROC-CDS) has been studied extensively in the literature. In this paper, we present a PTAS for ROC-CDS where , that is, there exists a polynomial-time -approximation for minimum CDS under constraint that for every pair of nodes u and v, where denotes the number of intermediate nodes in the shortest path between u and v, and denotes the number of intermediate nodes of the shortest path between u and v through CDS produced by the approximation algorithm.", "paper_title": "PTAS for routing-cost constrained minimum connected dominating set in growth bounded graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000355630900002"}
