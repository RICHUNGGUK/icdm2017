Combined with results of Bui-Xuan, Telle and Vatshelle (2013) [1] this leads to polynomial time algorithms for a large class of locally checkable vertex subset and vertex partitioning problems on all of these graph classes. The boolean-width of a graph is related to the number of 1-neighborhoods and our results imply that any of these graph classes have boolean-width O(log n). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
