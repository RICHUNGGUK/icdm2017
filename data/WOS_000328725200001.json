Then, we review and compare different numerical methods for solving the NLSE/GPE including finite difference time domain methods and time-splitting spectral method, and discuss different absorbing boundary conditions. In addition, these numerical methods are extended to the NLSE/GPE with damping terms and/or an angular momentum rotation term as well as coupled NLSEs/GPEs. Finally, applications to simulate a quantized vortex lattice dynamics in a rotating BEC are reported. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
