One design challenge for such a network is how to devise a good data fusion algorithm for information retrieval. Noting that the channel state information (CSI) between the cluster head and the sensor nodes will influence the received bit energy noise ratio of the sensor nodes, we propose an optimal data fusion algorithm taking into account the CSI for a one-hop clustered wireless sensor network. On the basis of the fusion algorithm, we consider the redundancy of the sensor deployment and propose a cross-layer transmission scheduling scheme. By selecting proper set of sensor nodes to transmit their local information back in turn, the scheme can prolong the lifetime of the sensor network. The numerical and simulation results show that it can get a good tradeoff between the energy efficiency and the performance. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
