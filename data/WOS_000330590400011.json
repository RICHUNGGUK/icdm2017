The minimum m such that there exist a circular m-L(j,k)-labeling of G is called the circular L(j,k)-labeling number of G and is denoted by sigma (j,k) (G). In this paper, for any two positive numbers j and k with ja parts per thousand currency signk, we give some results about the circular L(j,k)-labeling number of direct product of path and cycle.", "paper_title": "Circular L(j,k)-labeling number of direct product of path and cycle", "paper_id": "WOS:000330590400011"}
