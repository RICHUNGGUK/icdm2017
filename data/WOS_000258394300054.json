In this letter, new sequence sets with low correlation and large linear span are proposed. Based on the construction Tr-1(m)[Tr-m(n)(alpha(bt) + gamma i alpha(dt))](r) for generating p-ary sequences of period p(n) - 1, where n = 2m, d = up(m) +/- v, b = u +/- v, gamma(i) is an element of GF(p(n)), and p is an arbitrary prime number, several methods to choose the parameter d are provided. The obtained sequences with family size p(n) are of four-valued, five-valued, six-valued or seven-valued correlation and the maximum nontrivial correlation value is (u + v - 1)p(m) - 1. The simulation by a computer shows that the linear span of the new sequences is larger than that of the sequences with Niho-type and Welch-type decimations, and similar to that of [10].", "paper_title": "Several families of sequences with low correlation and large linear span", "paper_id": "WOS:000258394300054"}
