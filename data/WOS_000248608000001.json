In some applications, the access pattern of all the data can be represented by a weighted DAG. In this paper, we explore how to efficiently generate the broadcast schedule in a wireless environment for the data set having a weighted DAG access pattern. Such a broadcast schedule not only minimizes the access latency but also is a topological ordering of the DAG. Minimized access latency ensures the quality of service ( QoS). We prove that it is NP- hard to find an optimal broadcast schedule and provide some heuristics. After giving an analysis for these heuristics on the latency and complexity, we implement all the proposed heuristics to compare their performance.", "paper_title": "Disseminating dependent data in wireless broadcast environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000248608000001"}
