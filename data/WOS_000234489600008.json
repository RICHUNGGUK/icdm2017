In particular, it allows rapid decision-making, customized production, and short time-to-market. To address these challenges, the authors built a mediation suite on top of a message-oriented middleware to help develop e-services based on industrial data. This software, based on a domain-specific component model, meets stringent market requirements and is being used in real-life service applications.", "paper_title": "Asynchronous mediation for integrating business and operational processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000234489600008"}
