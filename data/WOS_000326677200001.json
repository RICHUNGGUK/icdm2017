Complexity of problem increases as the size of system increases. Recently artificial intelligence-based optimisation techniques are applied successfully for protection application in power system. Traditionally protection relays are electro-mechanically with discrete time dial and plug setting. Optimisation of relay coordination problem considering the discrete relay parameters needs the optimisation algorithm which can handle the discrete value of decision variables. In this paper, application of artificial bee colony algorithm is extended for discrete optimal coordination of overcurrent relays. Moreover, relay coordination problem is modified to optimise the relay setting for both near and far end faults.", "paper_title": "Optimal coordination of electro-mechanical-based overcurrent relays using artificial bee colony algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000326677200001"}
