The fundamental reason for these challenges is that the radio access network (RAN) is closed and ossified. We propose OpenRAN, an architecture for software-defined RAN via virtualization. It achieves complete virtualization and programmability vertically, and benefits the convergence of heterogeneous network horizontally. It provides open, controllable, flexible and evolvable wireless networks.", "paper_title": "OpenRAN: A Software-defined RAN Architecture Via Virtualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000327465900091"}
