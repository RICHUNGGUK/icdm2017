Given each face image, we first extract multiple features using different face descriptors to characterize face images from different aspects because different feature descriptors can provide complementary information. Then, we jointly learn multiple distance metrics with these extracted multiple features under which the probability of a pair of face image with a kinship relation having a smaller distance than that of the pair without a kinship relation is maximized, and the correlation of different features of the same face sample is maximized, simultaneously, so that complementary and discriminative information is exploited for verification. Experimental results on four face kinship data sets show the effectiveness of our proposed method over the existing single-metric and multimetric learning methods.", "paper_title": "Discriminative Multimetric Learning for Kinship Verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000338111700003"}
