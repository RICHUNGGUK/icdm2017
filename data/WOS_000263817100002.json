We develop two types of unsupervised and one supervised neural network. This scheme is meant to help the urologists in obtaining a diagnosis for complex multi-variable diseases and to reduce painful and costly medical treatments since neurological dysfunctions are difficult to diagnose. The clinical study has been carried out using medical registers of patients with urological dysfunctions. The proposal is able to distinguish and classify between ill and healthy patients.
