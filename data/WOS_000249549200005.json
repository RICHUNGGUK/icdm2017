The one-step approximations of the estimates in the case-deletion model are given and case-deletion measures, such as generalized Cook distance, likelihood distance are obtained. At the same time, we derive the diagnostic statistics for CGPR models under perturbations in case-weights and explanatory variables. Furthermore, we discuss an approximate test for significance of the dispersion parameter in the CGPR, and the score test statistic is obtained. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate our methodology.", "paper_title": "Diagnostics analysis in censored generalized Poisson regression model", "paper_id": "WOS:000249549200005"}
