For this reason, it is useful to model secrecy quantitatively, thinking of it as a \"resource\" that may be gradually \"consumed\" by a system. In this paper, we explore this intuition through several dynamic and static models of secrecy consumption, ultimately focusing on (average) vulnerability and min-entropy leakage as especially useful models of secrecy consumption. We also consider several composition operators that allow smaller systems to be combined into a larger system, and explore the extent to which the secrecy consumption of a combined system is constrained by the secrecy consumption of its constituents.
