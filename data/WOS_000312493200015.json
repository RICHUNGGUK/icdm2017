Researchers regarded the supplier selection process as a central issue in management decision. In fact, it can be viewed as a fuzzy multiple-attribute decision-making (FMADM) problem. However, in the past, few articles utilized FMADM methods to deal with the problem of supplier selection. In this paper, we identify empirically the quantitative and qualitative attributes and their corresponding importance weightings for selecting suppliers. Furthermore, a FMADM approach is employed to choose an optimum supplier from all possible supplier candidates.", "paper_title": "Supplier selection in supply chain management by using fuzzy multiple-attribute decision-making method", "paper_id": "WOS:000312493200015"}
