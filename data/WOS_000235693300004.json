The applied statistician today has a much more sophisticated set of methods to use when applying the EDA philosophy. One such collection of methods is functional data analysis (FDA), which was used to explore the structure of lactate curves. A principal components analysis and plots of the second derivatives provide new intuitive endurance markers which correlates highly with other numerical summaries of lactate curves that have been suggested in the literature.
