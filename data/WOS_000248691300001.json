A comprehensive performance evaluation of an MIS can aid in detecting potential bottlenecks, advise in deployment, and help improve future system development. In this paper, we analyze and compare the performance of three implementations in a quantitative manner: the Globus Toolkit((R)) Monitoring and Discovery Service (MDS2), the European DataGrid Relational Grid Monitoring Architecture (R-GMA), and the Condor project's Hawkeye. We use the NetLogger toolkit to instrument the main service components of each MIS and conduct four sets of experiments to benchmark their scalability with respect to the number of users, the number of resources, and the amount of data collected. Our study provides quantitative measurements comparable across all systems. We also find performance bottlenecks and identify how they relate to the design goals, underlying architectures, and implementation technologies of the corresponding MIS, and we present guidelines for deploying MISs in practice.
