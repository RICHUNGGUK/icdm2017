Sigma Delta fractional-N frequency synthesizer is widely adopted due to its excellent characteristics in these aspects. This paper presents a number of system issues and design considerations/tradeoffs which are involved in the design of such a frequency synthesizer from the system point of view. These considerations include selection of loop parameters, choice of key building blocks, and critical system performance issues like spurious tones, quantization noise, in-band phase noise, out-of-band phase noise, and frequency accuracy/resolution. Finally, the future possibilities are briefly analyzed.", "paper_title": "SYSTEM DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS OF HIGHLY-INTEGRATED Sigma Delta FRACTIONAL-N FREQUENCY SYNTHESIZER", "paper_id": "WOS:000261381300001"}
