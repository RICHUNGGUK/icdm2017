A variety of algorithms and constraints have been discussed in the literature. The dtw package provides an unification of them; it allows R users to compute time series alignments mixing freely a variety of continuity constraints, restriction windows, endpoints, local distance definitions, and so on. The package also provides functions for visualizing alignments and constraints using several classic diagram types.", "paper_title": "Computing and Visualizing Dynamic Time Warping Alignments in R: The dtw Package", "paper_id": "WOS:000268992000001"}
