In this paper, we develop an efficient approach for finding binding sites between proteins. Our approach consists of four steps: local sequence alignment, protein surface detection, 3D structure comparison, and candidate binding site selection. A comparison of our method with the ISA algorithm shows that the binding sites predicted by our method are somewhat closer to the actual binding sites in the protein protein complexes.
