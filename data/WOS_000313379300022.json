Two versions of this problem are addressed. In the first version, sensing ranges are supposed to be continuously adjustable (up to the maximum sensing range). In the second version, sensing ranges have to be chosen among a set of predefined values common to all sensors. An exact approach based on a column generation algorithm is proposed for solving these problems. The use of a genetic algorithm within the column generation scheme significantly decreases computation time, which results in an efficient exact approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
