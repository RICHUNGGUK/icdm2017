We leverage data from two different sources: real-world data acquired with an effective exposure time of less than 2 picoseconds, using an ultra-fast imaging technique termed femto-photography, and a transient renderer based on ray-tracing. We explore the effects of time dilation, light aberration, frequency shift and radiance accumulation by modifying existing models of these relativistic effects to take into account the time-resolved nature of light propagation. Unlike previous works, we do not impose limiting constraints in the visualization, allowing the virtual camera to explore freely a reconstructed 3D scene depicting dynamic illumination. Moreover, we consider not only linearmotion, but also acceleration and rotation of the camera. We further introduce, for the first time, a pinhole camera model into our relativistic rendering framework, and account for subsequent changes in focal length and field of view as the camera moves through the scene.", "paper_title": "Relativistic Effects for Time-Resolved Light Transport", "paper_id": "WOS:000368341800001"}
