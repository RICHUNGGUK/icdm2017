The technique is designed to handle concurrent load balancing actions, which are often the main obstacle in the analysis. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by analysing various natural diffusion type protocols. Our results are similar to, or better than, previously existing ones, while our proofs are much easier. The key idea is to first sequentialise the original, concurrent load transfers, analyse this new, sequential system, and then to bound the gap between both. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
