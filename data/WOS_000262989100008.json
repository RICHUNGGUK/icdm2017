For system parameters with abnormal changes, an adaptive change detection and parameter identification algorithm is neat presented. The presented technique and algorithm are finally applied to the parameter identification of the gas turbine engine by using the recorded input data from the engine test-bed. The identified parameters and the response curves are desirable. The simulations have proved the effectiveness of the proposed procedure compared with the previous identification approach.", "paper_title": "Novel Parameter Identification by Using a High-Gain Observer With Application to a Gas Turbine Engine", "paper_id": "WOS:000262989100008"}
