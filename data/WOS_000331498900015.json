It presents a prototypical non-linear, stochastic programming model to structure relevant and practical features of the problem and four adaptations, along with associated solution approaches, with the goal of facilitating solution by overcoming the computational disadvantages of the prototype. Each of these adaptations offers advantages but is also attended by disadvantages. Computational tests compare the four adaptations and solution approaches with respect to solution quality and run time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
