However, most users adjust parameters manually based on the reference values of previous literature. Such trial-and-error method is time-consuming, ineffective, and often it could not locate the optimal combination. Therefore, in flowshop scheduling problems, this research anticipates to complete optimal parameter combination design in genetic algorithm using Taguchi experimental design. According to the research results, different ways of producing initial solution have significant influence on this research topic. Consequently, confirmation experiment is conducted using the optimal parameter combination obtained from the research results. It is found that the predicted value of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ratio) and its actual value exists deviation of 0.238%, indicating repetitiveness and robustness of the obtained parameter combination. Hence, this research method can effectively reduce time spent on parameter design using genetic algorithm and increase efficiency of algorithm. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
