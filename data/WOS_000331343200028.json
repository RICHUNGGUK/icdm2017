The six feature vectors selected from the relevant parameters of the SMV are applied to the visible layer in the proposed DBN-based method. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using the detection accuracy and error probability of speech and music for various music genres. The proposed algorithm yields better results when compared with the original SMV method and support vector machine (SVM) based method.", "paper_title": "Speech/Music Classification Enhancement for 3GPP2 SMV Codec Based on Deep Belief Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000331343200028"}
