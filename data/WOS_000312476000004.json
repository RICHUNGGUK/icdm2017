We show how the simultaneously row and column reduced form can be used to transform a given higher-order input system into a first-order system. Finally, we show that the algorithm can be used to compute Two-Sided Block Popov forms as given in Barkatou et al. (2010). These results extend the previous work in Barkatou et al. (2010), on second-order systems, and Harris et al. (1968), on first-order systems, to systems of arbitrary order. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
