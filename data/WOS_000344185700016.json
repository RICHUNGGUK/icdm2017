More frequently the software industry requires more skilled and qualified staff; however at the university level students are young, inexperienced, and relatively homogeneous in background and abilities. This article describes an approach that integrates a student teamwork methodology (TSPi) and project-based learning (PBL) to improve software project managerial skills in undergraduate students. As complementary support, a computational tool, the Teamwork Platform for Software Engineering Education, has been developed to establish an interactive software engineering course with local software industry collaboration. Experimental results show that a set of software metrics was defined to demonstrate performance improvement of 45 students following our approach.(c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
