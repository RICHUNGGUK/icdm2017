Some of the major concerns facing these systems are scalability, ubiquitous access to sensory data, event processing overhead, and massive storage requirements-all of which demand novel scalable approach. Cloud computing can provide a powerful and scalable infrastructure for large-scale storage, processing, and dissemination of sensor data. Furthermore, the integration of sensor technology and cloud computing offers new possibilities for efficient development and deployment of sensor-based systems. This paper proposes a framework for a cloud-based multimedia surveillance system and highlights several research and technical issues. A prototype surveillance system is also designed and analyzed in the context of the proposed surveillance framework. The paper finally reports that cloud-based multimedia surveillance system can effectively support the processing overload, storage requirements, ubiquitous access, security, and privacy in large-scale surveillance settings.", "paper_title": "Framework for a Cloud-Based Multimedia Surveillance System", "paper_id": "WOS:000336537100001"}
