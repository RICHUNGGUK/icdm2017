The notched bodies are formed by bonding two materials together (isotropic-isotropic/isotropic-orthotropic). Also, a strain energy-based approach is developed and used to compute mode III SIFs for a bi-material notch using standard finite element (FE) commercial packages for comparison with corresponding data produced using the FFEM. Various numerical results for bi-material cracked/notched bodies under anti-plane shear are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the FFEM. Many new results for bi-material notched bodies are also introduced. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
