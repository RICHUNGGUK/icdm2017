The HVD mainly consists of four parts: a specially designed voltage-to-current converter (VCC) with thermal stability improvement, a comparison core to make current-based comparison, a current pre-amplifier to improve its transient performance and a Schmitt inverter to provide the hysteresis characteristic. The prototype of this HVD has been implemented in SMIC 0.18 mu m CMOS process and occupies 0.036 mm(2) area without pads. The hysteresis window is about 120 mV wide. The temperature coefficient (TC) is about -170.2 ppm degrees C. The average variation to different process corners can be reduced to 1.4% by MOSFET and resistor trimming. The total power consumption is only 701.5 nW when VDD is around 1.8 V.", "paper_title": "A HIGH-PRECISION ULTRA-LOW-POWER HYSTERETIC VOLTAGE DETECTOR USING CURRENT-BASED COMPARISON", "paper_id": "WOS:000327669200006"}
