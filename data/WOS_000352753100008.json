In such applications, monitoring and awareness are critical functionalities required for an effective collaboration. However, to date there has been little research into providing generic, application-independent awareness in P2P groupware systems. We present a distributed event-based awareness approach for such systems that provides different forms of awareness through a set of interoperating, low-level awareness services. The user and technical requirements for the approach are motivated with reference to Project-Based Learning in a P2P environment. We describe the implementation of a superpeer P2P network on a Cloud platform and the provision of reliable awareness services (AaaS - Awareness as a Service) from the Cloud. We report on the outcomes of an empirical evaluation of the performance and scalability of the approach.", "paper_title": "Event-Based Awareness Services for P2P Groupware Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000352753100008"}
