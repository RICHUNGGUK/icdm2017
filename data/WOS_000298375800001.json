One learning automaton is associated with each agent acting in a state and the automata acting within a state may communicate with each other. However, there is no communication between the automata present in different states, thus making the system partially decentralized. We propose novel algorithms so that the entire automata team converges to the policy that maximizes the long-term expected reward per step. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Partially decentralized reinforcement learning in finite, multi-agent Markov decision processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000298375800001"}
