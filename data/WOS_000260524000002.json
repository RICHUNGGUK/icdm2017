In this problem, a {0,1} incidence vector is associated with each cycle and the vector space over F-2 generated by these vectors is the cycle space of G. A set of cycles is called a cycle basis of G if it forms a basis for its cycle space. A cycle basis where the sum of the weights of the cycles is minimum is called a minimum cycle basis of G. Minimum cycle basis are useful in a number of contexts, e.g. the analysis of electrical networks and structural engineering. The previous best algorithm for computing a minimum cycle basis has running time O(m(omega) n), where omega is the best exponent of matrix multiplication. It is presently known that omega < 2.376. We exhibit an O(m(2)n + mn(2)) algorithm. When the edge weights are integers, we have an O(m(2)n) algorithm. For unweighted graphs which are reasonably dense, our algorithm runs in O(m(omega)) time. For any epsilon > 0, we also design an 1+epsilon approximation algorithm. The running time of this algorithm is O((m(omega)/epsilon)log(W/epsilon)) for reasonably dense graphs, where W is the largest edge weight.", "paper_title": "An (O)over-tilde (m(2)n) Algorithm for Minimum Cycle Basis of Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000260524000002"}
