This paper develops an analytical framework to study the optimality of rate-based generic AIMD and AIAD congestion control schemes. In this way, a congestion model is introduced to describe the congestion behavior of CRSNs. A semi-Markov chain (SMC) is proposed to model the steady-state sending rate distribution of source nodes based on the congestion model. The optimality of generic AIMD and AIAD, based on the proposed models, is analyzed in order to maximize the defined rate-congestion ratio (RCR). The analytical results are verified through various NS2-based simulations in CRSNs.", "paper_title": "On the Optimality of Generic Rate-Based AIMD and AIAD Congestion Control Schemes in Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000358910700001"}
