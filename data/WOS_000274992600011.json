Under this approach, the input vectors comprising the test sequence are fixed in advance. The process of generating the test sequence consists of ordering the precomputed input vectors such that the resulting test sequence has as high a fault coverage as possible. The advantage of this approach is that its computational complexity is limited by limiting the search space to a given set of input vectors and a given test sequence length. We describe a specific implementation of this approach. Experimental results demonstrate that restricting the search space to a fixed number of precomputed input vectors is sufficient for achieving the highest known fault coverage, or a fault coverage close to it, for benchmark circuits.", "paper_title": "TOV: Sequential Test Generation by Ordering of Test Vectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000274992600011"}
