Then apply the recursive least squares method to identify the parameters of these two models, respectively, by replacing the unmeasurable terms in the information vectors with their estimates. Thus a filtering based recursive least squares algorithm is finally derived. The given illustrative example indicates that the proposed algorithm can generate more accurate parameter estimates compared with the auxiliary model based recursive generalized extended least squares algorithm.
