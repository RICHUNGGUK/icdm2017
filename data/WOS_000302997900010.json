Typical video-mediated communication systems do not enable deictic gestures nor direct drawing with white board markers, thus limiting communication. We present our novel concept for Natural and Intuitive Video-mediated Collaboration (NIVMC). NIVMC was originally developed for design professionals to enable co-operative sketching, but it may also benefit other user groups.", "paper_title": "DEVELOPING NATURAL AND INTUITIVE VIDEO-MEDIATED COLLABORATION - NIVMC SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000302997900010"}
