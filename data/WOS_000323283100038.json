The results indicate that the molecule is weakly adsorbed on the intrinsic BC2N nanotube releasing energy of 0.8 kcal mol(-1) (at B3LYP/6-31G(d)) without significant effect on the HOMO-LUMO energy gap and electrical conductivity of the tube. Thus, H2CO cannot be detected using this intrinsic nanotube. To overcome this problem, a carbon atom of the tube wall was substituted by a Si atom. It was demonstrated that the Si-doped tube cannot only strongly adsorb the H2CO molecule, but also may effectively detect its presence because of the increase in the electric conductivity of the tube.", "paper_title": "A DFT study on the sensing behavior of a BC2N nanotube toward formaldehyde", "paper_id": "WOS:000323283100038"}
