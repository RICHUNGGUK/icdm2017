Such results as subordination and superordination properties, convolution properties, inclusion relationships, distortion theorems, inequality properties and sufficient conditions for multivalent starlikeness are proved. The results presented here would provide extensions of those given in earlier works. Several other new results are also obtained. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
