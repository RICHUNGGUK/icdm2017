We interpret in this model all of the type constructors needed for typed intermediate languages and typed assembly languages used for object-oriented and functional languages. We establish in this purely semantic fashion a soundness proof of the typing systems underlying these TILs and TALs-ensuring that every well-typed program is safe. The technique is generic, and applies to any small-step semantics including lambda-calculus, labeled transition systems, and von Neumann machines. It is also simple, and reduces mainly to defining a Kripke semantics of the Godel-Lob logic of provability. We have mechanically verified in Coq the soundness of our type system as applied to a von Neumann machine.", "paper_title": "A very modal model of a modern, major, general type system", "paper_id": "WOS:000253407700015"}
