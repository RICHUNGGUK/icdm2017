First, we express the f-vector as a sum over all subsets of [n-1]. Second, we use certain factorizations of the associated word over a two-letter alphabet to describe the f-vector. We show that the f-vector is maximized when the set S is the alternating set {1,3,5,aEuro broken vertical bar}a (c)[n-1]. We derive a generating function for F (S) (t), written as a formal power series in two non-commuting variables with coefficients in a\"currency sign[t]. We also obtain the generating function for the Ehrhart polynomials of the descent polytopes.", "paper_title": "The f-Vector of the Descent Polytope", "paper_id": "WOS:000287146600004"}
