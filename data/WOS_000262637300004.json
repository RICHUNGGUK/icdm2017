Our main tests took place in important fraud detection domains, which are characterized by the presence of high cardinality attributes and by the existence of relevant interactions among them. Other tests, over UCI data sets, show that HPB may have a quite wide applicability.", "paper_title": "HPB: A Model for Handling BN Nodes with High Cardinality Parents", "paper_id": "WOS:000262637300004"}
