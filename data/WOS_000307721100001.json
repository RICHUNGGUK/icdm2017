The proposed approach uses a levelset method to describe the fluid-solid interface geometry. The flow field is modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and discretized by the extended finite element method (XFEM). The no-slip condition along the fluid-solid interface is enforced via a stabilized Lagrange multiplier method. Unlike the commonly used porosity approach, the XFEM approach does not rely on a material interpolation scheme, which allows for more flexibility in formulating the design problems. Further, it mitigates shortcomings of the porosity approach, including spurious pressure diffusion through solid material, strong dependency of the accuracy of the boundary enforcement with respect to the model parameters which may affect the optimization results, and poor boundary resolution. Numerical studies verify that the proposed method is able to recover optimization results obtained with the porosity approach. Further, it is demonstrated that the XFEM approach yields physical results for problems that cannot be solved with the porosity approach.", "paper_title": "Levelset based fluid topology optimization using the extended finite element method", "paper_id": "WOS:000307721100001"}
