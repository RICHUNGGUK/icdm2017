Mundo (C3M) relating to the application of cybernetics principles to a design process with special regard to house design in Brazil. Design/methodology/approach - After discussing the peculiarities of architectural practice in Brazil, the paper presents C3M's design methodology, which is based on the creation of three models (\"conceptual model\", \"analogical model\", and \"scale model\"); a case study is presented and the results of the application of the methodology to several projects are discussed. Findings - The paper shows that cybernetics principles are relevant for dealing with the Brazilian housing shortage, especially because it is an adequate framework to deal with the Brazilian culture, known for its informality, its social plasticity and its playful nature. Originality/value - The correlation of cybernetics principles to the design of affordable houses is articulated through the concept of \"indeterminate project,\" intended as a project that would allow for flexibility, interpretation and adaptation.", "paper_title": "An indeterminate project for architecture in Brazil", "paper_id": "WOS:000251883500008"}
