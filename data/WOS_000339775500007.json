Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the homotopy analysis method (HAM) with unknown convergence-control parameter has been used to derive accurate analytic solution for MHD stagnation point flow in porous medium. Findings: Main findings are; the skin-friction coefficient decreases with Prandtl number, and with the increasing values of M the Nusselt number significantly increases with low Prandtl number. Practical implications: The HAM with unknown convergence-control parameter can be used to obtain analytic solutions for many problems in sciences and engineering. Originality/value: This paper fulfils an identified need to evaluate the accurate analytic solution (series solution) of practical problem. Some deduced results can be obtained in a limiting sense.
