The novelty is the focus on the local bootstrap of the periodogram function. The approach is then applied to three different semiparametric estimators of d, known from the literature, based upon the periodogram function. By means of an extensive set of simulation experiments, the bias and mean square errors are quantified for each estimator and the efficacy of the local bootstrap is stated in terms of low bias, short confidence intervals, and low CPU times. Finally, a real data set is analyzed to demonstrate that the methodology may be quite effective in solving real problems. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
