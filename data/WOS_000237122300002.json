An activity of multiple objects is represented based on discrete scene events and their behaviours are modelled by reasoning about the temporal and causal correlations among different events. This is significantly different from the majority of the existing techniques that are centred on object tracking followed by trajectory matching. In our approach, object-independent events are detected and classified by unsupervised clustering using Expectation-Maximisation (EM) and classified using automatic model selection based on Schwarz's Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Dynamic Probabilistic Networks (DPNs) are formulated for modelling the temporal and causal correlations among discrete events for robust and holistic scene-level behaviour interpretation. In particular, we developed a Dynamically Multi-Linked Hidden Markov Model (DML-HMM) based on the discovery of salient dynamic interlinks among multiple temporal processes corresponding to multiple event classes. A DML-HMM is built using BIC based factorisation resulting in its topology being intrinsically determined by the underlying causality and temporal order among events. Extensive experiments are conducted on modelling activities captured in different indoor and outdoor scenes. Our experimental results demonstrate that the performance of a DML-HMM on modelling group activities in a noisy and cluttered scene is superior compared to those of other comparable dynamic probabilistic networks including a Multi-Observation Hidden Markov Model (MOHMM), a Parallel Hidden Markov Model (PaHMM) and a Coupled Hidden Markov Model (CHMM).", "paper_title": "Beyond tracking: Modelling activity and understanding behaviour", "paper_id": "WOS:000237122300002"}
