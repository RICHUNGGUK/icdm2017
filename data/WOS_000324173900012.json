Contextual partitioning (CP) permits multiple simplified versions of the same task to exist in parallel, with selection tied to the context in use. We introduce CP for speech recognition, specifically targeted at user interfaces in handheld embedded devices. Contexts are drawn from webpage interactions. CP results in 61% fewer decoding errors, 97% less training for vocabulary changes, near-linear scaling potential with increasing core counts, and up to a potential 90% reduction in power usage.", "paper_title": "Contextual Partitioning for Speech Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000324173900012"}
