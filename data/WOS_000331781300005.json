Collaborative filtering is a widely accepted technique to generate recommendations based on the ratings of like-minded users. However, it suffers from several inherent issues such as data sparsity and cold start. To address these problems, we propose a novel method called \"Merge\" to incorporate social trust information (i.e., trusted neighbors explicitly specified by users) in providing recommendations. Specifically, ratings of a user's trusted neighbors are merged to complement and represent the preferences of the user and to find other users with similar preferences (i.e., similar users). In addition, the quality of merged ratings is measured by the confidence considering the number of ratings and the ratio of conflicts between positive and negative opinions. Further, the rating confidence is incorporated into the computation of user similarity. The prediction for a given item is generated by aggregating the ratings of similar users. Experimental results based on three real-world data sets demonstrate that our method outperforms other counterparts both in terms of accuracy and coverage. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
