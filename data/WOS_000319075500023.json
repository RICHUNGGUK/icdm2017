The direct use of multi-dimensional index structure over flash memory would introduce a large number of redundant writes since such index structure requires fine-grained updates intensively. K-D-B-tree is a classic multi-dimensional index structure. In this paper, the implementation of K-D-B-tree over flash memory, namely F-KDB, is proposed to handle fine-grained updates. In F-KDB, a K-D-B-tree node is represented as a collection of logs (termed as logging entries) to efficiently process the updates of the node. Since the collecting and parsing of all the relevant logging entries to construct a node could degrade the query performance, a Workload Adaptive (WA) online algorithm is proposed to improve the query performance. A series of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of F-KDB over flash memory. The response times of insertion/deletion are significantly reduced and the overall performance of F-KDB is improved.", "paper_title": "Efficient implementation of a multi-dimensional index structure over flash memory storage systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000319075500023"}
