The goal is to find activity schedules and resource requirement levels that maximize the net present value of the project cash flows. The problem is first mathematically modeled. Then, a genetic algorithm (GA) is designed using a new three-stage process that utilizes design of experiments and response surface methodology. The results of the performance analysis of the proposed methodology show an effective solution approach to the problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
