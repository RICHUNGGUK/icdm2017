In the face of the large number and wide variety of engineering materials, it is very necessary to research and develop an open, shared, and scalable knowledge framework for implementing domain-oriented and knowledge-based material selection. In this paper, the fundamental concepts and relationships involved in all aspects of material selection are analyzed in detail. A novel ontology-based knowledge framework is presented. The ontology-based Semantic Web technology is introduced into the semantic representation of material selection knowledge. The implicit material selection knowledge is represented as a set of labeled instances and RDF instance graphs in terms of the concept model, which provides a formal approach to organizing the captured material selection knowledge. A knowledge retrieval and reasoning approach integrating ontology concepts, instances, knowledge rules, and semantic queries encoded with Query-enhanced Web Rule Language (SQWRL) is proposed. The presented knowledge framework can provide powerful knowledge services for material selection. Finally, based on this knowledge framework, a case study on constructing a mold material selection knowledge system is provided. This work is a new attempt to build an open and shared knowledge framework for engineering material selection. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
