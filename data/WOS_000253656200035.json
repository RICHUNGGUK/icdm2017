To judge occurrence of frequency interference, we use a parameter POI (probability of interference) that depends on several factors such as multiple access method. emission mask, the number of channel, etc. Due to its dependence on several factors, a Monte-carlo based simulation is suitably used. Through the simulation. we draw minimum separation distance between two readers and examine performance degradation due to aggregate interfering readers. Moreover, we present a reader deployment strategy based on the average POI of active readers operating in some area.", "paper_title": "A POI-based RFID reader deployment and associated interference effect", "paper_id": "WOS:000253656200035"}
