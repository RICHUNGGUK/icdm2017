An example of application is given with reference to a check valve of a turbo-pump lubricating system in a Nuclear Power Plant, which is degrading due to mechanical fatigue and undergoes condition-based maintenance interventions. The component degradation-failure model used to evaluate the performance of the maintenance policy contains parameters subject to epistemic uncertainty. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
