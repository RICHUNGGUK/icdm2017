The present paper explores how the choice of the parametrization of rotation, when employed in conjuction with different numerical time-integration schemes, effects the accuracy and the computational efficiency. Three rotation parametrizations - the rotational vector, the Argyris tangential vector and the rotational quaternion - are combined with three different numerical time-integration schemes, including classical explicit Runge-Kutta method and the novel midpoint rule proposed here. The key result of the study is the assessment of the integration errors of various parametrization-integration method combinations. In order to assess the errors, we choose a time-dependent function corresponding to a rotational vector, and derive the related exact time-dependent angular velocity. This is then employed in the numerical solution as the data. The resulting numerically integrated approximate rotations are compared with the analytical solution. A novel global solution error norm for discrete solutions given by a set of values at chosen time-points is employed. Several characteristic angular velocity functions, resulting in small, finite and fast oscillating rotations are studied. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
