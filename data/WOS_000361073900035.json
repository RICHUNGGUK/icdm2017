In this study, for the first time, the progressive fracture mechanisms of all ISRM-suggested specimens are numerically investigated. The results indicate that the realistic crack front in the fracture process is significantly curved for specimens with a chevron notch, which violates the adopted straight-through crack assumption in the measuring principle; therefore, the traditional dimensionless stress intensity factors (SIFs) of chevron-notched specimens are likely inaccurate. In particular, the dimensionless SIFs of cracked chevron-notched Brazilian disc (CCNBD) specimens are likely the most inaccurate because the real fracture process of a CCNBD significantly deviates from the idealized situation. The numerical assessments of the progressive fracture mechanism of all ISRM-suggested specimens show that the fracture of the semi-circular bend (SCB) specimen agrees with the measuring principle. Furthermore, the dimensionless SIFs of the chevron-notched samples should be recalibrated using the realistic crack front with a curved shape in future studies. The numerical results indicate the need for additional studies of the progressive fracture mechanisms of the tested specimens to accurately measure the mode I fracture toughness of rocks.
