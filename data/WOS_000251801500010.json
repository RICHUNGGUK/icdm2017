Lattice basis reduction helps us to reduce the average transmitted energy by modifying the region which includes the constellation points. The new viewpoint helps us to generalize the idea of lattice-reduction-aided (LRA) precoding for the case of unequal-rate transmission, and obtain analytic results for the asymptotic behavior (signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) -> infinity) of the symbol error rate for the LRA precoding and the perturbation technique. Also, the outage probability for both cases of fixed-rate users and fixed sum rate is analyzed. It is shown that the LRA method, using the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz (LLL) algorithm, achieves the optimum asymptotic slope of symbol error rate (called the precoding diversity).", "paper_title": "Communication over MIMO broadcast channels using lattice-basis reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000251801500010"}
