Promotional efforts impact the replenishment policy and the sale price of goods. In this paper, the problem of replenishment policy and pricing for non-instantaneous deteriorating items subject to promotional effort is considered. We adopt a price dependent stochastic demand function in which shortages are allowed and partially backlogged. The major objective is to simultaneously determine the optimal selling price, the optimal replenishment schedule, and the optimal order quantity to maximize the total profit. First, we prove that a unique optimal replenishment schedule exists for any given selling price. Second, we prove that the total profit is a concave function of price. Third, we present an algorithm to obtain the optimal solution and solve a numerical example. Last, we extend the numerical example by performing a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters and discuss specific managerial insights.
