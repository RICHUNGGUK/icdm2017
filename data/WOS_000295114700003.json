The Community Structure Activity Resource (CSAR) aims to collect available data from industry and academia which may be used for this purpose (www.csardock.org). Also, CSAR is charged with organizing community-wide exercises based on the collected data. The first of these exercises was aimed to gauge the overall state of docking and scoring, using a large and diverse data set of protein ligand complexes. Participants were asked to calculate the affinity of the complexes as provided and then recalculate with changes which may improve their specific method. This first data set was selected from existing PDB entries which had binding data (K(d) or K(i)) in Binding MOAD, augmented with entries from PDBbind. The final data set contains 343 diverse protein ligand complexes and spans 14 pK(d). Sixteen proteins have three or more complexes in the data set, from which a user could start an inspection of congeneric series. Inherent experimental error limits the possible correlation between scores and measured affinity; R(2) is limited to similar to 0.9 when fitting to the data set without over parametrizing. R(2) is limited to similar to 0.8 when scoring the data set with a method trained on outside data. The details of how the data set was initially selected, and the process by which it matured to better fit the needs of the community are presented. Many groups generously participated in improving the data set, and this underscores the value of a supportive, collaborative effort in moving our field forward.", "paper_title": "CSAR Benchmark Exercise of 2010: Selection of the Protein-Ligand Complexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000295114700003"}
