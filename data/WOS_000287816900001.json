This generalization makes bounded linear logic considerably more flexible, while preserving soundness and completeness for polynomial time. In particular, we provide compositional embeddings of Leivant's RRW and Hofmann's LFPL into QBAL.", "paper_title": "BOUNDED LINEAR LOGIC, REVISITED", "paper_id": "WOS:000287816900001"}
