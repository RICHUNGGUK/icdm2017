This is not only time consuming but also very dependent on designer's experience. We propose a novel design exploration method that exploits the duality of time- and resource-constrained scheduling problems. Our exploration automatically constructs a time/area tradeoff curve in a fast, effective manner. It is a general approach and can be combined with any high-quality scheduling algorithm. In our work, we use the max-min ant colony optimization technique to solve both time- and resource-constrained scheduling problems. Our algorithm provides significant solution-quality savings (average 17.3% reduction of resource counts) with similar runtime compared to using force-directed scheduling exhaustively at every time step. It also scales well across a comprehensive benchmark suite constructed with classic and real-life samples.", "paper_title": "Exploring time/resource trade-offs by solving dual scheduling problems with the ant colony optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000250227600010"}
