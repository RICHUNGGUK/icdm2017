Thus it is possible to simulate the human cardiovascular system, its negative feedback loops (including the control of venous tone, of myocardial contractility, and of heart rate) and negative intrathoracic pressure. If the simulated cardiovascular system is acted upon by various disturbances their consequences can be studied in detail. The consequences of two disturbances are studied by simulation: (i) acute left ventricular failure and (ii) exercise (decreased peripheral resistance) in aortic stenosis. However, prior to the simulation of the latter, a relatively complex condition, two additional procedures are implemented, i.e. simulations of (iii) increased sympathetic tone and of (iv) aortic stenosis are performed. Simulation of exercise (decreased peripheral resistance) in aortic stenosis is also compared with data observed in patients. Results show that, by using the present equivalent circuit, conditions described above can be qualitatively and to some extent quantitatively well simulated. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
