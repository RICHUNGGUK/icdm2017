While offering better resource utilization, better reliability, and often even much better quality of experience (QoE), multipath routing and provisioning was shown to help network and data center operators achieve traffic engineering in the form of load balancing. In this survey, we first highlight the benefits and basic Internet multipath routing components. We take a top-down approach and review various multipath protocols, from application to link and physical layers, operating at different parts of the Internet. We also describe the mathematical foundations of the multipath operation, as well as highlight the issues and challenges pertaining to reliable data delivery, buffering, and security in deploying multipath provisioning in the Internet. We compare the benefits and drawbacks of these protocols operating at different Internet layers and discuss open issues and challenges.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Internet Multipath Routing and Provisioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000365233100014"}
