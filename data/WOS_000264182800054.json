An illustration segment evaluation procedure is used to demonstrate that our procedure is an effective quantification approach for integrating five forces, generic strategies and marketing information in a group decision-making process. The final decision-maker (DM) synthesizes the total crisp scores of individual alternatives by choosing judgmental coefficients lambda based on individual attitude towards core business competitiveness and market risks to accommodate differences among market segments to the specific environment with a better understanding of the decision problem and individual decision-making behavior. In the illustration presented here, the final solution is then obtained by identifying the best market segment for further development and negotiation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
