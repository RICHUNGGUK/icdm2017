These issues can relate both to the modeler and to the modelling process including the social interaction in the modelling team. The origins of behavioural effects can be in the cognitive and motivational biases or in the social systems created as well as in the visual and verbal communication strategies used. The possible occurrence of these phenomena in the context of environmental modelling is discussed and suggestions for research topics are provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
