We extend this theory to general cellular automata using topological methods. The starting point is the observation that the rescaled space-time diagrams, intersected with an appropriately chosen compact set, form sequences in a compact, metric space. They necessarily possess converging subsequences. In the present paper we define graphical limit sets as the collection of the accumulation points. The main result is that for a large class of cellular automata the graphical limit set defined in this way carries a group structure, which is either the trivial group consisting of one element only, or is homeomorphic to S-1. The well known self-similar, graphical limit sets are representatives of the second class. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
