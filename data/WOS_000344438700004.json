In economical point of view, the stability region in input-output space for maintaining the efficiency score of efficient DMU is important. In this paper, a new sensitivity analysis approach based on Banker, Charnes and Cooper (BCC) model which is modified by facet analysis, is developed. An extended stability region is determined especially for DMUs that are placed on intersection of efficient and weak efficient frontier. The results are shown by numerical examples.
