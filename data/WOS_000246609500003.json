Topological and metric localization information are combined in an efficient, hierarchical process, with each step being more complex and accurate than the previous one but evaluating fewer images. This allows us to work with large reference image sets in a reasonable amount of time. Simultaneously, thanks to the use of I D three-view geometry, accurate metric localization can be achieved based on just a small number of nearby reference images. Owing to the wide baseline features used, the method deals well with illumination changes and occlusions, while keeping the computational load small. The simplicity of the radial line features used speeds up the process without affecting the accuracy too much. We show experiments with two omnidirectional image data sets to evaluate the performance of the method and compare the results using the proposed radial lines with results from state-of-the-art wide-baseline matching techniques.
