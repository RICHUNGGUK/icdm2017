In this paper we present TauThor, a tool to enumerate tautomers and predict tautomer stability in the aqueous medium. The enumeration is based on a recursive process that generates tautomers according to the general scheme HX-Y=Z reversible arrow X=Y-ZH. The stability of a tautomer is calculated by using a library of 145 fragments associated with experimental tautomeric percentages in water and a pK(a) based-method that utilizes pK(a) values predicted by MoKa. Predicted tautomeric ratios based on pK(a) calculations were benchmarked against literature data for a set of eleven compounds. The FDA approved drugs database, the NCI database and two vendor databases - Specs Screening Library and Asinex Gold Collection - were used to illustrate the impact of tautomerism on chemical libraries and to evaluate the relative occurrences of alternative tautomeric forms.", "paper_title": "Tautomer Enumeration and Stability Prediction for Virtual Screening on Large Chemical Databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000262818500009"}
