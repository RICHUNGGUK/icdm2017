The optimal Wiener solution and several simplifications with different tradeoffs between complexity and performance are developed. We also prove the persymmetric structure of these Wiener filters. The existing mean reconstruction method is proven to be a special case of the proposed framework. Our method also includes as a special case the linear interpolation method used in DCT-based systems when there is no pre/postfiltering and when the quantization noise is ignored. The design criteria in our previous results are scrutinized and improved solutions are obtained. Various design examples and multiple description image coding experiments are reported to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Wiener filter-based error resilient time-domain lapped transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000243619200017"}
