For that purpose, we investigate the intersection between the 3D half-grid and the rotation plane. From this intersection, we define 3D hinge angles which determine a transit of a grid point from a voxel to its adjacent voxel during the rotation. Then, we give a method to sort all 3D hinge angles with integer computations. The study of 3D hinge angles allows us to design a 3D discrete rotation and to estimate the rotation between a pair of digital images in correspondence. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
