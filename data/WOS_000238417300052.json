This work has led to the implementation of advanced multiphysics, multi-scale, and multi-block numerical models and an autonomic software stack for DDDAS applications. The stack implements a Grid-based adaptive execution engine, distributed data management services for real-time data access, exploration, and coupling, and self-managing middleware services for seamless discovery and composition of components, services, and data on the Grid. This paper investigates how these solutions can be leveraged and applied to address another DDDAS application of strategic importance - the data-driven management of Ruby Gulch Waste Repository.", "paper_title": "Towards dynamic data-driven management of the Ruby Gulch Waste Repository", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300052"}
