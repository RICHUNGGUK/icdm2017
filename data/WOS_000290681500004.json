The weighted region setup is a more realistic model for many facility location problems that arise in practical applications. Our algorithms exploit an interesting property of the problem, that could possibly be used for solving other problems in weighted regions.", "paper_title": "Line facility location in weighted regions", "paper_id": "WOS:000290681500004"}
