Fault detection, isolation, and estimation tasks are considered. Moreover, the problem of quantifying the uncertainty in the ARR parameters is also addressed. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach, a case study based on the well-known wind turbine benchmark is used.", "paper_title": "Robust Fault Diagnosis of Nonlinear Systems Using Interval Constraint Satisfaction and Analytical Redundancy Relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000329055600002"}
