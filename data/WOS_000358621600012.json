Drawn on the generalization bounds, a complex SVM approach based on the Szego kernel of the Hardy space H-2(D) is formulated. It is applied to the frequency-domain identification problem of discrete linear time-invariant system (LTIS). Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is effective in applications.", "paper_title": "Sparse representation in Szego kernels through reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory with applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000358621600012"}
