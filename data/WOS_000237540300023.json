Blueweb's scatternet formation uses two mechanisms. One is the role exchange mechanism in which only slave nodes serve as relays throughout the whole scatternet. The other one is the return connection mechanism in which we convert the scatternet from a tree-shaped to a web-shaped topology. In this paper, a modified source routing protocol is proposed for Blueweb in which we combine the proactive method locally with the reactive method globally to discover the optimal path for packet transmission. In addition, we use computer simulations to evaluate the routing performance of Blueweb with a uniform end-to-end traffic model. Our simulation results show that Blueweb can achieve good system performance with the modified source routing protocol.", "paper_title": "On the performance of a hybrid routing protocol for blueweb: A bluetooth-based multihop ad hoc network", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300023"}
