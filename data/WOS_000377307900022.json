New analytical results for the secrecy outage probability and the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity are derived when the receiving terminals employ the maximum ratio combining scheme. In addition, simple and insightful approximations are obtained for the secrecy outage probability in the high signal to noise ratio regime, which shed light on the impact of key system parameters on the secrecy performance. Simulation results are provided to validate the analytical expressions.", "paper_title": "On the Secrecy Enhancement With Low-Complexity Large-Scale Transmit Selection in MIMO Generalized Composite Fading", "paper_id": "WOS:000377307900022"}
