We compare the errors and convergence rates of the standard and compatible SPH formalisms on a variety of shock test problems with analytic answers. We find that the new compatible formalism reliably achieves the expected first-order convergence for these analytic shock tests and, in all cases, improves the accuracy of the numerical solution over the standard formalism. We also examine the performance of our new formalism on a more complicated applied problem: the diversion of an asteroid by a kinetic impactor. We find the compatible discretization demonstrates measurable improvement in the convergence of properties such as the deflection velocity in this kind of applied problem as well.
