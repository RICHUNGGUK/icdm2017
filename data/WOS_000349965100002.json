One is the grooved Fresnel zone plate reflector with continuous phase-correcting. The other called subzone paraboloid reflector, has the profile that consists of a series of paraboloids. Their diffraction efficiencies and bandwidths are described. The two elements still preserve the advantages of Fresnel zone plates, namely, low profile, high efficiency, and simple fabrication. Two dual-reflector antennas using the proposed focusing elements as the main reflectors are simulated and the results show that these antennas have good radiation performances.
