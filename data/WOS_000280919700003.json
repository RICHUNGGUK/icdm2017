The robots have no knowledge of the arena dimensions and of the number of resource areas. The strategy is based on peer-to-peer local communication without the need for any central unit. Social Odometry leads to a self-organized path selection. We show how collective decisions lead the robots to choose the closest resource site from a central place. Results are presented with simulated and real robots.", "paper_title": "Collective decision-making based on social odometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000280919700003"}
