In this paper, we propose a novel buffer replacement scheme for mobile NAND flash storages. It efficiently improves write performance by evicting pages flash-friendly and maintains high cache hit ratios by managing pages in order of recency. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the best performing scheme in the recent literature, Sp.Clock, by 48%.", "paper_title": "Block Utilization-Aware Buffer Replacement Scheme for Mobile NAND Flash Storage", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784600032"}
