Evolutionary multimodal optimization algorithms can be very helpful in such cases. They detect and maintain multiple optimal solutions during the run by incorporating specialized niching operations in their actual framework. Differential evolution (DE) is a powerful evolutionary algorithm (EA) well-known for its ability and efficiency as a single peak global optimizer for continuous spaces. This article suggests a niching scheme integrated with DE for achieving a stable and efficient niching behavior by combining the newly proposed parent-centric mutation operator with synchronous crowding replacement rule. The proposed approach is designed by considering the difficulties associated with the problem dependent niching parameters (like niche radius) and does not make use of such control parameter. The mutation operator helps to maintain the population diversity at an optimum level by using well-defined local neighborhoods. Based on a comparative study involving 13 well-known state-of-the-art niching EAs tested on an extensive collection of benchmarks, we observe a consistent statistical superiority enjoyed by our proposed niching algorithm.", "paper_title": "An Improved Parent-Centric Mutation with Normalized Neighborhoods for Inducing Niching Behavior in Differential Evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000342228100002"}
