However, there are a few concrete ontologies within actual knowledge domains including learning domains. In this paper, we develop an ontology which is an explicit formal specification of concepts and semantic relations among them in philosophy. We call it a philosophy ontology. Our philosophy is a formal specification of philosophical knowledge including knowledge of contents of classical texts of philosophy. We propose a methodology, which consists of detailed guidelines and templates, for constructing text-based ontology. Our methodology consists of 3 major steps and 14 minor steps. To implement the philosophy ontology, we develop an ontology management system based on Topic Maps. Our system includes a semi-automatic translator for creating Topic Map documents from the output of conceptualization steps and other tools to construct, store, retrieve ontologies based on Topic Maps. Our methodology and tools can be applied to other learning domain ontologies, such as history, literature, arts, and music.
