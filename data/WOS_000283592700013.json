Such flows are known to be low Reynolds number incompressible flows and occur in many real life situations. To obtain a high quality fluid surface, we include a scalar value in isofunction. The scalar value indicates the relative position of each particle with respect to the fluid surface.", "paper_title": "Particle-based simulation and visualization of fluid flows through porous media", "paper_id": "WOS:000283592700013"}
