Such systems could sometimes experience transient overloads because of workload bursts or hardware malfunctions. Thus a mechanism to focus limited resources on the processing of urgent events is a key to retain system validity under stressing workloads. In this paper, we propose a new approach for workload Scaling in uniprocessor real-time embedded systems. The idea is to view the system as a black box, and workload scaling for overload management can be done via very intuitive primitives, i.e., how hardware events are selectively fed into the system. Such a new approach removes the need for the adjustments of task periods and task phasing, which is important for many workload-scaling techniques. The proposed approach is implemented in a real-time surveillance system. Experimental results show that the system still delivers good accuracy and high responsiveness for visual-object tracking under the presence of overloads.", "paper_title": "Event-driven dynamic workload scaling for uniprocessor real-time embedded systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000249934900004"}
