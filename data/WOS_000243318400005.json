The visualization is aimed at exploration of properties of the data and selecting a small number of interesting items from the database. The method introduced here is a new development of the Reasonable Goals method, which has already been implemented on Internet in the form of the Web application server. Thus, the new method can be applied on Internet, too. It can be used for selection-aimed data mining in various fields including environmental planning, machinery design, financial planning (including credit operations), biology and medicine.", "paper_title": "Visualization-based selection-aimed data mining with fuzzy data", "paper_id": "WOS:000243318400005"}
