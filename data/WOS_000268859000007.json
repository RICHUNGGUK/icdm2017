The \"kidnapped robot\" possesses a compass and map of its environment; it must determine its location at a minimum cost of travel distance. The problem is NP-hard [G. Dudek, K. Romanik, and S. Whitesides, SIAM J. Comput., 27 (1998), pp. 583-604] even to minimize within factor c log n [C. Tovey and S. Koenig, Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Austin, TX, 2000, pp. 819-824], where n is the map size. No approximation algorithm has been known. We give an O(log(3) n)-factor algorithm. The key idea is to plan travel in a \"majority-rule\" map, which eliminates uncertainty and permits a link to the 1/2-Group Steiner (not Group Steiner) problem. The approximation factor is not far from optimal: we prove a c log(2-epsilon) n lower bound, assuming NP not subset of ZTIME(n(polylog(n))), for the grid graphs commonly used in practice. We also extend the algorithm to polygonal maps by discretizing the problem using novel geometric techniques.", "paper_title": "A NEAR-TIGHT APPROXIMATION ALGORITHM FOR THE ROBOT LOCALIZATION PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000268859000007"}
