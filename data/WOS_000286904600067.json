One of potential ways to promote competition among service providers is to introduce a mobile number portability (MNP) service. Consumer preferences are estimated using conjoint analysis. Results indicate that subscribers do not consider the MNP service an import attribute, while price and service quality are the most valuable attributes. The results of this study provide important information to implement the first service launch in mobile telecommunication and other similar information and communication technology (ICT) services.
