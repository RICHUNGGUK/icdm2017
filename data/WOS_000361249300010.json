The model helps to make several decisions about the strategic issues such as opening of pharmaceutical manufacturing centers and main/local distribution centers along with optimal material flows over a mid-term planning horizon as the tactical decisions. It aims to concurrently minimize the total costs and unfulfilled demands as the first and second objective functions. Since the critical parameters are tainted with great degree of epistemic uncertainty, a robust possibilistic programming approach is used to handle uncertain parameters. In order to verify and analyze the proposed model, it is tested on a real case study and managerial insights are provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
