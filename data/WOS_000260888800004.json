They have the virtue of being computationally efficient (and hence interactive) and applicable to a variety of object representations. In this article we survey the state of the art in spatial deformation. Since manipulating ambient space directly is infeasible, deformations are controlled by tools of varying dimension-points, curves, surfaces and volumes-and it is on this basis that we classify them. Unlike previous surveys that concentrate on providing a single underlying mathematical formalism, we use the user-centered criteria of versatility, ease of use, efficiency and correctness to compare techniques.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Spatial Deformation from a User-Centered Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000260888800004"}
