Most of the previous protocols were designed for ideal circumstances, where the Packet Drop Loss Ratio (PDLR) on each communication link is 0. Moreover, in hazardous surroundings, channel state is unstable, which is ignored by many algorithms. In this paper, we investigate an Opportunistic Relay Assignment Problem (ORAP) in a wireless cooperative network where channel state is unstable. We take into consideration the PFLR, while still guaranteeing energy-efficiency. We prove that this problem (ORAP) is NP-hard. A distributed algorithm, called DORAA, is proposed to solve this problem. We analyse the approximate performance ratio of DORAA. Our numerical results show that DORAA can reduce expected transmission time by 15.44% and save energy by 19.45% on average.", "paper_title": "An energy-efficient opportunistic relay assignment in wireless cooperative networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000320854300001"}
