In this paper, we focus on reducing the energy consumption in the data and instruction cache hierarchies in a multicore system. First, we present a level one data cache tuning heuristic for a heterogeneous multicore system, which classifies applications based on data sharing and cache behavior and uses this classification to guide cache tuning and reduce the number of cores that need to be tuned. Results reveal average energy savings of 25 percent for 2, 4, 8, and 16-core systems while searching only 1 percent of the design space. Next, we present a level one instruction cache tuning heuristic that reduces energy consumption in the instruction cache hierarchy by an average of 53 percent for 2, 4, 8, and 16-core systems, while searching less than 1 percent of the design space. Finally, we develop a custom, global hardware cache tuner for a dual-core system and show that our cache tuner has low area, energy, and power overheads.", "paper_title": "A Cache Tuning Heuristic for Multicore Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000321221000007"}
