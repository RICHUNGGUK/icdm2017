By considering the dependence among protection domains and all the scenarios when a lightpath is available, our model can estimate the service availability more precisely than those in previous work. Then, based on the availability analysis, we propose a service availability oriented p-cycle configuration algorithm for dynamic elastic optical networks (EONs), namely, the number of relevant links (NRL)-based p-cycle design algorithm (NRL-p-cycle). The simulations compare the proposed algorithm with two benchmark p-cycle design algorithms that are based on the protection efficiency of p-cycles. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the service availability in EONs while keeping the blocking probability almost unchanged.", "paper_title": "Service Availability Oriented p-Cycle Protection Design in Elastic Optical Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000343163300008"}
