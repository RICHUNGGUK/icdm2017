Single registration (SR) and multiple registration (MR) schemes are introduced and improved to support both voice and data services efficiently. The performance of the improved SR and MR schemes is analyzed based on mobility and traffic characteristics of mobile users. The results show that there is tradeoff between improved SR and MR schemes and thus, an appropriate scheme should be selected based on users' mobility and traffic characteristics. The analytical methodology developed in this paper can be extended to analyze the performance of general heterogeneous networks with multiple wireless access systems, which will be realized in fourth generation (4G) networks.", "paper_title": "QoS-aware multi-tier location managements for integrated WLAN/UMTS networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800026"}
