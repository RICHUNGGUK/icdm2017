The WCSP finds an optimal plan in the planning graph containing all solution plans of minimum length. Experimental trials were performed to study the impact of soft arc consistency techniques (FDAC and EDAC) on the efficiency of the search for an optimal plan in this graph. We conclude by giving a possible theoretical explanation for the fact that we were able to solve optimisation problems involving several hundred variables.", "paper_title": "Soft arc consistency applied to optimal planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000241582400049"}
