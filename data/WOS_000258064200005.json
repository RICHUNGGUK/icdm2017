It is hence recognized that approximate answers are usually sufficient, where a good approximation obtained in a timely manner is often better than the exact answer that is delayed beyond the window of opportunity. Unfortunately, this is not the case for mining frequent patterns over data streams where algorithms capable of online processing data streams do not conform strictly to a precise error guarantee. Since the quality of approximate answers is as important as their timely delivery, it is necessary to design algorithms to meet both criteria at the same time. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that allows online processing of streaming data and yet guaranteeing the support error of frequent patterns strictly within a user-specified threshold. Our theoretical and experimental studies show that our algorithm is an effective and reliable method for finding frequent sets in data stream environments when both constraints need to be satisfied.", "paper_title": "Online mining of frequent sets in data streams with error guarantee", "paper_id": "WOS:000258064200005"}
