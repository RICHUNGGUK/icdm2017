Working on top of an existing recommender system, this paper presents mechanisms to automatically compose applications that provide personalized commercial functionalities to the users. The proposal addresses specific concerns of DTV environments, with special attention to achieving good personalization quality and furnishing useful interactions when there is no return channel permanently available for bidirectional communication. Preliminary experiments reveal good acceptance of the concept among real users. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
