Objectives: For Guillain-Barre patients, motor rehabilitation programs are helpful at the onset to prevent the complications of paralysis and in cases of persistent motor impairment. Traditional motor rehabilitation programs may be tedious and monotonous, resulting in low adherence to the treatments. A Virtual Motor Rehabilitation system has been tested in Guillain-Barre patients to increase patient adherence and to improve clinical results. Methods: Two people with Guillain-Barre performed 20 rehabilitation sessions. We tested a novel system based on Motor Virtual Rehabilitation in three periods of time (baseline evaluation, final evaluation, and follow-up. In the training program, the participants carried out a specific treatment using the Active Balance Rehabilitation system (ABAR). The system is composed of customizable virtual games to perform static and dynamic balance rehabilitation. Results: Significant improvements in clinical results were obtained by both participants, with significant results in the static balance clinical test of the Anterior Reach test in the standing position and unipedal stance time. Other significant results were found in dynamic balance clinical tests in the Berg Balance Scale test and the 30-second Sit-to-Stand test. With regard to acceptance of the system, both patients enjoyed the experience, and both patients thought that this system was helpful for their rehabilitation. Conclusions: The results show that Virtual Motor Rehabilitation for Guillain-Barre patients provides clinical improvements in an entertaining way.", "paper_title": "A Novel Virtual Motor Rehabilitation System for Guillain-Barre Syndrome Two Single Case Studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000351804000004"}
