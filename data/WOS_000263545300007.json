Inspired by dualism and dominance in nature, genetic algorithms with the dualism mechanism have been applied for several dynamic problems with binary encoding. This paper investigates the idea of dualism for combinatorial optimization problems in dynamic environments, which are also extensively implemented in the real-world. A new variation of the GA, called the permutation-based dual genetic algorithm (PBDGA), is presented. Within this GA, two schemes based on the characters of the permutation in group theory are introduced: a partial-dualism scheme motivated by a new multi-attribute dualism mechanism and a learning scheme. Based on the dynamic test environments constructed by stationary benchmark problems, experiments are carried out to validate the proposed PBDGA. The experimental results show the efficiency of PBDGA in dynamic environments.", "paper_title": "A permutation-based dual genetic algorithm for dynamic optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000263545300007"}
