Utilizing the digital shot based on a three dimensional accelerometer, we get the three dimensional throwing forces in real time. Through wavelet transform, the general characteristics of force information are picked up. Then the general characteristics are input into the classifier for recognition of throwing force curves. The analysis provides the scientific basis for the motion training and instruction of shot put. The experiment shows that the method not only has high anti-noise ability and improves the recognition efficiency, but also decreases the burden of system and improves the recognition speed.", "paper_title": "Recognition method of throwing force of athlete based on multi-class SVM", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000037"}
