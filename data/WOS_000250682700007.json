In this paper, we propose a method for goal change in the framework of Reiters; [12] theory of action in the situation calculus [8, 10], and investigate its properties. We extend the framework developed by Shapiro et al. [17] and Shapiro and Lesprance [16], where goals and goal expansion were modelled, but goal contraction was not.", "paper_title": "Goal change in the situation calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000250682700007"}
