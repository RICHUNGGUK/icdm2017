We propose a new routing strategy in which some smart nodes in networks deliver messages to next hops on the paths towards destinations according to Yan's algorithm while the other nodes just deliver messages randomly. We test our routing strategy in a large scale-free network. Simulations show that the average delivery time decreases with increase of number of smart nodes, while the maximal network capacity increases with number of smart nodes in the network. Moreover our strategy is much more efficient when employed with target selection than with random selection of the smart nodes.", "paper_title": "INTEGRATING LOCAL AND GLOBAL ROUTING ON SCALE-FREE NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289467600007"}
