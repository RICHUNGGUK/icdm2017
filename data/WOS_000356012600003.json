However, existing methods usually only focused on leaf recognition from small databases that usually only contain no more than hundreds of species, and none of them reported a stable performance in either recognition accuracy or recognition speed when compared with a big image database. In this paper, we present a novel method for leaf recognition from a big hierarchical image database. Unlike the existing approaches, our method combines the textural gradient histogram with the shape context to form a more distinctive feature for leaf recognition. To achieve efficient leaf image retrieval, we divided the big database into a set of subsets based on mean-shift clustering on the extracted features and build hierarchical k-dimensional trees (KD-trees) to index each cluster in parallel. Finally, the proposed parallel indexing and searching schemes are implemented with MapReduce architectures. Our method is evaluated with extensive experiments on different databases with different sizes. Comparisons to state-of-the-art techniques were also conducted to validate the proposed method. Both visual results and statistical results are shown to demonstrate its effectiveness.
