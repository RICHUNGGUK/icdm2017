Most previous 3-D modeling methods which directly recover 3-D geometry from single images require user interactions during the whole modeling process. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic 3-D modeling approach to recover accurate 3-D geometry from a single image of a piecewise planar object with less user interaction. Our approach concentrates on these three aspects: (1) requiring rough sketch input only, (2) accurate modeling for a large class of objects, and (3) automatically recovering the invisible part of an object and providing a complete 3-D model. Experimental results on various objects show that the proposed approach provides a good solution to these three problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
