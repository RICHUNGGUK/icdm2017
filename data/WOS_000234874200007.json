It is proved here that there is a subset Lambda of the vertices of T such that Lambda is a lattice and phi vertical bar Lambda is a group homomorphism. The tiling phi(T) is a tiling of R-2 by polyiamonds, polyominos, or polyhexes. These tilings occur often as expansion complexes of finite subdivision rules. The above theorem is instrumental in determining when the tiling phi(T) is conjugate to a self-similar tiling.", "paper_title": "Combinatorially regular polyomino tilings", "paper_id": "WOS:000234874200007"}
