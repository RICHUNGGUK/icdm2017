We find that such a tool is needed for the future development of the field and our own research efforts. It will allow easy reuse of software pieces through appropriate abstractions, facilitating the development of innovative methods, procedures and applications. We include a thorough review of vascular morphology image analysis. After the identification of the key representation elements and operations, we propose a Vessel Knowledge Representation (VKR) model that would fill this gap. We give insights into its implementation based on standard Object-Oriented Programming tools and paradigms. The VKR would easily integrate with existing medical imaging and visualization software platforms, such as the Insight ToolKit (ITK) and Visualization Toolkit (VTK).", "paper_title": "Knowledge management in image-based analysis of blood vessel structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000299092500009"}
