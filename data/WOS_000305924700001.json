According to the attached functional groups on the unsymmetrical distyrylbiphenyls, two kinds of compounds were synthesized and evaluated: (Z)-4-(2-p-tolylvinyl)-4'-[1-phenyl-2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)vinyl]biphenyl (U-DSB_tBM) and (Z)-4-[2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)vinyl]-4'-[1-phenyl-2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)vinyl]biphenyl (U-DSB_tBtB). As the emission layers of U-DSB_tBM or U-DSB_tBtB thickened, the operation voltage increased and the emitted light became more blue. After inserting a hole blocking layer, the values of the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates were (0.14-0.21, 0.15-0.28). As the applied current increased, the y coordinate of the sample using U-DSB_tBM increased: however, that of the sample using U-DSB_tBtB decreased regardless of the device structure. The X-ray diffraction data and the atomic force microscopy imaging results suggest that the hole mobility of U-DSB_tBM is greater than that of U-DSB_tBtB, indicating that the recombination region is located in U-DSB_tBM at a low current, and that it expands to the electron transport layer at a high current. Therefore, the device structure and mobility affect device performance, and both factors should be considered to optimize the device properties. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
