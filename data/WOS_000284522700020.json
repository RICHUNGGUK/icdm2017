The first algorithm addresses the integer case of the bilevel programming problem where integer variables of the outer optimization problem appear in linear or polynomial form in the inner problem. The algorithm employs global optimization techniques to convexify nonlinear terms generated by a reformulation linearization technique (RLT). A continuous multiparametric programming algorithm is then used to solve the reformulated convex inner problem. The second algorithm addresses the mixed-integer case of the bilevel programming problem where integer and continuous variables of the outer problem appear in linear or polynomial forms in the inner problem. The algorithm relies on the use of global multiparametric mixed-integer programming techniques at the inner optimization level. In both algorithms, the multiparametric solutions obtained are embedded in the outer problem to form a set of single-level (M)(I)(N)LP problems - which are then solved to global optimality using standard fixed-point (global) optimization methods. Numerical examples drawn from the open literature are presented to illustrate the proposed algorithms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
