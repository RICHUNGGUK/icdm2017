In this paper, we study the geodesics of such large deformation diffeomorphisms, and more precisely, introduce a fundamental property that they satisfy, namely the conservation of momentum. This property allows us to generate and store complex deformations with the help of one initial \"momentum\" which serves as the initial state of a differential equation in the group of diffeomorphisms. Moreover, it is shown that this momentum can be also used for describing a deformation of given visual structures, like points, contours or images, and that, it has the same dimension as the described object, as a consequence of the normal momentum constraint we introduce.", "paper_title": "Geodesic shooting for computational anatomy", "paper_id": "WOS:000236357400004"}
