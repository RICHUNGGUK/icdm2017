Birationality is shown to be expressed by the equality of two Chern numbers. We provide a relatively effective method for their calculation in terms of certain Hilbert coefficients. In dimension 2 the structure of the irreducible ideals - always complete intersections by a classical theorem of Serre - leads by a natural approach to the calculation of Sylvester determinants. We introduce a computer-assisted method (with a minimal intervention by the computer) which succeeds, in degree <= 5, in producing the full sets of equations of the ideals. In the process, it answers affirmatively some questions raised by Cox [Cox, D.A., 2006. Four conjectures: Two for the moving curve ideal and two for the Bezoutian.
