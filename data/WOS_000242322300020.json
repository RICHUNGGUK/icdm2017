There are currently some approaches in order to solve this problem. The purpose of this paper is to present an alternative for this classical operators so as to speed up effectively their running time. Design/methodology/approach - The paper shows the algorithm, calculate the computational complexity and finally, implement the fast operators to compare the increasing velocity of this choice using different kind of gray-scale images. Findings - The experimental results verify the theoretical results, as is pointed out throughout this work. Originality/value - Highlights two techniques for image processing using mathematical morphology.", "paper_title": "Development of morphological operators for real-time applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000242322300020"}
