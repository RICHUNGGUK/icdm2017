In this paper we propose a simple counter-based optimization for gossip-based broadcast protocols, aimed at enhancing reliability in the face of node failures. The basic idea is to have each node retransmit a broadcast message when the node has received the same message only a few times; a node thus can autonomously perceive the status of message dissemination and promote it when necessary. The usefulness of the technique is demonstrated through simulation results. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
