However, conjoint choice experiments can be used to obtain more information than that revealed by the individuals' single best choices. A way to obtain extra information is by means of best-worst choice experiments in which respondents are asked to indicate not only their most preferred alternative but also their least preferred one in each choice set. To create D-optimal designs for these experiments, an expression for the Fisher information matrix for the maximum-difference model is developed. Semi-Bayesian D-optimal best-worst choice designs are derived and compared with commonly used design strategies in marketing in terms of the D-optimality criterion and prediction accuracy. Finally, it is shown that best-worst choice experiments yield considerably more information than choice experiments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
