First, packet urgency, node urgency, and route urgency are defined on the basis of the end-to-end delay requirement. Based on these urgency metrics and the estimated transmission delay of each packet by Kalman filter, the proposed packet scheduling algorithm determines the transmission order and drop policy to minimize the node urgency without unnecessary packet drop, and the proposed routing algorithm establishes a route to minimize the derivative of route urgency in order to maximize the number of packets delivered within the required end-to-end delay. Finally, experimental results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed joint working algorithms.", "paper_title": "Urgency-based packet scheduling and routing algorithms for delay-sensitive data over MANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000323924800008"}
