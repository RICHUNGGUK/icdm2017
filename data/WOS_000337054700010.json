Its regularization term enforces preservation of strong edges while removing noise. We model the image-prior deconvolution problem as a linear system, which is solved in the frequency domain. This clean formulation lends to a simple and efficient implementation. We demonstrate its effectiveness by performing an extensive comparison with existing non-blind deconvolution methods, and by using it to deblur photographs degraded by camera shake. Our experiments show that our solution is faster and its results tend to have higher peak signal-to-noise ratio than the state-of-the-art techniques. Thus, it provides an attractive alternative to perform high-quality non-blind deconvolution of large images, as well as to be used as the final step of blind-deconvolution algorithms.", "paper_title": "Fast high-quality non-blind deconvolution using sparse adaptive priors", "paper_id": "WOS:000337054700010"}
