It will be shown that the selection of adequate ranges for the initial weights is related with local-stability of the network in its initial stage. As a result, quantitative limits for the initial weights are established that guarantee local stability and accelerate the learning process. These theoretical developments have been tested in experiments which corroborate the improvements achieved with the proposed initialization methods. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
