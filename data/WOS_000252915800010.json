We use a Vertex List Set to keep track of the free area boundary. This structure contains the best candidate locations for the task, and several heuristics are proposed to select one of them, based in fragmentation and adjacency. A Look-Ahead heuristic that anticipates the next known event is also proposed. A metric is used to estimate the fragmentation status of the FPGA, based oil the number of holes and their shape. Defragmentation measures are taken when needed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
