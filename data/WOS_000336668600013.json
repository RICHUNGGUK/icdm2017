Current information for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is estimated from system parameters, which leads to reducing power losses caused in sensing current and the number of components. Operation analysis of boundary conduction, quasiresonant, and discontinuous conduction modes is presented for its implementation. The high current estimation accuracy not only allows adaptive operation mode changes for efficiency optimization, but also guarantees achievement of high MPPT efficiency. Loss analysis of each operation mode is also presented to determine optimal transition points for mode change. A prototype PV micro-converter for a 120-W PV module is implemented by utilizing a digital signal processor. Experimental results verify that the proposed method is stable in both static and dynamic operations. European efficiency and MPPT efficiency are measured higher than 97.5% and 99.5%, respectively.", "paper_title": "Digitally Controlled Current Sensorless Photovoltaic Micro-Converter for DC Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600013"}
