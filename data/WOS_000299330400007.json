In every N x t subarray, each t-tuple occurs in at least one row. Covering arrays have been studied for their significant applications to generating software test suites to cover all t-sets of component interactions. In this paper, we present two constructive methods to obtain covering arrays of strength 5 by using difference covering arrays and holey difference matrices with a prescribed property. As a consequence, some new upper bounds on the covering numbers are derived.", "paper_title": "Constructions of covering arrays of strength five", "paper_id": "WOS:000299330400007"}
