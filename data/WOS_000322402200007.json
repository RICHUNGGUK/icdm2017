In this article, we give applications to the computation of solutions of higher type equations. Given a continuous functional f : X -> Y and y is an element of Y, we wish to compute x is an element of X such that f(x)=y, if such an x exists. We show that if x is unique and X and Y are subspaces of Kleene-Kreisel spaces of continuous functionals with X exhaustible, then x is computable uniformly in f, y and the exhaustibility condition. We also establish a version of this for computational metric spaces X and Y, where is X computationally complete and has an exhaustible set of Kleene-Kreisel representatives. Examples of interest include evaluation functionals defined on compact spaces X of bounded sequences of Taylor coefficients with values on spaces Y of real analytic functions defined on a compact set. A corollary is that it is semi-decidable whether a function defined on such a compact set fails to be analytic, and that the Taylor coefficients of an analytic function can be computed extensionally from the function.", "paper_title": "Algorithmic solution of higher type equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000322402200007"}
