Refined numerical models of different configurations of such a connection system are set-up through the nonlinear code ABAQUS in order to evaluate their performances by means of push-out analyses. The comparison among solutions in terms of strength and stiffness has provided useful indications for the optimization of the system in terms of both geometrical and mechanical characteristics, as well as for its use as reversible intervention for seismic retrofitting purposes.
