Recently, the balancing Choquet integral was introduced as another kind of a symmetric extension of the discrete Choquet integral. We introduce and discuss a new type of such extension, the fusion Choquet integral, and discuss its properties and relationship to the balancing and the symmetric Choquet integral. The symmetric maximum introduced by Grabisch is shown to be a special case of the fusion and the balancing Choquet integral. Several extensions of OWA operators are also discussed.
