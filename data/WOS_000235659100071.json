However, the efficient content-based location remains a challenge of large scale peer-to-peer network. In this paper we present SemreX, a semantic overlay for desktop literature documents sharing in peer-to-peer networks. We present a semantic overlay algorithm by which peers are locally clustered together according to their semantic similarity and long-range connections are rewired for short-cut in the peer-to-peer networks. Experiment results show that routing in the semantic overlay greatly improves the recall of search as well as reduces routing hops and messages.", "paper_title": "Semantic peer-to-peer overlay for efficient content locating", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100071"}
