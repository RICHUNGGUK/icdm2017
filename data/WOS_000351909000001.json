Complete security can only be ensured by adding privacy, cryptographic-based security and trust management aspects in a security solution. However, integration of all these three aspects in a single solution for resource constraints wireless sensor networks is not trivial. Current research intensively focuses on all these three aspects in an isolated manner. To the best of our knowledge, we have not found any work in the literature that comprehensively discusses: how these various privacy, security and trust solutions work together? In this work, we have made the first step towards this direction and to show how integration of various privacy, security and trust solutions can be performed in a single solution in step-by-step manner.", "paper_title": "Security Completeness Problem in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351909000001"}
