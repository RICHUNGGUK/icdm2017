In this paper, we study the computational power of the enhanced mobile membranes. In particular, we focus on the power of mobility given by the operations endo, exo, fendo and fexo. The computational universality is obtained with 12 membranes, while systems with 8 membranes subsume PsET0L, and those with 3 membranes are contained in PsMAT.", "paper_title": "Enhanced Mobile Membranes: Computability Results", "paper_id": "WOS:000287199100014"}
