The rise in blood flow in arteriovenous shunts depends on vascular remodelling. Computational tools to predict the outcome of VA surgery would be important in this clinical context. The aim of our investigation was then to develop a 0D/1D computational model of arm vasculature able to simulate vessel wall remodelling and related changes in blood flow. We assumed that blood vessel remodelling is driven by peak wall shear stress. The model was calibrated with previously reported values of radial artery diameter and blood flow after end-to-end distal fistula creation. Good agreement was obtained between predicted changes in VA flow and in arterial diameter after surgery and corresponding measured values. The use of this computational model may allow accurate vascular surgery planning and ameliorate VA surgery outcomes.", "paper_title": "Computational model for simulation of vascular adaptation following vascular access surgery in haemodialysis patients", "paper_id": "WOS:000334487900007"}
