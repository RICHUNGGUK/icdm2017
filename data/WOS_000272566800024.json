This work investigates fast-scale instability phenomena with a valid and novel approach. Firstly, the operational principle of a single-phase full-bridge inverter is examined and mapping state-space equations are generated. Additionally, the MATLAB/SIMULINK tool for experimental simulation and IsSpice for approximately physical simulation are adopted. The input DC voltage is changed to analyze the fast-scale instability waveforms of the inductor current and output voltage. Simulation results clearly demonstrate that MATLAB/SIMULINK and IsSpice provide consistent results, and validate the mathematical models.", "paper_title": "STUDY ON FAST-SCALE INSTABILITY PHENOMENA OF SINGLE-PHASE FULL-BRIDGE INVERTERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272566800024"}
