Such an event detection problem can be found in many fields in science and engineering, such as signal processing, pattern recognition, and image processing. In recent years, many data sequences used in these fields, especially in video data analysis, tend to be high dimensional. In this paper, we propose a novel event detection method for high-dimensional data sequences in soccer video analysis. The proposed method assumes a Bayesian hidden Markov model with hyperparameter learning in addition to the parameter leaning. This is in an attempt to reduce undesired influences from ineffective components within the high-dimensional data. Implemention is performed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The proposed method was tested against an event detection problem with sequences of 40-dimensional feature values extracted from real professional soccer games. The algorithm appears functional.", "paper_title": "Bayesian event detection for sport games with hidden Markov model", "paper_id": "WOS:000299505000005"}
