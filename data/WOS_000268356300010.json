The main question studied is the design of efficient seed alphabets to construct seeds with optimal sensitivity/selectivity trade-offs. We propose several different design methods and use them to construct several alphabets. We then perform a comparative analysis of seeds built over those alphabets and compare them with the standard BLASTP seeding method [2], [3], as well as with the family of vector seeds proposed in [4]. While the formalism of subset seeds is less expressive (but less costly to implement) than the cumulative principle used in BLASTP and vector seeds, our seeds show a similar or even better performance than BLASTP on Bernoulli models of proteins compatible with the common BLOSUM62 matrix. Finally, we perform a large-scale benchmarking of our seeds against several main databases of protein alignments. Here again, the results show a comparable or better performance of our seeds versus BLASTP.", "paper_title": "On Subset Seeds for Protein Alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000268356300010"}
