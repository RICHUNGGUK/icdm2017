Here we explore the case where the two given files are compressed using LZW, and devise the theoretical framework for modeling delta encoding of compressed files. In practice, although working on the compressed versions in processing time proportional to the compressed files, our target file may be considerably smaller than the corresponding LZW form.", "paper_title": "Modeling delta encoding of compressed files", "paper_id": "WOS:000253948900010"}
