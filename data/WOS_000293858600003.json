In this context, the input parameter may be an important source of variation that is related with a complex mapping function to the remaining sources of variation within a multivariate distribution. The definition of the relationship between the variables of a multivariate distribution and a single source of variation allows the estimation of the values of multiple variables given the value of the single variable, addressing in that way an ill-conditioned one-to-many mapping problem. As part of our investigation, two problem domains are considered: predicting the values of individual stock shares, given the value of the general index, and predicting the grades received by high school pupils, given the grade for a single course or the average grade. With our work, the performance of standard neural network-based methods and in particular multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), radial basis functions (RBFs), mixture density networks (MDNs) and a latent variable method, the general topographic mapping (GTM), is compared. According to the results, MLPs and RBFs outperform MDNs and the GTM for these one-to-many mapping problems.", "paper_title": "Neural network methods for one-to-many multi-valued mapping problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000293858600003"}
