These high power combining structures generally use nonplanar lines and ferrite cores to enhance their power handling capabilities. For optimum and accurate design, part of these equivalent models should be based on full wave EM analysis. In this article, we present such detailed analysis and give examples for wideband isolating and nonisolating power combiners, along with a novel flux canceling circuitry that has been developed to potentially improve the intermodulation distortion performance of these power combiners. Good agreement between measured and simulated results has been successfully demonstrated for both designs with over 30-450 MHz bandwidth and less than half decibel insertion loss.
