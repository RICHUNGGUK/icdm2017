Efficient stabilization methods of time delayed control systems enable NBCSs to be flexibly applied to many kinds of situations. A novel time delay compensation method based on the concept of network disturbance (ND) and communication disturbance observer (CDOB) has been proposed. The compensation method has the same effectiveness as that of the Smith predictor. In addition, since the method is simple and does not need time delay model or time delay measurement, it can be easily implemented to various applications. However;, the design method has not been concerned so far. This paper therefore presents stability analysis and studies a practical design procedure of the time delayed control systems with CDOB. At first, the concept of ND is introduced and the validity of the time delay compensation method is described. Then an analysis about the effects of parameters in control systems on stability is conducted. Characteristics of the effects of parameters on stability come out. Then we study a practical design procedure of the time delayed control systems. The validity of the design procedure is validated by experimental results. In the experiment, we also verify the performance of the system in the case of time-varying delay. Finally, comparative study of the method to the Smith predictor is presented.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis and practical design procedure of time delayed control systems with communication disturbance observer", "paper_id": "WOS:000259540700005"}
