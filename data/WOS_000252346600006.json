The sound field feature, captured from a sound source to a pair of microphones, contains the dynamic of the propagation path. Because of the complexity of indoor environment, the features from different path can be distinguished using appropriate models. Gaussian mixture models are utilized in this paper to characterize the phase difference and magnitude ratio distributions between the microphone pair in consecutive data frames. The application provides an alternative thinking compared with traditional methods such as direction of arrival (DOA) using propagation delay. They usually suffer from reverberation, non-line-of-sight and microphone mismatch problems. The experimental results show the method not only has a high recognition rate for robot's location and orientation, but also is robust against environmental noise. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
