Initially an attempt to categorize coevolutionary experiments is made and subsequently three experiments of competitive coevolution (hunt, battle and mating) are presented. The experiment concerning implicit competition of two species (mating) is given special attention as it shows emergence of compromise and collaboration through a competitive environment. The co-evolution progress monitoring is evaluated through fitness graphs, CIAO and Hamming maps and the results are interpreted for each experimental setup. The paper concludes that despite the alteration of fitness functions, several evasion-pursuit elements emerge. Furthermore, conciliatory strategies can emerge in implicit competitional cases.", "paper_title": "Exploring coevolutionary relations by alterations in fitness function: Experiments with simulated robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000241840200004"}
