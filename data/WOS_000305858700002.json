In this paper, we present a parabola approximation method based on the cubic reparameterization of rational Bezier surfaces, which generates G(1) continuous approximate curves lying completely on the surfaces by using iso-parameter curves of the reparameterized surfaces. The Hausdorff distance between the approximate curve and the exact curve is controlled under the user-specified tolerance. Examples are given to show the performance of our algorithm.
