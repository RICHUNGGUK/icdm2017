An observation is snipped when some of its dimensions are discarded, but the remaining are used for clustering and estimation. Snipped k-means is performed through a probabilistic optimization algorithm which is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum. We show global robustness properties of our snipped k-means procedure. Simulations and a real data application to optical recognition of handwritten digits are used to illustrate and compare the approach.", "paper_title": "Snipping for robust k-means clustering under component-wise contamination", "paper_id": "WOS:000341440800001"}
