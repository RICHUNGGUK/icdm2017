The well-known list scheduling (LS) algorithm has a worst-case bound of (3m - 1)1(in + 1) [Y. Cho, S. Sahni, Bounds for list schedules on uniform processors, SIAM J. Comput. 9 (1980) 91103]. An algorithm with a better competitive ratio was proposed in [R. Li, L. Shi, An on-line algorithm for some uniform processor scheduling, SIAM J. Comput. 27 (1998) 414-422]. It has a worst-case bound of 2.8795 for a big in and s = 2. In this note we present a 2.45-competitive algorithm for in >= 4 and any s, 1 <= s <= 2. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
