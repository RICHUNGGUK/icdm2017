One common root of many of these formalizations is Gold's model of identification in the limit. This model has been studied for learning recursive functions, recursively enumerable languages, and recursive languages, reflecting different aspects of machine learning, artificial intelligence, complexity theory, and recursion theory. One line of research focuses on indexed families of recursive languages - classes of recursive languages described in a representation scheme for which the question of membership for any string in any of the given languages is effectively decidable with a uniform procedure. Such language classes are of interest because of their naturalness. The survey at hand picks out important studies on learning indexed families (including basic as well as recent research), summarizes and illustrates the corresponding results, and points out links to related fields such as grammatical inference, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in general.
