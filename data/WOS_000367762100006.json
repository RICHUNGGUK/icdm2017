In the larger question of which algorithms behave well on which type of instances, our focus is here on the benchmarldng of the behavior of algorithms by applying experiments on test instances. We argue that a good minimum performance benchmark is due to pure random search; i.e. algorithms should do better. We introduce the concept of the cumulative distribution function of the record value as a measure with the benchmark of pure random search and the idea of algorithms being dominated by others. The concepts are illustrated using frequently used algorithms.", "paper_title": "On Benchmarking Stochastic Global Optimization Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000367762100006"}
