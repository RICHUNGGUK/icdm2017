The communication between them can be conducted by Transfer-queue Over Globus (TOG). We discuss issues related to the deployment and the usage of this kind of hybrid grids. We examine it using serial programs and parallel program codes, and compare it with the grids deployed by only GT or SGE, respectively. The case studies imply that this hybrid grid is suitable for loosely coupled applications with high computational complexity.", "paper_title": "A public grid computing framework based on a hierarchical combination of middleware", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100092"}
