This problem is essentially the same as MAX-3LIN problem. We consider simple and efficient message passing algorithms for this problem, and investigate their success probability, where input instances are generated under the planted solution model with equation probability p and perturbation probability q. For some variant of a typical message passing algorithm, we prove that p=I similar to(1/(nlnn)) is the threshold for the algorithm to work w.h.p. for any fixed constant q < 1/2.", "paper_title": "Message Passing Algorithms for MLS-3LIN Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000321212400006"}
