These values are currently obtained with the help of many empirical equations. A different estimation method, in the form of an artificial neural network is presented, in this paper. The network is trained by measurements collected in the laboratory and in-situ under different forcing conditions. Validation of the present neural network results with different measurements shows that the new method can predict the ripple length and height much more accurately than the conventional empirical equations.
