Subjects performed simple reach to grasp movements in a virtual environment in two experiments. In Experiment 1, trials were blocked so that subjects were aware that a graphical representation of the hand would either be available throughout the movement (FA), be removed at movement onset (FAB), or not be available (NF). In Experiment 2, trials were randomized so that subjects were unaware of whether feedback would be available throughout the trial or removed at movement onset. Our results indicated that when subjects were aware of the availability of graphical feedback, the FAB condition improved performance compared to the NF condition. Furthermore, movement time was similar in the two feedback available conditions (FA, FAB). In contrast, for the randomized trial presentation, the positive influence of the FAB condition was diminished. These results suggest that visual feedback available prior to movement onset can be used to calibrate the proprioceptive system and improve performance over a no feedback situation. These results can be applied by designers of virtual environments to solve problems related to occlusion of important environmental information by the hand as users reach to grasp and manipulate objects.
