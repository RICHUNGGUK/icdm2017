Little is known about how colour affects trust or satisfaction on the part of the viewer. Although the Internet is increasingly global, few systematic Studies have been undertaken in which the impact of colour on culturally diverse viewers is investigated in website design. In this research three website colour treatments are tested across three culturally distinct viewer groups for their impact On User trust, satisfaction, and e-loyalty. To gather data, a rich multi-method approach is used including eye-tracking, a survey, and interviews. Results reveal that website colour appeal is a significant determinant for website trust and satisfaction with differences noted across Cultures. The findings have practical value for web marketers and interface designers concerning effective colour use in website development. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
