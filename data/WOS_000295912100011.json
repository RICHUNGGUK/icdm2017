Total measurable acceleration is defined as the acceleration obtained as a vector sum of negative gravitational acceleration (represented as equivalent central acceleration) and the vector of Newton's total acceleration. Kinematic laws which have to be satisfied regardless of the shape of reset motion, two chosen points, and direction defined by points, are found. We give here a thesis of kinematical relationships for the generation, realization, and maintenance of general reset motion, by which we simulate the motion of a mechanical system. Our approach does not analyze the concrete realization of mechanical systems: instead, we describe the laws concerning the motion of a deformable-spaced element whose subspaces later can overlap with parts or completely over any solid body or elastic mechanical system. It is shown that relationships are valid in the case when the observed direction of the deformable-spaced element moves parallel to and periodically around the direction of reset motion for that body. Also, the procedure for generating the reset motion of a deformable-spaced element is presented. We have also defined a set of sensors that the element of deformable space should be equipped with in order to detect, generate, and control reset motion. As an example, we have given the shape of the periodic trajectory of one deformable-spaced point around its reset motion which is generated by impulses. Typical humanoid positions for such motion are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
