This type of problem arises from repetitive routing of grasp-and-delivery robots used in the production of printed circuit boards. The problem is formulated as follows. We are given a metric graph G* = (V*, E*), a set of m + 1 disjoint subsets C-i subset of V* of vertices with vertical bar C-i vertical bar = n, i = 0,1, ..., m, and a starting vertex s is an element of C-0. We seek to find a sequence pi = (C-i1, C-i2, ..., C-im) of the subsets of vertices and a shortest walk P which visits all (m + 1)n vertices in G* in such a way that after starting from s, the walk alternately visits the vertices in Cik-1 and C-ik, for k = 1, 2, ..., m (i(0) = 0). Thus, P is a walk with m(2n - 1) edges obtained by concatenating m alternating Hamiltonian paths between Cik-1 and C-ik, k = 1, 2, ..., m. In this paper, we show. that an approximate sequence of subsets of vertices and an approximate walk with at most three times the optimal route length can be found in polynomial time.", "paper_title": "Better Approximation Algorithms for Grasp-and-Delivery Robot Routing Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000320214300008"}
