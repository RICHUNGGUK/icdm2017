The minimizing coefficients are always positive; some of them are invariant and play an important role in differential algebra. As an example of application of the result obtained, an estimate for a typical differential dimension of a system of partial differential equations is obtained in the case where the orders and degrees of the equations are bounded.", "paper_title": "An upper bound for minimizing coefficients of dimension Kolchin polynomial", "paper_id": "WOS:000276526000005"}
