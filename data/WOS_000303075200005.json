The key functionality of our proposal, best-fit channel selection (BFC) is that it accounts both the primary channel traffic activity and CR traffic activity in channel selection. We assume CR nodes have the capability of estimating the primary channel traffic activities. In BFC, each CR selects a channel among the primary user (PU) channels for transmission that best fits to its transmission time requirement. We compare the performance of BFC to the widely known longest idle time channel selection (LITC) scheme. In LITC, a CR selects the channel that has the longest expected idle time independent of its transmission needs. In a multi-user CRN, this may degrade the network performance compared to the non-selfish BFC approach. LITC is considered selfish since each CR aims to maximize its own benefit and thus wastes resources that may be utilized by other nodes in the network. BFC providing an efficient spectrum sharing mechanism implicitly mitigates the effect of spectrum fragmentation which is a significant issue degrading the CR spectrum utilization. In CRNs, spectrum may be fragmented in various dimensions, e.g. time and frequency, such that some parts of the spectrum can not be used although being idle. Our proposal provides a solution to the spectrum fragmentation issue in time dimension at the medium access control (MAC) layer. By a set of simulations, we highlight the performance improvement by BFC over the conventional LITC under various CR/PU traffic, number of CRs. estimation accuracy and buffering capability. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed BFC is significantly superior to that of LITC in terms of probability of successful transmission, spectrum opportunity utilization and fragmentation.
