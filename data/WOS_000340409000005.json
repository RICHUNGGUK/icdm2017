We propose to use partial object geometry, tactile contacts, and hand kinematic data as proxies to encode task-related constraints, which we call semantic constraints. We introduce a semantic affordance map, which relates local geometry to a set of predefined semantic grasps that are appropriate to different tasks. Using this map, the pose of a robot hand with respect to the object can be estimated so that the hand is adjusted to achieve the ideal approach direction required by a particular task. A grasp planner is then used to search along this approach direction and generate a set of final grasps which have appropriate stability, tactile contacts, and hand kinematics. We show experiments planning semantic grasps on everyday objects and applying these grasps with a physical robot.", "paper_title": "Semantic grasping: planning task-specific stable robotic grasps", "paper_id": "WOS:000340409000005"}
