The user wants to retrieve some item from the database without the latter learning which item is retrieved. Most current PIR protocols are ill-suited to provide PIR from a search engine or large database: (i) their computational complexity is linear in the size of the database; (ii) they assume active cooperation by the database server in the PIR protocol. If the database cannot be assumed to cooperate, a peer-to-peer (P2P) user community is a natural alternative to achieve some query anonymity: a user gets her queries submitted on her behalf by other users in the P2P community. In this way, the database still learns which item is being retrieved, but it cannot obtain the real query histories of users, which become diffused among the peer users. We name this relaxation of PIR user-private information retrieval (UPIR). A peer-to-peer UPIR system is described in this paper which relies on an underlying combinatorial structure to reduce the required key material and increase availability. Extensive simulation results are reported and a distributed key management version of the system is described. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
