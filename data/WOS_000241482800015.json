A graph belongs to the class of d-DIR graphs if it is an intersection graph of segments in at most d directions in the plane. Moreover our algorithms are robust in the sense that they do not need the actual representation of the input graph and they answer correctly even if they are given a graph from outside the promised class.", "paper_title": "Fixed parameter tractability of independent set in segment intersection graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000241482800015"}
