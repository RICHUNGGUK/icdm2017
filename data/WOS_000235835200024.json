Determining the shortest or least cost route is one of the essential tasks that most organizations must perform. Necessary software based on CAD has been developed to help transportation planning and rescue examinations in the scope of this research. Two analyses have been performed by using Dijkstra algorithm. The first one is the shortest path which only takes into account the length between any two nodes. The second is the fastest path by introducing certain speeds into the paths between the nodes in certain times. A case study has been carried out for a selected region in Istanbul to check the performance of the software. After checking the performance of the software, running time of used algorithm was examined. According to the established networks, which have different nodes, the behaviors of algorithm running time were determined separately. Finally, the most appropriate curve was fitted by using CurveExpert 1.3 program according to algorithm running times in different networks.", "paper_title": "Analyzing shortest and fastest paths with GIS and determining algorithm running time", "paper_id": "WOS:000235835200024"}
