This task can be used in various applications such as question answering, summarization, and language specific information retrieval. In this paper, we propose an improved algorithm for classifying temporal relations, between events or between events and time, using support vector machines (SVM). Along with gold-standard corpus features, the proposed method aims at exploiting some useful automatically generated syntactic features to improve the accuracy of classification. Accordingly, a number of novel kernel functions are introduced and evaluated. Our evaluations clearly demonstrate that adding syntactic features results in a considerable improvement over the state-of-the-art method of classifying temporal relations.", "paper_title": "Using Syntactic-Based Kernels for Classifying Temporal Relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000286866900008"}
