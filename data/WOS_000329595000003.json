To secure RFID applications that confine tagged objects in the same RFID system, this paper studies the cloned-tag identification problem. Although limited existing work has shed some light on the problem, designing fast cloned-tag identification protocols for applications in large-scale RFID systems is yet not thoroughly investigated. To this end, we propose leveraging broadcast and collisions to identify cloned tags. This approach relieves us from resorting to complex cryptography techniques and time-consuming transmission of tag IDs. Based on this approach, we derive a time lower bound on cloned-tag identification and propose a suite of time-efficient protocols toward approaching the time lower bound. The execution time of our protocol is only 1.4 times the value of the time lower bound, being over 91% less than that of the existing protocol. Even better, we further dig up an adaptive protocol that can yield higher time efficiency under some scenarios. The proposed protocols may benefit also RFID applications that distribute tagged objects across multiple places. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
