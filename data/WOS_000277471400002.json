Existing novelty metrics can be divided into two types, symmetric and asymmetric, based on whether the ordering of sentences is taken into account. After a comparative study of several different novelty metrics, we observe complementary behavior in the two types of metrics. This finding motivates a new framework of novelty measurement, i.e. the mixture of both symmetric and asymmetric metrics. This new framework of novelty measurement performs superiorly under different performance requirements varying from high-precision to high-recall as well as for data wills different percentages of novel sentences. Because it does not require any prior information, the new metric is very suitable for real-time knowledge base applications such as novelty mining systems where no training data is available beforehand.
