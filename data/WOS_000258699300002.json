Most properties of the classical walk carry over to the quantum operation: degree becomes the number of Kraus operators. the spectral gap lower-bounds the gap of the quantum operation (viewed as a linear map on density matrices). and the quantum operation is efficient whenever the classical walk and the quantum Fourier transform on G are efficient. This means that using classical constant-degree constant-gap families of Cayley expander graphs on groups such as the symmetric group, we can construct efficient families of quantum expanders.", "paper_title": "Quantum expanders from any classical Cayley graph expander", "paper_id": "WOS:000258699300002"}
