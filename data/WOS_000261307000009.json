A multicast message may be unable to reach a destination if Hamming distance between the destination and the multicast source is large enough. A multicast message fails if any one of the destinations is unreachable from the Source. All effective destination ordering scheme of the destinations is proposed for one-port systems first, it is extended to all-port systems for unicast-based fault-tolerant multicasting. Unreachable destinations from the source based on the local safety information are forwarded to a reachable destination, where tire multicast message can be routed reliably. Destination ordering is completed based on Hamming distance. A Multiple round p-cube routing scheme is presented for a deadlock-free fault-tolerant routing for each unicast step in hypercubes, where the same Virtual channel is used for each round of p-cube)e routing. Sufficient simulation results are presented by comparing with the previous methods. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
