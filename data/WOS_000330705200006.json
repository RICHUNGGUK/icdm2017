Complexity measurements, including connectivity, collaboration and redundancy, are proposed and computed. Then the complexity-based capability is discussed and studied. Finally, two case studies of an anti-aircraft defence C2 network and partial tank division network are carried out to illustrate the computation processes of the proposed network complexity and capability.", "paper_title": "Measurement of network complexity and capability in command and control system", "paper_id": "WOS:000330705200006"}
