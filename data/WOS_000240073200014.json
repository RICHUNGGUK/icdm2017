This routing protocol, named as geographic pattern routing (GPR). The protocol does not need to search route frequently, so sufficient bandwidth is reserved for application packets, and QoS is easily guaranteed. It has ingredients to support geographic pattern search and packet forwarding assisted by geographic pattern, and it considers whether sufficient nodes are on the path represented by geographic pattern to allow packets forwarding to the destination. Besides vehicle location, it does not need other information. The simulation shows that GPR is better than other routing protocols.", "paper_title": "Geographic pattern routing for MANETOR in IVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000240073200014"}
