Therefore, the subjective comfort test is expensive and time consuming. Although the foot size and shape of a subject can be obtained by using a three-dimensional (3D) foot scanner, it is still difficult to create foot motion animations of each subject suitable for computer simulation. In this paper, we propose a fast approach to model foot deformation and present its application in simulating interaction with footwear towards footwear design. The simulation determines deformation of foot and footwear models. It can also determine stress distribution in the footwear. Given an initial foot model and a captured foot motion, human foot animation is created first. Then, the footwear model is fitted to the foot to compute the deformation and stress in the footwear. In this article, the boundary element method (BEM) is adopted. We demonstrate the results by conducting simulation of a captured gait motion. Experimental results showed that the method can be used to simulate human gait motion, and can determine deformation of footwear. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
