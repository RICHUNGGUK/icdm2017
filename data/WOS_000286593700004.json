Given a graph G and for each vertex upsilon of G a set alpha(upsilon) of non-negative integers. Is there a set S of vertices or edges of G such that, (1) S satisfies a fixed property expressible in monadic second order logic, and (2) for each vertex upsilon of G the number of vertices/edges in S adjacent/incident with upsilon belongs to the set alpha(upsilon)? We demonstrate that several hard combinatorial problems such as Lovasz's General Factor Problem can be naturally formulated as MSO-LCC problems. Our main result is the polynomial-time tractability of MSO-LCC problems for graphs of bounded treewidth. We obtain this result by means of a tree-automata approach. By way of contrast we show that a more general class of MSO-LCC problems, where cardinality constraints are applied to second-order variables that are arbitrarily quantified, does not admit polynomial-time tractability for graphs of bounded treewidth unless P = NP.", "paper_title": "Monadic Second Order Logic on Graphs with Local Cardinality Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000286593700004"}
