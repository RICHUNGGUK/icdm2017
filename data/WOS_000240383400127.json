We focus on the Privacy-preserving association rules mining in the following situation: two parties, each having a private data set, wish to collaboratively discover association rules on the union of the two private data sets. Therefore, we put forward a novel approach for mining Privacy-preserving association rule based on secure two-party computation using homomorphic encryption technology.", "paper_title": "Privacy preserving association rules mining based on secure two-party computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400127"}
