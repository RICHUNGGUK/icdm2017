To deploy an utmost scalable, flexible, and robust human behavior recognition system, we need both innovative sensing electronics and suitable intelligence algorithms. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) open a novel way for human behavior recognition, because the heavy computation can be immediately transferred to a network server. In this paper, a new scheme for human behavior recognition on WSNs is proposed, which transmits activities' signals compressed by Hamming compressed sensing to the network server and conducts behavior recognition through a collaboration between a new dimension reduction algorithm termed rank preserving discriminant analysis (RPDA) and a nearest neighbor classifier. RPDA encodes local rank information of within-class samples and discriminative information of the between-class under the framework of Patch Alignment Framework. Experiments are conducted on the SCUT Naturalistic 3D Acceleration-based Activity (SCUT NAA) dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of RPDA for human behavior recognition.", "paper_title": "Rank Preserving Discriminant Analysis for Human Behavior Recognition on Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600081"}
