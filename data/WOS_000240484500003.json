We model the vuggy medium on the microscopic scale using Stokes equations within the vugular inclusions, Darcy's law within the porous rock, and a Beavers-Joseph-Saffman boundary condition on the interface between the two regions. We assume periodicity of the medium and obtain uniform energy estimates independent of the period. Through a two-scale homogenization limit as the period tends to zero, we obtain a macroscopic Darcy's law governing the medium on larger scales. We also develop some needed generalizations of the two-scale convergence theory needed for our bimodal medium, including a two-scale convergence result on the Darcy-Stokes interface. The macroscopic Darcy permeability is computable from the solution of a cell problem. An analytic solution to this problem in a simple geometry suggests that: (1) flow along vug channels is primarily Poiseuille with a small perturbation related to the Beavers-Joseph slip, and (2) flow that alternates from vug to matrix behaves as if the vugs have infinite permeability.", "paper_title": "Homogenization of a Darcy-Stokes system modeling vuggy porous media", "paper_id": "WOS:000240484500003"}
