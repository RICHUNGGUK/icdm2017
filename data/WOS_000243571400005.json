Discussions at a conference on CDS in CPOE held in San Francisco, California, June 21-22, 2005 produced several papers in this issue of JAMIA. The first paper reviews CDS for electronic prescribing within CPOE systems;(1) the second describes current controversies regarding creation, maintenance, and uses of CPOE order sets for CDS;(2) and the third presents issues related to certification as a potential means of validating CPOE systems for widespread use.(3) This manuscript summarizes all of the discussions at the meeting and provides a pragmatically oriented view of how to implement CPOE with CDS.", "paper_title": "A pragmatic approach to implementing best practices for clinical decision support systems in computerized provider order entry systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243571400005"}
