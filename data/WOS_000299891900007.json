We compared leap up strategies between two distantly related amniote species, Anolis carolinensis (Squamate) and Microcebus murinus (Lemuriform) known to use leaping as their major locomotor mode for predator avoidance. Our comparative analysis and model show that leaping strategies (flat jump trajectory in horizontal leaps, use of forelimbs in landing) are similar in both species. The most striking divergence concerns only the temporal joint sequence accommodation to leaping height, although an identical proximal-to-distal sequence is observed when both taxa leap to maximal height. We suggest a convergent exaptation of leaping biomechanics among arboreal amniotes, which reflects similar biomechanical constraints and evolutionary pressures in these animals.", "paper_title": "Convergent exaptation of leap up for escape in distantly related arboreal amniotes", "paper_id": "WOS:000299891900007"}
