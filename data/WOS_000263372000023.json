It insures actual parity between perception and action, since the perceived and performed actions are equivalently and simultaneously represented within the mirror neuron system. Based on the parity of this representation we show how the mirror neuron system may facilitate the interaction between two robots. Synchronization between neuron groups in different structures of the mirror neuron system are on the basis of the interaction behavior. The robotic simulation is used to illustrate several interactions. The resulting synchronization and turn taking behaviors show the potential of the mirror neuron paradigm for designing of socially meaningful behaviors. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
