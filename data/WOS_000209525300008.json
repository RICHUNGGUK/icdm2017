We investigate the future environmental profile that is deterministic and evolves continuously. Unique to our model is the union of historical data with real-time sensor-based data to update the degradation model and the residual life distribution (RLD) of the component within a Bayesian framework. The performance of our model is evaluated on the basis of degradation signals from both numerical experiments and a case study using real bearing data. The results show that our approach accurately estimates the RLD by incorporating the environmental effects and utilizing the real-time observations.
