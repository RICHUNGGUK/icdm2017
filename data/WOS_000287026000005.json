Knowledge management has already established its own theoretical system, and has caught the attention of both theorists and practitioners alike. Organisational knowledge management study has made tremendous progress while regional knowledge management study is still in the initial stage, further research on regional knowledge management has become urgent and necessary. This study discusses regional knowledge management from the perspective of management theory, analyses the functions of regional knowledge management in terms of planning, organising, controlling and leadership, and presents a framework of regional knowledge management based on management theory.", "paper_title": "Regional knowledge management: the perspective of management theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000287026000005"}
