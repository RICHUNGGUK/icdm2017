Our method procedurally synthesizes the flow fields coming from the incompressible Navier-Stokes solver and the vorticity fields generated by vortex particle method for sub-grid turbulence. We are able to efficiently animate smoke which is highly turbulent and swirling with small scale details. Since this technique does not solve the linear system in high-resolution grids, it can perform fluid simulation more rapidly We can easily estimate the influence of turbulent and swirling effect to the fluid flow", "paper_title": "Procedural Synthesis using Vortex Particle Method for Fluid Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000270778100014"}
