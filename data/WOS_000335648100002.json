After summarising the present basic researches on MIMO radar, this paper first introduced the working principle of EES-MIMO radar and discussed the EES-MIMO radar electromagnetic environment sensory method. It later expound orthogonal waveform design method and analyse their potential technique advantages. This paper present a theory that making the combination of EES-MIMO radar technique and MIMO radar system. It can effectively solve the shortage of anti-jamming technique for existing MIMO radar.", "paper_title": "Research on electromagnetic environmental sensory based on MIMO radar and its key technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000335648100002"}
