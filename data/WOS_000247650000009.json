Most background models were maintained in pixel-based forms, while some approaches began to study block-based representations which are more robust to non-stationary backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a method that combines pixel-based and block-based approaches into a single framework. We show that efficient hierarchical backgrounds can be built by considering that these two approaches are complementary to each other. In addition, a novel descriptor is proposed for block-based background modeling in the coarse level of the hierarchy. Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed hierarchical method can provide better results than existing single-level approaches. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
