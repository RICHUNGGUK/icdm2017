The devices exhibited electroluminescence spectra composed of bluish (lambda(max) = 480 nm) and reddish (lambda(max) = 660 nm) emission bands, which corresponding to monomer and excimer emission originated from Pt-4 dopants. With optimized device structures, a maximum current efficiency of 11.5 cd/A was obtained and remained above 10 cd/A even the brightness was over 6000 cd/m(2). Furthermore, by integrating the fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium(III) as a complementary emitter and an additional 2,2',2 ''-(1,3,5-phenylene)-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole) space layer, the device efficiency was further improved, which exhibited a maximum current efficiency of 20.4 cd/A at the luminance of 100 cd/m(2), and maintained the mild efficiency roll-off that similar to its single Pt-4 doped counterpart.
