The adaptive control term with an improved composite adaptive law can estimate the uncertain parameters and compensate for the modelled dynamical uncertainties. While the robust control term, which is based on a modified nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control method with fast terminal sliding mode (TSM) reaching law, provides fast convergence of errors, and robustifies the design against unmodelled dynamics. Furthermore, the control method eliminates the singular problems in conventional TSM control. On the basis of the finite-time stability theory and the differential inequality principle, it is proved that the resulting closed-loop system is stable and the trajectory tracking error converges to zero in finite time. Finally the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by simulation and experimental study.", "paper_title": "Adaptive nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control for electromechanical actuator", "paper_id": "WOS:000311479200001"}
