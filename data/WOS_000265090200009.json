This system measures the external magnetic fields due to induced currents in the body at a relatively low operation, frequency of 50 kHz. Data is obtained by scanning a 2-D area on the body surface. For each transmitter position, a single sample (averaged) of the field distribution is used for image reconstruction. The Steepest Descent Algorithm is used to solve the inverse problem related to the field profiles. High-resolution images of agar blocks and an anesthetized leech are presented. The system sensitivity is measured as 13.2 mV/(S/m) using saline solution phantoms and as 155 V/S using resistors. The signal to noise ratio in the measurements is calculated to be 35.44 dB. The linearity in the measurements is explored using saline solutions in the biological conductivity range. The nonlinearity is measured to be 3.96% of the full scale. The nonlinearity is found to be 0.12% when resistor phantoms are used. The spatial resolution in the conductivity images is measured as 9.36 mm for a 7.5-mm-diameter cylindrical agar object. The results show that it is possible to distinguish two bars separated 14.4 mm from each other.", "paper_title": "Low-Frequency Magnetic Subsurface Imaging: Reconstructing Conductivity Images of Biological Tissues via Magnetic Measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000265090200009"}
