Mental logic theory states that humans reason through the application of formal reasoning schemas of the kind encountered in formal logic. Mental model theory states that humans reason through the construction, combination, and elimination of models compatible with the given information, and inspection of the models that remain. I propose that there exists a natural compromise between these two competing theories of reasoning.", "paper_title": "Using existential graphs to integrate mental logic theory and mental model theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000239427300003"}
