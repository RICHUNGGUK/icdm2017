Generally, communication overheads cause large performance degradation in multi-core collaboration. Interconnects in large scale are needed to deal with these overheads. Amdahl's and Gustafson's law have been applied to multi-core chips but inter-core communication has not been taken into account. In this paper, we introduce interconnection into Amdahl's and Gustafson's law so that these laws work more precisely in the multi-core era. We further propose an area cost model and analyse our speedup models under area constraints. We find optimized parameters according to our speedup model. These parameters provide useful feedbacks to architects at an initial phase of their designs. We also present a case study to show the necessity of incorporating interconnection into Amdahl's and Gustafson's law.", "paper_title": "Extending Amdahl's law and Gustafson's law by evaluating interconnections on multi-core processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000325022800018"}
