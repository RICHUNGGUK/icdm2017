The data set consisted of a family of synthetic opioid analgesics with the aim to cover both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, as most of these compounds are metabolized by both isoforms. The program MetaSite was used for the site of metabolism predictions, and the results were validated by experimental assessment of the major metabolites formed with recombinant CYP450s. This was made on a selection of 14 compounds in the data set. The prediction rates for MetaSite were 79-100% except for the CYP3A4 homology model, which picked the correct site in half of the cases. Despite differences in orientation of some important amino acids in the active sites, the MetaSite-predicted sites were the same for the different structures, with the exception of the CYP3A4 homology model. Further exploration of interactions with ligands was done by docking substrates/inhibitors in the different structures with the docking program GLUE. To address the challenge in interpreting patterns of enzyme-ligand interactions for the large number of different docking poses, a new computational tool to handle the results from the dockings was developed, in which the output highlights the relative importance of amino acids in CYP450-substrate/inhibitor interactions. The method is based on calculations of the interaction energies for each pose with the surrounding amino acids. For the CYP3A4 structures, this method was compared with consensus principal component analysis (CPCA), a commonly used method for structural comparison to evaluate the usefulness of the new method. The results from the two methods were comparable with each other, and the highlighted amino acids resemble those that were identified to have a different orientation in the compared structures. The new method has clear advantages over CPCA in that it is far simpler to interpret and there is no need for protein alignment. The methodology enables structural comparison but also gives insights on important amino acid substrate/inhibitor interactions and can therefore be very useful when suggesting modifications of new chemical entities to improve their metabolic profiles.", "paper_title": "Exploration of enzyme-ligand interactions in CYP2D6 & 3A4 homology models and crystal structures using a novel computational approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000246776400056"}
