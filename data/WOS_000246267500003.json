It subsumes many other graphical models, including Bayesian networks and Markov networks. This paper presents a multilevel probabilistic meta-model based on FGs - factor metanetwork. The model is a kind of context-enabled networks, and assumes that interoperability between component networks can be also modelled by another FG. It is composed of a set of FGs, which are put on each other in such a way that the probability distributions of single or multiple variables (function nodes) of every previous network (factor graph) depend on probability distributions associated with nodes of the next network. We assume parameters of function nodes in a FG as random variables, and allow all kinds of conditional dependencies between these probability functions. Several cases of two-level factor metanetworks are presented, and an example is presented to show the model's application.", "paper_title": "Factor metanetwork: a multilevel probabilistic meta-model based on factor graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000246267500003"}
