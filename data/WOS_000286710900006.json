Such false-name manipulations have traditionally not been considered in the theory of mechanism design. In this article, we review recent efforts to extend the theory to address this. We first review results for the basic concept of false-name-proofness. Because some of these results are very negative, we also discuss alternative models that allow us to circumvent some of these negative results.", "paper_title": "Using Mechanism Design to Prevent False-Name Manipulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000286710900006"}
