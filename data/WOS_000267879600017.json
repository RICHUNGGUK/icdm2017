However, the suggested relations defined in the metadata of the SCORM CAM are limited. To resolve the problem, new relations were proposed by researchers. Unfortunately, some of the relations are redundant and even inappropriate. In addition, the usability of these relations has never been formally studied. Therefore, in this paper, we summarized and analyzed existing relations, removed duplicated relations, and developed a new relation metadata extension for SCORM CAM. Also. we surveyed 145 students in attempt to understand whether or not the proposed relations can increase their learning effectiveness. The results of the survey showed that learners agreed that the proposed relations are helpful. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
