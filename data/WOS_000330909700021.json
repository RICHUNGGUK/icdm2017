The DSS is aimed at supporting decision-making concerning bicriteria location models and it was specially designed to deal with problems in which the facilities to be located have environmental impacts. We point out three advantages of SABILOC when compared with other DSS for location problems available in the literature. Firstly, an interactive procedure is used allowing the decision-maker to obtain non-dominated solutions for bicriteria location models. Secondly, a multiattribute analysis module allows the decision-maker to proceed with a more detailed analysis of a subset of solutions selected from the first interactive phase. Finally, the embedment of a Geographic Information System into SABILOC makes the system much more useful in real world location problems. In order to better describe and validate the potentialities and functionalities of SABILOC, we present a case study of a real world problem applied to waste transfer station siting.
