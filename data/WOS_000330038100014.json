To deal with these difficulties, we apply the Cayley transform-a Crank-Nicolson-like update scheme-to preserve the constraints and based on it, develop curvilinear search algorithms with lower flops compared to those based on projections and geodesics. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on a variety of test problems. In particular, for the maxcut problem, it exactly solves a decomposition formulation for the SDP relaxation. For polynomial optimization, nearest correlation matrix estimation and extreme eigenvalue problems, the proposed algorithms run very fast and return solutions no worse than those from their state-of-the-art algorithms. For the quadratic assignment problem, a gap 0.842% to the best known solution on the largest problem \"tai256c\" in QAPLIB can be reached in 5 min on a typical laptop.", "paper_title": "A feasible method for optimization with orthogonality constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000330038100014"}
