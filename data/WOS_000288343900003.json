We first compute the minimum classification error (MCE) matrix using genetic algorithm. The MCE matrix is then used during the pre-processing step to map the original dataset into a new space. The mapped data set is then fed to three different classifiers: distance-based, K-Nearest Neighbors, and neural networks classifiers. We measure three different indexes, namely mutual information, Dunn, and SD to evaluate the extent of separation of the data points before and after mapping is performed. The experimental results demonstrate that with the proposed mapping scheme we achieve, on average, 8% higher accuracy in classification of the P2P traffic compare to the previous solutions. Moreover, the genetic-based MCE matrix increases the classification accuracy more than what the basic MCE does.
