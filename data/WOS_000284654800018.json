The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) is one of the most significant efforts currently underway for users of Web-based services. Since users are typically nomadic in pervasive computing services, however, their specific privacy concerns change dynamically with context. This leads us to develop a dynamically adjusting P3P-based policy for a personalized, privacy-aware service as a core element of secure pervasive computing. The purpose of this paper is to propose dynamically and flexibly a pervasive P3P-based negotiation mechanism for a privacy control of those functions. To do so, we consider and implement a multi-agent negotiation mechanism on top of a pervasive P3P system. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
