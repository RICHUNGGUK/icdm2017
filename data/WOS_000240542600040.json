In this paper, Gibichini's model has been extended to depict EDCF mechanism. The proposed model analyses channel throughput under finite loads, which employs two states to accurately depict the backoff scheme. The proposed model also takes packet arrival rate, contention window size, maximum backoff state and AIFS into consideration. Simulation results proved the accuracy of the proposed model and the enhancement of the EDCF scheme.", "paper_title": "Performance computation model for IEEE 802.11e EDCF wireless LANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600040"}
