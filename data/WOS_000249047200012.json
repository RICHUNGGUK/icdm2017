The proposed transformation also provides an analytical modelling of a digital plane segment as a discrete polygon composed of a face, edges and vertices. A dual space representation of lines and planes is used to ensure that the computed curve remains inside the digital curve, and this tool enables to define a. very efficient algorithm. Applied on the digital plane segments resulting from the decomposition of a digital surface, this algorithm provides a set of polygons modelling exactly the digital surface. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
