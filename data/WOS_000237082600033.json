For switched systems, the Average Dwell time (ADT) property defines restricted classes of switching signals which can be used for proving stability. In this paper, we develop optimization -based methods for automatically verifying ADT properties of hybrid systems. This enables us to prove stability of hybrid systems, provided the individual modes of the system are stable. For two special classes of hybrid systems, we show that the resulting optimization problems can indeed be solved efficiently using standard mathematical programming techniques. We also present simulation relation-based proof methods for establishing equivalence of hybrid systems with respect to ADT. The proposed methods are applied to verify ADT properties of a linear hysteresis switch and a nondeterministic thermostat.", "paper_title": "Verifying average dwell time by solving optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237082600033"}
