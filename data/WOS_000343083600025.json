To facilitate this, we have developed a novel web tool called 'TRES' that predicts the likely upstream regulators for a given gene list. This is achieved by integrating transcription factor (TF) binding events from 187 ChIP-sequencing and ChIP-on-chip datasets in murine and human embryonic stem (ES) cells with over 1000 mammalian TF sequence motifs. Using 114 TF perturbation gene sets, as well as 115 co-expression clusters in ES cells, we validate the utility of this approach.", "paper_title": "TRES predicts transcription control in embryonic stem cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000343083600025"}
