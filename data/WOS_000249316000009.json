Their values can be known or unknown before the experiment is carried out. Several criteria are taken into consideration to find optimal conditional designs given some prior information on the factors. In order to determine these optimal conditional designs a class of multiplicative algorithms is provided. Optimal designs are computed for illustrative, but simplistic, examples. Two real life problems in production models and a physical test for predicting morbidity in lung cancer surgery motivate the procedures provided. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
