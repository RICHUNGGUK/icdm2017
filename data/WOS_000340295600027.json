Unlike existing RDH methods for encrypted spatial-domain images, the proposed method aims at encrypting a JPEG bitstream into a properly organized structure, and embedding a secret message into the encrypted bitstream by slightly modifying the JPEG stream. We identify usable bits suitable for data hiding so that the encrypted bitstream carrying secret data can be correctly decoded. The secret message bits are encoded with error correction codes to achieve a perfect data extraction and image recovery. The encryption and embedding are controlled by encryption and embedding keys respectively. If a receiver has both keys, the secret bits can be extracted by analyzing the blocking artifacts of the neighboring blocks, and the original bitstream perfectly recovered. In case the receiver only has the encryption key, he/she can still decode the bitstream to obtain the image with good quality without extracting the hidden data.", "paper_title": "Reversible Data Hiding in Encrypted JPEG Bitstream", "paper_id": "WOS:000340295600027"}
