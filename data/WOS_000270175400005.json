We introduce a rule induction algorithm based on the statistical learning approach that is tailored for this type of problems. The algorithm first monotonizes the dataset (excludes strongly inconsistent objects), using Stochastic Dominance-based Rough Set Approach, and then uses forward stagewise additive modeling framework for generating a monotone rule ensemble. Experimental results indicate that taking into account knowledge about order and monotonicity constraints in the classifier can improve the prediction accuracy.", "paper_title": "Learning Rule Ensembles for Ordinal Classification with Monotonicity Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000270175400005"}
