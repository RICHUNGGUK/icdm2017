This paper presents an analytical model developed using the stochastic reward net (SRN) modeling technique for the TCP flow behavior in WLANs. The purpose of developing an analytical model is the evaluation of stationary TCP flow behavior. In this paper, we focus the attention on the TCP variant called TCP Reno which is implemented by most operating systems. The performance of TCP Reno is investigated through the SRN model. The model captures aspects such as congestion window (cwd) evolution, slow start and congestion avoidance phases, TCP packet transmissions, management of packet losses due to time-out, and due to generation of triple duplicate acknowledgements. The performance metrics such as throughput and delay of the TCP traffic are obtained using the SRN model. On the basis of these performance measures, the existing unfairness between the downstream and upstream flow at the AP in WLANs is also shown. The proposed analytical model is validated via simulation. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
