The algorithm uses k-hop neighbors' information (k is an element of [1, D-G], where D-G is the diameter of graph G). EEDTC has a theoretical approximation factor of at most 9. When k is equal to 1, it has O(n) message complexity and O(inverted right perpendicularn(1-1)/D(G)inverted left perpendicular - 1) time complexity. Due to the low message complexity, EEDTC performs well on energy consumption. The energy-aware ranking technique that is introduced can also balance energy consumption in the network, and hence reduce the probability of network failures caused by energy depletion of back bone nodes.
