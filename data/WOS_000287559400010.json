In this paper we propose that the noises (denoted as N') between the source block and its co-located block in a reference frame can also be modeled as Laplacian random variables. Furthermore, it is possible to exploit the relationship between N and N' to improve the performance of the DVC system. A practical scheme based on theoretical insights, the hash signature saving scheme, is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme saves on average 83.2% of hash signatures, 13.3% of bit-rate, and 3.9% of encoding time.", "paper_title": "Hash signature saving in distributed video coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000287559400010"}
