Since, the WSNs include many low cost and low power sensor nodes and battery replacement in harsh environments is usually impossible, an energy-efficient paradigm for all layers of protocol stack specially routing schemes is necessary to prolong the sensors' lifetime. In this paper, we first specify the sources of energy consumption in a typical sensor node, and then we classify the energy-efficient routings into three main categories such as flat, hierarchical, and geographic mechanisms based on underlying network structure. However, protocols employing simultaneous schemes such as bio-inspired methods, quality of service, multi-path and query-based manners are also discussed. In this taxonomy, special attention has been devoted to the energy-aware QoS-based and bio-inspired routing algorithms which have not yet obtained much consideration in the literature. Moreover, each class covers a variety of the state-of-the-art routing and cross-layer protocols, which motivate potential ideas for future works. Finally, we compare these mechanisms and discuss open research issues.", "paper_title": "Classification of Energy-Efficient Routing Protocols for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000312286000006"}
