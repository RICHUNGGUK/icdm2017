The detailed updating process for status buffer of control center. UGV control input buffer and UAV center location information buffer are presented, receding horizon control (RHC) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are also adopted in this approach. Series experimental results show the feasibility and validity of the proposed time-delay compensation method in multiple UAVs and UGVs heterogeneous network control. The proposed approach is also a promising time-delay compensation strategy in solving other heterogeneous network control systems", "paper_title": "Time-Delay Compensation of Heterogeneous Network Control for Multiple UAVs and UGVs", "paper_id": "WOS:000278649500011"}
