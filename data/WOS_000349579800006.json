First, we show that no probabilistic self-stabilizing gathering algorithm exists in the asynchronous (ASYNC) model or if only global-weak and local-strong multiplicity detection is available. This impossibility result implies that a common assumption about initial configurations (no two robots share a node initially) is a very strong one. On the positive side, we give a probabilistic self-stabilizing algorithm for the gathering and orientation problems in the semi-synchronous (SSYNC) model with global-strong multiplicity detection. With respect to impossibility results, those are the weakest system hypotheses. In addition, as an application of the previous algorithm, we provide a self-stabilizing algorithm for the set formation problem. Our results imply that any static set formation can be realized in a self-stabilizing manner in this model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
