The potential is determined by solving a Dirichlet problem and evaluation of the single layer potential by a fast approximation technique based on Fourier approximation of the kernel function. The latter approximation leads to a generalization of the well-known convolution theorem used in finite difference methods. We address it by a non-uniform FFT approach. Overall, our method scales O(M + N + N log N) for N nodes and M surface triangles. We confirm our approach by several numerical tests. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
