Within this multiplexer model asymptotically exact approximation for buffered workload loss ratio is considered. Based on this, a direct and computationally feasible equivalent capacity estimate is presented in full accordance with the corresponding QoS constraints. This means that an equation involving a function of the large deviation rate function is solved symbolically with respect to the bandwidth requirement estimate. Analytical considerations and numerical investigations illustrate the usefulness of the novel estimate. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
