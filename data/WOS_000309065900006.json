It is assumed that the nominal linear systems are stable, minimum phase and relative degree one systems. The proposed structure is an integration of a modified Smith predictor and an ANN-based disturbance reduction scheme. Unlike other disturbance rejection methods, the proposed approach does not require information about unknown load disturbance frequencies. An ANN is used to approximate the unknown load disturbances and to enhance the robustness of the proposed disturbance reduction scheme against modelling errors in the estimated time delay and the process model. Connective weights of the ANN are trained on-line using a back-propagation algorithm until uncertainties resulting from unknown load disturbances and modelling errors are minimized. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the presented disturbance reduction scheme for controlling linear delay systems subjected to step or periodic unknown load disturbances.", "paper_title": "Modified Smith predictor with a robust disturbance reduction scheme for linear systems with small time delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000309065900006"}
