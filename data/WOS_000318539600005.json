The obtained aggregators implement probability distributions for specification of generator functions; as it was proven in the paper, such implementation is always possible. In the paper, the relation between neutral element of the probabilistic uninorm and parameters of the underlying probability distribution is demonstrated, and a method for specification of the probabilistic uninorm, and thusof the probability distribution using t-norm and t-conormis constructed. In addition, the obtained probabilistic uninorm and probabilistic absorbing norm or nullnorm are briefly considered as algebraic operations on the open unit interval. In is demonstrated, that, in general, the obtained algebra is nondistributive and depends on the distributions, which are used for generating probabilistic uninorm and absorbing norm. The obtained results bridge several gaps between fuzzy and probabilistic logics and provide a basis both for theoretical studies in the field and for practical techniques of digital/analog schemes synthesis and analysis.", "paper_title": "Probability-Generated Aggregators", "paper_id": "WOS:000318539600005"}
