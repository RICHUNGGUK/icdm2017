In this paper we study the Web news content extraction problem and propose an automated extraction algorithm for it. Our method is a hybrid one taking the advantage of both sequence matching and tree matching techniques. We propose TSReC, a variant of tag sequence representation suitable for both sequence matching and tree matching, along with an associated algorithm for automated Web news content extraction. By implementing a prototype system for Web news content extraction, the empirical evaluation is conducted and the result shows that our method is highly effective and efficient.", "paper_title": "Hybrid method for automated news content extraction from the web", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624200031"}
