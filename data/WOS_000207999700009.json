It is almost impossible for people to focus the key point. As a solution, we present a novel method to detect the hot topics mainly focused on the Internet forum. Our solution considers two important characteristics of Internet forum: the network structures and the user behavior patterns. First, we construct a network of the users' \"replied to\" relationships in a given Internet forum. Second, behavior patterns for all users are computed. Finally, we combine the results from first two steps to determine which topics are hot topics. Results of our empirical experiments show that our approach can identify hot topics easily and effectively.", "paper_title": "Network Structures and User Behavior Analysis Based Hot Topic Detection for Internet Forum", "paper_id": "WOS:000207999700009"}
