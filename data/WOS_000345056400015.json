As an alternative, we suggest a natural diversification strategy for the B-spline basis {B-i}(i). It is grounded on employing a separate copy B-i,B-gamma of B-i for every connected component gamma of its support supp B-i boolean AND Omega Q. In the bivariate case, which is important for applications, this process enhances the spline space to a crucial extent. Concretely, we prove that the error in uniform tensor product spline approximation of a function f : R-2 superset of Omega -> R can be bounded in terms of the pure partial derivatives of f, where the constant depends neither on the shape of Omega nor on the knot grid. An example shows that a similar result cannot hold true for higher dimensions, even if the domain is convex and has a smooth boundary. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
