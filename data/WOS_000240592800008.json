To analyze the hash function, we have extended existing approaches and used recent results in cryptanalysis. While RIPEMD and RIPEMD-128 reduced to 3 rounds are vulnerable to the attack, it is not feasible for RIPEMD-160. Furthermore, we present an analytical attack on a round-reduced variant of the RIPEMD-160 hash function. To the best of our knowledge this is the first article that investigates the impact of recent advances in cryptanalysis of hash functions on RIPEMD-160.", "paper_title": "On the collision resistance of RIPEMD-160", "paper_id": "WOS:000240592800008"}
