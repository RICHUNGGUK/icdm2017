It has proved useful in many areas of mathematics such as fuzzy set theory, optimization, idempotent analysis, large deviation theory, or extreme value theory. Existence of Radon-Nikodym derivatives, which turns out to be crucial in all these applications, was proved by Sugeno and Murofushi. Here we show a converse statement to this idempotent version of the Radon-Nikodym theorem, i.e. we characterize the sigma-maxitive measures that have the Radon-Nikodym property.
