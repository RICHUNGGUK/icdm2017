Then two particular models and methods, implementations of the general principle, are presented. The first of these two models presents an automata based version of the Bird and Baker approach with lower space complexity than the original algorithm. The second introduces a new model for two-dimensional approximate pattern matching using the two-dimensional Hamming distance.", "paper_title": "On two-dimensional pattern matching by finite automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000236480300028"}
