The effects of the sputtering power on the quality of the ZnO films have been investigated. The results show that thin films were polycrystalline, with wurtzite structure and a strong preferred c-axis orientation (002). The root-mean-square (rms) surface roughness of the ZnO thin films is 22.1 nm. The ZnO thin films fabricated by sputtering with 70 W sputtering power have a high mobility of 34.33 cm(2)/V center dot s. The ZnO films are shown to be compatible with flexible display on plastic substrates.", "paper_title": "Fabrication and characteristics of ZnO thin films deposited by RF sputtering on plastic substrates for flexible display", "paper_id": "WOS:000304120300020"}
