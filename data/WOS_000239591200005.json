The purpose of our research is to process users' emotion and attention in real-time, with the goal of designing systems that may recognize a user's affective response to a particular visually presented stimulus in the presence of other stimuli, and respond accordingly. In this paper, we introduce the AutoSelect system that automatically detects a user's preference based on eye movement data and physiological signals in a two-alternative forced choice task. In an exploratory study involving the selection of neckties, the system could correctly classify subjects' choice of in 81%. In this instance of AutoSelect, the gaze 'cascade effect' played a dominant role, whereas pupil size could not be shown as a reliable predictor of preference.", "paper_title": "AutoSelect: What you want is what you get: Real-time processing of visual attention and affect", "paper_id": "WOS:000239591200005"}
