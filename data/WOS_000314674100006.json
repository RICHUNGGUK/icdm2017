We propose a 2.5D AAM that combines a 3D metric Point Distribution Model (PDM) and a 2D appearance model whose control points are defined by a full perspective projection of the PDM. The advantage is that, assuming a calibrated camera, 3D metric shapes can be retrieved from single view images. Two model fitting algorithms and their computational efficient approximations are proposed: the Simultaneous Forwards Additive (SFA) and the Normalization Forwards Additive (NFA), both based on the Lucas-Kanade framework. The SFA algorithm searches for shape and appearance parameters simultaneously whereas the NFA projects out the appearance from the error image and searches only for the shape parameters. SFA is therefore more accurate. Robust solutions for the SFA and NFA are also proposed in order to take into account the self-occlusion or partial occlusion of the face. Several performance evaluations for the SFA, NFA and theirs efficient approximations were performed. The experiments include evaluating the frequency of converge, the fitting performance in unseen data and the tracking performance in the FGNET Talking Face sequence. All results show that the 2.5D AAM can outperform both the 2D + 3D combined models and the 2D standard methods. The robust extensions to occlusion were tested on a synthetic sequence showing that the model can deal efficiently with large head rotation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
