An important consideration in HSM is to limit cutting force variations, and one way to do so is to reduce cutter-workpiece engagement (CWE) variations. CWE is measured as the area of the tool instantaneously engaged with the part. Estimating CWE as a function of the tool path requires repeated, expensive computations. This paper develops algorithms for a discretized computational model to make CWE computations for arbitrary shaped parts.
