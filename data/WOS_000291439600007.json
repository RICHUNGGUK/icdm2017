The scalability of this switching architecture, a direct outcome of the deployment of pipeline forwarding, results-in addition to much lower cost-in the need for a smaller amount of components, and, consequently, lower power dissipation, which is key to a \"greening\" of the Internet. Although an all-optical architecture is demonstrated, we reached the conclusion that, given the current state of the art, a hybrid electro-optical architecture is the \"best-of-breed\" switch solution.", "paper_title": "Scalable Fractional Lambda Switching: A Testbed", "paper_id": "WOS:000291439600007"}
