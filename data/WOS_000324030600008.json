However, even though the global convergence of PS has been proved, it does not perform well on more complex and higher dimension problems nowadays. In order to improve the efficiency of PS and obtain a more powerful algorithm for global optimization, a new algorithm named Free Pattern Search (FPS) based on PS and Free Search (FS) is proposed in this paper. FPS inherits the global search from FS and the local search from PS. Two operators have been designed for accelerating the convergence speed and keeping the diversity of population. The acceleration operator inspired by FS uses a self-regular management to classify the population into two groups and accelerates all individuals in the first group, while the throw operator is designed to avoid the reduplicative search of population and keep the diversity. In order to verify the performance of FPS, two famous benchmark instances are conducted for the comparisons between FPS with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) variants and Differential Evolution (DE) variants. The results show that FPS obtains better solutions and achieves the higher convergence speed than other algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
