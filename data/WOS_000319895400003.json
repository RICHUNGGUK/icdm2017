This paper focuses on the latency of data aggregation. Previously, it has been proved that the problem of minimizing the latency of data aggregation is NP-hard [1]. Many approximate algorithms have been proposed to address this issue. Using maximum independent set and first-fit algorithms, in this study we design a scheduling algorithm, Peony-tree-based Data Aggregation (PDA), which has a latency bound of 15R + Delta - 15, where R is the network radius (measured in hops) and Delta is the maximum node degree. We theoretically analyze the performance of PDA based on different network models, and further evaluate it through extensive simulations. Both the analytical and simulation results demonstrate the advantages of PDA over the state-of-art algorithm in [2], which has a latency bound of 23R + Delta - 18. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
