Existing homotopy approaches for circuits are, however, often ineffective for large mixed-signal applications. In this paper, we describe a robust homotopy technique that is effective for solving large metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)-based mixed-signal circuits. We demonstrate how certain common circuit structures involving turning-point nesting can lead to extreme inefficiency, or failure, of conventional probability-one homotopy methods. We also find that such situations can lead to numerical ill-conditioning and homotopy paths that fold back upon themselves, leading to algorithm failure. Our new homotopy model for MOS devices, dubbed Arc-tangent Schichman-Hodges (ATANSH), features decoupled continuation parameters that are instrumental in avoiding these problems. ATANSH-based homotopy methods in production use have led to the routine solution of large previously hard-to-solve industrial circuits, several examples of which are presented.", "paper_title": "Delivering global DC convergence for large mixed-signal circuits via homotopy/continuation methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000234307000007"}
