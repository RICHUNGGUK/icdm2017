In these communities the infrastructure is established by the participants and is managed as a common resource. Many crowdsourcing experiences have flourished in community networks. This paper discusses the case of guifi.net, a success case of a community network daily used by thousands of participants, focusing on its principles and the crowdsourcing processes and tools developed within the community, and the role they play in the ecosystem that is guifi.net; the current status of its implementation; its measurable local impact; and the lessons learned in more than a decade.
