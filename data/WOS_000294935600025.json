By introducing latent variables {Z(ij)} and {Y(ij)} (to be defined later), he formulated the constrained parameter problem into a missing data problem. However, the derived DA algorithm does not work because he actually assumed that the {Y(ij)} are known. Furthermore, although the final results from the derived EM algorithm are correct, his findings are based on the assumption that the {Y(ij)} are observable. This note provides a correct DA algorithm. In addition, we obtained the same E-step and M-step under the assumption that the (Y(ij)) are unobservable. A real example is used for illustration. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
