We also present numerical examples in three spatial dimensions. The first example demonstrates the convergence of the method in the second example we consider an engineering application.", "paper_title": "Convergence analysis of finite element approximations of the Joule heating problem in three spatial dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000284594700006"}
