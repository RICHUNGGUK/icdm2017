Gaze-based interaction in virtual environments creates the feeling of controlling objects with the mind, arguably translating into a more intense immersion sensation. Additionally, it is also free of some of the most cumbersome aspects of interacting in virtual worlds. By incorporating a real-time physics engine, the sensation of moving something real is further accentuated. We also describe various simple yet effective techniques that allow eyetracking devices to enhance the three-dimensional visualization capabilities of current displays. Some of these techniques have the additional advantage of freeing the mouse from most navigation tasks. This work focuses on the study of existing techniques, a detailed description of the implemented interface and the evaluation (both objective and subjective) of the interface. Given that appropriate filtering of the data from the eye tracker used is a key aspect for the correct functioning of the interface, we will also discuss that aspect in depth.", "paper_title": "Gaze-based Interaction for Virtual Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000264754600004"}
