This structure utilizes a waveguide filled by a longitudinally inhomogeneous dielectric. The electric permittivity function of the structure is expanded in it truncated Fourier series first. Then, the optimum values of the coefficients of the series are obtained through an optimization approach. The usefulness of the proposed structure is verified using it comprehensive example.
