Design/methodology/approach - It is practical to use the synergetic self-organization theory to calculate the effects that the force of synergetic system of controlling tactics to financial information security makes on network financial system, and it is also practical to construct the synergetic model of controlling tactics to network financial information security on the basis of it. Findings - Through applying synergetic analysis to controlling tactical system of network financial information security, it can be found out that controlling tactical system is an open system which changes from disorder to order and which keeps away from a balancing state. As an opening system, controlling tactics are interacting with outside from now and then. Research limitations/implications - Network financial information security takes on dynamics, relativity, integrity and complexity. Accessibility of data is the main limitations which model will be applied. Practical implications - From the view of network financial information security, constructing controlling tactical and synergetic model of information security are explained. Originality/value - Network finance is orientated as a special social and economic system. The author does analysis on the network financial system, and expounds order parameters and model of network financial system.", "paper_title": "The synergetic model of the controlling tactics to network financial information security", "paper_id": "WOS:000261315700024"}
