Our deep opacity maps method extends the concept of opacity shadow maps by using a depth map to obtain a per pixel distribution of opacity layers. This approach eliminates the layering artifacts of opacity shadow maps and requires far fewer layers to achieve high quality shadow computation. Furthermore, it is faster than the density clustering technique, and produces less noise with comparable shadow quality. We provide qualitative comparisons to these previous methods and give performance results. Our algorithm is easy to implement, faster, and more memory efficient, enabling us to generate high quality hair shadows in real-time using graphics hardware on a standard PC.", "paper_title": "Deep opacity maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000255285500057"}
