This procedure considers the network in its totality and derives general active compensation conditions for a generic active-RC network employing 2 or 3 operational amplifiers. Furthermore, the remaining degrees of freedom of the circuits are used to optimize the performance of the actively compensated circuits to further extend its operating frequency range. Simulation and experimental results are also reported.", "paper_title": "Design of optimum actively compensated networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000316016100008"}
