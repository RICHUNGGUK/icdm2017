The noisy biometric measurement makes traditional identity based cryptosystems unusable. Also the extraction of key from biometric information is difficult. In this paper, we propose an efficient biometric identity based signature scheme (Bio-IBS) that makes use of fuzzy extractor to generate the key from a biometric data of user. The component fuzzy extraction is based on error correction code. We also prove that the security of suggested scheme is reduced to computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption instead of other strong assumptions. Meanwhile, the comparison with existing schemes shows that efficiency of the system is enhanced.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Biometric Identity Based Signature Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000326457100015"}
