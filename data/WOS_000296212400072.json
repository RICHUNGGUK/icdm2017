We first study the stability analysis problem for a single neural network and present a sufficient condition guaranteeing the mean square asymptotic stability. Then based on the Lyapunov functional method and the Kronecker product technique, the chaos synchronization problem of an array of coupled networks is considered. Both the stability and the synchronization conditions are delay-dependent, which are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The effectiveness of the developed methods is shown by simulation examples. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
