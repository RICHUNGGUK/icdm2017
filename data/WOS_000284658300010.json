As dietary differences generally only lead to subtle metabolic changes, measuring diet associated metabolic phenotypes is a challenge, and also an opportunity to develop and test new chemometric strategies that can highlight metabolic information in relation to different dietary habits. While multivariate statistical techniques have long been used to analyse dietary data from diet records and questionnaires, to date no attempt has been made to link dietary patterns with metabolic profiles. Using a three-step strategy, it was possible to merge H-1 NMR plasma metabolic profile data with specific dietary patterns as assessed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). Five dietary patterns (energy intake, plant versus animal based diet, \"traditional diet\" versus sugar-rich diet, \"traditional\" versus \"modern\" diets, and consumption of skim versus whole dairy products) were found by applying PCA to the food frequency questionnaire data which explained 50% of the variation. Metabolic phenotypes associated with these dietary patterns were obtained by PLS-DA and were mainly based on differences in lipids and amino acid profiles in plasma. This new approach to assess relationships between dietary intake and metabolic profiling data will allow greater steps to be made in merging nutritional epidemiology with metabonomics.
