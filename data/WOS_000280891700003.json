The numerical concentration of the transported chemicals are proved to remain nonnegative and stable. Then, we run a realistic test case in which some radioactive iodine I-129 particles are released from a leak in an underground nuclear waste disposal site. The question of whether the radionuclide invades the underground and reach the ground surface is investigated. Because of the 3D nature of the problem, a particular emphasis is made on the control of CPU time.
