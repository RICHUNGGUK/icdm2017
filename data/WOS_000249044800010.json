The main focus has been on modeling packet delay analytically. To derive the packet delay, an important part of the analysis will also focus on the cycle time. It is assumed that the traffic load is symmetric, that packet arrivals are Poisson distributed, and that packets have fixed size. Simulations were performed to prove the accuracy of the analytical model. Some extensions and limitations of the model are treated, including asymmetric traffic load, packet size distribution, self-similar traffic, and differentiated services.
