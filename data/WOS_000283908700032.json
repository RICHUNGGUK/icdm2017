Main issue in 802.11e protocol is internal sorting of packets, no priority mechanism within the queues and often lower priority traffic get more medium than high priority traffic. In this paper, the mathematical model of relevance scheme is enhanced so that it can consider the network control in real scenario by considering the impact of malicious node in network. Problems of 802.11e protocol can be resolved by making virtual queue at application level. We analyze the comparison of simple virtual queue with the over all impact of virtual queue and mathematical model. Similarly we compare the mathematical model with over all impact of virtual queue and modified mathematical model using NS-2 simulator.", "paper_title": "Information Sharing in Vehicular AdHoc Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000283908700032"}
