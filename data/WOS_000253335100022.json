As an application example, we apply the waveform design and diversity to automatic target recognition (ATR) in RSN and propose maximum-likehood (ML)-ATR algorithms for non-fluctuating target as well as fluctuating target. Simulation results show that our waveform diversity-based ML-ATR algorithm performs much better than single-waveform ML-ATR algorithm for non-fluctuating targets or fluctuating targets. Conclusions are drawn based on our analysis and simulations. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
