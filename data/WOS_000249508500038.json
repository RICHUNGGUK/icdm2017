Traditional balancing methods are generally based on the information from a unidirectional sensor. In fact, the motion of a rotor system is a complex spatial motion, which cannot be objectively and reliably described with just a unidirectional sensor in one bearing section. In order to give an accurate description of rotor vibration responses, multi-sensor fusion instead of a single sensor should be used with the purpose of more comprehensive utilization of information. Based on this theory, the paper presents a new balancing method for rotor systems named the holo-balancing method, which successfully applies the holospectral principle in traditional balancing methods of flexible rotor systems. At the same time, genetic algorithm (GA) optimization and computer simulation are used to simplify balancing process. The new method decreases test number, increases precision and efficiency of field balancing. The principle and detailed procedures of the new method are explained in this paper, and the effectiveness of the new method was validated by field balancing of several 300 MW turbo-generator units.
