The new method achieves segmentation directly from received signal, whereas conventional techniques require preprocessing by pulse compression and corrections afterwards. The advantage of the new method is the simplicity as well as the high performance. Numerical examples demonstrate that the new method indeed gives better segmentation results in image reconstruction. The high performance is valid even in the case contaminated by noise if the noise level is not too high and proper noise reduction technique is applied.", "paper_title": "A new segmentation method in SAR image reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000244974000001"}
