The efficient distribution of images in wireless networks is based on many parameters like the quality of service requirement, available bandwidth, restricted memory and diverse user profiles. We consider digital images as data objects accessed in a hierarchical mobile ad-hoc peer-to-peer network, referred as M-P2P. Our objective is to optimize the number of replicas of images in such a network architecture based on the resource limitations of the requesting peers equipped with miniature mobile devices as well as of wireless constraints in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET). While replicating images, fragments of different resolution and their residues are used to optimize the traffic in the network and to decrease the search turnaround time. We call this replication algorithm as Ada-Rep. Performance evaluation is done by simulating Ada-Rep, base replication and uniform replication methods to evaluate parameters such as response time, failure rate, memory usage, traffic etc. Our results prove the efficiency and better performance of Ada-Rep.
