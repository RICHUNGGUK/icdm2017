Like any other communication network, PLC networks need to be managed to ensure efficient use Of resources and operations. Currently, major PLC chip vendors are trying to provide network management solutions based on the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) by developing their own management systems, but they cannot manage heterogeneous PLC networks comprised of PLC devices from various PLC chip vendors. In this paper, we provide our experience of developing and testing an integrated management system fora heterogeneous PLC network based on SNMP. We present Our approach for integrated management by defining the common PLC Management information base (MIB) and an integrated PI-C proxy agent for providing interoperability to legacy PLC devices which do not support the common PLC MIB. We also present the development of in integrated PLC network management system and its test in heterogeneous PLC networks deployed in South Korea. The contribution of our work is to provide a guideline for developing and testing integrated NMSs for any heterogeneous networks including PLC networks.
