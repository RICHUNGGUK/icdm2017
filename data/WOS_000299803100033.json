These problems arise when modelling the thin lubricating film between contacts which are under sufficiently high pressure that the elastic deformation of the contacting elements cannot be neglected. The governing equations are highly non-linear and include a second order partial differential equation that is derived via the thin-film approximation. Furthermore, the problem features a free boundary, which models where cavitation occurs, and this is automatically captured as part of the solution process. The need for spatial adaptivity stems from the highly variable length scales that are present in typical solutions. Results are presented which demonstrate both the effectiveness and the limitations of the proposed adaptive algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
