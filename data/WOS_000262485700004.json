Our approach starts by estimating the principal curvatures and mesh saliency value for each vertex. Then, we calculate the uniform principal curvature of each vertex based on the weighted average of local principal curvatures. After that, we use the weighted bi-quadratic B,zier surface to fit the neighborhood of each vertex using the least-square method and obtain the new vertex position by adjusting the parameters of the fitting surface. Experiments show that our smoothing method preserves the geometric feature of the original mesh model efficiently. Our approach also prevents the volume shrinkage of the input mesh and obtains smooth boundaries for non-closed mesh models.", "paper_title": "A new feature-preserving mesh-smoothing algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000262485700004"}
