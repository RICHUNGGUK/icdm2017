Most existing anomaly intrusion detection techniques treat all types of attacks as equally important without any differentiation of the risk they pose to the information system. Although detection of all intrusions is important, certain types of attacks are more harmful than others and their detection is critical to protection of the system. This paper proposes a new one-class classification method with differentiated anomalies to enhance intrusion detection performance for harmful attacks. We also propose new extracted features for host-based intrusion detection based on three viewpoints of system activity such as dimension, structure, and contents. Experiments with simulated dataset and the DARPA 1998 BSM dataset show that our differentiated intrusion detection method performs better than existing techniques in detecting specific type of attacks. The proposed method would benefit even other applications in anomaly detection area beyond intrusion detection. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
