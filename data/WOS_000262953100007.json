In total more than 200 experimental data have been compiled. The water-to-micellar CTAB partition coefficients and MEKC retention factor data from three separate studies have been combined into a single database and correlated with the Abraham model. The derived correlation described the 200 experimental values to within a standard deviation of 0.175 log units. Also, the previously derived Abraham model correlation for water-to-micellar Sodium Dodecylsulfate (SDS) was updated to include MEKC retention factor data from the five recent experimental studies. The new repression correlation for SDS is based on 706 experimental values. Principal component analysis showed that water-to-micellar surfactant partition systems are good models for non-polar and polar narcotic toxicities of organic compounds toward fish, water fleas, and other aquatic organisms.", "paper_title": "Linear Free Energy Relationship Correlation of The Distribution of Solutes Between Water And Cetytrimethylammonium Bromide (CTAB) Micelles", "paper_id": "WOS:000262953100007"}
