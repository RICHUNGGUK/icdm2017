The resulting thermodynamic data gives useful information about the amino acids with the greatest association for brassinolide and the stabilities of such complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) optimizations were further carried out to test the performance of semiempirical calculations. Additional calculations with a more accurate DFT method were performed to explore the formation of this type of molecular complexes. The semiempirical geometries and stability order of these complexes are in good agreement with the DFT calculations. Each group of amino acids possesses a preferential zone of interaction with brassinolide, forming the polar-charged amino acids the most stable complexes. This study could contribute to future investigations of the interaction of brassinosteroids with the receptor protein in plants. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
