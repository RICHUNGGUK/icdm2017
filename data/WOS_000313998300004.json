Computer-aided Diagnosis (CADx) technology may enhance the performance of radiologists by assisting them in classifying patterns into benign and malignant categories. Although Neural Networks (NN) such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) have drawbacks, namely long training times, a considerable number of CADx systems employ NN-based classifiers. The reason being that they provide high accuracy when they are appropriately trained. In this paper, we introduce three novel learning rules called Opposite Weight Back Propagation per Pattern (OWBPP), Opposite Weight Back Propagation per Epoch (OWBPE), and Opposite Weight Back Propagation per Pattern in Initialization (OWBPI) to accelerate the training procedure of an MLP classifier. We then develop CADx systems for the diagnosis of breast masses employing the traditional Back Propagation (BP), OWBPP, OWBPE and OWBPI algorithms on MLP classifiers. We quantitatively analyze the accuracy and convergence rate of each system. The results suggest that the convergence rate of the proposed OWBPE algorithm is more than 4 times faster than that of the traditional BP. Moreover, the CADx systems which use OWBPE classifier on average yield an area under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), i.e. Az, of 0.928, a False Negative Rate (FNR) of 9.9% and a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 11.94%.
