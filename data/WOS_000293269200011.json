They may cause serious infections in humans and animals, and also cause problems in hydraulic machinery. In this paper we model the growth of a biofilm established on a medical implant. We assume that the biofilm's growth is given by a logistic reaction term with the growth rate being a random variable with a given distribution. This way we take into account the variability in the bacterial populations, and the measurement and experimental errors. The diffusion coefficient of the microbes is also taken to be random. A stochastic spectral representation of the parameters and the unknown stochastic process is used, together with the polynomial chaos method, to obtain a system of partial differential equations, which is integrated numerically to obtain the evolution of the mean and higher-order moments with respect to time. Some examples are presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Biofilm growth on medical implants with randomness", "paper_id": "WOS:000293269200011"}
