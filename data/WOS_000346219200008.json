An implementation of the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient algorithm on N Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices solves the large linear system of equations arising from the FE discretization. The system employs a large number of customized fixed-point computing units with a high-throughput memory architecture. An implementation of this scalable architecture on four Altera EP3SE110 FPGA devices yields a peak performance of 604 Giga Operations per second. This enables haptic simulation of a 3-dimensional deformable object of 21000 elements at an update rate of 400Hz.", "paper_title": "A Multiple-FPGA Parallel Computing Architecture for Real-Time Simulation of Soft-Object Deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000346219200008"}
