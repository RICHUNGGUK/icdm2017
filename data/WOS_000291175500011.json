Thus, equipment costs may exceed the target value and system operation/deployment may demand tasks which collide with environmental regulations or simply do not pay off if they are compared to the gained advantage. Different solutions have been deployed for animal localization which may require satellite transmitters or employ solar energy as a workaround for power supply constraints. However, the former can turn out to be expensive and the latter useless in latitudes with limited sunlight. We analyze the performance of a localization system which aims to overcome the aforementioned issues in herding environments. Different kinds of nodes along with flexible duty cycles leverage the system adaptiveness, meeting users' needs and complying with different environmental policies. Our analyses are based on real tests and combinations of such modeling with simulations. As a consequence of the system flexibility, the analyzed configurations exhibit wide ranges for magnitudes such as localization delay and localization events. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
