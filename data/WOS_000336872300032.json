Therefore, assessing and managing online complain influence has become a new problem for enterprise to listen to and manage online group complaints. This paper analyzed the complaint information feature of consumer group on online social network, from three-dimensional perspective of complaint text's quality, transmission timeliness and user interaction degree. We built the influence measure model of online complaint theme based on entropy weight model by monitoring and analyzing real-time the static and dynamic properties of complaint information, explored the measure method of complaint theme influence, employed empirical method to verify the validity and provided scientific decision-making tools and methods for enterprise listening to and managing online group complains.
