Nevertheless family REC is not closed under complementation and this implies that it is intrinsically non-deterministic. We consider different notions of unambiguity and determinism and the corresponding REC subclasses: they define a hierarchy inside REC. We show that some definitions of unarnbiguity are equivalent to particular notions of determinism and therefore the corresponding classes have linear parsing algorithms and are closed under complementation.", "paper_title": "EXPLORING INSIDE TILING RECOGNIZABLE PICTURE LANGUAGES TO FIND DETERMINISTIC SUBCLASSES", "paper_id": "WOS:000297580200003"}
