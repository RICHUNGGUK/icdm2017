Initially, \"6n\" patterns are introduced to completely detect and diagnose both static and crosstalk faults, where \"n\" is the total number of interconnect nets. Then, more economic \"4n+1\" patterns are described to test the crosstalk faults for the interconnect nets separated within a certain distance.", "paper_title": "Efficient interconnect test patterns for crosstalk and static faults", "paper_id": "WOS:000241567000028"}
