Despite a wide spectrum of research development efforts, how to facilitate knowledge discovery from an open environment and provide corresponding services remains an open challenge. In this special issue, we aim to foster the dissemination of high-quality research in methods, theories and techniques concerning the knowledge discovery from the next generation social media. Original and research articles include all aspects of theoretical studies, practical applications and experimental prototypes.", "paper_title": "Mining Social Media for Knowledge Discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000361469800001"}
