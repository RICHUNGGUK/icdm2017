The classical nonlinear filters used for image denoising, such as median filter, are based on a local analysis of the pixels within a moving window. Recently, the research of image denoising has been focused on the wavelet domain. Compared to the classical nonlinear filters, it is based on a global multiscale analysis of images. Apparently, the wavelet transform can be embedded in a moving window. Thus, a moving window-based local multiscale analysis is obtained. In this paper, based on the Haar wavelet, a class of nonorthogonal multichannel filter bank with its corresponding wavelet shrinkage called Lee shrinkage is derived. As a special case of this filter bank, the double Haar wavelet transform is introduced. Examples show that it is suitable for a moving window-based local multiscale analysis used for image denoising, edge detection, and edge enhancement.", "paper_title": "Moving window-based double Haar wavelet transform for image processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000239774800028"}
