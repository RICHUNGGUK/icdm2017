In MMR networks, two bandwidth scheduling zones, Access and Relay zones, are specified for direct access and forwarding sessions, respectively. One of the novelties in the proposed BNS is that bandwidth negotiation is conducted between the Access and Relay zones. In other words, a higher-priority traffic class in a high-utilization zone may receive extra bandwidth from low-utilization zone when its delay constraint or bandwidth requirement cannot be satisfied. In addition, when the assigned bandwidth to non-real-time polling service (nrtPS) has exceeded its minimum requirement, the proposed BNS can avoid possible starvations for best effort (BE) traffic by receiving extra bandwidth from nrtPS. Through multidimensional Markov formulation, we evaluate the performance of the BNS and compare it with a fixed-boundary scheme. The analytical results have shown that the proposed BNS can increase delay-constraint satisfactions for real-time polling service and decrease the packet loss rate for BE. Furthermore, the overall system throughput can be increased significantly because of an improvement on bandwidth utilization.
