However, this generally presents a difficult combinatorial optimization problem for engineers. Swarm intelligence, an approach to decision making that integrates collective social behavior models such as the bee algorithm (BA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), is being increasingly used to resolve various complex optimization problems. In order to integrate BA global search ability with the local search advantages of PSO, this study proposes a new optimization hybrid swarm algorithm-the particle bee algorithm (PBA) which imitates the intelligent swarming behavior of honeybees and birds. This study also proposes a neighborhood-windows technique for improving searching efficiency as well as a self-parameter-updating technique for preventing trapping into a local optimum in high-dimensional problems. This study compares PBA performance against BA and PSO performance in practical FL problem. Results show PBA performance is comparable to those of BA and PSO and can be efficiently employed to solve practical FL problem with high dimensionality.", "paper_title": "A hybrid AI-based particle bee algorithm for facility layout optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000302328100005"}
