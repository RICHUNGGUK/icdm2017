The EA is designed to explore the solution space and to select promising configurations of hubs (the location part of the problem). Hub configurations produced by the EA are further passed to the BnB search, which works with fixed hubs and allocates the non-hub nodes to located hubs (the allocation part of the problem). The BnB method is implemented using parallelization techniques, which results in short running times. The proposed hybrid algorithm, named EA-BnB, has been tested on the standard Australia Post (AP) hub data sets with up to 300 nodes. The results demonstrate the superiority of our hybrid approach over existing heuristic approaches from the existing literature. The EA-BnB method has reached all the known optimal solutions for AP hub data set and found new, significantly better, solutions on three AP instances with 100 and 200 nodes. Furthermore, the extreme efficiency of the implementation of this hybrid algorithm resulted in short running times, even for the largest AP test instances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
