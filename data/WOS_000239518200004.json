The theory of institutions helps in capturing the precise relationships between the logics that are obtained, and, furthermore, helps in analyzing some of the key design decisions and opens the way to make the approach more useful and, at the same time, more abstract.", "paper_title": "Quantum institutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000239518200004"}
