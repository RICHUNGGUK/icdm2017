Because of the high dynamicity of available bandwidth and network resources in CRSNs, it is more effective to use the stochastic guarantees. In this paper, the stochastic backlog and delay bounds of generic rate-based additive increase and multiplicative decrease (AIMD) congestion control scheme are modeled based on stochastic network calculus (SNC). Particularly, the probabilistic bounds are modeled through moment generating function (MGF)-based SNC with regard to the sending rate distribution of CR source sensors. The proposed stochastic bounds are verified through NS2-based simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
