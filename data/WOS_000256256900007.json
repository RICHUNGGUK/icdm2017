This global problem consists in finding the number of optical fibers between each pair of optical nodes, finding the configuration of each node with respect to transponders, finding the virtual topology (i.e., the set of lightpaths), routing the lightpaths, grooming the traffic (i.e, grouping the connections and routing them over the lightpaths) and, finally, assigning wavelengths to the lightpaths. Instead of partitioning the problem into subproblems and solving them successively, we propose a mathematical programming model that addresses it as a whole. Numerical results are presented and analyzed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
