To mitigate this problem, mobile sinks are proposed. They implicitly provide load-balanced data delivery and achieve uniform-energy consumption across the network. On the other hand, advertising the position of the mobile sink to the network introduces an overhead in terms of energy consumption and packet delays. In this paper, we propose Ring Routing, a novel, distributed, energy-efficient mobile sink routing protocol, suitable for time-sensitive applications, which aims to minimize this overhead while preserving the advantages of mobile sinks. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of Ring Routing via extensive simulations.", "paper_title": "Ring Routing: An Energy-Efficient Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks with a Mobile Sink", "paper_id": "WOS:000359264300014"}
