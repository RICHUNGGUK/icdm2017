A typical method to deal with the dynamics of the system is to decide the mapping decision at runtime, based on the local information of the system status. It is very challenging to guarantee any real-time performance of a certain application in such a dynamically varying system. To solve this problem, we propose a hybrid specification of dataflow and FSM models to specify the dynamic behavior of a system distinguishing inter- and intra-application dynamism. At the top level, each application is specified by a dataflow task and the dynamic behavior is modeled as a control task that supervises the execution of applications. Inside a dataflow task, we specify the dynamic behavior using a similar way as FSM-based SADF in which an application is specified by a synchronous dataflow graph for each mode of operation. It enables us to perform compile-time scheduling of each graph to maximize the throughput varying the number of allocated processors, and store the scheduling information. When a change in system state is detected at runtime, the number of allocated processors to the active tasks is determined dynamically utilizing the stored scheduling information of those tasks in order to meet the real-time requirements. The proposed technique is implemented in the HOPES design environment. Through preliminary experiments with a simple smartphone example, we show the viability of the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Behavior Specification and Dynamic Mapping for Real-Time Embedded Systems: HOPES Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000341390100018"}
