This algorithm provides a 2-approximation to the minimum edge dominating set and minimum maximal matching problems. We refine its analysis and give an expression of the approximation ratio that is strictly less than 2 in the cases where the input graph has it vertices and at least epsilon (n 2) edges, for epsilon > 1/2. This ratio is shown to be asymptotically tight for epsilon > 1/2. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
