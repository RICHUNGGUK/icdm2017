As semiconductor fabrication technology evolves into very deep sub-micron (DSM) level, power consumption has become the inevitable challenge in SoC design. In order to maximize the lifetime of portable system battery, SoC is required not only to be energy-efficient but also to work in an optimal and battery-aware manner. This paper intends to discuss some key technologies of SoC design from the above perspectives of view.", "paper_title": "Key technologies of system on chip design", "paper_id": "WOS:000256082600012"}
