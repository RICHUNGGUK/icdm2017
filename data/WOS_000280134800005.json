Recently, considerable research efforts have been made in the field of indexing, analyzing, and mining uncertain data. As shown in a recent book [2] on uncertain data, in order to efficiently manage and mine uncertain data, effective indexing techniques are highly desirable. Based on the observation that the existing index structures for multidimensional data are sensitive to the size or shape of uncertain regions of uncertain objects and the queries, in this paper, we introduce a novel R-Tree-based inverted index structure, named UI-Tree, to efficiently support various queries including range queries, similarity joins, and their size estimation, as well as top-k range query, over multidimensional uncertain objects against continuous or discrete cases. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both real data and synthetic data to demonstrate the efficiency of our techniques.", "paper_title": "Effectively Indexing the Uncertain Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000280134800005"}
