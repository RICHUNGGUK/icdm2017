Actually, the practical ED is a non-convex nonlinear optimisation problem with some equality and inequality limits. Mathematically, the practical ED entails a prevailing solver to find the optimal solution. In this way, this article proposes a new bio-inspired algorithm called krill herd (KH) to resolve the practical ED problem incorporating different types of constraints such as valve-loading effects, prohibited operating zone, spinning reserve and multi-fuel option. In order to improve the overall search skill of the algorithm, a new modification method based on Levy Flight motion and crossover operator is employed. The proposed modified KH (MKH) algorithm is examined on three test systems to validate its satisfying performance.", "paper_title": "A novel sufficient bio-inspired optimisation method based on modified krill herd algorithm to solve the economic load dispatch", "paper_id": "WOS:000348569600005"}
