A double band metamaterial unit cell design will be utilized to show that use of different boundary conditions may result in simulation of dissimilar periodic array topologies with completely different electromagnetic responses. It will also be shown that dimensions of the computational volume may strongly affect the overall response of the metamaterial structure due to varying electromagnetic coupling between the array elements.
