Balancing the lines is a vital design problem for the industries, and the problem is NP-hard. Besides the fundamental constraints of the conventional line balancing problem, some specific constraints may occur in the two-sided assembly line problem, including the zoning constraints, the positional constraints, and the synchronism constraints, which make the problem more complex. In this paper, an integer programming (IP) model is constructed and solved for the two-sided assembly line balancing problem which contains the above three constraints. A novel metaheuristic named late acceptance hill-climbing (LAHC) is also proposed to solve the problem effectively. The proposed algorithm is tested on several sets of instances. The computational results of the LAHC algorithm are compared with those of IP and the lower bounds of the instances. The experiment validates the effectiveness of the LAHC algorithm.", "paper_title": "A late acceptance hill-climbing algorithm for balancing two-sided assembly lines with multiple constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000347893700012"}
