For more than 30 years, the best algorithm known for general metrics has been Christofides's algorithm with an approximation factor of , even though the so-called Held-Karp LP relaxation of the problem is conjectured to have the integrality gap of only . Very recently, significant progress has been made for the important special case of graphic metrics, first by Oveis Gharan et al. (FOCS, 550-559, 2011), and then by Momke and Svensson (FOCS, 560-569, 2011). In this paper, we provide an improved analysis of the approach presented in Momke and Svensson (FOCS, 560-569, 2011) yielding a bound of on the approximation factor, as well as a bound of for any epsilon > 0 for a more general Travelling Salesman Path Problem in graphic metrics.", "paper_title": "13/9-Approximation for Graphic TSP", "paper_id": "WOS:000342194900002"}
