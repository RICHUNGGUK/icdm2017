For various reasons, these models may be incomplete and thus fail to meet the requirements defined by their potential applications. In this work, we develop a novel multiresolution approach to repair the voids commonly found in digital elevation models (DEM). We use the overall shape and structure of the surrounding terrain to build a smooth patch for the void. Then, using a multiresolution approach obtained from reverse Chaikin subdivision, we extract the low-scale characteristics from the surrounding terrain and apply them to the smooth patch. The results demonstrate that our approach is effective in synthesizing models with realistic characteristics.", "paper_title": "Contextual void patching for digital elevation models", "paper_id": "WOS:000249207600028"}
