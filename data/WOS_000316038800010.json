The parity-check matrices of our quantum codes contain one and only one 4-cycle in every two rows and have better distance properties. However, the classical parity-check matrix constructed from EGs does not satisfy the condition of dual-containing. In some parameter conditions, parts of the rows in the matrix maybe have not any nonzero element in common. Notably, we propose four families of fascinating structure according to changes in all the parameters, and the parity-check matrices are adopted to satisfy the requirement of dual-containing. Series of matrix properties are proved. Construction methods of the parity-check matrices with dual-containing property are given. The simulation results show that the quantum LDPC codes constructed by this method perform very well over the depolarizing channel when decoded with iterative decoding based on the sum-product algorithm. Also, the quantum codes constructed in this paper outperform other quantum codes based on EGs.", "paper_title": "A Class of Check Matrices Constructed from Euclidean Geometry and Their Application to Quantum LDPC Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000316038800010"}
