Through introducing two new dominance relations to set-valued information systems, we first introduce the conjunctive/disjunctive set-valued ordered information systems, and develop an approach to queuing problems for objects in presence of multiple attributes and criteria. Then, we present a dominance-based rough set approach for these two types of set-valued ordered information systems, which is mainly based on substitution of the indiscernibility relation by a dominance relation. Through the lower/upper approximation of a decision, some certain/possible decision rules from a so-called set-valued ordered decision table can be extracted. Finally, we present attribute reduction (also called criteria reduction in ordered information systems) approaches to these two types of ordered information systems and ordered decision tables, which can be used to simplify a set-valued ordered information system and find decision rules directly from a set-valued ordered decision table. These criteria reduction approaches can eliminate those criteria that are not essential from the viewpoint of the ordering of objects or decision rules. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
