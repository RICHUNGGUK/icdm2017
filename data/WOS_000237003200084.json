To obtain effective collaboration in such a collection of clusters, overcoming processors and networks heterogeneity, a system architecture was defined. This architecture and a model able to predict application performance and to help its design is described. The matrix multiplication algorithm is used as a benchmark and experiments are conducted over two geographically distributed heterogeneous clusters, one in Brazil and the other in Spain. The model obtained over 90% prediction accuracy in the experiments.", "paper_title": "Efficient execution of scientific computation on geographically distributed clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000237003200084"}
