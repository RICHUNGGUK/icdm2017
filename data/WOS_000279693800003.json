One aspect that was not deeply addressed in the original SIP is its authentication procedure. Apart from its security, an SIP authentication procedure should be efficient. This paper proposes a robust and efficient three-party SIP authentication protocol. In this protocol, the end users are authenticated with the proxy server in their domain using the registrar server. Compared to previous works, our proposed protocol is more efficient and secure. To support our protocol with a formal security proof, its model is constructed using High-Level Protocol Specification Language (HLPSL). The model is verified using the model checking tool, AVISPA, and the result confirms that the protocol is quite safe.", "paper_title": "A Robust and Efficient SIP Authentication Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000279693800003"}
