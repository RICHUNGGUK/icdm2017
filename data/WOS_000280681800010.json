However, most of the previous work has merely focused on the two-tier hierarchy. In this paper, we study and analyze General Truncated Pyramid Peer-to-Peer (GTPP) architecture, the generalized version of Partially Vertical Hierarchical Architecture (PV-HA). The idea is to study whether added tiers of hierarchy can provide added value in performance and functionality. Through mathematical analysis, we demonstrate performance results in comparison to flat architecture, which helps understanding the typical characteristics of hierarchical architectures. Firstly, GTPP has slightly higher expected lookup hop count, although it can be decreased with optimizing the sub-overlay setup. However, GTPP significantly decreases the expected lookup routing latency. Secondly, GTPP has clearer and more reasonable traffic distribution among all the peers from different tiers of sub-overlays, and can work with slightly lower maintenance traffic. Thirdly, our studies indicate that two to three tiers are most suitable in most cases for GTPP, considering all the parameters.", "paper_title": "GTPP: General Truncated Pyramid Peer-to-Peer Architecture over Structured DHT Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280681800010"}
