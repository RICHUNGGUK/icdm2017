It accounts for all structural coupling coming from the material anisotropy and geometric nonlinearity. Nonlinear governing equations are derived and solved by means of an incremental Newton-Raphson method. The finite element model that accounts for the geometric nonlinearity in the von Karman sense is developed to solve the problem. Numerical results are obtained for thin-walled composite Z-beam and I-beam to investigate effects of geometric nonlinearity, fiber orientation and warping restraint on the flexuraltorsional response.
