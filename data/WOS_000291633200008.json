First, we motivate the use of correntropy to improve the robustness of the classical mean square error (MSE) criterion that is sensitive to outliers. Then an l(1) regularization scheme is imposed on the correntropy to learn robust and sparse representations. Based on the half-quadratic optimization technique, we propose a novel algorithm to solve the nonlinear optimization problem. Second, we develop a new correntropy-based classifier based on the learned regularization scheme for robust object recognition. Extensive experiments over several applications confirm that the correntropy-based l1 regularization can improve recognition accuracy and receiver operator characteristic curves under noise corruption and occlusion.", "paper_title": "A Regularized Correntropy Framework for Robust Pattern Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000291633200008"}
