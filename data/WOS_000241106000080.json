The difficulty lies in the fact that the two metrics for evaluating privacy preserving data mining methods: privacy and accuracy are typically contradictory in nature. This paper addresses privacy preserving mining of association rules on distributed dataset. We present an algorithm, based on a probabilistic approach of distorting transactions in the dataset, which can provide high privacy of individual information and at the same time acquire a high level of accuracy in the mining result. Finally, we present experiment results that validate the algorithm.", "paper_title": "A privacy preserving mining algorithm on distributed dataset", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000080"}
