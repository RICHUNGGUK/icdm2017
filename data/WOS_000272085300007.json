In this paper, a multi-agent group programming model is presented, where each agent executes local programming by evolutionary search. Based on co-evolution idea, agents resolve conflicts and revise their own search direction to optimize local and social objectives in an interactive process by means of clustering and group choice. Finally, the paper presents simulation results that illustrate the operational effectiveness of our agent group programming model.", "paper_title": "Multi-Agent Group Programming Based On Co-evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000272085300007"}
