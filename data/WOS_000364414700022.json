In this letter, the locality and availability of some linear codes based on finite geometry are given. According to these results, we give some linear codes that have higher rate than known codes with the same locality and availability.", "paper_title": "On the Locality and Availability of Linear Codes Based on Finite Geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000364414700022"}
