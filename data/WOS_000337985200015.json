An important component of this development, cloud computing, uses low-power hosts to achieve high reliability. Specifically, cloud computing increases the number of user applications on the Internet. In this context, research should focus on how distributed systems can provide additional reliability and fluency. Notably, the consensus problem is a fundamental concern to fault-tolerant distributed systems. However, previous studies of the consensus problem do not address cloud computing and so they are not suitable within a cloud computing context. To enhance the relevant literature with regard to fault-tolerance, the consensus problem in a cloud computing environment is revisited in this study. The Dual Fault Protocol for cloud computing (DFP) that we proposed can solve the consensus problem with a minimal number of rounds of message exchange and tolerates a maximal number of allowable dual failure nodes. The DFP attempts to solve the consensus problem and allows all correct nodes in the topology of cloud computing environment to achieve stable results without any influence from faulty components.
