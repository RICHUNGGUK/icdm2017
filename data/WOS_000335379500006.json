Main hurdle to obtaining multiple measurements is the time required to manually trace a series of Doppler traces. To make it easier to analyze more beats, we present the description of an application system for automated aortic Doppler envelope quantification, compatible with a range of hardware platforms. It analyses long Doppler strips, spanning many heartbeats, and does not require electrocardiogram to separate individual beats. We tested its measurement of velocity-time-integral and peak-velocity against the reference standard defined as the average of three experts who each made three separate measurements. The automated measurements of velocity-time-integral showed strong correspondence (R-2 = 0.94) and good Bland-Altman agreement (SD = 1.39 cm) with the reference consensus expert values, and indeed performed as well as the individual experts (R-2 = 0.90 to 0.96, SD = 1.05 to 1.53). The same performance was observed for peak-velocities; ((R-2 = 0.98, SD = 3.07 cm/s) and (to (R-2 = 0.93 to 0.98, SD = 2.96 to 5.18 cm/s). This automated technology allows > 10 times as many beats to be analyzed compared to the conventional manual approach. This would make clinical and research protocols more precise for the same operator effort.", "paper_title": "Automated Aortic Doppler Flow Tracing for Reproducible Research and Clinical Measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000335379500006"}
