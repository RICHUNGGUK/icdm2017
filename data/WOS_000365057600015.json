We propose a collaborative multi-hop routing algorithm combined with clustering to improve network performance. To build the multi-hop routing with maximum achievable rate, a relation matrix is exploited to describe the possible coverage of network nodes. A clustering-based path strategy is presented to create the effective next-hop link. A collaboration strategy is proposed to construct collaborative matrix. And then by clustering and collaboration, a multi-hop routing with maximum achievable rate is successfully built. The effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed methods are verified by simulation results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
