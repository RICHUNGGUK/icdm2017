We focuse on wireless with stationary nodes, such as community wireless networks. Our main result is charactrerization of stability condition and the end-to-end throughput using the balance. We also investigate the impact of routing on end-to-end throughput and stability of intermediate nodes. We find that i) as long as the intermediate queues in the network are stable, the end-to-end throughput of a connection does not depend on the load on the intermediate nodes, ii) we showed that if the weight of a link originating from a node is set to the number of neighbors of this node, then shortest path routing maximizes the minimum probability of end-to-end packet delivery in a network of weighted fair queues with coupled servers. Numerical results are given and support the results of the analysis.", "paper_title": "Stability-throughput tradeoff and routing in multi-hop wireless ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800003"}
