The application of DE algorithms to pyramidal horn design allows the accurate calculation of their physical dimensions in a short amount of time. Moreover, self-adaptive DE does not require the pre-specified choice of control parameters reducing significantly the users' effort. Representative examples demonstrate the applicability of our proposal. Our study shows that self-adaptive DE algorithms outperform or produce similar results with other methods in the literature in terms of solution accuracy and convergence speed.
