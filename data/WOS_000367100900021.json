This finding has profound implications for the performance of network protocols such as broadcast, multicast, opportunistic routing, and network coding. In this paper, we show how link correlation can significantly impact broadcast. We present the design and implementation of CorLayer, a general supporting layer for energy-efficient reliable broadcast that carefully blacklists certain poorly correlated wireless links. The design uses only one-hop information, which makes it work in a fully distributed manner and introduces minimal communication overhead. The highlight of our work is CorLayer's broad applicability and effectiveness. We integrate CorLayer transparently with 16 state-of-the-art broadcast protocols specified in 13 publications on three physical testbeds running TelosB, MICAz, and GreenOrbs nodes, respectively. The experimental results show that CorLayer significantly improves energy efficiency across a wide spectrum of broadcast protocols and that the total number of packet transmissions can be reduced consistently by 47% on average.", "paper_title": "CorLayer: A Transparent Link Correlation Layer for Energy-Efficient Broadcast", "paper_id": "WOS:000367100900021"}
