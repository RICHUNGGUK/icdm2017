Self-determination theory and structuration theory are used as theoretical lenses to understand the adoption and use or an ICT system. The data were collected using qualitative semi-structured interviews with eleven system users and analyzed using a content analysis approach. The research shows that the self-determined adoption of ICT systems has benefits like user motivation and satisfaction. Problems in such adoption relate to users experiencing uncertainty regarding the organizational legitimization of the system and support for its use. Employees and organizations are likely to benefit from self-determined adoption because it promotes employees' motivation and initiative-taking. However, a shared understanding of self-determination and organizational support for it are required.", "paper_title": "Self-Determined Adoption of an ICT System in a Work Organization", "paper_id": "WOS:000288140100003"}
