The receiver-centric transport-layer (RCP)-C-2 (Radial Reception Control Protocol) was proposed to resolve the incapability of the MPP communication in conventional TCP and UDP. However, (RCP)-C-2 has no consideration to discriminate the importance in a packet payload which is critical to QoE and brings an issue for critical data packets that may be dropped in great risk of network congestion. In this paper, we thus present P-(RCP)-C-2 (Prioritized (RCP)-C-2) to effectively decrease the loss ratio of critical data packets in MPP video streaming while the network is congested. P-(RCP)-C-2 is a cross-layer protocol that considers both the transport-layer issues and the media content's properties in application-layer. Then, an example on MPP-UVS (MPP ubiquitous video surveillance) is presented as UVS is now a very important Internet application that requires QoS/QoE management to protect lives and assets especially in SHE. Our experiments are conducted on different kinds of surveillance videos over MPP links with different bandwidth and packet loss inserted. The experimental results demonstrate that, as the loss of critical packets is decreased by an order and much less critical data packets are dropped, P-(RCP)-C-2 can highly guard not only QoS but also QoE of SHE surveillance video streaming.
