Discriminating between these efficient DMUs is an interesting subject, and a large number of methods have been proposed for fully ranking both efficient and inefficient DMUs. This paper demonstrates the fact that the rank reversal phenomenon may occur in most DEA ranking methods; however, this study introduces some ranking methods which do not follow the procedure and lack this taint. Numerical examples are provided to clearly illustrate the above mentioned phenomenon in some DEA ranking methods. In fact, certain ranking methods are surveyed in DEA focusing on rank preservation and rank reversal phenomena. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
