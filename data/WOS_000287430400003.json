We present an algorithm to decide whether a proper rational parametrization of a ruled surface, with coefficients in K((i), can be properly reparametrized over a real (i.e. embedded in R) finite field extension of K. Moreover, in the affirmative case, the algorithm provides a proper parametrization with coefficients in a real extension of K of degree at most 2. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
