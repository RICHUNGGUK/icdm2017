However, people still misgive the effect of GM crop products for the health and the environment. Hence, the strategies for the co-existence of GM and non-GM crops are a recognized necessity. Using the fitting function to predict the rate of cross-pollination for determining a befitting distance is one of the strategies for the co-existence of GM and non-GM crops. Although many methods have been proposed to predict the rate of cross-pollination, most of them only use the distance from the pollen source to the pollen recipient However, the rates of cross-pollination are affected by many variables (factors). Furthermore, the cross-pollination rate prediction might be underestimated because most of cross-pollination rates are close to zero. Accordingly, to solve these problems, this paper proposes a hybrid method (FPSOSVR), which consists of fuzzy logic, particle swarm optimization, and support vector regression, for predicting the cross-pollination rate of pollen recipient from the pollen source to simulate the real situation of GM and non-GM maize. Compared with three existing methods, including Exponential, Log/log, and Log/square, the FPSOSVR, Exponential, Log/log, and Log/square methods yielded the root mean square error values of 5.0100%, 8.1950%, 8.2559%, and 8.1919% for training and 3.0727%, 7.2883%, 73736%, and 73026% for testing, respectively. Obviously, the fitting ability and prediction accuracy of FPSOSVR are better than those of the existing methods about 30-50%. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient between the actual and the predicted cross-pollination rates of FPSOSVR is also close to 0.9, that is, FPSOSVR can be successfully applied in the co-existence topic of genetically modified (GM) and non-GM crops because it brings a better performance in terms of several statistical indicators.
