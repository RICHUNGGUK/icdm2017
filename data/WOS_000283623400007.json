The temperature estimation at characteristic points of the machine, and in particular in permanent magnets, is essential to accurately simulate the electromagnetic behavior and avoid irreversible demagnetization. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, an electromagnetic dimensioning model, parameterized by finite element analysis, is coupled to a thermal lumped-parameter model to constitute a fast and efficient design tool for electrical machines. Findings - A parameterized and hybrid FE-analytical electromagnetic model, which combines analytical and numerical advantages, to archive a fast and accurate electromagnetic simulation results is combined with a thermal lumped-parameter model for water-cooled and passive air-cooled surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSM). Practical implications - Sizing, electromagnetic and thermal modeling aspects are integrated into an automated design process. The whole design process is demonstrated on two standard industrial servo motors for passive and active water cooling and afterwards compared with available measurements. Originality/value - The proposed method allows considering thermal aspects during the iterative automated electromagnetic design process of PMSM.", "paper_title": "Automated sizing of permanent magnet synchronous machines with respect to electromagnetic and thermal aspects", "paper_id": "WOS:000283623400007"}
