Our approach is based on the fast marching method for solving the eikonal equation in O(nl og n) steps on n grid points by numerically simulating wavefront propagation. The obtuse angle splitting problem is reformulated as a set of small integer linear programs, that can be solved in O(n). Numerical simulations demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm.
