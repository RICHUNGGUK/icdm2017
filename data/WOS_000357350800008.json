We have determined that the capabilities of CO2 adsorption depend on the combined effect of the framework topology and the position of the Ir-4 cluster. Adsorption intensifies despite the fact that a fraction of the pore volume is occupied by the Ir-4 cluster, and thus, the adsorption is more intense than that on empty zeolite. The pore topology however is also playing a crucial role in the effect, as in certain cases it allows the CO2 molecules to order in such a way they fill the most pore space. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
