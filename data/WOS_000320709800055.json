In this paper, we investigate the structure of the final exponentiation step. Consider an order r subgroup of an elliptic curve defined over F-q with embedding degree k. The final exponentiation in the Tate pairing is an exponentiation of an element in F-qk by (q(k) - 1)/r. The hardest part of this computation is to raise to the power lambda := Phi(k)(q)/r, where Phi(k)(.) denotes the kth cyclotomic polynomial. Write it as lambda = lambda(0) + lambda(1)q + ... + lambda(phi(k)-1)q(phi(k)-1) in the q-ary representation. The final exponentiation cost mostly depends on kappa(lambda), the size of the maximum of vertical bar lambda(i)vertical bar. In many parameterized pairing-friendly curves, the value kappa is about (1 - 1/rho phi(k)log(2) q where rho = log(2) q/log(2) r, while random curves will have kappa approximate to log(2) q . We investigate how this small kappa is obtained for parameterized pairing- friendly elliptic curves, and show that (1 - 1/rho phi(k)log(2) q is the lower bound for all known construction methods of parameterized pairing- friendly curves. In the second part of our paper, we propose a method to obtain a modified Tate pairing with small kappa for any pairing- friendly elliptic curves including those not belonging to parameterized families. More precisely, our method finds an integer m using the lattice basis reduction such that kappa(m lambda) = (1 - 1/rho phi(k)log(2) q. Using this modified Tate pairing, we can reduce the number of squarings in the final exponentiation by a factor of (1 - 1/rho phi(k) from the usual Tate pairing. We apply our method to several known pairing- friendly curves to verify the expected speedup.", "paper_title": "On the Final Exponentiation in Tate Pairing Computations", "paper_id": "WOS:000320709800055"}
