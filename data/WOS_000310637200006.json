Two powerful types of local descriptors have been considered in this study: Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Weber Local Descriptors (WLD). First, we investigate the performance of LBP and WLD separately and experiment with different parameter values to optimize race classification. Second, we apply the Kruskal-Wallis feature selection algorithm to select a subset of more \"discriminative\" bins from the LBP and WLD histograms. Finally, we fuse LBP and WLD, both at the feature and score levels, to further improve race classification accuracy. For classification, we have considered the minimum distance classifier and experimented with three distance measures: City-block, Euclidean, and Chi-square. We have performed extensive experiments and comparisons using five race groups from the FERET database. Our experimental results indicate that (i) using the Kruskal-Wallis feature selection, (ii) fusing LBP with WLD at the feature level, and (iii) using the City-block distance for classification, outperforms LBP and WLD alone as well as methods based on holistic features such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and LBP or WLD (i.e., applied globally).", "paper_title": "RACE CLASSIFICATION FROM FACE IMAGES USING LOCAL DESCRIPTORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000310637200006"}
