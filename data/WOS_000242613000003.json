First, on the basis of mechanical-electric coupling equation and considering electric load and mechanical loads together, the finite element model of piezoelectric trusses has been built up. Then, the computational formula has been derived for the design sensitivities of critical buckling load factor of the structure with respect to size and shape design variables. The electric voltage is taken as a new kind of design variable and the calculation method of critical load buckling factor with respect to the electric voltage variables is proposed. Particularly, the variations of the loads and pre-buckling inner forces with design variables have been accounted for. Finally, the sequential linear programming algorithm is employed to solve the optimization problem, and a new method of controlling structural buckling stability by optimizing the voltages of piezoelectric active bars is proposed. Numerical examples given in the paper have demonstrated the effectiveness of the methods presented.", "paper_title": "Design optimization and sensitivity analysis on buckling stability of piezoelectric truss structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000242613000003"}
