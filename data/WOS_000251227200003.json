Therefore, UWB may provide accurate positioning capability. In order to relax the complexity in circuit implementation, UWB system with low resolution analog digital converters (ADCs) has been investigated. In this paper, the accuracy of UWB positioning with comparators is investigated through experiment. The accuracy of positioning,kith comparators is compared to that with 8 [bit] ADCs, and effectiveness of the system with the comparators is confirmed within the area of 1.8 x 1.8 [m].", "paper_title": "Experimental investigation of an IR-UWB positioning system with comparators", "paper_id": "WOS:000251227200003"}
