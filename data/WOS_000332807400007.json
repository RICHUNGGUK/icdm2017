The error is always measured in L-2 (T-d). Particular emphasis is given to the dependence of all constants on the dimension d. We capture the exact decay rate in n and the exact decay order of the constants with respect to d, which is in fact polynomial. As a consequence we observe that none of our considered approximation problems suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Surprisingly, the square integrability of all weak derivatives up to order three (classical Sobolev norm) guarantees weak tractability of the associated multivariate approximation problem.
