This work deals with the development of a formation control strategy for the circular formation of a group of satellites. In this paper, artificial potential field method is used for path planning, and sliding mode control (SMC) technique is used for designing a robust controller. A fuzzy inference mechanism is utilized to reduce the chattering phenomenon inherent in the conventional SMC. An adaptive tuning algorithm is also derived based on Lyapunov stability theory to tune the fuzzy parameter. The proposed fuzzy-SMC-based technique is intended to compensate for the modeling uncertainties existing in practical applications. The results of simulations done for a group of five satellites making a circular formation confirm the stability and robustness of the present scheme.", "paper_title": "Multisatellite Formation Control for Remote Sensing Applications Using Artificial Potential Field and Adaptive Fuzzy Sliding Mode Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000355211600018"}
