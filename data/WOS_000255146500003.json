The proposed procedure employs inverse first order reliability method to obtain the design penetration depth and section modulus of the steel sheet pile wall in order that the reliability of the wall against failure modes must meet a desired level of safety. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the effect of uncertainties in design parameters on the reliability of cantilever sheet pile walls. The analysis is performed by treating back fill soil properties, depth of the water table from the top of the sheet pile wall, yield strength of steel and section modulus of steel pile as random variables. Two limit states, viz., rotational and flexural failure of sheet pile wall are considered. The results using this approach are used to develop a set of reliability based design charts for different coefficients of variation of friction angle of the backfill (5%, 10% and 15%). System reliability considerations in terms of series and parallel systems are also studied. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
