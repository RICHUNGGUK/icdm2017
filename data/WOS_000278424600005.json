Our solution is a fingerprint-based positioning system that overcomes the problem of the relative effect of doors and walls on signal strength and is independent of network device manufacturers. In the measurement phase, our system collects received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements from multiple access points. In the calibration phase, our system utilizes these measurements in a normalization process to create a radio map, a database of RSS patterns. Unlike traditional radio map-based methods, our methodology normalizes RSS measurements collected at different locations (on a floor) and uses artificial neural network models (ANNs) to group them into clusters. In the third phase, we use data mining techniques (clustering) to optimize location results. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method. From these results it is clear that the system is highly likely to be able to locate a MS in a room or nearby MOM. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
