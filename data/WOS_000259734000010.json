The eFPGA is based on a parametrisable architecture template optimised for arithmetic oriented applications. It was designed as a physically optimised VLSI-macro using a flexible design methodology also sketched in this paper. Quantitative comparisons of the eFPGA with a commercial standard FPGA show significant improvements in energy, area and timing delays. Simulations of the new ASIP-eFPGA architecture have been conducted using a model based approach to evaluate its efficiency. The results show that power- and area-efficiencies similar to an FPGA can be achieved for the flexible ASIP-eFPGA while preserving the flexibility of a software programmable processor.", "paper_title": "Application domain specific embedded FPGAs for flexible ISA-extension of ASIPs", "paper_id": "WOS:000259734000010"}
