At the same time, for large segments of embedded markets, parameters like cost and performance continue to be as important as reliability. This paper presents a compiler-based methodology for facilitating the design of fault-tolerant embedded systems. The methodology is supported by an infrastructure that permits to easily combine hardware/software soft errors mitigation techniques in order to best satisfy both usual design constraints and dependability requirements. It is based on a generic microprocessor architecture that facilitates the implementation of software-based techniques, providing a uniform isolated-from-target hardening core that allows the automatic generation of protected source code (hardened code). Two case studies are presented. In the first one, several software-based mitigation techniques are implemented and evaluated showing the flexibility of the infrastructure. In the second one, a customized fault tolerant embedded system is designed by combining selective protection on both hardware and software. Several trade-offs among performance, code size, reliability, and hardware costs have been explored. Results show the applicability of the approach. Among the developed software-based mitigation techniques, a novel selective version of the well known SWIFT-R is presented.", "paper_title": "Compiler-Directed Soft Error Mitigation for Embedded Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000299280300002"}
