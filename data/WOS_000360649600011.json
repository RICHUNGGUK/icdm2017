We performed our calculations for N- and C- codoping ZnO nanotube in two different configurations. For the first configuration in which the two impurity atoms (N or C) are on first nearest-neighbor sites in the plane of codoping, our calculation predicts that the N- and C-codoped ZnO nanotubes are antiferromagnetic material with no net magnetization. On the other hand, it is found that for the configuration in which the two impurity atoms are next nearest-neighbors, a spin polarization results in a magnetic moment in the N- and C-codoped ZnO nanotubes.", "paper_title": "Structural, electronic and magnetic properties of (N, C)-codoped ZnO nanotube: First principles study", "paper_id": "WOS:000360649600011"}
