Nikolopoulos, L Palios, Efficient parallel recognition of cographs, Discrete Applied Mathematics 150 (1-3) (2005) 182-215] and provide a new analysis of the algorithm. Given an input graph G with n vertices and m edges, we obtain the following three results based on our analysis: 1. When G is k-regular for a fixed positive integer k, the cograph-recognition problem can be optimally solved in O(log n) time using O(n+m/log n) processors on an EREW PRAM. 2. When G is k-regular for k = O(log log n), the cograph-recognition problem can be solved in O(log n log log n) time using O(n+m/log n) processors on an EREW PRAM. 3. Given a positive integer alpha = O(log log n), the cograph-recognition problem can be solved in O(log n log log n) time using O(n+m/log n) processors on an EREW PRAM, provided the number of vertices in G with degree larger than alpha is at most O(log n). The above results improve upon the previously best known result, which took O(log(2) n) time using O(n+m/log n) processors on an EREW PRAM. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
