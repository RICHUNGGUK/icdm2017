The interaction energies were estimated as a sum of the CCSD(T) correlation contribution and the Hartree-Fock energy at the complete basis set limit, for the geometries of the benzene-chlorohydrocarbon model structures at the energy minimum obtained by potential energy surface scans using RMP2(FC)/cc-pVTZ. The calculated Cl-pi interaction energy was -2.01 kcal/mol, and the dispersion force was found to be the major source of attraction. We also discuss the geometry flexibility in Cl-pi interactions.", "paper_title": "Cl-pi Interactions in Protein-Ligand Complexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000269223200019"}
