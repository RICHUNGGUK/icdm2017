Two novel architectures are proposed for multi-modulus adders that support the most common moduli cases in RNS channels, that is, modulo 2(n) - 1, 2(n) and 2(n) + 1. The proposed architectures use parallel prefix carry computation units composed of log(2)n levels. The experimental results show that the resulting adders are significantly faster and/or smaller than the earlier proposals. Multi-modulus subtractors, multipliers and squarers that rely on the use of the proposed multi-modulus adders are also presented. The last two are shown experimentally to outperform the currently most efficient ones in area, delay and dynamic power dissipation terms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
