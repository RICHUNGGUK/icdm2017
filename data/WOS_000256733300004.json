This program calculates the NLO supersymmetric contributions to the isospin asymmetry, using the effective Hamiltonian approach and within the QCD factorization method. We show that isospin symmetry breaking proves to be a very restrictive observable, in particular in the mSUGRA parameter space. The program also calculates the inclusive branching ratio associated to b -> s gamma transition, as a comparison reference.", "paper_title": "SuperIso: A program for calculating the isospin asymmetry of B -> K*gamma in the MSSM", "paper_id": "WOS:000256733300004"}
