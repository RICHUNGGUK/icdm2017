The model allows evaluating the performance of such systems under a cyclic process. Given the probabilistic characteristics of the transition times, the cycle time of the system can be determined from the initial marking. In this contribution, we compute an upper bound on the cycle time of a stochastic marked graph in case the probabilistic characteristics of the transition times are not fully specified.
