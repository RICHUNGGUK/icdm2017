To maintain confidentiality, encryption of 3D objects is essential. However, the requirements and limitations imposed by 3D objects indicate the impropriety of conventional cryptosystems for 3D object encryption. This suggests the necessity of designing new ciphers. In addition, the study of prior works indicates that the majority of problems encountered with encrypting 3D objects are about point cloud protection, dimensional and spatial stability, and robustness against surface reconstruction attacks. To address these problems, this paper proposes a 3D object encryption scheme, based on a series of random permutations and rotations, which deform the geometry of the point cloud. Since the inverse of a permutation and a rotation matrix is its transpose, the decryption implementation is very efficient. Our statistical analyses show that within the cipher point cloud, points are randomly distributed. Furthermore, the proposed cipher leaks no information regarding the geometric structure of the plain point cloud, and is also highly sensitive to the changes of the plaintext and secret key. The theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the security, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed cipher against surface reconstruction attacks.", "paper_title": "A 3D Object Encryption Scheme Which Maintains Dimensional and Spatial Stability", "paper_id": "WOS:000352560400016"}
