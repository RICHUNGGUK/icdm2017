The considered delays are distributed continuously over unbounded intervals. By applying the Lyapunov functional method, the semimartingale convergence theorem, and some inequality technique, we obtain some sufficient criteria to check the almost sure exponential stability of the system, which generalizes and improves some earlier publications, Two examples are also given to demonstrate our results.
