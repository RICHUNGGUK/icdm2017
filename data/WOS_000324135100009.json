Under the assumption that the communication range of the sensor nodes is no more than that of the relay node, we present a polynomial time (5+I mu)-approximation algorithm for the 1-coverage 1-connected problem. Furthermore, we consider the fault tolerant problem in the network, we present a polynomial time (20+I mu)-approximation algorithm for the 2-coverage 2-connected problem, where I mu is any given positive constant. For the k-coverage 2-connected situation, we present a polynomial time (15k-10+I mu)-approximation algorithm.", "paper_title": "Relay node placement in two-tiered wireless sensor networks with base stations", "paper_id": "WOS:000324135100009"}
