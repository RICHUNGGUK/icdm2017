There is unavailability of electricity in a building during a disastrous situation. To have an energy efficient and real-time data delivery, a Quality of Service (QoS) aware energy efficient routing technique is proposed in this paper. It tries to find a route that meets the real-time data delivery deadlines by minimising the energy consumption. Also, WMSNs usually employ single channel design approach whereas at a given instant several video or image streams should be delivered. Based on the channel conditions, a game theory based distributed multichannel allocation mechanism is proposed which improves the network performance parameters in varying channel conditions. These network design mechanisms are investigated using NS-2 simulator for a test case application. It is shown that the combined approach leads to further reduction in the energy consumption by meeting the data reporting deadlines.", "paper_title": "A multichannel design for QoS aware energy efficient clustering and routing in WMSN", "paper_id": "WOS:000320854300002"}
