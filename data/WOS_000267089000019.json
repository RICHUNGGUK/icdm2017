This is the first work that proposes to exploit the powerful properties of color analysis for improving the performance of an ear matcher. The method described is based on the selection of color spaces from which a set of Gabor features are extracted. The selection is performed using the sequential forward floating selection where the fitness function is related to the optimization of the ear recognition performance. Finally, the matching step is performed by means of the combination by the sum rule of several 1-nearest neighbor classifiers constructed on different color components. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using the Notre-Dame EAR data set. Particularly interesting are the results obtained by the new approach in terms of rank-1 (similar to 84%), rank-5 (similar to 93%) and area under the ROC curve (similar to 98.5%), which are better than those obtained by other state-of-the-art 2D ear matchers.
