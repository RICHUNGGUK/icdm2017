After formalizing the definition and security notions for ABPKIS, a concrete ABPKIS scheme is presented. The security of our proposed ABPKIS scheme can be proved on a standard model. According to our knowledge, this is the first ABPKIS scheme up to now. Moreover, this is also the first concrete attribute-based key-insulated signature construction supporting multi-helpers.", "paper_title": "Attribute-Based Parallel Key-Insulated Signature", "paper_id": "WOS:000362112000002"}
