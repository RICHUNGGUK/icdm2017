It is based on a hypermap model of planar subdivisions, formal specifications and proofs assisted by the Coq system. Fundamental properties are proven by structural or noetherian induction: Genus Theorem, Euler Formula, constructive planarity criteria. A notion of ring of faces is inductively defined and a Jordan Curve Theorem is stated and proven for any planar hypermap.", "paper_title": "An Intuitionistic Proof of a Discrete Form of the Jordan Curve Theorem Formalized in Coq with Combinatorial Hypermaps", "paper_id": "WOS:000266090200002"}
