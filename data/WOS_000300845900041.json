Roughly, a principal curve is a parameterized curve in R-d which passes through the \"middle\" of a data cloud drawn from some unknown probability distribution. Depending on the definition, a principal curve relies on some unknown parameters (number of segments, length, turn, etc.) which have to be properly chosen to recover the shape of the data without interpolating. In this paper, we consider the principal curve problem from an empirical risk minimization perspective and address the parameter selection issue using the point of view of model selection via penalization. We offer oracle inequalities and implement the proposed approach to recover the hidden structures in both simulated and real-life data.", "paper_title": "Parameter Selection for Principal Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000300845900041"}
