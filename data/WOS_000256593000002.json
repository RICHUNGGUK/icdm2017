Peer Database Management Systems (PDBMSs) offer one data sharing approach, which favors a direct and dynamic node-to-node model of communication with no centralized control. Moreover, Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) using Web service technologies allow users to leverage existing assets towards the goal of building new architectures and integrating existing systems that can be componentized. We propose an Open Service Architecture for PDBMSs (OSAP). This architecture offers the main services of a PDBMS as Web services that are invoked via the communication network using a set of well-defined interfaces. This approach provides power and flexibility in terms of development and usage of the system. We have implemented this architecture within the Hyperion PDBMS infrastructure. We provide an analysis of the implementation of the OSAP architecture in terms of its characteristics. We also conduct a performance comparison with both the original Hyperion architecture, and a much simpler architecture that hides all the internal functionalities offered by a PDBMS as private processes that can be used by other peers only through one single web service which acts as peer manager.", "paper_title": "An open service architecture for the hyperion peer database system", "paper_id": "WOS:000256593000002"}
