For solving this problem, denoted by 1 vertical bar r(j)vertical bar Sigma C-j, we provide a new metaheuristic which is an extension of the so-called filtered beam search proposed by Ow and Morton [30]. This metaheuristic, referred to as a Genetic Recovering Beam Search (GRBS), takes advantages of a Genetic Local Search (GLS) algorithm and a Recovering Beam Search (RBS) in order to efficiently explore the solution space. In this paper we present the GRBS framework and its application to the 1 vertical bar r(j)vertical bar Sigma C-j problem. Computational results show that it consistently yields optimal or near-optimal solutions and that it provides interesting results by comparison to GLS and RBS algorithms. Moreover, these results highlight that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristics. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
