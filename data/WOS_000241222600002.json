The method describes the velocity and the non-hydrostatic pressure field and the free surface evolution in time. The governing equations are discretized by means of the finite volume method on a structured non-uniform grid; for this reason both local and global mass conservation are guaranteed. Convective and diffusive fluxes on the control volume faces, as well as boundary conditions, are approximated by high-order formulae.
