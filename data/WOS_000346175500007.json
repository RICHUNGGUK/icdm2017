Zukowski, Phys. Rev. A 85 (2012) 022119] is a procedure to transform a tight Bell inequality with partial correlations into a full-correlation form that is also tight. In this paper, we check the homogenizations of two families of n-partite Bell inequalities: the Hardy inequality and the tight Bell inequality without quantum violation. For Hardy's inequalities, their homogenizations bear stronger quantum violation for the maximally entangled state; the tight Bell inequalities without quantum violation give the boundary of quantum and supra-quantum, but their homogenizations do not have the similar properties. We find their homogenization are violated by the maximally entangled state. Numerically computation shows the the domains of quantum violation of homogenized Hardy's inequalities for the generalized GHZ states are smaller than those of Hardy's inequalities.", "paper_title": "Quantum nonlocality enhanced by homogenization", "paper_id": "WOS:000346175500007"}
