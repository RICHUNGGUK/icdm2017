However, few existing publications addressed the stability of delayed neural networks with variable-time impulses. In this paper, we consider the case of variable-time impulses and attempt to establish the general stability criteria. It shows that the proposed results can also be applied to the case of fixed-time impulses, which provide a new stability condition for the case of fixed-time impulses. To illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results, numerical examples and simulations are also presented.", "paper_title": "Stability of Hopfield neural networks with time delays and variable-time impulses", "paper_id": "WOS:000313062100021"}
