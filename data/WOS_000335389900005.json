A novel heuristic algorithm is proposed, the central element of which is a nonlinear transformation psi(p)=log(p/(1-p)) of the probability p that a pixel of the sought image be 1-valued. It consists of backprojections based on psi(p) and iterative corrections. Application of this algorithm to a series of artificial test cases leads to exact binary reconstructions, (i.e., recovery of the binary image for each single pixel) from the knowledge of projection data over a few directions. Images up to 10(6) pixels are reconstructed in a few seconds. A series of test cases is performed for comparison with previous methods, showing a better efficiency and reduced computation times.", "paper_title": "Efficient Binary Tomographic Reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000335389900005"}
