The current paper presents new models to predict HS for protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions with better statistics compared with the ones currently reported in literature. These models are based on solvent accessible surface area (SASA) and genetic conservation features subjected to simple Bayes networks (protein-protein systems) and a more complex multi-objective genetic algorithm-support vector machine algorithms (protein-nucleic acid systems) The best models for these interactions have been implemented in two free Web tools.", "paper_title": "Solvent Accessible Surface Area-Based Hot-Spot Detection Methods for Protein-Protein and Protein-Nucleic Acid Interfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000355382200015"}
