However, users may have photographs that contain graphics or images and want to access an electronic database to retrieve this information. Hence, an effective photograph retrieval method is needed. Although many content-based retrieval methods have been developed for images and graphics, few are designed to retrieve graphics and images simultaneously. Moreover, existing graphics retrieval methods use contour-based rather than pixel-based approaches. Contour-based methods, which are concerned with lines or curves, are inappropriate for images. To retrieve graphics and images simultaneously, this work applies an adaptive retrieval method. The proposed method uses histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) as pixel-based features. However, the characteristics of graphics and images differ, and this affects feature extraction and retrieval accuracy. Thus, an adaptive method is proposed that selects different HOG-based features for retrieving graphics and images. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method has high retrieval accuracy even under noisy conditions.", "paper_title": "Adaptive photograph retrieval method", "paper_id": "WOS:000337156500036"}
