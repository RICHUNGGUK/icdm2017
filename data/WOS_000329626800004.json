With this approach, both types of information as well as a regularization based on the Navier equation are directly integrated in a single energy minimizing functional. For this functional we have derived an analytic solution, which is based on matrix-valued non-radial basis functions. With our approach the full 3D intensity information is exploited, i.e., all voxels are considered and subsampling using a grid is not required. A special case of our hybrid approach is obtained by disregarding the landmark information, which results in a pure intensity-based elastic registration approach. We have successfully applied our approach to 3D synthetic images, 2D MR images of the human brain, 2D gel electrophoresis images, and 3D CT lung images.", "paper_title": "Spline-Based Hybrid Image Registration using Landmark and Intensity Information based on Matrix-Valued Non-radial Basis Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000329626800004"}
