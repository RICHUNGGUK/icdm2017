We show that BSIL is strictly more expressive than ATL(+) but incomparable with ATL*, GL (game logic), and AMC (alternating mu-calculus) in expressiveness. We show that a memoryful strategy is necessary for fulfilling a specification in BSIL. We establish that the BSIL model-checking problem is PSPACE-complete. However, BSIL model checking can be performed in time quadratic in the model for fixed formulas. The BSIL (and hence ATL(+)) satisfiability is 2EXPTIME-complete. Finally, we report our experiment with a model checker for BSIL.", "paper_title": "An Extension of ATL with Strategy Interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000356699500002"}
