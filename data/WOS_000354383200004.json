In Maker-Breaker games there are two players, denoted by Maker and Breaker. In each round, Maker claims one previously unclaimed edge of G and Breaker responds by claiming b previously unclaimed edges. We consider the Hamiltonicity game, the perfect matching game and the k-vertex-connectivity game, where Maker's goal is to build a graph which possesses the relevant property. Avoider-Enforcer games are the reverse analogue of Maker-Breaker games with a slight modification, where the two players claim at least 1 and at least b previously unclaimed edges per move, respectively, and Avoider aims to avoid building a graph which possesses the relevant property. Maker-Breaker games are known to be \"bias-monotone\", that is, if Maker wins the (1, b) game, he also wins the (1, b-1) game. Therefore, it makes sense to define the critical bias of a game, b*, to be the \"breaking point\" of the game. That is, Maker wins the (1, b) game whenever b < b* and loses otherwise. An analogous definition of the critical bias exists for Avoider-Enforcer games: here, the critical bias of a game b* is such that Avoider wins the (1, b) game for every b >= b*, and loses otherwise. We prove that, for every p = omega(ln n/n), G similar to G(n, p) is typically such that the critical bias for all the aforementioned Maker-Breaker games is asymptotically b* = np/ln n. We also prove that in the case p = Theta(ln n/n), the critical bias is b* = Theta(np/ln n). These results settle a conjecture of Stojakovic and Szabo. For Avoider-Enforcer games, we prove that for p = Omega(ln n/n), the critical bias for all the aforementioned games is b* = Theta(np/ln n).
