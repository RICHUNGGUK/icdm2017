The problem to be solved is how to model conflict situations where there is uncertainty about agreement, neutrality and disagreement among agents in a conflict situation. The solution to this problem includes modeling a conflict situation relative to basic binary relations on a universe of agents, introducing a measure of the degree of conflict, and encapsulating a conflict situation in an information system. The basic approach to modeling conflict situations is illustrated in the context of contract negotiation during the initial phases of requirement negotiation for a systems engineering project. An example of a high-level requirements negotiation for an automated lighting system is presented. The contribution of this paper is a rough set based requirements determination model using a conflict relation for representing requirements agreements (or disagreements).", "paper_title": "Conflict analysis and information systems: A rough set approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500034"}
