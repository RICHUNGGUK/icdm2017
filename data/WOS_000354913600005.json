This paper presents a new English auction scheme that can be realized in the public network environments without any additional secure channel. Our scheme not only satisfies security requirements of anonymity, traceability, no framing, fairness, public verifiability, unlinkability among different rounds of auction and linkability in an auction round, but also provides one-time registration and easy revocation. Furthermore, as compared with the pervious works, the proposed scheme has a better performance in terms of the computation and the size of bidding information.", "paper_title": "Efficient English Auction Scheme without a Secure Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000354913600005"}
