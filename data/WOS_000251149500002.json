The survey is carried out from two different perspectives: facial modeling, which concerns how to produce 3D face models, and facial animation, which regards how to synthesize dynamic facial expressions. To generate an individual face model, we can either perform individualization of a generic model or combine face models from an existing face collection. With respect to facial animation, we have further categorized the techniques into simulation-based, performance-driven and shape blend-based approaches. The strength and weakness of these techniques within each category are discussed, alongside with the applications of these techniques to various exploitations. In addition, a brief historical review of the technique evolution is provided. Limitations and future trend are discussed. Conclusions are drawn at the end of the paper.", "paper_title": "Building highly realistic facial modeling and animation: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000251149500002"}
