Although repeated codes are not used for encoding data, due to their parameters, we show that they have a good performance with this algorithm. We compare, by computer simulations, our algorithm for the repeated code of a Reed-Solomon code against a decoding algorithm of a Reed-Solomon code. Finally, we estimate the decoding capability of the algorithm for Reed-Solomon codes and show that performance is somewhat better than our estimates.", "paper_title": "List decoding of repeated codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000323372300009"}
