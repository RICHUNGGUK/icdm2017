The slack-diversifying nonlinear fluctuation smoothing rule is derived from the one-factor tailored nonlinear fluctuation smoothing rule for cycle time variation (1f-TNFSVCT) by dynamically maximizing the standard deviation of the slack, which has been shown to improve scheduling performance in several previous studies. The effectiveness of the proposed rule has been validated via using it with a simulated data set. Based on the findings in this research we also derived several directions that can be exploited in the future. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
