The formulation is developed using hyperelasticity in terms of logarithmic strains, the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into an elastic and a plastic part, and the exponential mapping. The novelty in the computational procedure is that it retains the conceptual simplicity of the large strain isotropic elasto-plastic algorithms based on the same ingredients. The plastic correction is performed using a standard small strain procedure in which the stresses are interpreted as generalized Kirchhoff stresses and the strains as logarithmic strains, and the large strain kinematics is reduced to a geometric pre- and post-processor. The procedure is independent of the specified yield function and type of hardening used, and for isotropic elasticity, the algorithm of Eterovic and Bathe is automatically recovered as a special case. The results of some illustrative finite element solutions are given in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
