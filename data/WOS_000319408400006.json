To accomplish this task, fuzzy hardware is the best choice. At inference engine, conjunction and disjunction operations play a very important role for decision making. Common operations in existing fuzzy hardware are minimum, maximum, algebraic product and probabilistic sum. In order to extend the applicability of existing fuzzy hardware, it is necessary to consider a wider range of operations. It is even desirable to have configurable circuits which take advantage of hardware resources. This work presents the hardware implementation of configurable circuits for the realization of diverse fuzzy t-norm and t-conorm operations. Resultant circuits are low hardware resource consumers which makes them efficient to be used as add-in modules for existing fuzzy hardware in FPGA or ASIC. Comparative results are presented showing the advantages of these circuits. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
