It is proved that the area of a compact slicing floorplan is a convex function of its width (height). The convexity is shown for the cases with and without dead (empty) space. This feature can be exploited to efficiently optimize the dimensions of layout components with multiple variants, without enumerating all possible combinations. Layout of a voltage-doubler circuit is used to quantitatively verify the proof. (C) 2015 Elsevier BM.
