While single-point upstream weighting is attractive due to simplicity and small stencil, the accompanying first-order error can contribute to a large amount of grid-dependent numerical diffusion which smooths the numerical solution. New upwind schemes are introduced for reservoir simulation that significantly reduce cross-wind diffusion, retain a local flux approximation with local conservation, and are free of spurious oscillations.
