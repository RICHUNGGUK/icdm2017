We consider a system with a single base station communicating with multiple users assisted by multiple relays. The relays have limited power which must be divided among the users they support in order to maximize the data rate of the whole network. Advanced power allocation schemes are crucial for such networks. The optimal relay power allocation which maximizes the data rate is proposed as an upper bound, by finding the optimal power requirement for each user based on knapsack problem formulation. Then by considering the fairness, a new relay power allocation scheme, called weighted-based scheme, is proposed. Finally, an efficient power reallocation scheme is proposed to efficiently utilize the power and improve the data rate of the network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed power allocation schemes can significantly improve the data rate of the network compared to the traditional scheme.", "paper_title": "Power Allocation Framework for OFDMA-based Decode-and-Forward Cellular Relay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345551700009"}
