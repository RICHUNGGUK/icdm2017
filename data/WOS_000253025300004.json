When demand rates are known with certainly, the assignment is found through the solution of a max-min integer program. When demand rates are stochastic with a common law, the assignment is found by solving an integer programme the objective of which is a non-homogeneous partial difference equation of first order. Unlike what common rules of thumb would dictate, our results show that the proportion of spaces assigned to a product is not necessarily equal to its demand frequency. Numerical computations show that employing the latter policy would result in inter-replenishment times that are about 24% shorter than the optimal solution. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
