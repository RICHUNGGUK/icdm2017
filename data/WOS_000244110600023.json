As there are a great number of products on the Internet, it is impossible to recommend all kinds of products in one system. We believe that the personalized recommendation system should be built up according to the special features of a certain sort of product, and forming professional recommendation systems for different products. In this paper, based on the consumer's current needs obtained from the system-user interactions, we propose a fuzzy-based system for consumer electronics to retrieve optimal products. Experimental results show the system is feasible and effective. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
