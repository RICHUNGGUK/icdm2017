Based on the assumption that data with the same label locate on a sub-manifold and different class data reside in the corresponding sub-manifolds, the proposed algorithm can construct an objective function which aims to project the original data into a subspace with maximum sub-manifold distance and minimum manifold locality. Moreover, instead of setting the weights between any two points directly or obtaining those by a square optimal problem, the optimal weights in this new algorithm can be approached using L1 minimization. The proposed algorithm is efficient, which can be validated by experiments on some benchmark databases.", "paper_title": "Feature extraction using maximum variance sparse mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000309878400002"}
