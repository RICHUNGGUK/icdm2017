Based on the BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) approach, it allows deriving a comprehensive vision of the process and a friendly-user interface of the logistics chain for the analysis and the decision making. Furthermore, ACTIF (Aide a la Conception de systemes de Transports Interoperables en France), a modeling approach proposed by the French Transportation Ministry, appears to be an interesting alternative approach since it assures the interoperability between the transport systems in France. Hence, we propose a model transformation procedure of the BPMN-model into an ACTIF model.", "paper_title": "Transportation Process of Containers BPMN-Modeling and Transformation into ACTIF Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000302996500005"}
