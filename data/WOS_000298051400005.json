The global convergence of the neural network can be guaranteed even though the objective function is pseudoconvex. The finite-time state convergence to the feasible region defined by the equality constraints is also proved. In addition, global exponential convergence is proved when the objective function is strongly pseudoconvex on the feasible region. Simulation results on illustrative examples and application on chemical process data reconciliation are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and characteristics of the neural network.", "paper_title": "A One-Layer Recurrent Neural Network for Pseudoconvex Optimization Subject to Linear Equality Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000298051400005"}
