Applications such as location-based services and quantified selfharness such data to bring meaningful context to users' behavior. As social applications are becoming prevalent, there is a trend for users to share their mobile data. The nature of online social networking poses new challenges for controlling access to private data, as compared to traditional enterprise,systems. First, the user may have a large number of friends, each associated with a unique access policy. Second, the access control policies must be dynamic and fine-grained, i.e. they are content-based, as opposed to all-or-nothing. In this paper, we investigate the challenges in sharing of mobile data in social applications. We design and evaluate a middleware running on Google App Engine, named Mosco, that manages and facilitates sharing of mobile data in a privacy-preserving manner. We use Mosco to develop a location sharing and a health monitoring application. Mosco helps shorten the development process. Finally, we perform benchmarking experiments with Mosco, the results of which indicate small overhead and high scalability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
