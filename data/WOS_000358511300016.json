The generated reference voltage is only 17.69 mV. This result has been achieved by introducing a temperature compensation technique that does not require the drain-source voltage of each MOSFET to be larger than 4kT/q. The implemented solution consists in two transistors voltage reference with two MOSFETs of the same threshold-type and exploits the dependence of the threshold voltage on transistor size. Measurements performed over a large sample population of 60 chips from two separate batches show a standard deviation of only 0.29 mV. The mean variation of the reference voltage for V-DD ranging from 0.15 to 1.8 V is 359.5 mu V/V, whereas the mean variation of V-REF in the temperature range from 0 degrees C to 120 degrees C is 26.74 mu V/degrees C. The mean power consumption at 25 degrees C for V-DD = 0.15 V is 26.1 pW. The occupied area is 1200 mu m(2).", "paper_title": "A Sub-kT/q Voltage Reference Operating at 150 mV", "paper_id": "WOS:000358511300016"}
