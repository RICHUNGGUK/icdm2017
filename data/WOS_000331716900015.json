The ion behavior is governed by the kinetic Vlasov equation with the BGK collisional term in the four-dimensional phase space, and since the finite difference discretization on a tensor product grid is used, this equation becomes the most computationally challenging part of the scheme. To relax the complexity and memory consumption, an adaptive model reduction using the low-rank separation of variables, namely the Tensor Train format, is employed. The approach was verified via a prototype MATLAB implementation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the possibility of efficient separation of space and velocity variables, resulting in the solution storage reduction by a factor of order tens.
