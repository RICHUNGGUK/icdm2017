Such flows are characterized by strong variations in fluid properties with the temperature. A compressible, multi-phase, one-fluid formulation that accounts for the energy balance and variable thermodynamics properties of the fluid is described. A preconditioning method for low Mach number areas is presented. Cavitation phenomenon is modelled by two different liquid-vapour mixture equations of state (EOS). Mathematical and thermodynamic properties are studied. Numerical results are given for a Venturi geometry with freon R-114 fluid and comparisons are made with experimental data.
