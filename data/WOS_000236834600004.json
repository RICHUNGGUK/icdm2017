However, no work has been done concerning the efficient selection of the appropriate Web Service instance in terms of quality and performance factors at the moment of the Web Service consumption attempt. Such factors may include execution time and response time. The proposed approach adaptively selects the most efficient WS among possible different alternatives with real-time, optimized and countable factors-parameters. Implementation issues and case study experiments are presented along with the corresponding results. Additionally, an optimal selection algorithm for series of Web Services requests is proposed. Finally, conclusions and future steps are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
