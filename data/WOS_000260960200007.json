We assume that this is the result of remodelling to restore wall stress. We developed a numerical model to predict aneurysm expansion based on this assumption. In addition, we obtained aneurysm geometry of 11 patients from computed tomography angiographic images to obtain patient specific calculations. The assumption of a wall stress related expansion indeed resulted in a series of local expansions, adjusting global geometry in an exponential fashion similar as in patients. Furthermore, it revealed that location of peak wall stress changed over time. The assumptions of this model are discussed in detail in this manuscript, and the implications are related to literature findings.", "paper_title": "A numerical model to predict abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion based on local wall stress and stiffness", "paper_id": "WOS:000260960200007"}
