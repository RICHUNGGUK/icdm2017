This realistic model has been very useful for proposing original solutions to various pattern recognition problems (signature segmentation and veri. cation, handwriting analysis and synthesis, etc.). Most of these applications rely on the use of an efficient algorithm to extract the delta-lognormal parameters from real data with the best possible fit. In this paper, we compare two such algorithms: a deterministic one, based on nonlinear regression, and a Breeder Genetic algorithm. The performance of these two algorithms and of their combinations are compared using the same artificial database, composed of analytical delta-lognormal profiles and their noisy versions (20 dB SNR). In the free-noise case, the analysis of the experimental results shows that the deterministic approach leads to better results than the evolutionary one, while under the extremely noisy conditions selected, the evolutionary approach seems to be less sensitive to noise, but is nevertheless less successful than the deterministic search.", "paper_title": "Deterministic and evolutionary extraction of delta-lognormal parameters: Performance comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000250862300003"}
