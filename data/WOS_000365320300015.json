A novel state estimator is presented to estimate the network states. A new event-triggered transmission scheme is proposed to reduce unnecessary network traffic between the sensors and the estimator, where the sampled data is transmitted to the estimator only when the so-called \"event-triggered condition\" is satisfied. The purpose of the problem addressed is to design an estimator for the complex network such that the estimation error is ultimately bounded in mean square. By utilizing Lyapunov theory combined with the stochastic analysis approach, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the ultimate boundedness of the estimation error in mean square. Then, the desired estimator gain matrices are obtained via solving a convex problem. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the results.", "paper_title": "Event-Triggered State Estimation for Complex Networks With Mixed Time Delays via Sampled Data Information: The Continuous-Time Case", "paper_id": "WOS:000365320300015"}
