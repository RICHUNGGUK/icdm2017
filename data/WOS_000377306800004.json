In this letter, we explore the impact of coordinated transmission on the mean local delay and the energy efficiency, in a Poisson network model. Leveraging tools from point process theory, we derive analytical expressions of the mean local delay and the long-term energy efficiency, without and with coordinated transmission. We find that coordinated transmission greatly decreases the mean local delay and also improves the long-term energy efficiency under certain network configurations.", "paper_title": "On the Impact of Coordination on Local Delay and Energy Efficiency in Poisson Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000377306800004"}
