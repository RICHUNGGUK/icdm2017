The operational matrix of derivative for the cubic B-spline scaling functions is presented and is utilized to reduce the solution of nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation to the solution of algebraic equations. Illustrative examples are included to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the new techniques. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
