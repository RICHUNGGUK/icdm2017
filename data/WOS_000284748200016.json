Matlab (TM) is a worldwide standard in technical programming and computing, and its use is still growing; therefore, it is taught in many different university degree programs (Physics, Mathematics, Engineering, etc.). The course analyzed in this paper contains examples of different fields of knowledge to show the students the versatility and power of this tool. At the end of each course, which consists of 30 h, the students expressed their opinions about the content in a private opinion poll (questionnaire). The results of these opinion polls show that the methodology followed is considered appropriate and useful by the students who attended the course. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
