This method uses three different two-electrode AC discharges to extract the cell capacitances. The drive point capacitances of the cell with and without a two-electrode dark discharge were measured, and the cell capacitances were extracted from them. The extracted cell capacitances agree well with those obtained from a three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation. Electrical equivalent circuits of the plasma were constructed using Jung's model [Y.K. Jung, J.W. Seo, Y.H. Kim, B.K. Kang, Circuit model for two-electrode AC discharge, IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci., 31(3), pp. 362-368, 2003.] and the measured firing voltages. A circuit model for the cell was constructed using the cell capacitances and the equivalent circuits for the plasma. The results of electrical simulation using this circuit model agree well with the measurements, indicating that the presented circuit model would be useful for simulating the electrical behaviors of a three-electrode AC PDP.
