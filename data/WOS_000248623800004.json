As such, a cascade of in vitro and in vivo assays have been developed to filter compounds with hERG inhibitory activity. Quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models are used at the very earliest part of this cascade to eliminate compounds that are likely to have this undesirable activity prior to synthesis. Here a new QSAR technique based on the one-dimensional representation is described in the context of the development of a model to predict hERG inhibition. The model is shown to perform close to the limits of the quality of the data used for model building. In order to make optimal use of the available data, a general robust mathematical scheme was developed and is described to simultaneously incorporate quantitative data, such as IC50 = 50 nM, and qualitative data, such as inactive or IC50 > 30 mu M into QSAR models without discarding any experimental information.", "paper_title": "Understanding hERG inhibition with QSAR models based on a one-dimensional molecular representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000248623800004"}
