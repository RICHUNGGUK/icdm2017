This work proposes a novel method applied to moving images that takes into account the human visual system and leads to an improved perception of such details. To this end, we display images rapidly varying over time along a given trajectory on a high refresh rate display. Due to the retinal integration time the information is fused and yields apparent super-resolution pixels on a conventional-resolution display. We discuss how to find optimal temporal pixel variations based on linear eye-movement and image content and extend our solution to arbitrary trajectories. This step involves an efficient method to predict and successfully treat potentially visible flickering. Finally, we evaluate the resolution enhancement in a perceptual study that shows that significant improvements can be achieved both for computer generated images and photographs.", "paper_title": "Apparent Display Resolution Enhancement for Moving Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000279806600082"}
