With this in mind, in this work we used some of the technologies developed in the context of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) to provide a proof of concept of the possible synergy between Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and Service Orientation. In particular, we present a DSL toolkit for modeling the structural part of Abstract Service Descriptions (ASDs) and the reasoning mechanism that assesses whether two versions of a service are compatible with respect to its consumers.", "paper_title": "Towards Model-Driven Engineering Support for Service Evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000313207000002"}
