However, the low plasticity of this alloy causes problems during wire drawing. A numerical model of the drawing process can be used to optimize the deformation parameters. Research has shown that fractures in MgCa0.8 start within grain boundaries; therefore, a model of the drawing process should consider this mechanism. The main purpose of this work is to develop a micro-scale numerical model of fracture in MgCa0.8 using the boundary element method (BEM). Additionally, the potential for using the developed BEM model as a part of the multi-scale model of the drawing process is investigated.
