In order to rank the countries, a novel two-dimensional method is proposed, which is inspired by the H-index and other methods based on quality and quantity measures. The countries data are represented in a \"quantity-quality diagram\", and partitioned by a conventional statistical algorithm into three clusters, members of which are rather the same in all of the basic sciences. The results offer a new perspective on the global positions of countries with regards to their scientific output.", "paper_title": "A two-dimensional approach to evaluate the scientific production of countries (case study: the basic sciences)", "paper_id": "WOS:000278695500008"}
