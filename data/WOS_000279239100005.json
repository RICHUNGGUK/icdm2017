By geometric randomization of the option maturity, we transform the n-steps backward recursion that arises in option pricing into an integral equation. The option price is then obtained solving n independent integral equations by a suitable quadrature method. Since the integral equations are mutually independent, we can exploit the potentiality of a grid computing architecture. The primary performance disadvantage of grids is the slow communication speeds between nodes. However, our algorithm is well-suited for grid computing since the integral equations can be solved in parallel, without the need to communicate intermediate results between processors. Moreover, numerical experiments on a cluster architecture show the good scalability properties of our algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
