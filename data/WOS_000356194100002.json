The L-0 norm directly measures the sparsity of a solution, and we observe that many common objects can be defined as piecewise smooth surfaces with a small number of features. Hence, we demonstrate how to apply an L-0 optimization directly to point clouds, which produces sparser solutions and sharper surfaces than either the L-1 or L-2 norm. Our method can faithfully recover sharp features while at the same time smoothing the remaining regions even in the presence of large amounts of noise. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
