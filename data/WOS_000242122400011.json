By exchanging a sequence of proposals in the negotiation stage, a service provider and a consumer try to establish a formal contract, to specify agreed terms on the service, particularly terms on non-functional aspects. To react to an ever-changing environment, flexible negotiation strategies that can make adjustable rates of concession should be adopted. This paper presents such flexible strategies for Web Services negotiation. In a negotiation round, the negotiation strategies first examine the environment situations by evaluating certain factors, which include time, resources, number of counterparts and current proposals from the counterparts. For each factor, there is a corresponding function that suggests the amount of concession in terms of that factor. Then considering the importance of each service attribute, the target concession per attribute is determined. As a final step, a set of experimental tests is executed to evaluate the performance of the negotiation strategies.", "paper_title": "Flexible decision making in web services negotiation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122400011"}
