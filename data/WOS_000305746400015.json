Three main perspectives are identified in this roadmap, and defined to comprehensively address relevant dimensions of the ePAL environment. These three perspectives consist of: (1) the technological perspective that addresses the needed technology and the support services, (2) the societal perspective that addresses both the human factors and the societal aspects, and (3) the organizational perspective that addresses both the economic / managerial and governmental aspects of these environments. This document however aims to zoom in on the technological perspective of the roadmap. Following a brief description of the three main perspectives of the ePAL environment, it introduces the four main ICT research and development areas that are identified for strengthening and realization of active ageing. The technological perspective of the ePAL's vision constitutes a substantial part of the roadmap recommendations. This article further addresses the state of the art in each of these four areas and exemplifies their application needs in the ePAL environment.", "paper_title": "Technological research plan for active ageing", "paper_id": "WOS:000305746400015"}
