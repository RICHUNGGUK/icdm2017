Our approach relies on the combination of two complementary analyses. First, the image-based analysis exploits visual clues to select the regions of interest in the document. Second, the textual-based analysis searches for name patterns and low-level word textual features. Both analyses are then combined at the word level through a neural network fusion scheme. Reported results on degraded documents such as facsimile and photocopied technical journals demonstrate the interest of the combined approach.", "paper_title": "Automatic name extraction from degraded document images", "paper_id": "WOS:000240830900008"}
