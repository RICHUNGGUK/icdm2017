The main objective of this paper is to develop a novel EP algorithm for the robust stability analysis of interval neutral delay-differential systems. Two main results are obtained in this paper. First a delay-dependent criterion is derived for ensuring the stability of degenerate neutral time-delay systems, and then by solving some optimization problems, which will be defined later, the robust stability of interval neutral delay-differential systems can be guaranteed. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
