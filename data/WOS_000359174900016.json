The first reaction in this domino process, which is also the rate-determining step, is a complete regioselective [3 + 2] cycloaddition (32CA) reaction associated with the nucleophilic attack of C5 carbon atom of enamine 7 on the C3 carbon atom of nitrile imine 6, leading to cycloadduct 8. The second reaction is a rapid acid/base catalysed stepwise elimination reaction of the morpholine 9 from cycloadduct 8 affording celecoxibe 3. The results also show that neither molecular mechanism of reaction nor activation barriers are considerably affected by the inclusion of solvent. The calculated relative Gibbs free energies as well as local reactivity indices obtained using the calculated Parr functions explain the complete regioselective fashion provided by the 32CA reaction under consideration in excellent agreement with the experimental findings.
