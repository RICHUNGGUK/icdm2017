This paper presents an approach to timing analysis of SBSs expressed by UML interaction models. The approach considers more general and expressive timing constraints in UML sequence diagrams (SDs), and gives a solution to the reachability analysis, constraint conformance analysis and bounded delay analysis problems, which reduces these problems into linear programs. With the synchronous interpretation of the SD compositions, the timing analysis algorithms in the approach form a decision procedure for a class of SBSs where any loop in any path is time-independent of the other parts in the path. These algorithms are also a semi-decision procedure for general SBSs with both the synchronous and asynchronous composition semantics. The approach also supports bounded timing analysis of SBSs, which investigates all the paths in the bound limit one by one, and performs the timing analysis for each finite path by linear programming. A tool prototype has been developed to support this approach.
