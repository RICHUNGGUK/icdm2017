First, based on a new Lyapunov functional, we present a sufficient condition guaranteeing that the resulting closed-loop system is robustly stable and satisfies a prescribed H-infinity performance level. The Lyapunov functional used here depends on not only the fuzzy basis function but on the lower and upper bounds of the time-varying delay as well. Second, two classes of delay-dependent conditions for the existence of the concerned H-infinity fuzzy controllers are given in terms of relaxed linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and a desired controller can be designed by using the solutions to these LMIs. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.", "paper_title": "Delay-Dependent Robust H-infinity Control for Uncertain Discrete-Time Fuzzy Systems With Time-Varying Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000268527100006"}
