An ontology represents a set of concepts that are commonly shared and agreed to by all parties in a particular domain. Here, we introduce generic and specific trust ontologies. These ontologies include the following: an agent trust ontology and trustworthiness; agents include sellers, service providers, Web sites, brokers, shops, suppliers, buyers, or reviewers. A services trust ontology and trustworthiness assists in measuring the quality of service that agents provide in the service-oriented environment such as sales, orders, track and trace, warehousing, logistics, education, governance, advertising, entertainment, trading, online databases, virtual community services, security, information services, opinions, and e-reviews. A goods or products trust ontology and trustworthiness is useful for measuring the quality of products such as commercial products, information products, entertainment products, or second-hand products. We present a trust ontology that is suitable for all types of agents that exist in the service-oriented environment. As agent trust is measured through the quality of goods and services, we introduce two additional distinct concepts of service trust ontology and product trust ontology.
