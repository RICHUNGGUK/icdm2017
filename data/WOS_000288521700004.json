This paper presents an approach for modeling, simulation and analysis of aircraft arresting system using bond graphs for electronically controlled, hydraulically operated multi disc friction type of braking arrangement. A detailed dynamic model of the aircraft arrester system is modeled through bond graphs in which the various sub-systems of the total system are created as capsules (sub-system objects). Detailed analysis for each of these sub-systems is carried out and then final results are obtained. The simulation is carried out for different aircraft weights and landing speeds.
