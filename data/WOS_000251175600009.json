We proposed quantum algorithm to solve the problem by dividing the database binarily and then use a probabilistic veri. er algorithm to determine if the item is within one part of the divided database. We analyzed the computational complexity of this algorithm, and found that in general, the number of steps is proportional to that in the standard Grover algorithm. However in some cases, it is less than that of the Grover algorithm.", "paper_title": "Verifier-based algorithm for unsorted database search problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000251175600009"}
