A watermark image is embedded by modifying the integral invariants of some of the vertices. In order to modify the integral invariants, the positions of a vertex and its neighbors are shifted. To extract the watermark, all the vertices are tested for the embedded information, and this information is combined to recover the watermark image. The number of parts of the watermark image that can be recovered will determine the authentication decision. Experimental tests show that this method is robust against normal use modifications introduced by rigid transformations, format conversions, rounding errors, etc., and can be used to test for malicious attacks such as mesh editing and cropping. An additional contribution of this paper is a new algorithm for computing two kinds of integral invariants.", "paper_title": "A New Watermarking Method for 3D Models Based on Integral Invariants", "paper_id": "WOS:000262317200010"}
