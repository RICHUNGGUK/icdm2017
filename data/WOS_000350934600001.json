However, existing sparse representation based methods often only highlight the boundaries of salient object rather than the whole object, especially for relatively large object. In this paper, we propose a new saliency method. Given an image, we first hierarchically segment it into fine superpixels and coarse segments. Next, we use the center-remaining strategy at the coarse scale to build the dictionary to reconstruct the fine superpixels, i.e., for a segment, each superpixel it contains is described as the weighted combination of all the superpixels in the remaining segments. We average the reconstruction errors in a segment as its initial saliency. The hierarchical treatment is helpful to overcome the above problem. Finally, we further refine saliency result by using a ranking-based inference model and define a multi-feature fitting potential to describe the interaction among multiple features. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and recall. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
