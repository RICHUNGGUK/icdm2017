A linear program max{cx vertical bar Ax = b, x >= 0} is said to be sign-solvable if the set of sign patterns of the optimal solutions is uniquely determined by the sign patterns of A, b, and c. It turns out to be NP-hard to decide whether a given linear program is sign-solvable or not. We then introduce a class of sign-solvable linear programs in terms of totally sign-nonsingular matrices, which can be recognized in polynomial time. For a linear program in this class, we devise an efficient combinatorial algorithm to obtain the sign pattern of an optimal solution from the sign patterns of A, b, and c. The algorithm runs in O(m gamma) time, where m is the number of rows of A and gamma is the number of all nonzero entries in A, b, and c.", "paper_title": "Solving linear programs from sign patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000254805300009"}
