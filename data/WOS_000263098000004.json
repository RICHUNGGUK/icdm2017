This aggravates the need for a socio-technical perspective for requirements engineering, which allows for modelling and analyzing the composition and interaction of hardware and software components with human and organizational actors. In this setting, alternative requirements models have to be evaluated and selected finding a right trade-off between the technical and social dimensions. To address this problem, we propose a tool-supported process of requirements analysis for socio-technical systems, which adopts planning techniques for exploring the space of requirements alternatives and a number of social criteria for their evaluation. We illustrate the proposed approach with the help of a case study, conducted within the context of an EU project.", "paper_title": "Designing socio-technical systems: from stakeholder goals to social networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000263098000004"}
