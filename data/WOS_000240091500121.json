A total of 30 fault symptoms were simulated with the variations in the four process parameters. Both discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) and continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) were utilized to filter the sensor information. Three types of diagnosis models (raw-, DWT-, and CWT-based models) were constructed. The comparisons revealed that the improvement in the prediction performance of DWT and CWT data models over the raw data model were about 42% and 30%, respectively.", "paper_title": "Diagnosis model of radio frequency impedance matching in plasma equipment by using neural network and wavelets", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500121"}
