However the problem has arisen that speedup is limited by the bandwidth of the main memory on large-scale analysis. As described in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm and implement FDTD using it. We compared the novel algorithm with results obtained using region segmentation, thereby demonstrating that the proposed algorithm has shorter calculation time than that provided by region segmentation.", "paper_title": "Acceleration of FDTD Method Using a Novel Algorithm on the Cell BE", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304900006"}
