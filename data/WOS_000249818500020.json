It is a compilation of various methods, which allows the user (1) to control data quality by detecting biases with a large number of visual representations, (2) to pre-process data ( filtering and normalization) and (3) to carry out differential analyses. MAnGO is not only a 'turn-key' tool, oriented towards biologists but also a flexible and adaptable R script oriented towards bioinformaticians.
