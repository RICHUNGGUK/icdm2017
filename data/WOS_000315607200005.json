Suppose a company has managed a chain of owned warehouses, and now this company is in need of acquiring some new and profitable warehouse adding to its operation chain. A key business decisions here is how to choose the most profitable warehouses from a number of potential warehouses. In reality, the challenge is that the future profitability is unpredictable. Therefore, it is infeasible to rank potential warehouses directly for choice. To address such a problem, this paper proposes a new rule-based decision model. This model includes the following characteristics: (i) decision information is provided via interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy values; (ii) multiple experts as a group of decision makers are involved; (iii) both subjective evaluations from experts and objective data of historical profitability are employed; (iv) both certain and uncertain information are exploited. The core decision mechanism is, making use of uncertain information of owned warehouses, to induce a collection of \"if ... then ...\" rules, and subsequently to exploit these rules for prediction of preference orders of all potential warehouses. Therein, we develop and integrate multiple techniques for the purposes of (a) aggregation of uncertain information; (b) construction of pairwise comparison; (c) induction of certain and uncertain rules; and (d) decision rules exploitation. We finally elaborate our discussion with a numerical example illustrating the application of the proposed decision mechanism to supply-chain domain problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
