Two important integral inequalities that include Jensen's inequality as a special case are developed. By constructing proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing inequality technique, several delay-distribution-dependent sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the global asymptotic and exponential stability of the addressed neural networks. These conditions are expressed in terms of complex-valued LMIs, which can be checked numerically using the effective YALMIP toolbox in MATLAB. An example with simulations is given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
