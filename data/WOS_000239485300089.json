Firstly we detect the Putamen region slice by slice using I D wavelet feature extraction. Then fuzzy c-means technology is combined with edge detection to segment the objects inside the Putamen region. Finally features are extracted from the segmented objects and fed into a neural network classifier in order to identify the Putamen shape. Experiment shows the segmentation results to be accurate and efficient.", "paper_title": "Automatic segmentation of putamen from brain MRI", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300089"}
