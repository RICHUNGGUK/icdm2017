During the global adaptation, a coarse matching is used for adjusting the facial contour and five sense organs according to the correspondence of feature points both in 2D facial image and 3D model. An interpolation is processed on the global adjusted 3D model for a fine matching, which forms the local adaptation. A personalized facial sketch generation method is present based on the similar idea of 3D facial model adaptation. By comparison between the feature points of specific person's face and those of a predefined generic face, metamorphosis can be drawn for generating a personalized cartoon facial sketch. Two systems are built, and face reconstruction and sketch results show that proposed method is efficient and desirable.", "paper_title": "Image based active model adaptation method for face reconstruction and sketch generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300109"}
