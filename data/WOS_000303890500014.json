Wide spread deployment and years of experience running the protocol have motivated continuous improvements in its operation as the nature and demands of the routing infrastructures have changed. Modern routing domains need to maintain a very high level of service availability. Hence, OSPF needs to achieve fast convergence to topology changes. Also, the ever-growing size of routing domains, and possible presence of wireless mobile adhoc network (MANET) components, requires highly scalable operation on part of OSPF to avoid routing instability. Recent years have seen significant efforts aimed at improving OSPF's convergence speed as well as scalability and extending OSPF to achieve seamless integration of mobile adhoc networks with conventional wired networks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these efforts.", "paper_title": "Improving Convergence Speed and Scalability in OSPF: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000303890500014"}
