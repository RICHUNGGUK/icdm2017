The video text information can facilitate content based video analysis, indexing and retrieval. Video sequences are usually compressed before storage and transmission. A basic step of text-based applications is text detection and localization. In this paper, an overlaid text detection and localization method is proposed for H.264/AVC compressed videos by using the integer discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of intra-frames. The main contributions of this paper are in the following two aspects: 1) coarse text blocks detection using block sizes and quantization parameters adaptive thresholds; 2) text line localization according to the characteristics of text in intra frames of H.264/AVC compressed domain. Comparisons are made with the pixel domain based text detection method for the H.264/AVC compressed video. Text detection results on five H.264/AVC video sequences under various qualities show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Video text detection and localization in intra-frames of H.264/AVC compressed video", "paper_id": "WOS:000337156500006"}
