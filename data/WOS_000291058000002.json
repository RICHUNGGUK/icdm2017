G23FM includes different techniques to generate finite element grids that maintain the geometric integrity of input surfaces, and geologic data and produce optimal triangular/tetrahedral grids for flow and transport simulations. G23FM generates grid for two-dimensional cross-sections, represents faults and fractures, for three-dimensional fractured media, and has the capability of including finer grids. Different examples are presented to illustrate some of the main features of G23FM.", "paper_title": "G23FM: a tool for meshing complex geological media", "paper_id": "WOS:000291058000002"}
