We summarize the state of art feature detectors and descriptors in visual odometry field and divide them based on their implemented details. We present three new evaluation criterions (Detection Chain Repeatability, Average Detection Chain Re-projection Error and Matching Chain Precision) of feature detectors and descriptors. We also design experiments to evaluate the performance of different detectors and descriptors from the robustness, precision and cost of computation.
