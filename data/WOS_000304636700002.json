The massively separated flow around a square cylinder, which is a classical test case, is selected. Three popular turbulence models are selected, i.e. standard low-Reynolds k-epsilon model, k-omega model and a realizable k-epsilon model. The turbulent viscosity ratio, which is observed to vary a lot according to different authors in this configuration, is taken as an uncertain parameter to illustrate the potential applications of the present methodology. It is found that the realizable k-epsilon model behaves quite stably, and predicts nearly consistent results in all simulations. In contrast, the other two models are very sensitive to random turbulent inflow condition in both cases, especially the standard k-omega model, resulting in a significant weakness of usual validation procedures for turbulence models.
