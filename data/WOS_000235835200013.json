Because of the complexity of color perception, there is no single color space which can represent various properties of color perception and provide a consistent retrieval capability in indexing oil paintings. We propose a new color space for indexing and retrieving oil paintings, which is based on pigment color mixing and the psychology of seeing. The new space includes seven color elements: pure color, white, black, tint, tone, shade and grey. Finally, six semantic query categories are defined in accordance with six color arrangements in oil paintings.", "paper_title": "Indexing and retrieving oil paintings using style information", "paper_id": "WOS:000235835200013"}
