Applications with different goals steer these sensors in different directions. Although being expensive to deploy and maintain, existing steerable sensor networks allow only a single application to control them due to the slow speed of their mechanical actuators. To address the problem, we design MultiSense to enable fine-grained multiplexing by (1) exposing a virtual sensor to each application and (2) optimizing the time to context-switch between virtual sensors and satisfy requests. We implement MultiSense in Xen, a widely used virtualization platform, and explore how well proportional-share scheduling, along with extensions for state restoration, request batching and merging, and anticipatory scheduling, satisfies the unique requirements of steerable sensors. We present experiments for pan-tilt-zoom cameras and weather radars that show MultiSense efficiently isolates the performance of virtual sensors, allowing concurrent applications to satisfy conflicting goals. As one example, we enable a tracking application to photograph an object moving at nearly 3 mph every 23 ft along its trajectory at a distance of 300 ft, while supporting a security application that photographs a fixed point every 3 s.", "paper_title": "MultiSense: proportional-share for mechanically steerable sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000309341800005"}
