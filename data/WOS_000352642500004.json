VaR forecast estimation involves the evaluation of conditional quantiles based on the currently available information. Recent advances in VaR evaluation incorporate conditional variance into the quantile estimation, which yields the conditional autoregressive VaR (CAViaR) models. However, uncertainty with regard to model selection in CAViaR model estimators raises the issue of identifying the better quantile predictor via averaging. In this study, we propose a quasi-Bayesian model averaging method that generates combinations of conditional VaR estimators based on single CAViaR models. This approach provides us a basis for comparing single CAViaR models against averaged ones for their ability to forecast VaR. We illustrate this method using simulated and financial daily return data series. The results demonstrate significant findings with regard to the use of averaged conditional VaR estimates when forecasting quantile risk.", "paper_title": "A quasi-Bayesian model averaging approach for conditional quantile models", "paper_id": "WOS:000352642500004"}
