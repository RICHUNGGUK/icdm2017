This work is motivated by a real-life problem faced by a major transporter in Norway. The heuristic uses stochastic information during the solution process. The new method is shown to be superior to previous heuristics that are uniquely based on a pure dynamic approach. The proposed heuristic is well suited to problems containing stochastic customers, stochastic demands, or both.
