They are traditionally taken as noises and need to be removed properly. To achieve this, two intuitive and crucial kinds of information-the textual information and the visual information of web pages-is considered in this paper. Accordingly, Text Density and Visual Importance are defined for the Document Object Model (DOM) nodes of a web page. Furthermore, a content extraction method with these measured values is proposed. It is a fast, accurate and general method for extracting content from diverse web pages. And with the employment of DOM nodes, the original structure of the web page can be preserved. Evaluated with the CleanEval benchmark and with randomly selected pages from well-known Web sites, where various web domains and styles are tested, the effect of the method is demonstrated. The average F1-scores with our method were 8.7 % higher than the best scores among several alternative methods.", "paper_title": "A hybrid approach for content extraction with text density and visual importance of DOM nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000347286900004"}
