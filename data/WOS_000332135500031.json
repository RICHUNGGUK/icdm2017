The behavior of the 1WPM is fully proved through a comparison with AM-AM and AM-PM measured data. The results show that this simulation technique is able to prove the effectiveness of the 1VIPM implementation as behavioural model for high power radiofrequency amplifiers. The system is able to compensate perturbations caused by modern communication systems. Design/methodology/approach - The implementation uses Matlab-Simulink, and its digital signal processing (DSP) builder. The first stage allows developing the model in Matlab using the DSP builder blockset through the signal compiler block. Then, the design is downloaded to the DSP board. Findings - The paper demonstrates a proper behavior of the MPM as a truncation of the Volterra series, with respect to different inputs. This is a key point, because the series truncations allow first to implement this model in real time and second to obtain a correct precision, for instance when modeling amplification of digital signals in high frequency. Originality/value - The global system approach permits to easily develop, simulate, and validate a wireless system. The efficiency of a complete connected solution based on Agilent Technologies tools, combining simulations and measurements under true operating conditions, seems to be clearly demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Flexible test bed for the behavioural modelling of power amplifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000332135500031"}
