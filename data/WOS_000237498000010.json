Current database management system provides some security control mechanisms to ensure the data security such as access control and password protection. However, these mechanisms are not sufficient to ensure database security, This research paper presents a pinion-rack encryption/decryption model (P-R model) and its implementation issues using the field of a record from a database as the basic encryption granularity. Based on the P-R model, this paper also presents a technique of hiding concomitant information in the information system, which can be used to detect the intrusion from illegal users. The P-R model can enhance the ability to identify attacks, accelerate encryption/decryption speed, reduce response time and improve real-time efficiency by cutting the length of keys and minimizing the number of necessary encryption operations. This research paper also proposes a \"keeping separately and triggering simultaneously\" key management strategy to reduce the possibility of modifying sensitive data purposely by legal users.", "paper_title": "Illegal intrusion detection based on hidden information database", "paper_id": "WOS:000237498000010"}
