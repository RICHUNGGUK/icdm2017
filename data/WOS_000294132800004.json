We show that an arbitrary polyphase matrix of a wavelet bi-frame can be factorized into a series of lifting steps. Based on the proposed factorization, we present a general construction of bi-frames. Especially, we give an explicit formula to construct the bi-frames of two scaling and two generators with symmetry and one vanishing moment. This paper does not involve many theories of wavelet frames in mathematics, but focuses on the algebraic issues related to Laurent polynomials, which are efficient expressions in redundant filter banks associated with wavelet frames. As an extension of the classical two-channel filter bank, the redundant filter bank is more complicated but also more flexible. Furthermore, we present an algorithm to increase the number of vanishing moments to arbitrary order by lifting, which is iterated and is straightforward in implementation.", "paper_title": "The Lifting Factorization and Construction of Wavelet Bi-Frames With Arbitrary Generators and Scaling", "paper_id": "WOS:000294132800004"}
