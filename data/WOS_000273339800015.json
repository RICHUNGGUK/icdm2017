This brief analyzes the convergence and stability of a class of self-stabilizing MCA algorithms via a deterministic discrete-time (DDT) method. Some sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the convergence of these learning algorithms. Simulations are carried out to further illustrate the theoretical results achieved. It can be concluded that these self-stabilizing algorithms can efficiently extract the minor component (MC), and they outperform some existing MCA methods.", "paper_title": "On the Discrete-Time Dynamics of a Class of Self-Stabilizing MCA Extraction Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000273339800015"}
