In a case study of a project of the concurrent realisation of products (components for the automotive industry), it is shown how the requirements of quality standards for the automotive industry can be integrated in processes of the concurrent product realisation project, based on track-and-loop principle and three strategies: parallelness, standardisation and integration. This article gives an overview of quality-related standards in the automotive industry, the principles of sequential and concurrent product realisation and the course of concurrent product realisation and quality assurance of products in the automotive industry. Five loops of concurrent product realisation processes are defined for the automotive industry, as well as seven milestones of advanced product quality planning. A course of concurrent realisation and quality assurance of products in the automotive industry is shown in the case of the concurrent realisation of a car component.", "paper_title": "Concurrent realisation and quality assurance of products in the automotive industry", "paper_id": "WOS:000336265000006"}
