A multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) shows that the multifractality nature of TEPIX returns time series is due to both fatness of the probability density function of returns and long range correlations between them. MF-DFA results help us to understand how genetic algorithm and kernel smoothing methods act. Then we utilize a recently developed genetic algorithm for carrying out successful forecasts of the trend in financial time series and deriving a functional form of Tehran price index (TEPIX) that best approximates the time variability of it. The final model is mainly dominated by a linear relationship with the most recent past value, while contributions from nonlinear terms to the total forecasting performance are rather small.", "paper_title": "Forecasting smoothed non-stationary time series using genetic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000251548700012"}
