In this work, we study the complexity of two special but natural cases of identity testing-first is a case of depth-3 PIT, the other of depth-4 PIT. Our first problem is a vast generalization of verifying whether a bounded top fan-in depth-3 circuit equals a sparse polynomial (given as a sum of monomial terms). Formally, given a depth-3 circuit C, having constant many general product gates and arbitrarily many semidiagonal product gates test whether the output of C is identically zero. A semidiagonal product gate in C computes a product of the form , where m is a monomial, l (i) is a linear polynomial, and b is a constant. We give a deterministic polynomial time test, along with the computation of leading monomials of semidiagonal circuits over local rings. The second problem is on verifying a given sparse polynomial factorization, which is a classical question (von zur Gathen, FOCS 1983): Given multivariate sparse polynomials f, g1, . . . , gt explicitly check whether . For the special case when every gi is a sum of univariate polynomials, we give a deterministic polynomial time test. We characterize the factors of such g (i) 's and even show how to test the divisibility of f by the powers of such polynomials. The common tools used are Chinese remaindering and dual representation. The dual representation of polynomials (Saxena, ICALP 2008) is a technique to express a product-of-sums of univariates as a sum-ofproducts of univariates. We generalize this technique by combining it with a generalized Chinese remaindering to solve these two problems (over any field).", "paper_title": "A Case of Depth-3 Identity Testing, Sparse Factorization and Duality", "paper_id": "WOS:000316489300002"}
