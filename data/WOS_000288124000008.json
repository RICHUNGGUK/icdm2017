The proposed procedure is based on solving the full set of Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain, and enables the exact computation of very near fields at the surface of the grounding grid, as well as far fields, by simple and accurate closed-form expressions for solving Sommerfeld integrals. In addition, the soil ionization is easily considered in the proposed method. The frequency domain responses are converted to the time domain by fast inverse Laplace transform. The results are validated and have shown acceptable accuracy.", "paper_title": "Calculating the transient behavior of grounding systems using inverse Laplace transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000288124000008"}
