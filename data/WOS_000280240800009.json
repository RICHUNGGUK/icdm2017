Two algorithms are used in this integer IDCT improvement. One is common factor extraction which extracts the complicated common factors from transform kernel to scale; the other is two-stage scale which splits a more than 16-bit scale into two less than 16-bit scales. With the two algorithms, high-accuracy integer IDCT is implemented in lower complexity. The experimental results show that the proposed transform exceeds the requirements of IEEE1180-1990 significantly (about 10 times). The results of the proposed IDCT implemented into MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 decoders instead of original 64-bit floating-point IDCT also show that it reduces the error drifting of decoders efficiently.", "paper_title": "Error-resistance and Low-complexity Integer Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000280240800009"}
