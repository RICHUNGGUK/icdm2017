Smaller disturbances or an oscillation of the body are typical for a walking robot and must be addressed by an appropriate sensor feedback. To this end, this paper proposes a novel observer fusing joint angle sensors and force sensing resistors. This new method of sensor feedback in a preview control system balances the walk by damping those disturbances and oscillations of the body. Moreover, novel stabilizing methods for defining reference trajectories for the zero moment point and limbs are examined.", "paper_title": "Observer based biped walking control, a sensor fusion approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000319452000004"}
