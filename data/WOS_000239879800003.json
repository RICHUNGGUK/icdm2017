This concept will concern 'isolated systems' in which the part supplying is made difficult because of the specific environment which is not really adapted and for which the storage of spare parts implies space constraints incompatible with the size of such systems. The quick spare parts manufacturing is made possible by developing new quick manufacturing technologies about to be mature today and using e-maintenance supports. The implementation of those technologies allows reproducing the defective unit, which needs to be replaced in a short time and according to the requirements.
