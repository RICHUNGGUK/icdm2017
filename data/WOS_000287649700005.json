It may be seen from simulation results in this work that the traditional filtering method based on linear measurement may not provide a reliable solution to this problem due to the existence of the nonlinear characteristic of sensors. In the system under consideration, there exist time-varying parameter uncertainties, and state and external-disturbance-dependent noise. Robust filters are constructed for both continuous and discrete stochastic systems, such that the resultant filtering error systems are robustly stochastically stable with a prescribed H-infinity-disturbance attenuation performance. Finally, some simulation results with deterministic or stochastic disturbance signals are given to illustrate the proposed method.", "paper_title": "H-infinity filtering for uncertain stochastic systems subject to sensor nonlinearities", "paper_id": "WOS:000287649700005"}
