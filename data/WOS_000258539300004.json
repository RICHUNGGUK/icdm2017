In telecom world, JAIN-SLEE (JAIN Service Logic Execution Environment) is an emerging standard specification for Java service platforms targeted to host value added services, composed of telecom and IT services. In this paper we describe StarSLEE platform which extends JAIN-SLEE in order to compose JAIN-SLEE services with Web services and the StarSCE service creation environment which allows exporting value added services as communication web services, and we analyze open issues that must be addressed to introduce Web Services in new telecom service platforms.", "paper_title": "Communication web services and JAIN-SLEE integration challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000258539300004"}
