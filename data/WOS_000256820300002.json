The proposal is based on a classical indexing mechanism for numerical crisp data, B+-tree, which is implemented in most commercial database management systems (DBMS). This makes the proposed technique a good candidate for integration in a fuzzy DBMS when it is developed as an extension of a crisp DBMS. The efficiency of the proposal is contrasted with another indexing method for similar data and queries, G-tree, which is specifically designed to index multidimensional data. Results show that the proposal performance is similar to and more stable than the measured for G-tree when used for indexing fuzzy numbers. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
