By studying the intrinsic relationship between system throughput and fairness, a performance evaluation problem for packet scheduling algorithms in a wireless system is formulated. Through the use of nonlinear programming method, the performance evaluation framework for weighted-type packet scheduling algorithms can be established. The performances of some typical packet scheduling algorithms for multiuser wireless communications are also evaluated in this framework as examples.
