This method is based on the detection of perceptual landmarks, which are scale invariant. These landmarks and the parts between them are transformed into a symbolic representation. Shapes are mapped into symbol sequences and a database of shapes is mapped into a set of symbol sequences and therefore it is possible to use support vector machines for categorization. The method here proposed has been evaluated on silhouettes database and achieved the highest recognition result reported with a score of 97.85% for the MPEG-7 shape database.", "paper_title": "Shape categorization using string kernels", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100032"}
