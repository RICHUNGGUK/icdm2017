The update interval of most pages database is almost one month. This condition has not changed for many years. Coverage and update problems have become the bottleneck problem of current web search engine. To solve these problems, a new system, search engine based on DNS is proposed in this paper. This system adopts the layered distributed architecture like DNS, which is different from any current commercial search engine. In theory, this system can cover all the web pages on Internet. Its update interval could even be one day. The original idea, detailed content and implementation of this system all are introduced in this paper. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
