Re = 3900, 10,000 and 20,000, based on the cylinder diameter. A mixed finite-element/finite-volume discretization on unstructured grids is used. The separation between the largest and the smallest resolved scales is obtained through a variational projection operator and finite-volume cell agglomeration. The WALE subgrid scale model is used to account for the effects of the unresolved scales; in the VMS approach, it is only added to the smallest resolved ones. The capability of this methodology to accurately predict the aerodynamic forces acting on the cylinder and in capturing the flow features are evaluated for the different Reynolds numbers considered. The sensitivity of the results to different simulation parameters, viz, agglomeration level and numerical viscosity, is also investigated at Re = 20,000. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
