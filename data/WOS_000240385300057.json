The proposed algorithm when compared with conventional Fisherface method and ULDA+PCA method has an improved recognition rate and a decrease of computational load for face images with high resolutions. In the proposed technique, the face images are divided into smaller sub-images by 2-D DWT and the uncorrelated linear discriminant analysis is applied to approximations sub-images. The time-cost of the proposed method is greatly reduced and recognition rates ranging between 95% and 97.5% are obtained on the ORL database. An average error rate of 1.4% is obtained with the experiments on the NUST603 database. In addition, the effect of number of discriminant vectors on the recognition system is systematically discussed.", "paper_title": "When uncorrelated linear discriminant analysis are combined with wavelets", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300057"}
