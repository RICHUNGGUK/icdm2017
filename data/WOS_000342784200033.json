In the proposed scheme, the received symbols through bad channel conditions are arranged in reverse order due to the performance of a system depending on the detection capability of the first layer. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme provides almost the same performance as the QRD-M. Moreover, the complexity is about 33.6% of the QRD-M for a bit error rate (BER) with 4x4 multi input multi output (MIMO) system.", "paper_title": "An Improved Low Complexity Detection Scheme in MIMO-OFDM Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784200033"}
