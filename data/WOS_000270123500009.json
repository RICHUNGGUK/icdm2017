This type of network is in fact an example of delay and disruption tolerant networks (DTNs). In this paper, we focus on a typical two-way street and analytically evaluate the maximum stable throughput and the average delay for packet forwarding along the street. To this end, we map the mobility patterns of the vehicles with different speeds onto suitable parameters of a BCMP queueing network and derive the location density of vehicles. Then, we employ another queueing network in order to model opportunistic multi-hop packet forwarding along the street with respect to the specifications of MAC and routing schemes. We propose a two-mode MAC scheme suitable for DTNs with predictable mobility patterns. We also consider the effect of vehicles' velocities and opportunistic relaying for routing schemes. In our analysis, we evaluate the average delay and the maximum stable throughput for the proposed MAC and routing schemes. In the last part of the paper, we show the efficiency of the proposed analytical approach by some numerical results and confirm our analysis by simulation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
