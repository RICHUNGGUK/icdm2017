These OSNs offer attractive means for digital social interactions and information sharing, but also raise a number of security and privacy issues. While OSNs allow users to restrict access to shared data, they currently do not provide any mechanism to enforce privacy concerns over data associated with multiple users. To this end, we propose an approach to enable the protection of shared data associated with multiple users in OSNs. We formulate an access control model to capture the essence of multiparty authorization requirements, along with a multiparty policy specification scheme and a policy enforcement mechanism. Besides, we present a logical representation of our access control model that allows us to leverage the features of existing logic solvers to perform various analysis tasks on our model. We also discuss a proof-of-concept prototype of our approach as part of an application in Facebook and provide usability study and system evaluation of our method.", "paper_title": "Multiparty Access Control for Online Social Networks: Model and Mechanisms", "paper_id": "WOS:000319461800014"}
