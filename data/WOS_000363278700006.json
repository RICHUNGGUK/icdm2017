Our main result is a polynomial upper bound on the mixing time of the single-site update chain known as the Glauber dynamics for planar graphs when k = Omega(Delta/log Delta). Our results can be partially extended to the more general case where the maximum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the graph is at most Delta(1-epsilon), for fixed epsilon > 0. The main challenge when k <= Delta + 1 is the possibility of \"frozen\" vertices, that is, vertices for which only one color is possible, conditioned on the colors of its neighbors. Indeed, when Delta = O(1), even a typical coloring can have a constant fraction of the vertices frozen. Our proofs rely on recent advances in techniques for bounding mixing time using \"local uniformity\" properties.
