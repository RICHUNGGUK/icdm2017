The proposed system uses geometric hashing of SURF key-points to index the palmprint into hash table and makes score level fusion of voting strategy based on geometric hashing and SURF score to identify the live palmprint. All ordered pairs of SURF key-points of the palmprint are scaled and mapped to a predefined coordinate system and all other points are similarity transformed. The new location after transformation serves as the index of the hash table. During identification, all ordered pairs of key-points of live palmprint are scaled and mapped to the coordinate system while remaining points are similarity transformed. A vote is casted to all images in the corresponding bins. Images having votes more than certain threshold are considered as candidate images of the live palmprint. SURF features of the live palmprint and the candidate images are compared for matching. Matching scores which are based on SURF key-points and vote of the corresponding candidate image are fused using weighted sum rule. The candidate image with the highest fused score is considered as the best match. The system is tested on IITK, CASIA and PolyU datasets. It has been observed that penetration rate of the proposed system is less than 30% for 0% bin miss rate (BMR) and has the identification accuracy of more than 97% for all three datasets. Further, the system is evaluated for robustness on downscaled and rotated. It has been found that the identification accuracy of the system for top best match is more than 90% for images downscaled up to 49% and accuracy is more than 85% when images are rotated at any angle.", "paper_title": "Score level fusion of voting strategy of geometric hashing and SURF for an efficient palmprint-based identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000323256000004"}
