Along with analysis of the problem of workflow composition and the description of related research in that matter, we present the Workflow Composition Tool. The tool is designed to provide descriptions of abstract (i.e. not executable) workflows of service-based Grid applications. The tool applies novel semantic techniques to deliver meaningful discovery and matching of ontologically described resources. WCT is a part of larger workflow composition and execution system being developed in the K-WfGrid project - the short description of the entire system is also included.", "paper_title": "Semantic-based grid workflow composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100078"}
