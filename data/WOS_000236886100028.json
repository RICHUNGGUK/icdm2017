As a further contribution to this theory, this paper first studies a new C-variety of languages, lying somewhere between star-free and regular languages. Then, continuing the early works of Esik-Ito, we extend the wreath product to C-varieties and generalize the wreath product principle, a powerful tool originally designed by Straubing for varieties. We use it to derive a characterization of the operations L -> LaA* and L -> La on languages. Finally, we investigate the decidability of the operation V -> V (*) LI (the wreath product by locally trivial semigroups) and solve it explicitely in several non-trivial cases.", "paper_title": "C-varieties, actions and wreath product", "paper_id": "WOS:000236886100028"}
