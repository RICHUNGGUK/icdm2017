However, if the table contains text, minimizing the height of the table for a fixed maximum width is NP-hard. Thus, more efficient heuristic algorithms are required. We evaluate the HTML table layout recommendation and find that while it generally produces quite compact layout it is brittle and can lead to quite uncompact layout. We present an alternate heuristic algorithm. It uses a greedy strategy that starts from the widest reasonable layout and repeatedly chooses to narrow the column for which narrowing leads to the least increase in table height. The algorithm is simple, fast enough to be used in online applications, and gives significantly more compact layout than is obtained with HTML's recommended table layout algorithm.", "paper_title": "HTML Automatic Table Layout", "paper_id": "WOS:000316416200004"}
