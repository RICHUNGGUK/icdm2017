A comparative study of mean flow parameters, and turbulence stresses along the jet centerline has also been performed to investigate the effect of variation of oblique angle. The Reynolds number considered for the present study is 15000 for which the flow field becomes fully turbulent. Flow field has been represented in terms of streamwise and lateral velocity contours, static pressure contour, and streamwise velocity and static pressure profiles at different locations along the oblique offset plate. Distribution of Reynolds stresses in terms of spanwise, lateral and turbulent shear stresses, and turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate have been presented to describe the turbulent characteristics. Spanwise integral of mean momentum, static pressure, Reynolds stress and energy have been computed along the downstream direction. Similarity of streamwise velocity and velocity component parallel to the oblique offset plate has been observed in the wall jet region of the reattached flow. The jet growth rate has been presented in terms of half-width, the decay of maximum velocity, variation of maximum velocity location and growth of length scale. Effect of variation of oblique angles on the streamwise variation of static pressure and skin friction coefficient have been compared for different angles. In the wall jet region streamwise variation of centerline turbulent intensities shows increased values with increase in oblique angle while turbulence intensities along the jet centerline in the preimpingement region remain unaffected by change in oblique angles. Near-wall velocity profiles have been presented by logarithmic law profiles and velocity defect law. Velocity distribution of oblique offset jet in inner coordinates shows differences with that of the boundary layer as well as plane wall jet. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
