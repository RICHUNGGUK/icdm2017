Our system involves the construction of model defined paper-cutting patterns, extraction of the medial axis (MA) from the mesh models and position location for patterns on the mesh surface based on MA. Patch sets for placing patterns on the mesh surface are determined by the region growing algorithm. After patch sets parameterization, patterns are drawn on the parameterized domain and mapped onto the mesh surface by inverse sampling.", "paper_title": "Generating 3D paper-cutting effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300126"}
