We then show that any posetal locally Cartesian closed model category Qt in which the mapping Hom((w))(ZxB, C) : Qt -> Sets is functorial in Z and represented inQt satisfies our homotopy version of the Univalence Axiom, albeit in a rather trivial way. This work was motivated by a question reported in [ 2], asking for a model of the Univalence Axiom not equivalent to the standard one.", "paper_title": "The Univalence Axiom in posetal model categories", "paper_id": "WOS:000355952200007"}
