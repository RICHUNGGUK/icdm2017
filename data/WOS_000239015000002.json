However, the user has to choose non-linearities, and usually simple (but non-optimal) cubic polynomials are applied. In this paper, the optimal choice of these non-linearities is addressed. We show that this optimal non-linearity is the output score function difference (SFD). Contrary to simple non-linearities usually used in EASI (such as cubic polynomials), the optimal choice is neither component-wise nor fixed: it is a multivariate function which depends on the output distributions. Finally, we derive three adaptive algorithms for estimating the SFD and achieving \"quasi-optimal\" EASI algorithms, whose separation performance is much better than \"standard\" EASI and which especially converges for any sources.
