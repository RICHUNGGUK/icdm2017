The system recovers surface colour and surface normal for each surface patch separately, in the presence of highlights and shadows. The error analysis presented concerns every step of the algorithm, and it is based on the assumptions that errors may arise due to Gaussian image noise and errors in the accuracy with which the geometry of the illuminating set-up is known. The analysis is confirmed by experiments. The implications of this sensitivity analysis to the design of such a rig and the choice of threshold values for the algorithm are also discussed and recommendations to a designer are given.", "paper_title": "Design issues for a colour photometric stereo system", "paper_id": "WOS:000235460400007"}
