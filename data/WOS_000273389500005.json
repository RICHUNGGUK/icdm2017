We first propose a method to find energy minimizers of the 1-component DNLS equation and use it as the initial point of the m-component DNLS equations in a continuation scheme. We then show that the change of local optimality occurs only at the bifurcation points. The fact leads to a minimal energy tracking method that guides the choice of bifurcation branch corresponding to the minimal energy solution curve. By combining all these techniques with a parameter-switching scheme, we successfully compute a non-radially symmetric energy minimizer that can not be computed by existing numerical schemes straightforwardly.
