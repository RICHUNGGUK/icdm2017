Design/methodology/approach - The paper takes the form of a report based on internal documentation. Findings - Since its implementation in winter 2007/8 Koha has grown into an LMS that supports the wide-ranging needs of a busy and fast-growing specialist library. CAMLIS had Koha modules modified and added to meet its needs flexibly, using simultaneously both UK-based consultancy firms with Koha expertise. Originality/value - This is among the first implementations of Koha in the UK. Experience and conclusions from this installation might influence decisions at other libraries.", "paper_title": "Two years on: Koha 3.0 in use at the CAMLIS library, Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital", "paper_id": "WOS:000282031000007"}
