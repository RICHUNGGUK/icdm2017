From dancer's movement, we construct motion trajectories, detect turnings, and stops of trajectories, and then estimate rhythm of motion (ROM). For music, beats are detected to describe rhythm of music. Two modalities are therefore represented as sequences of rhythm information to facilitate finding cross-media correspondence. Two applications, i.e., background music replacement and music video generation, are developed to demonstrate the practicality of cross-media correspondence. We evaluate performance of ROM extraction, and conduct subjective/objective evaluation to show that rich browsing experience can be provided by the proposed applications.", "paper_title": "Rhythm of Motion Extraction and Rhythm-Based Cross-Media Alignment for Dance Videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000302701100013"}
