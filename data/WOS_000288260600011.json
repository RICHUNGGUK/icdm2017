It is suspected that some additional linear constraints may hold on to the whole parameter space. The estimator is a generalization of the well-known restricted least-squares estimator and is confined to the (affine) subspace which is generated by the restrictions. The risk functions of the proposed estimators are derived under balanced loss function. Finally, the performance of the new estimators is evaluated by a simulated data set.", "paper_title": "Ridge regression methodology in partial linear models with correlated errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000288260600011"}
