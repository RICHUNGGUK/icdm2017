The loading materials are barium tetratitanate ceramics of very high dielectric constant (epsilon(r) = 38, 80). It is shown that, simply through loading, the antenna sizes are greatly reduced; however, the antenna performances are deteriorated. For instance, the antenna gain becomes lower. Then enhancement of the antenna performances follows. A substrate-superstrate structure is used to recover the gain. Both the experiments and the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations demonstrate that the gain and impedance bandwidth can be retrieved such that they are comparable to those of conventional microstrip antennas loaded with low permittivity materials (epsilon(r) < 3).
