The objective is to design a robust fault detection filter that guarantees both sensitivity to faults and robustness to disturbances. Based on switched Lyapunov functional method, sufficient conditions for the existence of the above filters are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "LMI APPROACH TO DESIGN FAULT DETECTION FILTER FOR DISCRETE-TIME SWITCHED SYSTEMS WITH STATE DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000273648900033"}
