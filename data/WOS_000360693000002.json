In the infrastructures, data are being collected by distributed sensor services, served by distributed geospatial data services, transformed by processing services and workflows, and consumed by smart clients. Consequently, Geographical Information Systems (GISs) are moving from GISystems to GIServices. Intelligent GIServices are enriched with new capabilities including knowledge representation, semantic reasoning, automatic workflow composition, and quality and traceability. Such Intelligent GIServices facilitate information discovery and integration over the network and automate the assembly of GIServices to provide value-added products. This paper provides an overview of intelligent GIServices. The concept of intelligent GIServices is described, followed by a review of the state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies relevant to intelligent GIServices. Visions on how GIServices can perceive, reason, learn, and act intelligently are highlighted. The results can provide better services for big data processing, semantic interoperability, knowledge discovery, and cross-discipline collaboration in Earth science applications.", "paper_title": "Towards intelligent GIServices", "paper_id": "WOS:000360693000002"}
