The novelty of this work resides in the application of Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) to define the interface of the deformable objects. The employed B-spline basis functions facilitate the direct evaluation of surface normal vectors and curvatures, as required by the BIM. Collocation and L-2-projection methods are implemented to approximate the velocity of the B-spline control points. In particular, a comparison between these two methods for the case of the drop is reported and shows that the collocation method provides faster and more stable results. The collocation method is also applied for the determination of the surface tension in an inextensible membrane. A series of simulations is conducted to verify the isogeometric approach, and various computational aspects are studied. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
