There are also situations in which the available data are record statistics such as weather and sports. In this paper, we consider the problem of testing fuzzy hypotheses on the basis of records. Pareto distribution is investigated in more details since it is used in applications including economic and life testing analysis. For illustrative proposes, a real data set on annual wage is analyzed using the results obtained.", "paper_title": "HYPOTHESES TESTING WITH THE TWO-PARAMETER PARETO DISTRIBUTION ON THE BASIS OF RECORDS IN FUZZY ENVIRONMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000348558300008"}
