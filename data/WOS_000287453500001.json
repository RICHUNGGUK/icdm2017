So, gene expression data from DNA microarray are characterized by many measured variables (genes) on only a few samples. One important application of gene expression data is to classify the samples. In statistical terms, the very large number of predictors or variables compared to small number of samples makes most of classical \"class prediction\" methods unemployable. Generally, this problem can be avoided by selecting only the relevant features or extracting new features containing the maximal information about the class label from the original data. In this paper, a new method for gene selection based on independent variable group analysis is proposed. In this method, we first used t-statistics method to select a part of genes from the original data. Then, we selected the key genes from the selected genes for tumor classification using IVGA. Finally, we used SVM to classify tumors based on the key genes selected using IVGA. To validate the efficiency, the proposed method is applied to classify three different DNA microarray data sets. The prediction results show that our method is efficient and feasible.", "paper_title": "Gene selection using independent variable group analysis for tumor classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000287453500001"}
