The hybrid method comprises two phases, one is support vector machine (SVM)-based model for predicting the tunnel surrounding rock displacement, and the other is GA-based model for optimizing the parameters in the SVM. The proposed model is evaluated with the data of tunnel surrounding rock displacement on the tunnel of Wuhan-Guangzhou railway in China. The results show that genetic algorithm (GA) has a good convergence and relative stable performance. The comparison results also show that the hybrid method can generally provide a better performance than artificial neural network (ANN) and finite element method (FEM) for tunnel surrounding rock displacement prediction.", "paper_title": "HYBRID MODEL FOR DISPLACEMENT PREDICTION OF TUNNEL SURROUNDING ROCK", "paper_id": "WOS:000306821100003"}
