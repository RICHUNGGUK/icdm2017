The NMC exploits both the Miller capacitance-multiplier effect and the pole-splitting action. In literature NMC capacitor sizing rules have been presented to design amplifiers characterised by a third-order Butterworth unity-gain closed-loop response. In the paper, the Authors show these criteria neglecting transistor parasitic capacitances, may lead to incorrect amplifier behaviour when small load capacitances have to be driven. A developed model, allowing better pole location estimation, is also presented.", "paper_title": "Correct modelling of nested miller compensated amplifier for discrete-time applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000241464600051"}
