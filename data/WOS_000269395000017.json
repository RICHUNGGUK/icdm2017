Based on NCBI' 97 reports, the most significant challenge is the docking procedure. In this work, Lyapunov stability theorem is used to discuss and analyze the numbers of binding sites in the drug design and to enhance the docking performance. These novel techniques are significantly based on the concept of minimum energy and optimal geometry search strategies to ensure the stability of protein-ligand interactions. This study also applies the Lyapunov stability theorem to discuss the molecular orbit adjustment of molecular dynamics equations when the equilibrium point moves away from the initial state with zero input in molecule infinite time t. From the view point of the minimum energy, we have used the Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) curves to accelerate the molecular docking system by the short route. Furthermore, the folding of various proteins is discussed. And the force field is also analyzed. Finally, simulation results are given to show the feasibility and effectiveness of this study.", "paper_title": "MOLECULAR SIMULATION VIA LYAPUNOV PRINCIPLE AND NURBS CURVES", "paper_id": "WOS:000269395000017"}
