The control scheme and model are based on the complete physics model of the system. An accurate model of the actuator is presented and validated by means of an experimental prototype. A nonlinear state observer is also developed in order to estimate temperature and phase state variables that are difficult to measure online due to the small dimensions of the actuator. Experimental results are then presented for different set-point functions. Tracking performance, frequency response and disturbance rejection are evaluated and the advantages of the proposed controller are then discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
