Many previous studies with real objects have investigated the mechanical properties that underlie human haptic perception. Few virtual environments, however, have systematically incorporated the relevant mechanical parameters underlying kinesthetic perception. In this study, the ability of a haptic device to render kinesthetic information regarding the inertial properties of virtual objects was tested. Results suggest that users were able to perceive length of rendered virtual objects via the haptic device. Further, users can be trained using the haptic device to increase sensitivity to specific mechanical parameters (like inertia) that are perceptually salient in perceiving properties of rendered objects. The primary implication of this finding is that rendering kinesthetic parameters and employing feedback in a systematic manner may increase the realism of virtual environments and also improve haptic perception.", "paper_title": "Perceptually salient haptic rendering for enhancing kinesthetic perception in virtual environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000342069200007"}
