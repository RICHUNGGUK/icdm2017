Design/methodology/approach - This research applies a multiple-case study methodology analyzing five cases of IMC application scenarios in five large European industrial and service-sector companies. Findings - Results show that IMC can deliver business value in various applications ranging from advanced analytic insights to support of real-time processes. This enables higher-level organizational advantages like data-driven decision making, superior transparency of operations, and experience with Big Data technology. The findings are summarized in a business value generation model which captures the business benefits along with preceding enabling changes in the organizational environment. Practical implications - Results aid managers in identifying different application scenarios where IMC technology may generate value for their organizations from business and IT management perspectives. The research also sheds light on the socio-technical factors that influence the likelihood of success or failure of IMC initiatives. Originality/value - This research is among the first to model the business value creation process of in-memory technology based on insights from multiple implemented applications in different industries.", "paper_title": "Business value of in-memory technology - multiple-case study insights", "paper_id": "WOS:000345148100005"}
