Inspired by recent work in sparsity for single channel image classification, we propose a new simultaneous sparsity model for multi-channel histopathological image representation and classification (SHIRC). Essentially, we represent a histopathological image as a sparse linear combination of training examples under suitable channel-wise constraints. Classification is performed by solving a newly formulated simultaneous sparsity-based optimization problem. A practical challenge is the correspondence of image objects (cellular and nuclear structures) at different spatial locations in the image. We propose a robust locally adaptive variant of SHIRC (LA-SHIRC) to tackle this issue. Experiments on two challenging real-world image data sets: 1) mammalian tissue images acquired by pathologists of the animal diagnostics lab (ADL) at Pennsylvania State University, and 2) human intraductal breast lesions, reveal the merits of our proposal over state-of-the-art alternatives. Further, we demonstrate that LA-SHIRC exhibits a more graceful decay in classification accuracy against the number of training images which is highly desirable in practice where generous training per class is often not available.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous Sparsity Model for Histopathological Image Representation and Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000335379500014"}
