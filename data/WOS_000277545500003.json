With the aim of developing the accurate computational models for identifying vasodilators of diverse structures, several machine learning methods, such as C4.5 decision tree (C4.5 DT), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector machine (SVM), were explored in this work. These identification models were trained by using 198 three-dimensional molecular descriptors and a group of 635 compounds including 308 vasodilators and 327 non-vasodilators, in which feature selection was conducted to optimize the training models and select the most appropriate descriptors for identifying the vasodilators. An independent validation set of 74 vasodilators and 87 non-vasodilators was subsequently used to evaluate the performance of the developed identification models. The identification rates of these models are in the range of 78.38%-97.30% for vasodilators and 83.91%-86.21% for non-vasodilators. Our investigation reveals that the explored machine learning methods, especially SVM, are potentially useful for the identification of vasodilators. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
