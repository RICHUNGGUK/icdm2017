A recent focus in machine-learnings research has been to extend traditional machine-learning classification techniques to classify nodes in such networks. In this article, we provide a brief introduction to this area of research and how it has progressed during the past decade. We introduce four of the most widely used inference algorithms for classifying networked data and empirically compare them on both synthetic and real-world data.", "paper_title": "Collective Classification in Network Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000260368400008"}
