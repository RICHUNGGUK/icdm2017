One editing operation that has recently received increased attention is median filtering. While several median filtering detection techniques have recently been developed, their performance is degraded by JPEG compression. These techniques suffer similar degradations in performance when a small window of the image is analyzed, as is done in localized filtering or cut-and-paste detection, rather than the image as a whole. In this paper, we propose a new, robust median filtering forensic technique. It operates by analyzing the statistical properties of the median filter residual (MFR), which we define as the difference between an image in question and a median filtered version of itself. To capture the statistical properties of the MFR, we fit it to an autoregressive (AR) model. We then use the AR coefficients as features for median filter detection. We test the effectiveness of our proposed median filter detection techniques through a series of experiments. These results show that our proposed forensic technique can achieve important performance gains over existing methods, particularly at low false-positive rates, with a very small dimension of features.", "paper_title": "Robust Median Filtering Forensics Using an Autoregressive Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000324575200004"}
