Most existing research suffers from the problems of inefficiency in globally managing the nodes' load information and consumption of network bandwidth. This paper describes the mechanisms for collecting and globally managing the dynamic load of each node, and based on which to present a load balancing strategy which transfers the load from overloaded to under loaded nodes so as to improve load balancing efficiency. In order to encourage the rational and selfish nodes to actively participate in the load balancing process, we also propose an incentive mechanism in dynamic load balancing, by which the differentiated services could be provided for the nodes according to their load balancing abilities. The simulation results indicate that our approach could tackle the load imbalance problem in structured P2P networks effectively and efficiently in terms of the load distribution and the transferred load volume.
