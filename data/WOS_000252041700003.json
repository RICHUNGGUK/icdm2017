Though this principle successfully explains the gain-related aspects of muscle force generation, it does not address the need for desynchronization of motor unit activities in order to produce a smooth tension profile at the level of whole muscle, while individual muscle fibers are \"twitching.\" We propose an oscillator model of motor neurons in which a pool of motor neurons fires a bundle of muscle fibers. Although individual muscle fibers have a complicated tension profile, the tension produced by the entire bundle is regulated and follows a command signal accurately. This is shown to be possible because of uncorrelated activity produced by local inhibitory connections among motor neurons. Connections that produce synchronized oscillations result in uncontrolled contractions of the Muscle. These results seem to suggest that while synchronized activity indicates pathology and disease, desynchronized activity is the precondition for normal muscle function. Physiological evidence for the proposed theory of motor unit synchronization is presented.", "paper_title": "An oscillator theory of motor unit recruitment", "paper_id": "WOS:000252041700003"}
