The EIDCA enables the nodes in the wireless sensor networks to self-organize themselves autonomously without a centralized control for target detection. A probability-based scheme for hormone transmission is also introduced to alleviate fluctuations of the network caused by frequent switches of the nodes. Meanwhile, a numerical evaluation method is designed to provide a quantitative metric for comparing the tracking performance of different algorithms. Simulation results show that the decentralized network controlled by the EIDCA can work efficiently and reliably without central control. It is also shown that the proposed EIDCA outperforms the compared algorithms in tracking targets.", "paper_title": "An endocrine-based intelligent distributed cooperative algorithm for target tracking in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351472300020"}
