To produce an appealing haptic sensation for smooth solids, a large number of polygons are needed in conventional approaches. This, however, slows down computation and consumes much more memory. In this paper, we present a method to generate smooth feedback force in haptic interaction with coarse polygonal meshes. Our method calculates the interaction force based on Gregory patches, which are locally constructed from n-sided polygons and ensure G(1) continuity across boundaries of patches. During the real time haptic interaction, the contact point is continuously tracked on the locally constructed Gregory patches and thus generates smooth haptic forces to be rendered. Our method is validated on various models with comparison to conventional force rendering techniques.
