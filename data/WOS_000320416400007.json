This work is the first part of a two-levels global optimization strategy. The general objective is to reduce computation costs; here, we focus on the costs which are associated with the generation of the metamodel. Our goal is achieved through the introduction of two main elements: what we call a \"multiparametric strategy\" based on the LATIN method, which reduces the computation costs when the parameters vary, and the use of a cokriging metamodel taking gradients into account. Several examples illustrate the efficiency of these two elements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
