The Kriging metamodel is established to approximate the characteristic performance functions of a pump, namely, the efficiency and required net positive suction head (NPSHr). Hence, the two objectives are to maximize the efficiency and simultaneously to minimize NPSHr. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) have been applied to the multi-objective optimization problem, respectively. The Pareto solution set is obtained by a more effective and efficient manner of the two multi-objective optimization algorithms. A tradeoff optimal design point is selected from the Pareto solution set by means of a robust design based on Monte Carlo simulations, and the optimal solution is further compared with the value of the physical prototype test. The results show that the solution of the proposed multi-objective optimization method is in line with the experiment test. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
