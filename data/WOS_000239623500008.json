On the other hand, knowledge itself should mainly come from information. Therefore, knowledge serves as a channel for linking information and intelligence. Without knowledge, information can hardly be transformed into intelligence. Even more interestingly, a unified theory of artificial intelligence can well be achieved if a comprehensive understanding of knowledge theory is reached.", "paper_title": "Knowledge theory and artificial intelligence", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500008"}
