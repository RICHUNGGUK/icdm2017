Like other evolutionary algorithms, QICA is also characterized by the representation of the antibody (individual), the evaluation function, and the population dynamics. However, in QICA, an antibody is proliferated and divided into a subpopulation. Antibodies in a subpopulation are represented by multi-state gene quantum bits. For the novel representation, we put forward the quantum mutation operator which is used at the inner subpopulation to accelerate the convergence. Finally, QICA is applied to a practical case, the multiuser detection in DS-CDMA systems, with a satisfactory result.", "paper_title": "Quantum-inspired immune clonal algorithm for multiuser detection in DS-CDMA systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300011"}
