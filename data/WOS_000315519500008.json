Due to the importance of location information in mobile search, PMSE classifies these concepts into content concepts and location concepts. In addition, users' locations (positioned by GPS) are used to supplement the location concepts in PMSE. The user preferences are organized in an ontology-based, multifacet user profile, which are used to adapt a personalized ranking function for rank adaptation of future search results. To characterize the diversity of the concepts associated with a query and their relevances to the user's need, four entropies are introduced to balance the weights between the content and location facets. Based on the client-server model, we also present a detailed architecture and design for implementation of PMSE. In our design, the client collects and stores locally the clickthrough data to protect privacy, whereas heavy tasks such as concept extraction, training, and reranking are performed at the PMSE server. Moreover, we address the privacy issue by restricting the information in the user profile exposed to the PMSE server with two privacy parameters. We prototype PMSE on the Google Android platform. Experimental results show that PMSE significantly improves the precision comparing to the baseline.", "paper_title": "PMSE: A Personalized Mobile Search Engine", "paper_id": "WOS:000315519500008"}
