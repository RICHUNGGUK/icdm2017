Existing routing schemes for DTNs provide best effort service, but are unable to optimize QoS and support message priority. In this paper, we present a Look-Ahead Routing and Message Scheduling approach (ALARMS) which exploits more accurate knowledge about various parameters regarding routing to achieve better QoS in the DTN. We assume a variation of the well-known ferry model, in which there are ferry nodes moving along pre-defined routes to exchange messages with the gateway node of each region on the route and also pass to the gateway nodes look-ahead routing information about when it will arrive at each gateway node on the route in the next two rounds and how long it will stay. The gateway nodes use this information to estimate the delivery delay of each message when being delivered by different ferries, and schedule the message to be delivered by the ferry which arrives earliest at the destination. Simulation results show that ALARMS outperforms three existing routing protocols: epidemic routing, Spray-and-Wait, and Spray-and-Focus, in terms of delay time, delivery ratio, and overhead. We also discuss five enhancement strategies on ALARMS and how ALARMS can support message prioritization. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
