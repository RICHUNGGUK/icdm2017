The first step for imaging under such circumstances is the computation of the cross correlations of the recorded signals, which have attracted a lot of attention recently because of their numerous applications in seismic imaging, volcano monitoring, and petroleum prospecting. Here, we use these cross correlations for imaging reflectors with travel-time migration. While the resolution of the image obtained this way has been studied in detail, an analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is presented in this paper along with numerical simulations that support the theoretical results. It is shown that the SNR of the image inherits the SNR of the computed cross correlations and therefore is proportional to the square root of the bandwidth of the noise sources times the recording time. Moreover, the SNR of the image is proportional to the array size. This means that the image can be stabilized by increasing the size of the array when the recorded signals are not of long duration, which is important in applications such as nondestructive testing.", "paper_title": "Signal-to-Noise Ratio Estimation in Passive Correlation-Based Imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000326033500013"}
