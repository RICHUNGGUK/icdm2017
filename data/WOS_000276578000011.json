Through the proper use of BPMS, business processes in an enterprise can be executed efficiently and be coordinated seamlessly. For the sound execution of business process, it is important to debug its ran-time processing and verify its logic before deploying business process model to BPMS. In our previous research, a simple process debugging scheme which is called request-reply debug model was suggested as an implementation framework for BPMS. Though it was somewhat successful while debugging business processes, it could not handle some exceptional situations such as failures of either client or server. In this paper, we incorporate some fault tolerance features in the request-reply debug model, and advanced its architectural design to robustly handle process debugging. With this extended debug model, it is expected that the debugging of business process can be done in a more robust and reliable way.", "paper_title": "FAULT-TOLERANT PROCESS DEBUGGER FOR BUSINESS PROCESS DESIGN", "paper_id": "WOS:000276578000011"}
