Targets are detected by computing the pixel-wise difference between consecutive frames, and then classified with a temporally boosted classifier and \"spatiotemporal-oriented energy\" analysis. We demonstrate that the proposed classifier can successfully recognize five types of objects: a person, a bicycle, a motorcycle, a vehicle, and a person with an umbrella. In addition, we process targets that do not match any of the AdaBoost-based classifier's categories by using a secondary classification module that categorizes such targets as crowds of individuals or non-crowds. We show that the above classification task can be performed effectively by analyzing a target's spatiotemporal-oriented energies, which provide a rich description of the target's spatial and dynamic features. Our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed system is extremely effective in recognizing all predefined object classes.", "paper_title": "Spatiotemporal Motion Analysis for the Detection and Classification of Moving Targets", "paper_id": "WOS:000262163600013"}
