Current DTN-based mobile data offloading models are based on simple and unrealistic network assumptions which do not take into account the heterogeneity of mobile data and mobile users. We establish a mathematical framework to study the problem of multiple-type mobile data offloading under realistic assumptions, where (i) mobile data are heterogeneous in terms of size and lifetime; (ii) mobile users have different data subscribing interests; and (iii) the storages of offloading helpers are limited. We formulate the objective of achieving maximum mobile data offloading as a submodular function maximization problem with multiple linear constraints of limited storage, and propose three algorithms, suitable for the generic and more specific offloading scenarios, respectively, to solve this challenging optimization problem. We show that the designed algorithms effectively offload data to the DTN by using both the theoretical analysis and simulation investigations which employ both real human and vehicular mobility traces.", "paper_title": "Multiple Mobile Data Offloading Through Disruption Tolerant Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000339169100015"}
