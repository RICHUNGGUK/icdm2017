Tag collision arbitration for passive tags is a significant issue for fast tag identification due to communication over a shared wireless channel. This paper presents an adaptive memoryless protocol, which is an improvement on the query tree protocol. Memoryless means that tags need not have additional memory except ID for identification. To reduce collisions and identify tags promptly, we use information obtained from the last process of tag identification at a reader. Our performance evaluation shows that the adaptive memoryless protocol causes fewer collisions and takes shorter delay for recognizing all tags while preserving lower communication overhead than other tree based tag anticollision protocols.", "paper_title": "An adaptive mentoryless protocol for RFID tag collision arbitration", "paper_id": "WOS:000241052400020"}
