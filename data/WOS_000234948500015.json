In this paper, we propose non-adjacent form of radix-r representation (rNAF) and efficient algorithms for generating rNAF. The number of non-trivial digits is (r - 2)(r + 1)/2 and its average density of non-zero digit is asymptotically (r - 1)1(2r - 1). For r = 3, the non-trivial digits are (*2, 4) and the non-zero density is 0.4. We then investigate the width-w version of rNAF for the general radix-r representation, which is a natural extension of the width-w NAF. Finally we compare the proposed algorithms with the generalized NAF (gNAF) discussed by Joye and Yen. The proposed scheme requires a larger table but its non-zero density is smaller even for large radix. We explain that gNAF is a simple degeneration of rNAF-we can consider that rNAF is a canonical form for the radix-r representation. Therefore, rNAF is a good alternative to gNAF.", "paper_title": "Radix-r non-adjacent form and its application to pairing-based cryptosystem", "paper_id": "WOS:000234948500015"}
