Owing to its efficiency and simplicity, PSO has attracted many researchers' attention and developed many variants. Orthogonal learning particle swarm optimization (OLPSO) is proposed as a new variant of PSO that relies on a new learning strategy called orthogonal learning strategy. The OLPSO differs in the utilization of the information of experience from the standard PSO, in which each particle utilizes its historical best experience and globally best experience through linear summation. In OLPSO, particles can fly in better directions by constructing an efficient exemplar through orthogonal experimental design. However, the global version based orthogonal learning PSO (OLPSO-G) still have some drawbacks in solving some complex multimodal function optimization. In this paper, we proposed a quadratic interpolation based OLPSO-G (QIOLPSO-G), in which, a quadratic interpolation based construction strategy for the personal historical best experience is applied. Meanwhile, opposition-based learning, and Gaussian mutation are also introduced into this paper to increase the diversity of the population and discourage the premature convergence. Experiments are conducted on 16 benchmark problems to validate the effectiveness of the QIOLPSO-G, and comparisons are made with four typical PSO algorithms. The results show that the introduction of the three strategies does enhance the effectiveness of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Quadratic interpolation based orthogonal learning particle swarm optimization algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000331659500002"}
