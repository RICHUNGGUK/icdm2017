By providing users with realistic perception and immersive experience, CAVE systems have been widely used in many fields, including military, education, health care, entertainment, design, and others. In this paper, we focus on the design applications in the CAVE. The design applications involve many interactions between the user and the CAVE. However, the conventional interaction tool, the wand, cannot provide fast and convenient interactions. In this paper, we propose vDesign, a CAVE-based virtual design environment using hand interactions. The hand interactions in vDesign are classified into menu navigation and object manipulations. For menu navigation, we define two interactions: activating the main menu and selecting a menu item. For object manipulations, we define three interactions: moving, rotating, and scaling an object. By using the proposed hand interactions, we develop the functions of image segmentation and image composition in vDesign. With the image segmentation function, the designer can select and cut the interested objects from different images. With the image composition function, the designer can manipulate the segmented objects and combine them as a composite image. We implemented the vDesign prototype in CAVE and conducted experiments to evaluate the interaction performance in terms of manipulation time and distortion. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed hand interactions can provide faster and more accurate interactions compared to the traditional wand interactions.", "paper_title": "vDesign: a CAVE-based virtual design environment using hand interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000343714200003"}
