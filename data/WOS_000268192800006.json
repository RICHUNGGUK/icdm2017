The whole iterative procedure includes three parts: the optimal excitation signals design, the uncertainty model set identification and the stable controller design. Firstly the worst case upsilon-gap is used as the criterion of the optimal excitation signals design, and the design is performed via the power spectrum optimization. And then, an uncertainty model set is attained by system identification on the basis of the measure signals. The controller is designed to ensure the stability of closed-loop system and the closed-loop performance improvement. Simulation result shows that the proposed method has good convergence and closed-loop control performance.", "paper_title": "Iterative identification and control design with optimal excitation signals based on upsilon-gap", "paper_id": "WOS:000268192800006"}
