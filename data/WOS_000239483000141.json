We make the following two modifications: 1) The neural identifier which is used to estimate the unknown nonlinear system, applies new learning algorithms. The stability and non-zero properties are proved by dead-zone and projection technique. 2) We propose a new sliding surface and give a necessary condition to assure exponential decrease of the sliding surface. The time-varying gain in the sliding mode produces a low-chattering control signal. The closed-loop system with sliding mode controller and neural identifier is proved to be stable by Lyapunov method.", "paper_title": "Discrete-time sliding-mode control based on neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000141"}
