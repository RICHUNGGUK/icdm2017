Firstly, the incremental harmonic balance (IHB) method is used to obtain the solution of nonlinear vibration differential equations. Hsu's method is then adopted for computing the transition matrix at the end of one period, and the precise time integration algorithm is adjusted to improve the computational precision. The stability regions of the system obtained from the precise Hsu's, Hsu's and improved numerical integration methods are compared and discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
