A technique is derived for determining upper bounds on the response time of the jobs of each task, when a constrained-deadline sporadic task system is scheduled. This technique yields a generalization to a load-based sufficient schedulability condition for DM, the generalization being the added ability to account for blocking in the presence of non-preemptable serially re-usable resources.", "paper_title": "Efficient computation of response time bounds for preemptive uniprocessor deadline monotonic scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000295793000001"}
