Comparison with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4) confirms the very high accuracy of the presented algorithm. The obtained results reveal that the proposed algorithm is a promising method for the solution of the CGS and more promising because it can further be readily employed to solve other chaotic systems.
