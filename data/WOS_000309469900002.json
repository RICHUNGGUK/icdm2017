We study when, how and to which extent an exchange of arguments can be beneficial in negotiation. The results show that argumentation can improve the quality of an outcome but never decrease it.", "paper_title": "A formal analysis of the role of argumentation in negotiation dialogues", "paper_id": "WOS:000309469900002"}
