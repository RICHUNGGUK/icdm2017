Carnegie Mellon University [Online]. Available ], in 2010 in the European Union, but also in Asian countries like Japan [J. M. Bachnik, Roadblocks on the Information Highway: The IT Revolution in Japanese Education, ser. Studies of Modern Japan. Lexington Books, 2003.]. This paradigm is characterized by applying innovative methods of teaching that involve students as active participants in their own learning. In this paper, it is proposed a method based on detecting the students' learning gains by using low time consuming Pretests and Posttests, on a selection of learning activities. The overload of introducing the Pretest-Posttest is minimized by using information and communication technologies. The results of the Pretests and Posttests, provided online, allow the students to be aware of their learning progress. The analysis of these results helps teachers adapt their strategies when presenting the learning activities. The method has been applied on a first-year course on Computer Engineering, during the 2010-2011, 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 academic years. To verify that the method works, two student groups, one control and one experimental, were created. The method was applied in the experimental group. The statistical analysis of the obtained results by the experimental and control groups, shows that the method enhances the grades of the experimental group. Additionally, the support of Information and Communication Technologies minimizes the overload of using this method. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
