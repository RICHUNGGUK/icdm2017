The EM algorithm is an ideal choice for iteratively obtaining maximum likelihood estimation of parameters in presumable finite mixtures, comparing to some popular numerical methods. However, the original EM is a batch algorithm that works only on fixed datasets. To endow the EM algorithm with the capability to process streaming data, two on-line variants are studied, including Titterington's method and a sufficient statistics-based method. We first prove that the two on-line EM variants are theoretically feasible for training the multivariate normal mixture model by showing that the model belongs to the exponential family. Afterward, the two on-line learning schemes for multivariate normal mixtures are applied to the problems of background learning and moving foreground detection. Experiments show that the two on-line EM variants can efficiently update the parameters of the mixture model and are capable of generating reliable backgrounds for moving foreground detection.", "paper_title": "On-line EM Variants for Multivariate Normal Mixture Model in Background Learning and Moving Foreground Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000329234700009"}
