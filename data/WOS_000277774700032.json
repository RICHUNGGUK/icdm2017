By employing radial-basis-function neural networks to account for system uncertainties, the proposed scheme is developed by combining \"dynamic surface control\" and \"minimal learning parameter\" techniques. The key features of the algorithm are that, first, the problem of \"explosion of complexity\" inherent in the conventional backstepping method is avoided, second, the number of parameters updated online for each subsystem is reduced to 2, and, third, the possible controller singularity problem in the approximation-based adaptive control schemes with feedback linearization technique is removed. These features result in a much simpler adaptive control algorithm, which is convenient to implement in applications. In addition, it is shown via input-to-state stability theory and small gain approach that all signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, three simulation examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "A DSC Approach to Robust Adaptive NN Tracking Control for Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000277774700032"}
