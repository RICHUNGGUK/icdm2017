Currently, however, the engineering of tissue substitutes is a long and costly process based exclusively on experimentation. Predictive computer models can greatly reduce the development costs of tissue-engineered therapies by enabling scientists to rapidly evaluate the effect of system parameters on the growth rates and quality of regenerated tissues. We report here the parallel implementation of a three-dimensional model that employs cellular automata to describe the dynamic behavior of a population of mammalian cells that migrate, interact and proliferate to generate new tissues. The simulator uses MPI for interprocessor communication and is suitable for distributed memory multi-computers. Three parallel algorithms are developed to approximate the sequential algorithm describing this dynamic process of tissue growth. The parallel algorithms progressively relax the correctness requirements using different approaches to handle the cells that either move/divide in the boundary layers of processors or cross subdomain boundaries. Finally, a systematic study is carried out to evaluate the accuracy and performance of these algorithms.", "paper_title": "Parallel implementation of a cellular automaton modeling the growth of three-dimensional tissues", "paper_id": "WOS:000246304700007"}
