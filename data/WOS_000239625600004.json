Through a series of examples, we demonstrate the impact that various types of communicative signals, namely salience, captions and estimated perceptual task effort, have on the intended message inferred by our implemented system.", "paper_title": "Communicative signals as the key to automated understanding of simple bar charts", "paper_id": "WOS:000239625600004"}
