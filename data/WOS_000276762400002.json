A method based on radial basis functions and linear multi-step methods is used to construct continuous nonlinear models that approximate the original dynamical system. Information, such as the structure of the original system, is incorporated into the models through weak constraints. The formulation of the model and its advantages associated with modeling is described. Different examples are presented that highlight the various characteristics of the model and its effectiveness in dealing with various problems encountered in fluid flow problems.
