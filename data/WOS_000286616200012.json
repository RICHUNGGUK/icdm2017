The piercing number of F is the minimum number of points we need to intersect all the sets in F. In this paper we will find some bounds for the piercing number of families of convex sets with (p,q)(r) properties.", "paper_title": "Piercing Numbers for Balanced and Unbalanced Families", "paper_id": "WOS:000286616200012"}
