The rotor is made with high temperature superconductor bulks which nearly present a diamagnetic behavior under zero-field cooling. The stator consists of superconducting armature windings fed by AC currents of high amplitude. The superconducting stator winding can generate a high rotating magnetic field without the need of ferromagnetic material in the rotor. The electromagnetic torque is obtained by the interaction between the rotating magnetic field created by the superconducting stator windings and the variable reluctance due to the superconducting bulks. The proposed analytical method is based on the resolution of Laplace's equation (by the separation of variables method) for each sub-domain, i.e. rotor shaft, holes between superconducting bulks and air-gap. The global solution is obtained using boundary and continuity conditions. Magnetic field distribution and electromagnetic torque obtained by the analytical method are compared with those obtained from finite element analyses. (C) 2013 IMACS. Published by Elsevier E.V.
