To demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms we emulate the dynamics of the ship-deck, for various sea states and different ships using a six degrees of freedom motion platform. We then present the design and implementation of our robust computer vision system to measure the pose of the shipdeck with respect to the vehicle. A Kalman filter is used in conjunction with our vision system to ensure the robustness of the estimates. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our system to occlusions, variation in intensity, etc. using our testbed.", "paper_title": "An Approach Toward Visual Autonomous Ship Board Landing of a VTOL UAV", "paper_id": "WOS:000336449400009"}
