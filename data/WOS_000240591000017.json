The main result is a Dedekind inequality for the cardinality, which enables us to manipulate the cardinality of the composites of relations. As applications a few relational proofs for the basic theorems on graph matchings, and fundamentals about network flows will be given.", "paper_title": "On the cardinality of relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000240591000017"}
