Our infrastructure is based on two physical primitives, namely collaborative jamming and spatial signature enforcement, and a zero knowledge alternative for bootstrapping trust. Notably, it eschews the use of shared secrets, while providing a cryptosystem that is no less secure than conventional cryptosystems.", "paper_title": "A Shared-Secret Free Security Infrastructure for Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000307171100007"}
