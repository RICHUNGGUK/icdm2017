The pixel-by-pixel intensity difference of consecutive video frames is used as the factor or decision variable for designing an experiment for key-frame detection. The determination of a key-frame is correlated with the different values of the factor. A novel concept of meaningfulness of a video key-frame is also introduced to select the representative key-frame from a set of possible key-frames. The use of the concepts of design of experiments and the meaningfulness property to summarize a video is tested using a number of videos taken from MUSCLE-VCD-2007 dataset. The performance of the proposed approach in detecting key-frames is found to be superior in comparison to the competing approaches like PME based method (Liu et al., IEEE Trans Circuits Syst Video Technol 13(10):1006-1013, 2003; Mukherjee et al., IEEE Trans Circuits Syst Video Technol 17(5):612-620, 2007; Panagiotakis et al., IEEE Trans Circuits Syst Video Technol 19(3):447-451, 2009).", "paper_title": "A design-of-experiment based statistical technique for detection of key-frames", "paper_id": "WOS:000314715500014"}
