The problem of deciding whether a subword inequality holds for all words was proposed in [5]. We provide partial results describing a few cases in which the subword inequalities hold. Whether a subword inequality falls in these categories is decidable. However, the general question remains open.", "paper_title": "On inequalities between subword histories", "paper_id": "WOS:000258291000020"}
