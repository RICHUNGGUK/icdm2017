Although the PSO may find local optima or exhibit slow convergence speed when solving complex multimodal problems. Also, the algorithm requires setting several parameters, and tuning the parameters is a challenging for some optimization problems. To address these issues, an improved PSO scheme is proposed in this study. The algorithm, called non-parametric particle swarm optimization (NP-PSO) enhances the global exploration and the local exploitation in PSO without tuning any algorithmic parameter. NP-PSO combines local and global topologies with two quadratic interpolation operations to increase the search ability. Nineteen (19) unimodal and multimodal nonlinear benchmark functions are selected to compare the performance of NP-PSO with several well-known PSO algorithms. The experimental results showed that the proposed method considerably enhances the efficiency of PSO algorithm in terms of solution accuracy, convergence speed, global optimality, and algorithm reliability.
