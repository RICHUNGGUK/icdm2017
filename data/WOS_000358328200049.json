In this paper we present an investigation of node-link visualizations for communication and how to better support their creation. We begin by breaking down these images into their basic elements and analyzing how they are created. We then present a set of techniques aimed at improving the creation workflow by bringing more flexibility and power to users, letting them manipulate all aspects of a node-link diagram (layout, visual attributes, etc.) while taking into account the context in which it will appear. These techniques were implemented in a proof-of-concept prototype called GraphCoiffure, which was designed as an intermediary step between graph drawing/editing software and image authoring applications. We describe how GraphCoiffure improves the workflow and illustrate its benefits through practical examples.", "paper_title": "Towards a smooth design process for static communicative node-link diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000358328200049"}
