In this paper, we will further study (alpha, U-2)-migrative uninorms U-1, where U-1 and U-2 are two uninorms with different neutral elements e(1) and e(2), respectively. All cases when the uninorm U-1 and U-2 are in different families out of the most usual classes of uninorms are analyzed, characterizing all solutions of the migrativity equation for some possible combinations of U-1 and U-2.
