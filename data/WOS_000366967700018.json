The traditional formal verification method is not fully applicable to the development of actual system life cycle. Therefore, this paper presents a new real-time system verification method, It takes the deadlock timed Buchi automata as the medium, and translates the timed temporal logic into timed communicating sequential process language. The tock event is also joined, which can be directly used for the detection of refinement tool FDR. The method verifies the situation of deadlock. To establish the link between the conventional model checking and refinement model checking can well combine the advantages of both and improves system security and reliability.", "paper_title": "Verification Method of Real-time System Based on Refinement Relation", "paper_id": "WOS:000366967700018"}
