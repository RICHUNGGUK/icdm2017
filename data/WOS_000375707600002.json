Several projects aim to implement machine learning (ML) algorithms efficiently. But three key challenging and iterative practical tasks in using ML - feature engineering, algorithm selection, and parameter tuning, collectively called model selection have largely been overlooked by the data management community, even though these are often the most time-consuming tasks for analysts. To make the iterative process of model selection easier and faster, we envision a unifying abstract framework that acts as a basis for a new class of analytics systems that we call model selection management systems (MSMS). We discuss how time-tested ideas from database research offer new avenues to improving model selection, and outline how MSMSs are a new frontier for interesting and impactful data management research.", "paper_title": "Model Selection Management Systems: The Next Frontier of Advanced Analytics", "paper_id": "WOS:000375707600002"}
