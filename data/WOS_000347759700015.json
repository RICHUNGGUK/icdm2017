Physical constraints are derived for stochastic climate models but are applicable for many fluid systems. A condition is derived for global stability of stochastic climate models based on energy conservation. Stochastic climate models are globally stable when a quadratic form, which is related to the cubic nonlinear operator, is negative definite. A new algorithm for the efficient sampling of such negative definite matrices is developed and also for imputing unobserved data which improve the accuracy of the parameter estimates. The performance of this framework is evaluated on two conceptual climate models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
