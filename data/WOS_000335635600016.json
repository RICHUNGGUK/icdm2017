The proposed P-Box algorithm takes advantage of Gray code properties and allows fast encryption with high information diffusion. The algorithm is optimized for integer q-bit operations (q=8, 16, 32,...), allowing a direct implementation in almost any hardware platform, while avoiding rounding errors of floating-point operations. By combining the P-Box with chaotic S-Box based on the logistic map, we design a complete, highly secure and fast cryptosystem. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
