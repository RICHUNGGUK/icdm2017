It also explores the benefits of Carry-Save format numbers in this decimation filter. After trading off between area and power consumption, we propose to use shift-and-adder for high data rate decimation stages and hardware multiply-accumulator for low data rate stages. The proposed decimation filter chain exploits the advantage of all architectures and exhibit the best area-power trade-off. It is implemented using 45 nm CMOS technology. The proposed design reduces power by 13.7% without area overhead, compared with a conventional filter chain using only binary number. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
