A nonlinear control law is constructed in the Lyapunov stability analysis framework. This control law achieves a global asymptotic stability of the system based on the usual requirements for reference velocities. The control law is extensively analysed and compared to some existing, globally stable control laws. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
