We have designed an empirical validation framework to demonstrate that the new framework provides the same security level as BeeHiveGuard, a digital signature based cryptography framework. But the processing and communication costs of the new framework are significantly smaller as compared to BeeHiveGuard.", "paper_title": "BeeHiveAIS: A simple, efficient, scalable and secure routing framework inspired by Artificial Immune Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400063"}
