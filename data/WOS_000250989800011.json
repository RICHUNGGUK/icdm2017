We introduce an innovative topology that considerably enhances the design space of MML circuits thus provides more functionality achievable within an atomic multiple-valued circuit. The functional correctness of the design has been proved by numerical simulations using Pspice.", "paper_title": "Multiple-valued logic circuits design using negative differential resistance devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000250989800011"}
