However, multiple simultaneous failures may occur in large-scale complex virtual paths of MPLS/GMPLS networks. In this paper, we present a dynamic MPLS/GMPLS path management strategy in which the path recovery mechanism can rapidly find an optimal backup path which satisfies the resilience constraints under multiple link failure occurrences. We derived the conditions to test the existence of resilience-guaranteed backup path, and developed a decomposition theorem and backup path construction algorithm for the fast restoration of resilience-guaranteed backup paths, for the primary path with an arbitrary configuration. Finally, simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Dynamic path management with resilience constraints under multiple link failures in MPLS/GMPLS networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258027100002"}
