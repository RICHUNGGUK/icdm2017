In the design of the Storage structures that we present, properties of healthcare data and fundamental types of queries on the healthcare data are taken into account as well as the constraints of the smart cards. We compare the space and time efficiency of the proposed storage structures for various types of queries. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
