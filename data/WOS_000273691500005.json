The purpose of the SPEC MPI2007 benchmark and its run rules is to further the cause of fair and objective benchmarking of high-performance computing systems. The rules help to ensure that the published results are meaningful, comparable to other results, and reproducible. MPI2007 includes 13 technical computing applications from the fields of computational fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, electromagnetism, geophysics, ray tracing, and hydrodynamics. We describe the benchmark suite, and compare it with other benchmark suites.
