The classical updating scheme is replaced by stochastic versions which either randomly update cells or disrupt the cell-to-cell transmission of information. We then use the novel updating schemes to probe the behaviour of elementary cellular automata, and observe a wide variety of results. We study these behaviours in the scope of macroscopic statistical phenomena and microscopic analysis. Finally, we discuss the possibility to use updating schemes to probe the robustness of complex systems.", "paper_title": "Probing robustness of cellular automata through variations of asynchronous updating", "paper_id": "WOS:000312130900002"}
