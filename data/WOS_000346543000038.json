In this paper we develop a new variant of variable neighborhood search for solving the problem. The extensive computational results show that our new heuristic significantly outperforms the current state of the art. Moreover, the best known solutions have been improved on 531 out of 540 test instances from the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
