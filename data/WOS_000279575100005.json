Making IR-UWB localization technology a growing hot topic in recent research field, therefore, it is necessary for us to give an overview of it in this paper. The TOA estimation, error analysis, NLOS identification and NLOS localization are studied in details based on the ranging methods. Simultaneously the UWB localization applications and practical problems are pointed out. At last, we outline the challenges for further research of IR-UWB localization.", "paper_title": "A survey on impulse-radio UWB localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000279575100005"}
