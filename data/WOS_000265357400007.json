The proposed configurations are suitable choices for broadband chip filters integrated in printed circuit boards, especially for those with constraints on size and loss. Low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology can be used to manufacture such filters. To validate the idea, prototypes of Chebyshev and elliptic function filters are designed following a systematic procedure. Stepped impedance stripline resonators are used in the Chebyshev filter to improve the spurious response. A novel canonical structure is presented for achieving high selectivity elliptic function filter responses. Rigorous mode matching method is applied to analyze and optimize all the filters, whose results are validated by commercial software. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
