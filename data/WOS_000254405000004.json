In the proposed scheme, the intra-prediction mode and motion vector difference are encrypted with the length-kept encryption algorithm (LKE) in order to keep the format compliance, and the residue data of the macroblocks are encrypted with the residue data encryption algorithm (RDE) in order to keep low cost. Additionally, a key distribution scheme is proposed to keep the robustness to transmission errors, which assigns sub-keys to different frames or slices independently. The encryption scheme's security, time efficiency and error robustness are analyzed in detail. Experimental results show that the encryption scheme keeps file format unchanged, is secure against replacement attacks, is efficient in computing, and is robust to some transmission errors. These properties make it a suitable choice for real-time applications, such as secure IPTV, secure videoconference or mobile/wireless multimedia, etc.", "paper_title": "Efficient video encryption scheme based on advanced video coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000254405000004"}
