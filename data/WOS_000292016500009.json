A high linearity CMOS configuration for a CDTA is made up of high linearity input and output stages. The proposed CDTA provides high output impedance at port X and excellent input/output current tracking. A biquad filter circuit was chosen as an application example in order to demonstrate the performance of the CDTA. PSpice simulation results using a TSMC 0.35-mu m CMOS process model were included to verify the expected values.", "paper_title": "A new, improved CMOS realization of CDTA and its filter applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000292016500009"}
