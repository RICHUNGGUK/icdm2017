This model allows to transfer logic problems into algebraic terms, resulting in an immediate computational approach to Knowledge Based Systems based on multi-valued logics. By means of this new approach, we have extended an already existent algebraic model to logics with a prime power number of truth values, while also getting more straightforward proofs and a more direct enunciation of the central theorem of this model.", "paper_title": "A Polynomial Model for Logics with a Prime Power Number of Truth Values", "paper_id": "WOS:000287185000003"}
