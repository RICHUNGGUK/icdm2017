Technology trends in software development signify a move from component-based to service-oriented approach, therefore SWF will inevitably need appropriate tools to discover and integrate heterogeneous services. In this paper we present the SODIUM platform consisting of a set of languages and tools as well as related middleware, for the development and execution of scientific workflows composed of heterogeneous services.", "paper_title": "Developing Scientific Workflows from heterogeneous services", "paper_id": "WOS:000238891500004"}
