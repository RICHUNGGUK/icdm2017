Based on insights from perceptual psychology, the problem of human action recognition is approached on the understanding that activities are hierarchical, temporally constrained and at times temporally overlapped. A hierarchical Bayesian network (HBN) based on a stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG) is implemented to address the hierarchical nature of human activity recognition. Then it is shown how the HBN is applied to different substrings in a sequence of primitive action symbols via deleted interpolation (DI) to recognize temporally overlapped activities. Results from the analysis of action sequences based on video surveillance data show the validity of the approach.", "paper_title": "RECOGNIZING OVERLAPPED HUMAN ACTIVITIES FROM A SEQUENCE OF PRIMITIVE ACTIONS VIA DELETED INTERPOLATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000262598400004"}
