Little work has been done in proposing a hybrid shape descriptor that works for both retrieval scenarios, let alone the integration of the component features of the hybrid shape descriptor in an automatic way. In this paper, we propose a hybrid shape descriptor that integrates both geodesic distance-based global features and curvature-based local features. We also develop an automatic algorithm to generate meta similarity resulting from different component features of the hybrid shape descriptor based on Particle Swarm Optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our framework, as well as the significant improvements in retrieval performances. The framework is general and can be applied to similar approaches that integrate more features for the development of a single algorithm for both non-rigid and partial 3D model retrieval.", "paper_title": "Hybrid shape descriptor and meta similarity generation for non-rigid and partial 3D model retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000339891300023"}
