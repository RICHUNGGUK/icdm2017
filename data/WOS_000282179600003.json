Under fairly general conditions, monotonicity with respect to the (state- and time-dependent) routing matrices is shown. Under more restrictive assumptions, monotonicity with respect to the service rates is shown as well. We conclude by using the comparison results to establish a moment bound, a stability result for stochastic fluid networks with L,vy inputs, and a comparison result for multi-class GPS networks.", "paper_title": "Pathwise comparison results for stochastic fluid networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000282179600003"}
