Our approach is both theoretical and experimental since our goal is to obtain a random model that is able to capture the real-data complexity. Starting from a model that generalizes the Erdos-Renyi model [10,11], we obtain asymptotic estimations on the average number of transversals, irredundants and minimal transversals in a random hypergraph. We use those results to obtain an upper bound on the average complexity of algorithms to generate the minimal transversals of a hypergraph. Then we make our random model more complex in order to bring it closer to real-data and identify cases where the average number of minimal transversals is at most polynomial, quasi-polynomial or exponential.
