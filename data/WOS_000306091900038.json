We propose a fast segmentation method to reduce laborious manual efforts and conveniently provide robust and stable cardiac quantification to users. The proposed method provides a very simple energy functional form using a predetermined Rayleigh distribution parameter so that the corresponding steepest descent approach with some shape constraints on contour is still capable of fast segmentation. We present several experimental results on two-dimensional echocardiography data for the performance of the proposed model. The experiments show that the proposed model is especially useful when a part of target boundary is seriously corrupted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
