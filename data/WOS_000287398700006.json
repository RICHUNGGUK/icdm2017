The proposed shunt regulator used a single Miller compensation capacitor to increase stability. The current-mode shunt regulator helps the transient response to be faster than the voltage-mode low-dropout regulator (LDO) and the power noise (bounce noise) is smaller than one. The proposed current-mode shunt regulator has been fabricated with TSMC 0.35 mu m 2P4M CMOS technology. The experimental results show the transient-response time is only 400 ns within 0.5% error and the maximum output voltage dip is only 70 mV for full loading current variation. Moreover, the line and load regulations are 26 mu V/mA and 8 ppm/mA, respectively. The dropout current is 1.0741 mA for loading current 150 mA. The active chip area is 226 mu m x 310 mu m.", "paper_title": "A new current-mode fast-transient-response shunt regulator using CMOS technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000287398700006"}
