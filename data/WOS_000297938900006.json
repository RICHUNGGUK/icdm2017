However, due to the high conductivity of the rare-earth magnet, neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB), and slot/tooth harmonics, there is eddy current loss generated inside the magnets. This loss may not attribute very much to the efficiency of the motor, but the temperature-rise inside the magnets caused by this loss can lead to the unpredictable deterioration of the magnets, such as the degradation of performance and potential demagnetization. In addition, the output voltage of pulse-width-modulated (PWM) inverter contains abundant high frequency harmonics, which induce excessive loss in the magnets. The excessive heat in PM motor induced by the eddy current loss combined with other losses can degrade the performance of the machine. This paper presents the modeling and analysis of eddy current loss in surface-mounted-magnets PM synchronous motors (SPMSM) and interior-magnets PM synchronous motors (IPMSM), operated by PWM inverter supply. Analytical methods are implemented, in conjunction with time-stepped finite-element analysis (FEA) for the calculation of eddy current loss in the magnet. Based on the calculated losses in the machines, simplified analytical models are developed as thermal circuits with network of interconnected nodes, thermal resistances and heat sources representing the heat processes within the SPMSM and IPMSM, to predict the temperature of the magnets. The predicted machine temperatures are found to be consistent with the experimental measurement.", "paper_title": "MODELING OF EDDY CURRENT LOSS AND TEMPERATURE OF THE MAGNETS IN PERMANENT MAGNET MACHINES", "paper_id": "WOS:000297938900006"}
