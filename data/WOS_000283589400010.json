The problem to find a minimum multicasting tree is NP-hard, and all the existing algorithms are heuristics. Most of them are based on the idea of being greed. A greedy idea is always shortsighted. While it could get a good local effect, it would obtain a somewhat bad global performance. In this article, we propose a foresighted strategy for greed-based multicasting algorithms. With the co-action of the greedy idea and a foresighted strategy, a multicasting algorithm can get a good local and global performance simultaneously. We introduce the strategy by embedding it in the Member-Only algorithm and investigate two indexes, the average cost of all multicasting requests and the blocking rate of the whole network. Simulation results show that, with the presence of the proposed foresighted strategy, these two targets are all obviously decreased.", "paper_title": "A foresighted strategy for greed-based multicasting algorithms in all-optical mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000283589400010"}
