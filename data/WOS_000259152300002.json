A sufficient condition is derived to ensure the stability of grey discrete-time systems with time delay. Mathematical analysis reveals that the stability criterion of the proposed is less conservative than that of previous result. Examples are provided to illustrate the application of the result. The result of this study provides an additional option for the stability examination of the grey discreet-time systems.", "paper_title": "Sufficient condition for stability analysis of grey discrete-time systems with time delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000259152300002"}
