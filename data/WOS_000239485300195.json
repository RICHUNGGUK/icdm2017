The HANNP has RISC based architecture leading to an effective general digital signal processing and artificial neural networks computation. The architecture of a HANNP including the general digital processing units such as 64-bit floating-point arithmetic unit (FPU), a control unit (CU) and neural network processing units such as artificial neural computing unit (NNPU), specialized neural data bus and interface unit, etc. The HANNP is modeled in Veilog HDL and implemented with FPGA. Character recognition problems and Kohonen self-organization problems are applied to the proposed HANNP to justify its applicability to real engineering problems.", "paper_title": "Implementation of a neural network processor based on RISC architecture for various signal processing applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300195"}
