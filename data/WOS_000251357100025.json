Comparing to the conventional approach which treats fusion classifier design and performance evaluation as a two-stage process, this work directly optimizes the target performance with respect to fusion classifier design. Based on a smooth approximation to the total error rate of identity verification, a deterministic solution is proposed to solve the fusion optimization problem. The proposed method is applied to a face and iris verification fusion problem addressing the demand for high security in the modem networked society. Our empirical evaluations show promising potential in terms of decision accuracy and computing efficiency. (C) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
