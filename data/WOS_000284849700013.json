Network resilience is provided through a shared backup path protection scheme, enhanced with a reinforced sharing mechanism. The results indicate that the IAR scheme provides significantly lower connection blocking compared with traditional minimum-hop routing because physical impairments have a significant contribution to the overall network blocking probability. Dual-link failures are also considered, and the performance of a network designed to be resilient to single-link failures is evaluated. Simulation results show low connection loss rates due to dual failures that can be further improved using a restoration mechanism activated on the occurrence of dual failures.", "paper_title": "Performance Evaluation of Impairment-Aware Routing Under Single- and Double-Link Failures", "paper_id": "WOS:000284849700013"}
