This paper presents a master-slave swarms shuffling evolution algorithm based on self-adaptive particle swarm optimization (MSSE-SPSO), which combines a particle swarm optimization with self-adaptive, hierarchical and multi-swarms shuffling evolution strategies. By comparison with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a master-slave swarms shuffling evolution algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (MSSE-PSO), MSSE-SPSO is also applied to identify HIMS hydrological model to demonstrate the feasibility of calibrating hydrological model. The results show that MSSE-SPSO remarkably improves the calculation accuracy and is an effective approach to calibrate hydrological model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
