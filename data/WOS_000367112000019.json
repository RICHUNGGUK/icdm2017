Brownian dynamics simulations were performed to study self-assembly of the linear amphiphilic block copolymers with the same hydrophilic head, but hydrophobic tails of different lengths. Critical micelle concentration (CMC), gyration radius distribution, micelle size distribution, density profiles of micelles, shape anisotropy, and dynamics of micellization were investigated as a function of tail length. Simulation results were compared with predictions from theory and simulation for mixed systems of block copolymers with long and short hydrophobic tail, reported in our previous work. Interestingly, the equilibrium structural and dynamic parameters of pure and mixed block copolymers were similarly dependant on the intrinsic/apparent hydrophobic block length. Log (CMC)\"was, however; proportional to the tail length and had a different behavior compared to the mixed system. The power law scaling relation of equilibrium structural parameters for amphiphilic block copolymers predicts the same dependence for similar hydrophobic tail lengths, but the power law prediction of CMC is different, which is due to its simplifying assumptions as discussed here.
