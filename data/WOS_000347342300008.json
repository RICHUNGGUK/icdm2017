This kind of obstacles are especially challenging because they cannot be detected by the walking stick or the guide dog. The algorithm captures the 3-D data of the scene through stereo vision. To our knowledge, this is the first work that presents a technology able to obtain real 3-D measures with smartphones in real time. The orientation sensors of the device (magnetometer and accelerometer) are used to approximate the walking direction of the user, in order to look for the obstacles only in such a direction. The obtained 3-D data are compressed and then linearized for detecting the potential obstacles. Potential obstacles are tracked in order to accumulate enough evidence to alert the user only when a real obstacle is found. In the experimental section, we show the results of the algorithm in several situations using real data and helped by VI users.", "paper_title": "Aerial Obstacle Detection With 3-D Mobile Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000347342300008"}
