The phase information obtained from 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of images contains important information of image representation. The phase-based image matching, especially BLPOC-based image matching, is successfully applied to image recognition tasks for biometric recognition applications. To calculate the matching score, the proposed algorithm corrects the global and local deformation between FKP images using phase-based correspondence matching and the BLPOC-based local block matching, respectively. Experimental evaluation using the PolyU FKP database demonstrates the efficient recognition performance of the proposed algorithm compared with the state-of-the-art conventional algorithms.
