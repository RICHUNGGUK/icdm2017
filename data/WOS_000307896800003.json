It is now well understood that the choice of the sparsity regularization term is critical in the success of such models. Based on a codelength minimization interpretation of sparse coding, and using tools from universal coding theory, we propose a framework for designing sparsity regularization terms which have theoretical and practical advantages when compared with the more standard l(0) or l(1) ones. The presentation of the framework and theoretical foundations is complemented with examples that show its practical advantages in image denoising, zooming and classification.", "paper_title": "Universal Regularizers for Robust Sparse Coding and Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000307896800003"}
