Following a discussion of high performance packages used by White and Houseman to analyze social networks from marital data, the authors present examples from their research that suggest that even apparently trivial, nonanalytic tasks that form part of the process of preparing data for higher end analyses may yield exciting and productive results. The authors conclude with a statement on the nature of science in anthropology and the implications for the types of software that will be most useful.", "paper_title": "Kinship, computing, and anthropology", "paper_id": "WOS:000234716600003"}
