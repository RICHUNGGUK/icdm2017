Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is feasible for the localization problem because of its quick convergence and moderate demand for computing resources. This paper proposes a distributed two-phase PSO algorithm to solve the flip ambiguity problem, and improve the efficiency and precision. In this work, the initial search space is defined by bounding box method and a refinement phase is put forward to correct the error due to flip ambiguity. Moreover, the unknown nodes which only have two references or three near-collinear references are tried to be localized in our research. Simulation results indicate that the proposed distributed localization algorithm is superior to the previous algorithms.", "paper_title": "An Improved PSO Algorithm for Distributed Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000359217600001"}
