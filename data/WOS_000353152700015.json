Existing node-deletion-based algorithms usually fail to find high-quality solutions due to their easy stagnation in local optima, especially when the scale of the problem grows large. In this paper, a new algorithm for the MBBP, evolutionary algorithm with structure mutation (EA/SM), is proposed. In the EA/SM framework, local search complemented with a repair-assisted restart process is adopted. A new mutation operator, SM, is proposed to enhance the exploration during the local search process. The SM can change the structure of solutions dynamically while keeping their size (fitness) and the feasibility unchanged. It implements a kind of large mutation in the structure space of MBBP to help the algorithm escape from local optima. An MBBP-specific local search operator is designed to improve the quality of solutions efficiently; besides, a new repair-assisted restart process is introduced, in which the Marchiori's heuristic repair is modified to repair every new solution reinitialized by an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA)-like process. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a large set of benchmark graphs with various scales and densities. Experimental results show that: 1) EA/SM produces significantly better results than the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms; 2) it also outperforms a repair-based EDA and a repair-based genetic algorithm on all benchmark graphs; and 3) the advantages of EA/SM are mainly due to the introduction of the new SM operator and the new repair-assisted restart process.", "paper_title": "A New Evolutionary Algorithm with Structure Mutation for the Maximum Balanced Biclique Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000353152700015"}
