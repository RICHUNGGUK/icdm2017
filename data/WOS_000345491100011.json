The functions known as means (or averages) are idempotent and typically are monotone, however there are many important classes of means that are non-monotone. Weak monotonicity was recently proposed as a relaxation of the monotonicity condition for averaging functions. In this paper we discuss the concepts of directional and cone monotonicity, and monotonicity with respect to majority of inputs and coalitions of inputs. We establish the relations between various kinds of monotonicity, and illustrate it on various examples. We also provide a construction method for cone monotone functions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
