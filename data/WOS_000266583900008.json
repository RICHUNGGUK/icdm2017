We prove two theorems that imply tighter upper bounds for deciding the uniqueness of normal forms ( U N(=)) and unique normalization (U N(->)) properties under certain conditions. From these theorems we derive a new and simpler polynomial-time algorithm for the U N(=) property of ground rewrite systems, and explicit upper bounds for both U N(=) and U N(->) properties of left-linear right-ground systems. We also show that both properties are undecidable for right-ground systems. It was already known that these properties are undecidable for linear systems. Hence, in a sense the decidability results are \"close\" to optimal.", "paper_title": "Complexity of Normal Form Properties and Reductions for Term Rewriting Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000266583900008"}
