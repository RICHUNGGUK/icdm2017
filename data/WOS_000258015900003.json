The existing facilities may be located at any subset of vertices. Upper and lower bounds are proposed for both the discrete and continuous models. In the discrete model, a median path is not allowed to contain partial edges. in the continuous model, a median path may contain partial edges. The proposed upper bounds for these two models are O(n log n) and O(n log n alpha(n)), respectively. They improve the previous known bounds from O(n log(2) n) and O(n(2)), respectively. The proposed lower bounds are both Omega(n log n). (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
