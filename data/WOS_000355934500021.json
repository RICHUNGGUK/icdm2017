Traditional uncertain differential equation can only deal with a continuous dynamic uncertain system. To model the sharp drifts embedded in an uncertain dynamic system, this paper proposes a type of uncertain differential equation driven by a canonical Liu process and an uncertain renewal process, which is called an uncertain differential equation with jumps. A sufficient condition for the proposed equation having a unique solution is first given, then a concept of stability for the proposed equation is provided in the sense of uncertain measure, and its sufficient condition is also derived.", "paper_title": "Uncertain differential equation with jumps", "paper_id": "WOS:000355934500021"}
