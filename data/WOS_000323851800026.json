Compared with the conventional correlation filters in Class-dependence Feature Analysis (CFA), UOOTF improves the overall performance for unseen patterns by removing the hard constraints on the origin correlation outputs during the filter design. To handle non-linearly separable distributions between different classes, we further develop a non-linear extension of UOOTF based on the kernel technique. The kernel extension of UOOTF allows for higher flexibility of the decision boundary due to a wider range of non-linearity properties. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed unconstrained correlation filter and its kernelization in the task of face recognition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
