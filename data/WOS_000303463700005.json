On the one hand, due to the use of differential phase shift keying modulation, triple-play service including point-to-point service and broadcast service is realized. On the other hand, the wavelengths can be allocated dynamically by means of the special design of the remote node. What is more important is this network architecture can provide flexible protection modes for either single or multiple failures as well. The network survivability could be improved largely.", "paper_title": "A reliable WDM optical access network enabling dynamic wavelength allocation and triple-play service", "paper_id": "WOS:000303463700005"}
