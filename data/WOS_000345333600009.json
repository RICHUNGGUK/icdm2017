However, the complex congestion window evolution of network coded TCP (TCP-NC) makes the analysis of end-to-end throughput challenging. This paper analyzes the evolutionary process of TCP-NC against lossy links. An analytic model is established by applying a two-dimensional Markov chain. With maximum window size, end-to-end erasure rate and redundancy parameter as input parameters, the analytic model can reflect window evolution and calculate end-to-end throughput of TCP-NC precisely. The key point of our model is that by the novel definition of the states of Markov chain, both the number of related states and the computation complexity are substantially reduced. Our work helps to understand the factors that affect TCP-NC's performance and lay the foundation of its optimization. Extensive simulations on NS2 show that the analytic model features fairly high accuracy.", "paper_title": "Analytic Throughput Model for Network Coded TCP in Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345333600009"}
