The sensitivity of the following model outputs was evaluated: the ambient CO2 concentration, the rate of CO2 uptake by the plant, the ambient O-3 concentration, the flux of O-3 from the air to the plant/soil boundary and the flux of O-3 taken up by the plant alone. The most sensitive model inputs for the majority of outputs were: The Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fractional Vegetation Cover (Fr), Cuticle Resistance (CR) and Vegetation Height (VH). The influence of the external CO2 on the leaf and O-3 concentration in the air as input parameters was also significant. Our study provides an important step forward in the global efforts towards SimSphere verification given the increasing interest in its use as an independent modelling or educational tool. Results of this study are also timely given the ongoing global efforts focused on deriving, at an operational level, spatio-temporal estimates of energy fluxes and soil moisture content using SimSphere synergistically with Earth Observation (EO) data.
