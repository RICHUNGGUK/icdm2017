As the feature size of VLSIs decreases to the nano-meter region, the work to obtain an accurate gate delay value becomes more difficult and time consuming than ever. The conventional methods usually use iterative algorithms to ensure the accuracy of the effective capacitance C-eff, which is usually used to compute the gate delay with interconnect loads and to capture the output signal shape of the real gate response. Accordingly, the efficiency is sacrificed. In this paper, an accurate and efficient approach is proposed for gate delay estimation. With the linear relationship of gate output time points and C-eff, a polynomial approximation is used to make the nonlinear effective capacitance equation be solved without iterative method. Compared to the conventional methods, the proposed method improves the efficiency of gate delay calculation. Meanwhile, experimental results show that the proposed method is in good agreement with SPICE results and the average error is 2.8%.", "paper_title": "A Non-Iterative Method for Calculating the Effective Capacitance of CMOS Gates with Interconnect Load Effect", "paper_id": "WOS:000292619200004"}
