The over-represented and under-represented symbols in a particular position are shown above and below the zero line. When the sequences are in open reading frames, the background frequency of nucleotides could be calculated separately for the three positions of a codon, thus greatly reducing the background noise. The chi(2)-test or Fishers exact test is used to evaluate the statistical significance of every symbol in every position and only those that are significant are highlighted in the resulting logo. The perl source code of the program is freely available and can be run locally.", "paper_title": "BLogo: a tool for visualization of bias in biological sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000259581900020"}
