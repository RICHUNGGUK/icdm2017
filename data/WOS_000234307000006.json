On the other hand, their metallic counterparts have often been regarded as ideal interconnects for future technology generations. Owing to their high current densities and increased reliability, metallic single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) have been subjects of fundamental research, both in theory, as well as experiments. Metallic CNTs have been modeled for radio-frequency (RF) applications using a transmission-line model. In this paper, we present an efficient circuit-compatible RLC model for metallic SWCNTs, and analyze the impact of SWCNTs on the performance of ultrascaled digital very large scale integration (VLSI) design.", "paper_title": "Modeling of metallic carbon-nanotube interconnects for circuit simulations and a comparison with Cu interconnects for scaled technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000234307000006"}
