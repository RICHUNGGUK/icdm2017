In this paper, we present the revamped design of the complete system and the implementation of a middleware entity utilizing concepts present in the emerging MPEG-21 framework. More specifically, all multimedia content is packaged in a self-contained \"digital item\", containing both the binary information (video, graphics, etc.) required for the playback, as well as structured representations of the different entities that can handle this item and the actions they can perform on it. This module essentially stands between the different components of the integrated content preparation system, thereby not disrupting their original functionality at all; additional tweaks are performed in the receiver sides, as well, to ensure that the additional information and provisions are respected. The outcome of this design upgrade is that IPR issues are dealt with successfully, both with respect to the content itself and to the functionality of the subscription levels; in addition to this, end users can be presented with personalized forms of the final content, e.g., viewing in-play virtual advertisements that match their shopping habits and preferences, thus enhancing the viewing experience and creating more revenue opportunities via targeted advertisements.
