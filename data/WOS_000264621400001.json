The integration overcomes the two-dimensional constraint of conventional GIS by supplementing advance tools for three-dimensional, dynamic visualization. The application of a GIS-based interface module together with the three-dimensional, dynamic display tools enhances communication of relationships and trends of hydrodynamic and pollutant transport simulation in both spatial and temporal context, and thus promotes better coastal water quality planning and management. Model functionality includes input data viewing and editing, mesh grid configuration, and result interpretation. The functionality of the GIS-model integrated system is illustrated through a case study on the Pearl River Estuary (PRE). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
