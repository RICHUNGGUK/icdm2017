In this paper we propose a method for generating the motions of characters using multidimensional keyframe animation in parallel with real-time physical simulation. The method generates characters capable of physical interaction, and also allows animators to use traditional methods for designing character motion. We have implemented the system and confirmed its effectiveness experimentally.", "paper_title": "Physics-driven Multi Dimensional Keyframe Animation for Artist-directable Interactive Character", "paper_id": "WOS:000264544700013"}
