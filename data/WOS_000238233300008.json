Through the algorithm proposed here, a system engineer or user need no labor of determining the values of gains and parameters to be used. In the system, a subject with data glove imitated the same motion with a dexterous robot hand which was moving according to a certain mathematical function. Autoregressive models were adapted to the matching, where each joint angle in the robot and data glove data of the human were used as object and explanatory variables respectively. The partial regression coefficients were estimated by means of singular value decomposition with a system-noise reduction algorithm utilizing statistical properties. The experimental results showed that the robot hand was controlled with high accuracy with small delay, suggesting that the method proposed in this study is proper and easy way and is adaptive to many other systems between a pair of motion-measurement device and output device.", "paper_title": "Dexterous robot hand control with data glove by human imitation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233300008"}
