In previous work, systematic ACM synthesis methods have been proposed. In this paper, we advance this work by developing algorithms and software tools which automate most of the ACM synthesis process. Firstly, an interleaving specification is constructed in the form of a state graph, and secondly, a Petri net model of an \"ACM-type\" is derived using the theory of regions. The method is applied to a number of \"standard\" writing and reading policies of ACMs with shared memory and unidirectional control variables.", "paper_title": "Automating synthesis of asynchronous communication mechanisms", "paper_id": "WOS:000248389400004"}
