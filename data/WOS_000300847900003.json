Through an examination of ethnographic research conducted at an urban after-school learning program we show how social, technological and power infrastructures influence learning and interaction in this setting. Adopting a holistic approach we examine how technologies are integrated into activities in this program to support the learning of the after-school youth. We emphasize both positive and negative infrastructures that contribute to the learning environment and discuss how identifying these infrastructures are one of the first steps towards understanding and informing technology design in informal learning settings.", "paper_title": "Social Infrastructures as Barriers and Foundation for Informal Learning: Technology Integration in an Urban After-School Center", "paper_id": "WOS:000300847900003"}
