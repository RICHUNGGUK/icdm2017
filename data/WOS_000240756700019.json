The adaptive coding scheme utilizes stochastic learning-based weak estimation techniques to adaptively update the probabilities of the source symbols, and this is done without resorting to either maximum likelihood, Bayesian, or sliding-window methods. The authors have incorporated the estimator in the adaptive Fano coding scheme and in an adaptive entropy-based scheme that \"resembles\" the well-known arithmetic coding. The empirical results obtained for both of these adaptive methods are obtained on real-life files that possess a fair degree of non-stationarity. From these results, it can be seen that the proposed schemes compress nearly 10% more than their respective adaptive methods that use maximum-likelihood estimator-based estimates.", "paper_title": "Stochastic automata-based estimators for adaptively compressing files with nonstationary distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000240756700019"}
