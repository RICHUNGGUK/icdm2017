To understand how mobile user's viewing experience is impacted, we conducted a field user study with 42 participants in two typical usage contexts using a custom-designed iPhone application. With user's acceptance of mobile video quality as the index, the study addresses four influence aspects of user experiences, including context, content type, encoding parameters and user profiles. Accompanying the quantitative method (acceptance assessment), we used a qualitative interview method to obtain a deeper understanding of a user's assessment criteria and to support the quantitative results from a user's perspective. Based on the results from data analysis, we advocate two user-driven strategies to adaptively provide an acceptable quality and to predict a good user experience, respectively. There are two main contributions from this paper. Firstly, the field user study allows a consideration of more influencing factors into the research on user experience of mobile video. And these influences are further demonstrated by user's opinions. Secondly, the proposed strategies - user-driven acceptance threshold adaptation and user experience prediction - will be valuable in mobile video delivery for optimizing user experience.", "paper_title": "EXPLORATION AND OPTIMIZATION OF USER EXPERIENCE IN VIEWING VIDEOS ON A MOBILE PHONE", "paper_id": "WOS:000289955900002"}
