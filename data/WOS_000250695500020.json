Support vector machines (SVMs) are widely used in pattern classification and have produced high accuracy when performing fingerprint classification. In order to effectively apply SVMs to multi-class fingerprint classification systems, we propose a novel method in which the SVMs are generated with the one-vs-all (OVA) scheme and dynamically ordered with naive Bayes classifiers. This is necessary to break the ties that frequently occur when working with multi-class classification systems that use OVA SVMs. More specifically, it uses representative fingerprint features as the FingerCode, singularities and pseudo ridges to train the OVA SVMs and naive Bayes classifiers. The proposed method has been validated on the NIST-4 database and produced a classification accuracy of 90.8% for five-class classification with the statistical significance. The results show the benefits of integrating different fingerprint features as well as the usefulness of the proposed method in multi-class fingerprint classification.
