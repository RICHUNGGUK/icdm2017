This paper presents a protein-protein interaction extraction system BioPPIExtractor for biomedical literature. This system applies Conditional Random Fields model to tag protein names in biomedical text, then uses a link grammar parser to identify the syntactic roles in sentences and at last extracts complete interactions by analyzing the matching contents of syntactic roles and their linguistically significant combinations. Experimental evaluations with two other state of the art extraction systems indicate that BioPPlExtractor system achieves better performance. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
