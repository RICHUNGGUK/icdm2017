The basic idea is to use floorplanning to guide the placement of objects at the global level. The flow consists of four steps: (1) The objects in the original netlist are clustered into blocks; (2) floorplanning is performed on the blocks; (3) the blocks are shifted within the chip region to further optimize the wirelength; (4) with large macro-locations fixed, incremental placement is applied to place the remaining objects. There are several advantages to handling placement at the global level with a floorplanning technique. First, the problem size can be significantly reduced. Second, exact Half-Perimeter WireLength (HPWL) can be minimized. Third, better object distribution can be achieved so that legalization only needs to handle minor overlaps among small objects in a block. Fourth, macro-rotation and various geometry constraints can be handled. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new flow, we implement a high-quality and efficient floorplan-guided placer called FLOP. We also construct the Modern Mixed-Size (MMS) placement benchmarks that can effectively represent the complexities of modern mixed-size designs and the challenges faced by modern mixed-size placers. Compared with most state-of-the-art mixed-size placers and leading macroplacers, experimental results show that FLOP achieves the best HPWL and easily obtains legal solutions on all circuits with all geometry constraints satisfied.", "paper_title": "An Effective Floorplan-Guided Placement Algorithm for Large-Scale Mixed-Size Designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000337808000008"}
