In the first, the weights are iteratively set to weighted component-wise medians, while in the second the generalized median is used, enabling kMER to process symbolic data. Simulations are performed to illustrate the extensions.", "paper_title": "Batch map extensions of the kernel-based maximum entropy learning rule", "paper_id": "WOS:000236361500024"}
