This work offers the possibility of simplifying each subobject independently and at different levels of detail. This way, the user can simplify the whole model and then modify some parts, by simplifying more or by refining the desired subobjects. This can be performed while the total number of triangles in the simplified model is maintained. In this method any error metric based on an edge collapse operation can be used. Boundaries between subobjects are preserved and important attributes in the final aspect of simplified models, like normals and texture coordinates, are also considered. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
