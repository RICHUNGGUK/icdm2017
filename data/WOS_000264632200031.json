We show that the maximum correlation values of the proposed sequence families are upper-bounded by 2 root p+5 or 3 root p+4. In addition, we prove that the linear complexity of each sequence in the proposed families is either p-1 or p-p-1/M-1. We also construct an M-ary sequence family from Sidel'nikov sequences of period p(m) - 1 by applying the same method, when M is a divisor of p(m) - 1. The proposed sequence family (F(s)) over tilde has larger size than the known M-ary Sidel'nikov sequence families, whereas they all have the same upper bound on the maximum correlation.", "paper_title": "New M-Ary Sequence Families With Low Correlation and Large Size", "paper_id": "WOS:000264632200031"}
