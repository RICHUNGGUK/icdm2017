Here, A is an element of R-mxn, b is an element of R-m, c is an element of R-n are given. Our algorithm works with finite precision arithmetic. Yet, this precision is variable and is adjusted during the algorithm. Both the finest precision required and the complexity of the algorithm depend on the dimensions n and m as well as on the condition K(A, b, c) introduced in D. Cheung and F.
