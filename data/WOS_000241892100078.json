In this paper, we employ our proposed method, Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO), to solve the IIR digital filters design problem. QPSO, which is inspired by the fundamental theory of Particle Swarm Optimization and quantum mechanics, is a global convergent stochastic searching technique. The merits of the proposed method such as global convergent, robustness and rapid convergence are demonstrated by the experiment results on the low-pass and band-pass IIR filters.", "paper_title": "Design IIR digital filters using Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100078"}
