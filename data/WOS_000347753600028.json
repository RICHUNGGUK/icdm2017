The detection of communities has great significance for understanding the function and organization of networks. Generally, community detection can be formulated as a modularity optimization problem. However, traditional modularity optimization based algorithms have the resolution limit that they may fail to find communities which are smaller than a certain size. In this paper, we propose a cellular learning automata based algorithm for detecting communities in complex networks. Our algorithm models the whole network as an irregular cellular learning automata (ICLA) and reveals the optimal col-ill-flunky structure through the evolution of the cellular learning automata. By interacting with both the global and local environments, our algorithm effectively solves the resolution limit problem of modularity optimization. The experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that our algorithm is effective and efficient at detecting community structure in complex networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
