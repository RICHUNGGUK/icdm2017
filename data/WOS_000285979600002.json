We introduce a bi-criteria approach aiming at maximizing the throughput of the application while minimizing the energy consumed by participating resources. Assuming arbitrary super-linear power consumption laws, we investigate different models, with energy overheads and memory constraints. Building upon closed-form expressions for the uni-processor case, we derive asymptotically optimal solutions for all models.
