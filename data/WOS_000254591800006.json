Distributed shared memory (DSM) implementations on such networks promise high performance even for small applications with small granularity. This paper, after summarizing the architecture of one such implementation called the Simultaneous Multiprocessor Optical Exchange Bus (SOME-Bus), presents simple algorithms for improving the performance of parallel programs running on the SOME-Bus multiprocessor implementing cache-coherent DSM. The algorithms are based on run-time data redistribution via dynamic page migration protocol. They use memory access references together with the information of average channel utilization, average channel waiting time, number of messages in the channel queue or short-term average channel waiting time reported by each node and gathered by hardware monitors to make correct decisions related to the placement of shared data. Simulations with four parallel codes on a 64-processor SOME-Bus show that the algorithms yield significant performance improvements such as reduction in the execution times, number of remote memory accesses, average channel waiting times, average network latencies and increase in average channel utilizations.
