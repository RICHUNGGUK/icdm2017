Being the outer norm of the Mordukhovich coderivative of this multifunction, the condition number can be estimated from above explicitly in terms of the problem data by applying appropriate calculus rules. Here, a chain rule for the extended partial second-order subdifferential recently proved by Mordukhovich and Rockafellar plays a crucial role. The obtained results are illustrated for the example of two-stage stochastic optimization problems with simple recourse.", "paper_title": "Conditioning of linear-quadratic two-stage stochastic optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000344809700008"}
