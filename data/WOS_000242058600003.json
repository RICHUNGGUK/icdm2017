The goal was to explore the integration process of information and communication technologies (ICT) into traditional teaching. Four undergraduate chemistry courses incorporated a course website, an electronic forum, computerized visualizations, and Web-based projects, into their curriculum. The learning technologies were integrated to enhance inquiry-based learning, visualizations, and knowledge sharing. The current study investigated chemistry instructors' perceptions toward ICT and their activities while practicing the newly introduced technologies. The findings showed that integrating new practices is a phase-dependent process that consists of promises as well as complexities. Four transition steps were found to characterize the integration of ICT-learning environments: non-active, support-dependant, partial-independant, and total-independant. Findings indicated that the transition from traditional to ICT-enhanced learning environments involves ambivalent feelings and dichotomy among instructors. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
