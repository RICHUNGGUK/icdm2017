This study presents an Ontology-based Classification and Regression Tree (OCART) approach to induct crash rules on regional highway corridors by adding ontological reasoning to Classification and Regression Tree (CART) decision rules. It develops an ontology-driven geospatial framework to predict the motor vehicles crash severity through the proposed OCART approach. A system prototype has been developed and implemented on a regional highway corridor in order to illustrate and evaluate the proposed method. The results demonstrate the application of ontological reasoning and spatial computation significantly improves the performance of CART crash rules. The proposed method reveals new relationships among crash severities and contributing factors that have been kept implicit in CART decision rules.
