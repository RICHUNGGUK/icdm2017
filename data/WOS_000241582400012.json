The constraint is satisfied if T is a minimum spanning tree of G, where the edge weights are specified by the entries of W. We develop algorithms that filter the domains of all variables to bound consistency.", "paper_title": "The minimum spanning tree constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000241582400012"}
