Based on the HPC model and the LAAD method, a pervasive computing based multimodal tele-home healthcare system is designed and partly implemented using the Waterfall Prototyping Process. The design and implementation issues are discussed in more detail. Some testing results are presented.", "paper_title": "A Pervasive multimodal tele-home healthcare system", "paper_id": "WOS:000236173400008"}
