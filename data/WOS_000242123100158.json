Unlike the existing (deterministic) spline based strategy, the proposed envelope is a result of an optimisation precess and sought as a minimum of a quadratic cost function. A closed form solution of this optimisation problem is obtained and it is shown that by choosing free parameters, we can fine-tune the frequency resolution or the number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) as well as the shape of the envelopes. Computer simulations on both the synthetic and real-world electro-encephalogram (EEG) data support the analysis.", "paper_title": "A flexible method for envelope estimation in empirical mode decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100158"}
