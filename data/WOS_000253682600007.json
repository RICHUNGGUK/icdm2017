The calculations were performed using ab initio molecular orbital calculations (HF), and density functional theory (DFT) with the inclusion of entropic and thermochemical corrections to yield free energies of redox reactions. The electrode potential of DMPID was also obtained experimentally with the aid of an electrochemical technique (cyclic voltammetry). The values for geometric parameters and the vibrational frequencies of DMPID and 2-(6-methyl-3,4-dioxocyclohexa-1,5-dienyl)-2-phenyl-2H-indene-1,3-dione (MDPID) were also computed using the same levels with the basis set of 6-31G(d). The calculated IR spectrum of DMPID used for the assignment of IR frequencies was observed in the experimental FT-IR spectrum and the calculated IR and FT-IR observed spectra of DMPID were compared with correlation factor of 0.996. It should be mentioned that the present work is the first research on coagulant derivative molecules in which the electrode potential of a molecule is calculated.", "paper_title": "Molecular geometry, vibrations and electrode potentials of 2-(4,5-dihydroxy-2-methylphenyl)-2-phenyl-2H-indene-1,3-dione; experimental and theoretical attempts", "paper_id": "WOS:000253682600007"}
