Our analysis of data from the Pew Research Center demonstrates that greater levels of access to the Internet are significantly associated with greater political knowledge and engagement for low SES individuals, but not high SES individuals. We explain our results in the context of incidental learning among the disengaged public during high-profile political events, such as a presidential election.", "paper_title": "Digital Inequality and Participation in the Political Process: Real or Imagined?", "paper_id": "WOS:000323938800007"}
