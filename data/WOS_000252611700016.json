One such issue is developing global enhancement methods that work effectively across the varying illumination. In this paper, we introduce two novel image enhancement algorithms: edge-preserving contrast enhancement, which is able to better preserve edge details while enhancing contrast in images with varying illumination, and a novel multihistogram equalization method which utilizes the human visual system (HVS) to segment the image, allowing a fast and efficient correction of nonuniform illumination. We then extend this HVS-based multihistogram equalization approach to create a general enhancement method that can utilize any combination of enhancement algorithms for an improved performance. Additionally, we propose new quantitative measures of image enhancement, called the logarithmic Michelson contrast measure (AME) and the logarithmic AME by entropy. Many image enhancement methods require selection of operating parameters, which are typically chosen using subjective methods, but these new measures allow for automated selection. We present experimental results for these methods and make a comparison against other leading algorithms.", "paper_title": "Human visual system-based image enhancement and logarithmic contrast measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000252611700016"}
