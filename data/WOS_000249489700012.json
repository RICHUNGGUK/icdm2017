A geometric model adjusted to real data was created by means of semiautomatic contour segmentation of anatomic units from the visible human project and data generated from classical anatomic information. A dynamic model included converting muscular units from their continuous geometric representation into a set of voxels and then real-time interaction and performance. The current implementation enables deformation of the realistic model associated with pushing and stretching interaction, allowing immersion in the anatomy of the inguinal structures. The model does not allow simulation of surgical interventions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
