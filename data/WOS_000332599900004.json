For upsilon epsilon V and r >= 1, we denote by B-G gamma upsilon the ball of radius r and centre upsilon. A set zeta subset of V is said to be an r-identifying code in G if the sets , B-G subset of gamma upsilon boolean AND zeta, upsilon epsilon V, are all nonempty and distinct. A graph G admitting an r-identifying code is called r-twin-free, and in this case the size of a smallest r-identifying code in G is denoted by gamma (r) (G). We study the following structural problem: let G be an r-twin-free graph, and G(*) be a graph obtained from G by adding or deleting an edge. If G(*) is still r-twin-free, we compare the behaviours of gamma (r) (G) and gamma (r) (G(*)), establishing results on their possible differences and ratios.", "paper_title": "Minimum sizes of identifying codes in graphs differing by one edge", "paper_id": "WOS:000332599900004"}
