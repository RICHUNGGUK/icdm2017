The proposed UWB pulses can obtain good performance in NBI suppression. Both of the two chirp pulses require only the time domain processing because of the inherent relationship between the frequency domain and the time domain. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the direct sequence pulse binary amplitude modulation (DS-BPAM) UWB systems with the proposed chirp waveforms can achieve excellent NBI suppression performance and outperform the linear chirp waveform based UWB system significantly.
