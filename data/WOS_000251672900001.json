The protocol introduces a circular directional transmission of the Request To Send (RTS) control packet, spreading around a station information about the intended communication. The stations that receive the directional RTS, using a simple scheme of tracking the neighbors' directions, defer their transmission toward the beams that could harm the ongoing communication. In this way, the proposed protocol takes advantage of the benefits of directional transmissions as the increase of spatial reuse and of coverage range. Additionally, it reduces the hidden-terminal problem, as well as the deafness problem, two main factors for the decrease of the efficiency of directional transmissions in ad hoc networks. The performance evaluation of the protocol shows that it offers a significant improvement in static, as well as mobile, scenarios, as compared to the performance of the proposed protocols that use omnidirectional or directional transmissions.", "paper_title": "CDR-MAC: A protocol for full exploitation of directional antennas in ad hoc wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000251672900001"}
