In the adaptive system training context, the main drawback of utilizing output error entropy as compared to correlation-estimation-based second-order statistics is the computational load of the entropy estimation, which is usually obtained via a plug-in kernel estimator. Sample-spacing estimates offer computationally inexpensive entropy estimators; however, resulting estimates are not differentiable, hence, not suitable for gradient-based adaptation. In this brief paper, we propose a nonparametric entropy estimator that captures the desirable properties of both approaches. The resulting estimator yields continuously differentiable estimates with a computational complexity at the order of those of the sample-spacing techniques. The proposed estimator is compared with the kernel density estimation (KDE)-based entropy estimator in the supervised neural network training framework with computation time and performance comparisons.", "paper_title": "Continuously Differentiable Sample-Spacing Entropy Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000260865800013"}
