To accomplish this result, we demonstrate a DFD display simulator that extends the established DFD principle by using screens in arbitrary configurations and from arbitrary viewpoints. The feasibility of the generalized DFD effect is established with a user study using the simulator. Based on these results, we developed a prototype display using one or two immaterial screens to create an unencumbered 3D visual that users can penetrate, examining the potential for direct walk-through and reach-through manipulation of the 3D scene. We evaluate the prototype system in formative and summative user studies and report the tolerance thresholds discovered for both tracking and projector errors.", "paper_title": "Depth-Fused 3D Imagery on an Immaterial Display", "paper_id": "WOS:000265437500004"}
