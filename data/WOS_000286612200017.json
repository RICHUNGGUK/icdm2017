In turn, the computational power of these abstract computing devices can be understood just looking at their topology, that is, information flow. This line of research is very promising for several aspects: (i) its results are valid for a broad range of systems based on multiset rewriting; (ii) it allows to know the computational power of abstract computing devices without tedious proofs; (iii) it links computational power to topology and, in this way, it opens a broad range of questions. In this paper we summarise the known results on this topic and we list a few suggestions for research together with the relevance of possible outcomes.", "paper_title": "P SYSTEMS AND TOPOLOGY: SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR RESEARCH", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612200017"}
