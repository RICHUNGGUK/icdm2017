The participants were 135 college students, and a quasi-experimental research design was employed. Several learning performance factors of the museum visitors aided with different guided modes were evaluated, including their learning effectiveness, flow experience, the amount of time spent focusing on the paintings, behavioral patterns, and attitude of using the guide systems. The results showed that compared to the audio- and nonguided participants, the AR guide effectively enhanced visitors' learning effectiveness, promoted their flow experience, and extended the amount of time the visitors spent focusing on the paintings. In addition, the visitors' behavioral patterns were dependent upon the guided mode that they used; the visitors who were the most engaged in the gallery experience were those who were using the AR guide. Most of the visitors using the mobile AR-guide system elicited positive responses and acceptance attitudes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
