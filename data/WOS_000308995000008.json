A unified model consisting of a linear dynamic system and a bounded static nonlinear operator is employed to describe these systems, such as chaotic neural networks, Chua's circuits, Henon map, etc. Based on the H-infinity performance analysis of this unified model using the linear matrix inequality approach, H infinity state estimator are designed for this model with sensors to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the estimation error dynamic systems and to reduce the influence of noise on the estimation error. The parameters of these filters are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem. As most discrete-time chaotic systems with or without time delays can be described with this unified model, H-infinity state estimator design for these systems can be done in a unified way. Three numerical examples are exploited to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator design schemes.", "paper_title": "H-infinity State Estimation for Discrete-Time Chaotic Systems Based on a Unified Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000308995000008"}
