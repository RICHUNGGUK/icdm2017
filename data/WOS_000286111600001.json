Query-Driven Visualization (QDV) strategies are among the small subset of techniques that can address both large and highly complex data sets. This paper extends the utility of QDV strategies with a statistics-based framework that integrates nonparametric distribution estimation techniques with a new segmentation strategy to visually identify statistically significant trends and features within the solution space of a query. In this framework, query distribution estimates help users to interactively explore their query's solution and visually identify the regions where the combined behavior of constrained variables is most important, statistically, to their inquiry. Our new segmentation strategy extends the distribution estimation analysis by visually conveying the individual importance of each variable to these regions of high statistical significance. We demonstrate the analysis benefits these two strategies provide and show how they maybe used to facilitate the refinement of constraints over variables expressed in a user's query. We apply our method to data sets from two different scientific domains to demonstrate its broad applicability.", "paper_title": "An Application of Multivariate Statistical Analysis for Query-Driven Visualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000286111600001"}
