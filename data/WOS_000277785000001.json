The presentation is broken into two main parts: (1) the dynamics of charged streams of particles and their interaction with electromagnetic fields and (2) the coupled thermal fields that arise within the jet. An overall model is built by assembling submodels of the various coupled physical events to form a system that is solved iteratively. Specifically, an approach is developed whereby the dynamics of charged particles, accounting for their collisions, inter-particle near-fields, interaction with external electromagnetic fields and coupled thermal effects are all computed implicitly in an iterative, modular, manner. A staggered, temporally-adaptive scheme is developed to resolve the multiple fields involved and the drastic changes in the physical configuration of the stream, for example when impacting a solid wall or strong localized electromagnetic field. Qualitative analytical results are provided to describe the effects of the electromagnetic fields and quantitative numerical results are provided for complex cases.", "paper_title": "On the Dynamics of Charged Electromagnetic Particulate Jets", "paper_id": "WOS:000277785000001"}
