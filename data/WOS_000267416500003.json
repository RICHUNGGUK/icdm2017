The situation is realistic in practice. Design/methodology/approach - During the decision-making process of an economic system, the managers often get some uncertain data for the missing information. Then, it becomes difficult to analyze the complex system by using the input-occupancy-output analysis. Since the uncertain data are grey numbers, the decision maker can control it by using grey system theory and the input-occupancy-output analysis. Findings - Get the grey direct consumption and occupancy coefficient matrices and the computational formulas of their matrix-covered sets. The grey model of input-occupancy-output analysis and its covered solution are also obtained. Research limitations/implications - The chaos of the grey statistic data should satisfy a level of accuracy and it is key to get the number-covered set that the true data belongs to. Practical implications - A feasible approach to control the economic system that the accurate data are difficult to be obtained. Originality/value - Give a new approach to study an economic system by using grey system theory.", "paper_title": "The grey input-occupancy-output analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000267416500003"}
