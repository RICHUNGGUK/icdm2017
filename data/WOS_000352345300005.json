DF can be used in logistics planning activities, for instance, in factory planning and organisation, in analysis and replanning of manufacturing areas, in addition to simulation and validation of workstations ergonomics conditions. This study presents the application of DF concepts related to replanning of manufacturing area, reduction of the physical space occupied by the facilities and adequacy of ergonomics characteristics in an automotive manufacturing cell. A case study is presented in order to demonstrate the application of these concepts. Results are shown and the paper ends with conclusions and considerations about the subject.", "paper_title": "Application of digital factory concepts to optimise and integrate inventories in automotive pre-assembly areas", "paper_id": "WOS:000352345300005"}
