It is natural that the source ontologies be multiple large ontologies, each of which is extracted, and then merged to create a smaller and tailored ontology for a specific domain. Therefore, extracting sub-ontologies as well as merging them is a primary process. In this paper, we propose sub-ontology extraction and merging, whereby multiple sub-ontologies are extracted from various source ontologies and then these extracted sub-ontologies are merged to form a complete ontology to be used by the user. We use the maximum extraction method to facilitate this. A walkthrough case study using the UMLS meta-thesaurus ontology is also presented.", "paper_title": "Merging sub-ontologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000334070200007"}
