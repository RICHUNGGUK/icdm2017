Design/methodology/approach - The research examines two areas of study: social identification theory and word-of-mouth communication in the virtual environment (eWOM). Based on these theories an explicative model has been proposed applying structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis to a sample of SNS users buying travel services. Partial least squares was chosen as a method to conduct an SEM analysis. Findings - First, the results support the central role of social identification in SNS communication. Second, the results show that SNS users give greater importance to the transmission of communication than to its reception. This fact supports the idea that SNS is used more as a tool for highlighting and maintaining social status than as a channel for information. Originality/value - The study highlights the role of social identification as the core element which drives SNS. It then analyses the development of eWOM communication in the new context provided by SNS. In addition eWOM communication is studied from two perspectives: from the standpoint of the communicator, but also the receiver. Finally, it seems appropriate to differentiate between virtual communities discussing tourism (e.g. www.TripAdvisor.com) and the SNS (e.g. www.facebook.com, www.twitter.com). While the former seems to be a growing source of information, the latter acts rather more in a social context.", "paper_title": "Social identity, electronic word-of-mouth and referrals in social network services", "paper_id": "WOS:000327752800003"}
