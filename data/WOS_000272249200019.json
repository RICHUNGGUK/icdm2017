In general, the EM has been initially used for solving continuous optimization problems and could not be applied on combinatorial optimization ones. This paper proposes a discrete binary version of the EM for solving combinatorial optimization problems. To show the efficiency of our proposed EM, we solve a single machine scheduling problem and compare our computational results with the solutions reported in the literature. Finally, we conclude that our proposed method is capable of solving such well-known problems more efficiently than the previous studies.", "paper_title": "SOLVING A SINGLE MACHINE SCHEDULING PROBLEM BY A DISCRETE VERSION OF ELECTROMAGNETISM-LIKE METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000272249200019"}
