A system of semi-linear equations over GF(2) has the form Mx = f (x), where M is a completion of A and f : {0, 1}(n) -> {0, 1}(m) is an operator, the ith coordinate of which can only depend on variables corresponding to *-entries in the ith row of A. We conjecture that no such system can have more than 2(n-epsilon-mr(A)) solutions, where epsilon > 0 is an absolute constant and mr(A) is the smallest rank over GF(2) of a completion of A. The conjecture is related to an old problem of proving super-linear lower bounds on the size of log-depth boolean circuits computing linear operators x bar right arrow Mx. The conjecture is also a generalization of a classical question about how much larger can non-linear codes be than linear ones. We prove some special cases of the conjecture and establish some structural properties of solution sets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
