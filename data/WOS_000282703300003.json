The provisioning of ubiquitous personalized multimedia services (UPMSs) is a challenging task, which involves a lot of heterogeneous entities ranging from objects, devices to software. In this work, we propose a three-layer software platform, called UPmP to support efficient development and deployment of UPMSs. It fulfills the core functionalities for ubiquitous personalized multimedia provisioning including service management, multimedia recommendation, adaptation, and delivery. We adopt service-oriented approach in building the platform. The enabling technologies such as component representation, service lifecycle management, platform configuration, and service composition are described in detail. The experimental results show that the UPmP is flexible to be configured under different settings.", "paper_title": "A Service-Oriented Platform for Ubiquitous Personalized Multimedia Provisioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000282703300003"}
