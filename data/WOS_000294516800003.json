A curve on a surface is a line of curvature if its tangents are always in the direction of the principal curvature. By utilizing the Frenet frame, the surface pencil can be expressed as a linear combination of the components of the local frame. With this parametric representation, we derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the given curve to be the line of curvature on the surface. Moreover, the necessary and sufficient condition for the given curve to satisfy the line of curvature and the geodesic requirements is also analyzed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
