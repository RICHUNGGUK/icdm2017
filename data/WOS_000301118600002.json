These techniques offer features such as learning from experience, handling noisy and incomplete data, helping with decision making, and predicting capabilities. In this article, we present a number of different applications of a multidomain knowledge representation structure called decisional DNA that can be implemented and shared for the exploitation of embedded knowledge within different technologies.", "paper_title": "Decisional DNA: The Concept and Its Implementation Platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000301118600002"}
