The equations are discretized with high-order accurate finite difference methods that satisfy a Summation-By-Parts rule. The boundary conditions are imposed with penalty terms known as the Simultaneous Approximation Term technique. The main result is a stability proof for the full three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, including the boundary conditions. We show the theoretical third-, fourth-, and fifth-order convergence rate, for a viscous shock, where the analytic solution is known. We demonstrate the stability and discuss the non-reflecting properties of the outflow conditions for a vortex in free space. Furthermore, we compute the three-dimensional vortex shedding behind a circular cylinder in an oblique free stream for Mach number 0.5 and Reynolds number 500. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
