Students start by using OpenGL and, afterwards, use VTK in half of their lab classes, in order to accomplish some tasks and acquire knowledge on its features and fu ncti onali ties. They are also required to develop a visualization application based on VTK. We first present the motivation for using VTK and the main features of the \"3D Modelling and Visualization\" course. Afterwards, we describe some of the most successful projects developed by our students. Then, we globally analyse the effectiveness of using VTK., and present the results of a questionnaire handed out to the students who attended the course in the last semester. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
