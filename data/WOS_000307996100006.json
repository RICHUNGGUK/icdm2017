The proposed method is applied to Travel Salesman Problem (TSP) and successfully solved it. Simulation results have been proved the performance of our algorithm compared to similar strategies.", "paper_title": "BEE COLONY SYSTEM: PRECISENESS AND SPEED IN DISCRETE OPTIMIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000307996100006"}
