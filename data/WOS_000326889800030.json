Effective parameters on scour phenomena include sediment size, geometry of bridge pier, and upstream flow conditions. Different shapes of piers have been utilized to develop the GMDH network. Back propagation algorithm was performed to train the GHMD network which updated weighting coefficients of quadratic polynomial in each iteration of the training stage. The GMDH performed with the lowest errors of training and testing stages for cylindrical pier. Also, Richardson and Davis, Johnson's equations produced relatively good performances for different types of piers. Finally, the results indicated that GMDH could be provided more accurate prediction than those obtained using traditional equations.", "paper_title": "Group method of data handling to predict scour depth around bridge piers", "paper_id": "WOS:000326889800030"}
