Several studies of adders and multipliers in QCA have been proposed, whereas QCA divider design and implementation is a rather unexplored research area. In this paper the earliest designs for QCA dividers, which explore the restoring and non-restoring array dividers, considered as the best possible dividers, are introduced. These designs use well-organized arithmetic components as their basic construction parts and take some design rules into consideration which make them reliable and more robust against noise. These dividers with their design considerations and constraints are introduced step by step. Moreover, these designs are probed in terms of complexity, clocking and latency. QCADesigner, a simulation tool for QCA circuits, is used to check circuits' layout and functionality. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
