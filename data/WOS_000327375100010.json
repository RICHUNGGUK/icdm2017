Faculty of organizational sciences and Ministry of Education and Science of Serbia have recognized importance of biometrics, and started an international project named \"Multimodal biometry in identity management\". As a part of our project, we have developed a support platform for learning about multimodal biometrics. Platform is used as part of biometric course in order to improve student's learning experience and to increase their interest in biometrics. A research study was conducted to compare traditional learning method and learning method based on our support platform. Results of our research study speak in favour of using elBio support platform as a teaching tool.", "paper_title": "Support Platform for Learning about Multimodal Biometrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000327375100010"}
