As a new feature, GLoBES 3.0 allows for user-defined systematical errors, which can also be used to simulate experiments with multiple discrete sources and detectors. In addition, the combination with external information, such as from different experiment classes, is simplified. As far as the probability calculation is concerned, GLoBES now provides an interface for the inclusion of non-standard physics without re-compilation of the software. The set of experiment prototypes coming with GLoBES has been updated. For example, built-in fluxes are now provided for the simulation of beta beams. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
