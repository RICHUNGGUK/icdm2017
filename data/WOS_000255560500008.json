Tight bounds are obtained for both combined operations. The results clearly show that the state complexity of a combined operation can be very different from the composition of the state complexities of its participating individual operations. A new approach for research in automata and formal language theory is also explained.", "paper_title": "The state complexity of two combined operations: Star of catenation and star of reversal", "paper_id": "WOS:000255560500008"}
