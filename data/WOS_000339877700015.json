In the last decade, research on peer-to-peer (P2P) technology has become even more popular. As more people use P2P systems, the scalability and flexibility of the systems must be considered. In this study, an arrangement graph is used to form a P2P overlay, the Arrangement-Graph Overlay (AGO), to reduce system overhead and bind routing hops. The proposed AGO utilizes the properties of the arrangement graph, i.e., that each node has a unique ID and IDs between adjacent nodes differ by only one digit, to form the overlay network and develop a routing algorithm. The routing hops of the proposed AGO system can be bound within a certain number because of the diameter of the arrangement graph. Experimental results show that the proposed AGO system can greatly reduce system overhead and perform routing in a constant number of hops, even in a large-scale network environment. The experimental results also show that the AGO system consumes less bandwidth, which is an important consideration in P2P systems.", "paper_title": "A scalable P2P overlay based on arrangement graph with minimized overhead", "paper_id": "WOS:000339877700015"}
