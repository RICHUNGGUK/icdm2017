Randomly arriving jobs are routed to a choice of servers. The number of active servers depends on server activation decisions that are updated at a slow time scale, and the service rates of the servers are controlled by power scaling decisions that are made at a faster time scale. We develop a two-time-scale decision strategy that offers provable power cost and delay guarantees. The performance and robustness of the approach is illustrated through simulations.", "paper_title": "Power Cost Reduction in Distributed Data Centers: A Two-Time-Scale Approach for Delay Tolerant Workloads", "paper_id": "WOS:000327662100021"}
