The shape of each algorithm's objective function (convex or strictly convex) is related to the algorithm's sensitivity to the estimated component number of the trilinear system. Different situations near the objective solution are analyzed both theoretically and numerically. The wall of perturbation generated by deviations in the iterative steps prevents the PARAFAC algorithm from achieving the objective solution when the component number is overestimated. This may explain, from a calculational perspective, why the PARAFAC algorithm could not obtain the objective solution or any equivalent thereto (although equivalents might still be chemically meaningful optimal solutions). The different effects of deviation and residual on the algorithms are demonstrated by numerical analysis in this paper. The convergence rate can be improved by the use of high-performance computing strategy of the specific algorithm. The concept of solution set discussed in this paper complements the theory of the uniqueness of trilinear decomposition. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. A rigorous method named differential analysis has been proposed in this paper to discuss the characteristic of trilinear decomposition algorithms. The origin why trilinear decomposition algorithm is sensitive to the excessive number of components is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically.
