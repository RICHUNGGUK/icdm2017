The detector employs the maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) in cooperation with the blind linear prediction (BLP), of which prediction coefficients are determined by the method of Lagrange multipliers. Interpolation of channel frequency responses is also applied to the detector in order to reduce the complexity. A complexity analysis and computer simulations demonstrate that the proposed detector can reduce the complexity to about a half, and that the complexity reduction causes only a loss of 1 dB in average E-b/N-0 at BER of 10(-3) when the prediction order and the degree of polynomial approximation are 2 and 1, respectively.", "paper_title": "MLSE detection with blind linear prediction and subcarriers interpolation for DSTBC-OFDM systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000245194000004"}
