One approach is to shorten the traffic information measurement cycle. However, performance degradation is inevitable if traffic measurement servers merely shorten the cycle and measure all traffic. This paper presents a software architecture that can measure traffic more frequently without degrading performance by estimating the level of abnormal traffic. The algorithm in the architecture estimates the values of the interface group objects in MIB by using the IP group objects thereby reducing the number of measurements and the size of measured data. We evaluated this architecture on part of Internet service provider's IP network. When the traffic was measured 5 times more than before, the CPU usage and TPS of the proposed scheme was 7% and 41% less than that of the original scheme while the false positive rate and false negative rate were 3.2% and 2.7% respectively.", "paper_title": "Efficient Abnormal Traffic Detection Software Architecture for a Seamless Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000288501000004"}
