PetroHAZOP consists of four modules including case base module, CBR engine Module, knowledge maintenance module and user graphical interface module. Within the case base, HAZOP analysis knowledge is represented as cases which are organized with a hierarchical structure. Similarity-based case retrieval algorithm is also depicted to find the closest-matching cases. In order to enhance the case retrieval, a new set of ontologies for CBR-based HAZOP analysis is created by integration of existing ontologies reported in literature. Finally the application of PetroHAZOP is demonstrated by two case studies of industrial processes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
