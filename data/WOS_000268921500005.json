Higher level formalisms for biological systems description can be translated into sSMSR, and the features of sSMSR allow the development of efficient simulators. In this paper, we show the encoding into sSMSR of two formalisms for the description of biological systems, namely Stochastic CLS and the Stochastic pi-calculus. We prove soundness and completeness of both the encodings. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
