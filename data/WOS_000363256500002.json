In this paper, in order to reduce the repair bandwidth of parity nodes of the known minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes with high rate, which is usually the whole amount of the original data, i.e., the maximal, a new systematic piggybacking design is proposed through an in-depth analysis of the design of piggybacking. As a result, new MSR codes are obtained with almost optimal repair bandwidth of parity nodes while retaining the optimal repair bandwidth of systematic nodes. Furthermore, MSR codes with balanced download during node repair process are presented based on the new piggybacking design.", "paper_title": "A Systematic Piggybacking Design for Minimum Storage Regenerating Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000363256500002"}
