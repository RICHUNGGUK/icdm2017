The resulting data representations are typically high-dimensional and assume diverse forms. Hence, finding a way of transforming them into a unified space of lower dimension generally facilitates the underlying tasks such as object recognition or clustering. To this end, the proposed approach (termed MKL-DR) generalizes the framework of multiple kernel learning for dimensionality reduction, and distinguishes itself with the following three main contributions: First, our method provides the convenience of using diverse image descriptors to describe useful characteristics of various aspects about the underlying data. Second, it extends a broad set of existing dimensionality reduction techniques to consider multiple kernel learning, and consequently improves their effectiveness. Third, by focusing on the techniques pertaining to dimensionality reduction, the formulation introduces a new class of applications with the multiple kernel learning framework to address not only the supervised learning problems but also the unsupervised and semi-supervised ones.", "paper_title": "Multiple Kernel Learning for Dimensionality Reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000289524000006"}
