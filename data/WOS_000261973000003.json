HeMUT is developed under NET and builds unstructured/structured hexahedral meshes. The algorithm focuses on urban terrains and on the mesh generation for the simulation of toxic gases dispersion (finite element). HeMUT is fully automated, multi-threading and takes advantage of terrain. In addition, it distributes the nodes on the domain by employing a method based on process design considerations. These features decrease the computational effort and at the same time differentiate this algorithm from all other similar ones. in comparison with a commercial software HeMUT performed well.
