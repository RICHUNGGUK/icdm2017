An adder determines the overall performance of the circuits in most of those systems. In this paper we propose a novel 1-bit full adder cell which uses only eight transistors. In this design, three multiplexers and one inverter are applied to minimize the transistor count and reduce power consumption. The power dissipation, propagation delay, and power-delay produced using the new design are analyzed and compared with those of other designs using HSPICE simulations. The results show that the proposed adder has both lower power consumption and a lower power-delay product (PDP) value. The low power and low transistor count make the novel 8T full adder cell a candidate for power-efficient applications.", "paper_title": "Design of a novel low power 8-transistor 1-bit full adder cell", "paper_id": "WOS:000292309400009"}
