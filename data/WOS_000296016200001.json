However, high pattern frequencies introduce ambiguities during phase unwrapping. This paper proposes a process for embedding a period cue into the projected pattern set without reducing the signal-to-noise ratio. As a result, each period of the high frequency signal can be identified. The proposed method can unwrap high frequency phase and achieve high measurement precision without increasing the pattern number. Therefore, the proposed method can significantly benefit real-time applications. The method is verified by theoretical and experimental analysis using prototype system built to achieve 120 fps at 640 x 480 resolution.", "paper_title": "Period Coded Phase Shifting Strategy for Real-time 3-D Structured Light Illumination", "paper_id": "WOS:000296016200001"}
