In the most stable structures of Be (n) Cu (m) , the Be atoms tend to gather together and construct similar configurations to those of pure Be (n) clusters. Meanwhile, there is a tendency for Cu atoms to segregate toward the Be (n) cluster surface. The successive binding energies, cohesive energies, second difference of energies, the highest occupied-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy gaps and chemical hardness of Be (n) Cu (m) are also investigated. All of them demonstrate that the clusters with even number of copper atoms present relatively higher stabilities. The natural population analyses on the Be (n) Cu (m) clusters reveal that, the charge transfers from Be to Cu when the average coordination numbers (Nc) of Be atom is less than 3, whereas the charge-transferring direction reverses when Nc(Be) increases.", "paper_title": "Density functional study of structural and electronic properties of small binary Be (n) Cu (m) (n plus m=2 similar to 7) clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000321922600015"}
