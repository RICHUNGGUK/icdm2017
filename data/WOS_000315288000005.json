Using PM and QDPSK modulation, the system improves bandwidth utilization. The key new feature of the approach is source-free optical network units (ONUs) including wireless access and upstream communication. By use of a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier and the reuse of the downstream light source, the ONU can omit the laser source and makes the WDM-PON colorless. This networking has the credible transmission property, including wireless access and fiber transmission. It also has a large coverage area.", "paper_title": "Design of WDM-RoF-PON for Wireless and Wire-Line Access With Source-Free ONUs", "paper_id": "WOS:000315288000005"}
