As demand for data items changes, for performance reasons, the system needs to automatically respond to changes in demand for different data items. The problem of computing a migration plan among the storage devices is called the data migration problem. This problem was shown to be NP-hard, and an approximation algorithm achieving an approximation factor of 9.5 was presented for the half-duplex communication model in Khuller, Kim and Wan (Algorithms for data migration with cloning. SIAM J. Comput. 33(2):448-461, 2004). In this paper we develop an improved approximation algorithm that gives a bound of 6.5+o(1) using new ideas. In addition, we develop better algorithms using external disks and get an approximation factor of 4.5 using external disks. We also consider the full duplex communication model and develop an improved bound of 4+o(1) for this model, with no external disks.", "paper_title": "Improved Approximation Algorithms for Data Migration", "paper_id": "WOS:000299482700016"}
