Service times at either station follow the same general distribution, are independent of each other and are independent of the arrival process. The system is charged station-dependent holding costs at each station per customer per unit time. At any point in time, a decision-maker may decide to move, at a cost, some number of jobs in one queue to the other. The goals of this paper are twofold. First, we are interested in providing insights into this decision-making scenario. We do so, in the important case that the service time distribution is highly variable or simply has a heavy tail. Secondly, we propose that the savvy use of Markov decision processes can lead to easily implementable heuristics when features of the service time distribution can be captured by introducing multiple customer classes. To this end, we consider a two-station proxy for the original system, where the service times are assumed to be exponential, but of one of two classes with different rates. We prove structural results for this proxy and show that these results lead to heuristics that perform well.", "paper_title": "A simple heuristic for load balancing in parallel processing networks with highly variable service time distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000274387200003"}
