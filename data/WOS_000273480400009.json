Many works have studied network survivability. The majority of these works are destined for single-domain networks. In this work, we address the survivability of multi-domain optical networks. This paper provides a classification of the existing protection solutions proposed for multi-domain networks and analyses their advantages and limitations. We propose a new solution for multi-domain optical networks based on p-cycles (pre-configured cycles). For scalability and security reasons, we also propose a topology aggregation model adapted to p-cycle computations. This aggregation model allows our proposed solution to find a trade-off between two competing goals: efficient use of backup resources and short running time. Simulation results show that the proposed solution is a good trade-off between resource utilization and running time compared to existing solutions.", "paper_title": "Survivability in multi-domain optical networks using p-cycles", "paper_id": "WOS:000273480400009"}
