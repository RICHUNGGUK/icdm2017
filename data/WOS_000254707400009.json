Thus it would still be possible to have confidential communications even if conventional encryption schemes were outlawed. Hanaoka et al. constructed unconditionally secure chaffing-and-winnowing schemes which achieve perfect secrecy in the sense of Shannon. Their schemes are constructed from unconditionally secure authentication codes.", "paper_title": "Unconditionally secure chaffing and winnowing with short authentication tags", "paper_id": "WOS:000254707400009"}
