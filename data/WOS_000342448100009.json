POST is a highly scalable tree structured network that interconnects thousands of servers and provides low hop count transmission paths among all the servers connected. In POST, we introduced two new switching components that help in routing data passively and efficiently within a POST network. Additionally, we have provided architectural modification to POST, which enhances the reliability of POST in a cost-effective manner. Our simulation results prove that POST provides a low average delay compared with traditional data center networks and the scalability of POST increases as the north-south traffic in the data center increases.", "paper_title": "POST: a scalable optical data center network", "paper_id": "WOS:000342448100009"}
