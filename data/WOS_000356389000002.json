This article describes Fireflies, an overlay network protocol that fights such attacks by organizing members in a verifiable pseudorandom structure so that an intruder cannot incorrectly modify the membership views of correct members. Fireflies provides each member with a view of the entire membership, and supports networks with moderate total churn. We evaluate Fireflies using both simulations and PlanetLab to show that Fireflies is a practical approach for secure membership maintenance in such networks.", "paper_title": "Fireflies: A Secure and Scalable Membership and Gossip Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000356389000002"}
