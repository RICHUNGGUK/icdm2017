Lateral bending behaviour these two piles subjected to passive sub soil movements were very different from each other because of the casing and is modelled in this paper using a three dimensional analysis. The effect of relative stiffness of the piles on their lateral bending behaviour is investigated. The effect of interface joint slip on the pile's behaviour is also investigated in a later section of this paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
