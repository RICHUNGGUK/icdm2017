With drastic scaling down of devices at recent technology level, leakage power has also become an important design parameter to be considered during synthesis. A genetic algorithm-based state encoding, targeting area and power minimized FSM, has been proposed in this paper. A unified technique to reduce both static power (leakage) and dynamic power along with area trade-off has been carried out for FSM synthesis, targeting static CMOS NAND-NAND PLA, dynamic CMOS NOR-NOR PLA and pseudo-NMOS NOR-NOR PLA implementations. Suitable weights for area, leakage power and dynamic power to minimize power density have also been explored. Simulation with MCNC benchmarks shows an average improvement of 31%, 26% and 29% in leakage power consumption, dynamic power consumption and area requirement respectively, over NOVA-based state assignment technique in case of dynamic CMOS PLA implementation. Improvements of 30% in leakage power and 15% in area have been obtained for pseudo-NMOS PLA implementation. For the static CMOS case, the improvements are about 29% in leakage power consumption, 14% in dynamic power consumption and 18% in area requirement. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
