We adopt a goal programming model based on lexicographic multiobjective optimisation of both makespan and due-date satisfaction and propose a particle swarm algorithm to solve the resulting problem. We present experimental results which show that this multiobjective approach achieves as good results as single-objective algorithms for the objective with the highest priority, while greatly improving on the second objective.", "paper_title": "Swarm lexicographic goal programming for fuzzy open shop scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000365013800011"}
