They succeed to establish the parameterized complexity of all cases except two, when we ask about: a connected k-edge subgraph with all vertices of odd degrees, the problem known as k-EDGE CONNECTED ODD SUBGRAPH; and a connected k-vertex induced subgraph with all vertices of even degrees, the problem known as k-VERTEX EULERIAN SUBGRAPH. We show that k-EDGE CONNECTED ODD SUBGRAPH is FPT and k-VERTEX EULERIAN SUBGRAPH is W[1]-hard. Our EFT algorithm is based on a novel combinatorial result on the treewidth of minimal connected odd graphs with even amount of edges. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
