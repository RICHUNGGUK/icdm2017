Brushing sounds were manipulated and were found to alter the user's impression. In our experiment, brushing sounds recorded by a microphone in the toothbrush are manipulated and presented to the users in real-time. We demonstrate that frequency manipulation affects feelings of comfort and accomplishment when sound levels are amplified. We also show that the gradually increasing frequency of brushing sounds induces more comfortable and accomplished feelings than the original sounds. The results show that it is possible to motivate users by interactively manipulating the frequency of brushing sounds.", "paper_title": "Modulating tooth brushing sounds to affect user impressions", "paper_id": "WOS:000375125900002"}
