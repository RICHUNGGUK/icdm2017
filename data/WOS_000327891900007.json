In a multiple tiling, a convex body is translated with a discrete multiset in such a way that each point of gets covered exactly times, except perhaps the translated copies of the boundary of . It is known that all possible multiple tilers in are zonotopes. In it was known by the work of Kolountzakis (Discrete Comput Geom 23(4):537-553, 2000) that, unless is a parallelogram, the multiset of translation vectors must be a finite union of translated lattices (also known as quasi periodic sets). In that work (Kolountzakis, Discrete Comput Geom 23(4):537-553, 2000) the author asked whether the same quasi-periodic structure on the translation vectors would be true in . Here we prove that this conclusion is indeed true for . Namely, we show that if is a convex multiple tiler in , with a discrete multiset of translation vectors, then has to be a finite union of translated lattices, unless belongs to a special class of zonotopes. This exceptional class consists of two-flat zonotopes , defined by the Minkowski sum of two 2-dimensional symmetric polygons in , one of which may degenerate into a single line segment. It turns out that rational two-flat zonotopes admit a multiple tiling with an aperiodic (nonquasi-periodic) set of translation vectors . We note that it may be quite difficult to offer a visualization of these 3-dimensional non-quasi-periodic tilings, and that we discovered them by using Fourier methods.", "paper_title": "Structure Results for Multiple Tilings in 3D", "paper_id": "WOS:000327891900007"}
