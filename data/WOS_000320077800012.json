This paper discusses the design and optimization of an ultra-wideband (UWB) correlator circuit using ESD-aware simulation design technique. Mixed-mode ESD simulation-design method and RF ESD characterization technique are presented for accurate ESD device design and ESD-induced parasitic effects extraction. The impact of ESD induced parasitic is carefully considered in the whole correlator design simulation by using a direct S-parameter insertion technique. The design is based on a commercial 0.18 mu m RFCMOS technology.", "paper_title": "An optimized UWB correlator design with the consideration of the impacts from the ESD protection devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000320077800012"}
