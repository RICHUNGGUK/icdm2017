The main findings are that at the country group level, there is no significant difference between CIVETS and BRICs in knowledge-based economy performance, scientific research quality and scientific research structure and that the number of scientific research papers is the clear gap between them. The results may be of use to find the answer to the question \"Are CIVETS the next BRICs\" at least from the perspective of scientometrics.", "paper_title": "Are CIVETS the next BRICs?
