P2P streaming systems often employ multi-channels to deliver streaming to users simultaneously, which leads to a great challenge of allocating server resources among these channels appropriately. Most existing P2P systems resort to over-allocating server resources to different channels, which results in low-efficiency and high-cost. To allocate server resources to different channels efficiently, we propose a dynamic resource allocation algorithm based on a streaming quality model for P2P live streaming systems. This algorithm can improve the channel streaming quality for multi-channel P2P live streaming system and also guarantees the streaming quality of the channels under extreme Internet conditions. In an experiment, the proposed algorithm is validated by the trace data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
