The proposal has been validated in a transport SDN controller, supporting optical network virtualization via slicing of physical resources such as nodes, links and wavelengths, through use case testbed demonstrations of policy enforcement for SDN applications, including optical equalization and virtual optical network control. Additionally, the policy engine incorporates a simulation-assisted pre-setting mechanism for local policy decisions in case of problems in communication with the controller.", "paper_title": "Providing Optical Network as a Service with Policy-based Transport SDN", "paper_id": "WOS:000350554900006"}
