However, solutions of k-means algorithm depend on the initialization of cluster centers and the final solution converges to local minima. This paper presents a hybrid evolutionary algorithm to overcome k-means algorithm shortcomings. The proposed algorithm is elaborately developed by combining Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Simulated Annealing (SA), and k-means algorithms called PSO-SA-K that helps find better cluster partition. The efficiency of the proposed clustering technique is evaluated by several benchmark data sets. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the previous approaches such as PSO, SA, combination of PSO and SA (PSO-SA), Ant Colony Optimization (A CO), combination of k-means and PSO (K-PSO), combination of Nelder Mead simplex search and PSO (NM-PSO), K-NM-PSO, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Tabu Search (TS), Honey Bee Mating Optimization (HBMO), and k-means for partitional clustering problem.", "paper_title": "A NEW HYBRID ALGORITHM BASED ON PSO, SA, AND K-MEANS FOR CLUSTER ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000279829800026"}
