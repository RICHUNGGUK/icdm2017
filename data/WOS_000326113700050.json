It is a data-driven method and the ALINEA controller is auto-tuned only depending on the input and output data collected from closed-loop experiments. To mimic a real traffic environment, a simulator is built on the PARAMICS platform. The flow-based ALINEA controller is also considered to illustrate the good tuning performance of IFT comprehensively. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified through PARAMICS based simulations.", "paper_title": "A Data-Driven Iterative Feedback Tuning Approach of ALINEA for Freeway Traffic Ramp Metering With PARAMICS Simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000326113700050"}
