The challenge that motivated the development of a grid-enabled version of the 'standalone' KDDML (Knowledge Discovery in Databases Markup Language) environment was on one side to exploit the parallelism offered by the grid environment, and on the other side to overcome the problem of data immovability, a quite frequent restriction on real-world data collections that has principally a privacy-preserving purpose. The last question is addressed by moving the code and 'mining' the data 'on the place', that is by adapting the computation to the availability and localization of the data.
