Most of the existing design pattern languages describe design patterns using a combination of a natural language, UML-style diagrams and complex mathematical or logic based formalisms, which makes them hard for programmers to understand. In this paper we propose a design pattern definition language (DPDL) based on XML which can be used for sharing design patterns' implementation details among developers. DPDL is easy to understand and use. It provides unambiguous description of the patterns and is extensible. DPDL also has the flexibility of defining design patterns in a generic term to be used as templates.
