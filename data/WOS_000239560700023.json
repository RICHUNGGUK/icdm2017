The deformation is based on labels and allows transferring specific facial features between the generic rig and face models. High quality physics-based animation is achieved by combining different deformation methods with our labeling system, which adapts muscles and skeletons from a generic rig to individual face models. We describe how to find the correspondence of the main attributes of the generic rig, transfer them to different 3D face models and generate a sophisticated facial rig based on human anatomy. We show how to apply the same deformation parameters to different face models and obtain unique expressions. Our goal is to ease the character setup process and provide digital artists with a tool that allows manipulating models as if they were using a puppet. We end with different examples that show the strength of our proposal.", "paper_title": "Transferring a labeled generic rig to animate face models", "paper_id": "WOS:000239560700023"}
