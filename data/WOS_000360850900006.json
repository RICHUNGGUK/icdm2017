The binding energies corrected for the basis set superposition error, Delta E-bind(BSSE), were obtained using the optimized geometries at the MP2 level with a large basis set and were compared with the single point binding energies, denoted as Delta E-bind(BSSE-s), using large basis sets on the geometries optimized at the small basis sets, such as SVP and TZVP. The calculations showed that the Delta E-bind(BSSE-s) values were similar to those at the MP2 level with the large basis sets. The binding strength increased gradually with increasing size of the PAHs. The Delta E-bind(BSSE-s) for an infinite graphene sheet was estimated to be -1.70 kcal mol(-1) using the non-linear curve fitting method. The present work could be expected to provide more useful and reliable information on H-2 physisorption.", "paper_title": "Modeling studies on the uptake of hydrogen molecules by graphene", "paper_id": "WOS:000360850900006"}
