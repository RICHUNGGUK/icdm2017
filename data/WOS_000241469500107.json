In this paper, we present a solution to the problem of efficiently realizing uniform data dependencies on processor arrays. In contrary to existing approaches, we formulate an optimization problem to consider the cost of both: channels and registers. Further, a solution to the optimization problem assigns which channels shall be implemented and it specifies the control for the realization of the uniform data dependencies. We illustrate our method on the edge detection algorithm.", "paper_title": "Efficient realization of data dependencies in algorithm partitioning under resource constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000241469500107"}
