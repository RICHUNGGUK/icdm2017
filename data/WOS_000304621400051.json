Reactions with both substituted and unsubstituted phenylhalocarbenes are strongly exothermic. The reactions with nitrosubstituted halocarbenes are predicted to be spin allowed due to the practical degeneracy of the singlet and triplet carbene states. Conversely, for the unsubstituted compounds, the equilibrium between the triplet carbene and O-3(2) requires a previous singlet-triplet state crossing. The large spin-orbit coupling at this crossing suggests a rather efficient tunneling rate. This would help to explain why the rate constant in solution in these cases is only one order of magnitude smaller than those involving a spin-allowed process. Moreover, the action of the solvent as a third body appears to play a fundamental role in prompting relatively smooth rates.", "paper_title": "Oxygenation of the phenylhalocarbenes.
