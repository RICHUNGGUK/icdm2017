These are significant advantages over music taxonomies, which tend to be incomplete and inconsistent. However, music folksonomies have an inherent loose and open semantics, which hampers their use in many applications, such as structured music browsing and recommendation. In this paper, we present a system that can (1) automatically obtain a set of semantic facets underlying the folksonomy of the social music website Last.fm, and (2) categorize Last.fm tags with respect to the obtained facets. The semantic facets are anchored upon the structure of Wikipedia, a dynamic repository of universal knowledge.", "paper_title": "Inferring Semantic Facets of a Music Folksonomy with Wikipedia", "paper_id": "WOS:000328316900003"}
