Subjects used these three screen sizes to view and execute a computer maintenance procedure. Results from 65 student participants indicated a significant difference in completion times between the three screen sizes [F(2, 120)=690, p <0.050], but no differences in subjectively assessed cognitive workload, errors or performance time. Competing memory strategies in procedure-based tasks were revealed through the access frequency and amount of time subjects spent reading the procedure before starting the experiment [F(2, 105)=25.17, p <0.001]. When using the 7 in./17.8 cm screen, users read more of the procedure before executing the procedure. In contrast, when using the smaller screen, users sampled the procedure in longer intervals during execution.", "paper_title": "Increased memory load during task completion when procedures are presented on mobile screens", "paper_id": "WOS:000293838600008"}
