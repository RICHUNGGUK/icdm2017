We then apply these models to compare today's synchronous optical network/synchronous digital hierarchy metro rings with different alternatives envisaged for next-generation MAN: an Ethernet carrier grade ring, an optical hub-based architecture and an optical time-slotted wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) ring. Our results indicate that the optical architectures are likely to decrease power consumption by up to 75% when compared with present day MANs. Moreover, by allowing the capacity of each wavelength to be dynamically shared among all nodes, a transparent slotted WDM yields throughput performance that is practically equivalent to that of today's electronic architectures, for equal capacity.", "paper_title": "Cost, Power Consumption and Performance Evaluation of Metro Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000313906300009"}
