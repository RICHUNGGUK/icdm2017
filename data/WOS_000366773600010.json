The quantiles and range countings are two important aggregations to characterize a data distribution. Let S(t) = (d(1), ... , d(n)) denote the multi-set of sensory data that have arrived until time t, which is a sequence of data orderly collected by nodes s(1), s(2), ... , s(k). One of our goals is to continuously track epsilon-approximate phi-quantiles (0 <= phi <= 1) of S(t) for all phi's with efficient total communication cost and balanced individual communication cost. The other goal is to track (epsilon, delta)-approximate range countings satisfying the requirement of arbitrary precision specified by different users. In this paper, a deterministic tracking algorithm based on a dynamic binary tree is proposed to track epsilon-approximate phi-quantiles, whose total communication cost is O (k/epsilon . log n . log(2)(1/epsilon)), where k is the number of the nodes in a network, n is the total number of the data, and epsilon is the user-specified approximation error. For range countings, a Bernoulli sampling based algorithm is proposed to track (epsilon, delta)-approximate range countings, whose total communication cost is O (2/epsilon(2) ln 2/1-root 1-delta + n(c)), where delta is the user-specified error probability, n(c) is the number of clusters.
