Compared to still images, video sequences provide more information about how objects and scenarios change over time. Tracking humans is of interest for a variety of applications including surveillance, activity monitoring and gate analysis. Many efficient object tracking algorithms have been proposed in literature, however part of those algorithms are semi-automatic requiring human interference. As for the fully automated algorithms, most of them are not applicable to real-time applications. This paper presents a low cost automatic object tracking algorithm suitable for use in real-time video based systems. The novelty of the proposed system is that it uses a simplified version of the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) technique to detect features of both continuous and discontinuous nature. As discontinuous feature selection is subject to noise, and would result in non-optima/feature based object tracking, the authors propose the use of a Kalman filter for the purpose of seeking optimal estimates in tracking. The integrated tracking system is capable of handling shadows and is based on a dynamic background subtraction strategy that minimises errors and quickly adapts to scene changes. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the system's capability of accurately tracking objects in real-time applications where scenes are subject to noise particularly resulting from occlusions and sudden illumination variations.", "paper_title": "An Automated Real-Time People Tracking System Based on KLT Features Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000298971400014"}
