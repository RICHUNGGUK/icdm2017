However, it suffers from some drawbacks such as pinball routing and large packet sizes in nested mobile networks (MoNET). In this paper we introduce new pinball routing problems associated with local mobile nodes in nested MoNETs and discuss on the effectiveness of several RO schemes in tackling the problems. Among the schemes we demonstrate that the RCS scheme can be an appropriate solution due to its low signaling overhead and short RO setup time compared to other approaches. Most importantly, we show that the RCS scheme is the unique solution for mobility support when a mobile network taking part in a nested MoNET changes its attachment point within the MoNET.", "paper_title": "Route optimization problems with local mobile nodes in nested mobile networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100054"}
