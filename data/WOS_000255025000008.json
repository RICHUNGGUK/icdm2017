These systems model low-frequency electromagnetic phenomena in plasmas, and thus \"light waves\" are somewhat supressed, which in turn allows the numerical discretization to dispense with the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition on the time step. We construct a numerical scheme based on semi-Lagrangian methods and time splitting techniques. We develop a four-dimensional phase space algorithm for the distribution function while the electromagnetic field is solved on a two-dimensional Cartesian grid. Finally, we present two nontrivial test cases: (a) the wave Landau damping and (b) the electromagnetic beam-plasma instability. For these cases our numerical scheme works very well and is in agreement with analytic kinetic theory.", "paper_title": "Numerical approximation of self-consistent Vlasov models for low-frequency electromagnetic phenomena", "paper_id": "WOS:000255025000008"}
