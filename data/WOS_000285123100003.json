The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are discretized in space onto a fixed cartesian mesh and the displacement of deformable objects through the fluid is taken into account using a penalization method. The interface between the solid and the fluid is tracked using a level-set description so that it is possible to simulate several bodies freely evolving in the fluid. As an illustration of the methods, fish-like locomotion is analyzed in terms of propulsion efficiency. Underwater maneuvering and school swimming are also explored. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
