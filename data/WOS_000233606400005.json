Typical methods for pose estimation require point correspondences to estimate the epipolar geometry between the two views. Algorithms for determining these correspondences invariably output false matches along with the good. We present an algorithm for identifying and removing these mismatches for scenes generated by a mobile scanning platform. The algorithm utilizes the motion characteristics of a rear-wheel drive sensing platform to identify correct point matches through their common motion trajectories. Our algorithm works in cases where the percentage of false matches may be as high as 80%, providing a set of correspondences whose correct/incorrect match ratio is higher than the mutual best match approach found in the literature. This algorithm is intended as a post-processing step for any point correspondence algorithm and its output can be used in standard pose estimation algorithms to enhance their speed and accuracy. Experimental results show the computational savings of our approach over the mutual best match method, resulting in comparable or better outlier rejection-increasing the true/false match ratio by 2-3 times-in only a fraction of the time.
