The outstanding features of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has emerged which is a very promising alternative in this field. Unfortunately, until recently the LBM could not be employed in fire research due to its inherent defects in combustion simulation. In order to extend the LBM into fire research, a novel LB model for fire simulation is designed in this study. Besides the intrinsic advantages of the standard LBM, this model shows improved numerical stability and can cover temperature ratio of more than one order of magnitude. The model is validated through a benchmark test \"coflow methane-air diffusion flame\". Furthermore, because little attention has been paid to the effect of the interaction between the inlet boundary and the interior of the flow field on stability of the computation and the quality of the solution, therefore in this study we also discuss this problem in detail to bridge this gap.", "paper_title": "A new numerical approach for fire simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000250954800005"}
