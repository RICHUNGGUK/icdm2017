Given v, t, and m(1), m(2), ... , m(s) with t = Sigma(s)(i=1) m(i), does there exist a partial Steiner triple system with t triples whose triples can be partitioned into partial parallel classes of sizes m1,..., ms? An affirmative answer to the first question gives an affirmative answer to the second when m(i) <= m for each i is an element of {1, 2, ... , s}. These questions arise in the analysis of erasure codes for disk arrays and that of codes for unipolar communication, respectively. A complete solution for the first problem is given when m is at most 1/3 (v -(9v)(2/3)) + O (v(1/3)).", "paper_title": "Trails of triples in partial triple systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000313055300005"}
