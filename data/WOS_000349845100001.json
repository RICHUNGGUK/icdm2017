The loa package provides dedicated panel functions to integrate RgoogleMaps within the lattice plotting environment. In addition to solving the generic task of plotting on a map background in R, we introduce several specific algorithms to detect and visualize spatio-temporal cluster. This task can often be-reduced to detecting over-densities in space relative to a background density. The relative density estimation is framed as a binary classification problem. An integrated hotspot visualizer is presented which allows the efficient identification and visualization of cluster in one environment. Competing clustering methods such as the scan statistic and the density scan offer higher detection power at a much larger computational cost. Such clustering method can then be extended using the lattice trellis framework to provide further insight into the relationship between clusters and potentially influential parameters. While there are other options for such map 'mashups' we believe that the integration of RgoogleMaps and lattice using loa can in certain circumstances be advantageous, e.g., by providing a highly intuitive working environment for multivariate analysis and flexible testbed for the rapid development of novel data visualization .", "paper_title": "RgoogleMaps and loa: Unleashing R Graphics Power on Map Tiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000349845100001"}
