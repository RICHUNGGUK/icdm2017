By the theory of optimization, some theoretic properties are obtained. Algorithms for constructing uniform designs are then studied. When the number of runs n is smaller than the number of all level-combinations m, the construction problem can be transferred to a zero-one quadratic integer programming problem, and an efficient algorithm based on the simulated annealing is proposed. When n >= m, another algorithm is proposed. Empirical study shows that when n is large, the proposed algorithms can generate designs with lower WD compared to many existing methods. Moreover, these algorithms are suitable for constructing both symmetrical and asymmetrical designs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
