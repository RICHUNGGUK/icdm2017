However, this method of error recovery is less effective at the margins of coverage where channel conditions are bad, so that mobiles experience higher error rates and longer error bursts: this effectively limits the service area for video applications. To overcome this problem, we augment scalable video coding (SVC) with a selective repetition scheme, which retransmits those packets within the layered structure of SVC that are most important for video. Simulations using an the example MPEG-4 fine granularity scalability video demonstrate that our scheme safeguards the important packets and improves the service quality. Furthermore, energy measurements show that it also extends battery life.", "paper_title": "SVC-aware selective repetition for robust streaming of scalable video", "paper_id": "WOS:000347777300009"}
