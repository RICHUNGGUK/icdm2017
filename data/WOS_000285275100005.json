We directly consider the multicast throughput to unify the unicast and broadcast throughput, and design a new multicast scheme under the generalized physical model based on the so-called secondary highways system. Taking account of all possible cases of n(s) = omega(1) and 1 <= n(d) <= n - 1, we derive the achievable multicast throughput, where n(s) and n(d) denote the number of sessions and the number of destinations of each session. We prove that for some cases in terms of n(s) and n(d), our scheme achieves better throughput than the existing schemes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
