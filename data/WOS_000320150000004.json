We apply Morse-Smale decomposition to segment the multidimensional transfer function domain. This segmentation helps to reduce the number of cases where sampling in transfer function space should be performed, effectively reducing the rendering cost for equivalent sampling quality. We show that the overall performance is increased depending on the topology of a transfer function. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
