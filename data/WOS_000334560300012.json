The functionality and capabilities of the presented program are illustrated on a series of carefully selected examples. The introduced tool, described in detail in the body of the current paper, is subsequently applied for performing formal proofs for some of the heuristically discovered formulas presented in our previous work.", "paper_title": "ZZDecomposer: A Graphical Toolkit for Analyzing the Zhang-Zhang Polynomials of Benzenoid Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000334560300012"}
