The whole platform is conceived under the premise of high efficiency in terms of energy consumption and optimization. We will focus mainly on the electromechanical structure of the lower part of the prototype, which is the main component demanding energy during motion. The dimensions and weight of the robotic platform, together with its link configuration and rigidity, will be optimized. Experimental results are presented to show the validity of the design.", "paper_title": "TEO: Full-Size Humanoid Robot Design Powered by a Fuel Cell System", "paper_id": "WOS:000302134400002"}
