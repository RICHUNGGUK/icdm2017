Thus, this paper suggests a new approach based on social spider optimization (SSO) algorithm to deal with the optimal allocation and sizing of D-STATCOM in the distribution systems. The problem is formulated in a multi-objective framework based on scenario production and SSO algorithm to capture the uncertainties of active and reactive loads suitably. The proposed scenario based method generates a number of possible scenarios with different probabilities to model the uncertainty effects. The feasibility and satisfying performance of the proposed method are examined using an IEEE standard distribution test system.", "paper_title": "A new intelligent method for optimal allocation of D-STATCOM with uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000365138800016"}
