This fact plays an important role in human dynamics at collective levels. Recently, researchers found that the heavy-tailed inter-activity patterns of human behaviors slow down the spreading significantly. In this paper, we investigate the influence of people's interest time length on information spreading. Considering that information has its own time period of being interested in, we find that for small interest time period, heavy-tailed human behaviors can enhance the information spreading. While for large interest time period, the heavy-tailed human behaviors will suppress the spreading. These results can help us understanding the rule of information spreading, controlling and limiting the outbreak of rumors.", "paper_title": "Impact of the time pattern of human behaviors on information spreading", "paper_id": "WOS:000343996000007"}
