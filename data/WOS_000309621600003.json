After a general discussion about modeling and simulation, we address the basic concept of ABMS, focusing on its generative and bottom-up nature, its advantages as well as its pitfalls. The subsequent part of the article deals with application-oriented aspects, including selected tools and well-known applications. In order to illustrate the benefits of using ABMS, we focus on several aspects of a well-known area related to simulation of complex systems, namely traffic. At the end, a brief look into future challenges is given.", "paper_title": "Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000309621600003"}
