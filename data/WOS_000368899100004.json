Colorings of game graphs are identified if they determine the same winning regions and strategies, for all ownership structures of nodes. The Rabin index of a parity game is the minimum of the maximal color taken over all equivalent coloring functions. We show that deciding whether the Rabin index is at least k is in P for k = 1 but NP-hard for all fixed k >= 2. We present an EXPTIME algorithm that computes the Rabin index by simplifying its input coloring function. When replacing simple cycle with cycle detection in that algorithm, its output over-approximates the Rabin index in polynomial time. We evaluate this efficient algorithm as a preprocessor of solvers in detailed experiments: for Zielonka's solver on random and structured parity games and for our partial solver psolB on random games.
