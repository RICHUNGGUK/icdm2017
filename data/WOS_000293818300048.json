We introduce the concepts and properties of RDOEL, and provide a complete solution to RDOEL with one integrator. Moreover, we show that it is also a complete solution to a simple case of DOEL.", "paper_title": "A Complete Solution to a Simple Case of Dynamic Observer Error Linearization: New Approach to Observer Error Linearization", "paper_id": "WOS:000293818300048"}
