To achieve this, we propose two population-based algorithms for solving dynamic optimisation problems (DOPs) with continuous variables: the self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm (jDE) and the differential ant-stigmergy algorithm (DASA). The performances of the jDE and the DASA are evaluated on the set of well-known benchmark problems provided for the special session on Evolutionary Computation in Dynamic and Uncertain Environments. We analyse the results for five algorithms presented by using the non-parametric statistical test procedure. The two proposed algorithms show a consistently superior performance over other recently proposed methods. The results show that both algorithms are appropriate candidates for DOPs.", "paper_title": "Differential evolution and differential ant-stigmergy on dynamic optimisation problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000314168000007"}
