Recently, codebooks meeting (resp., nearly meeting) the Welch bound were constructed from difference sets (resp., almost difference sets). In this paper, a general connection between complex codebooks and relative difference sets is introduced. Several classes of codebooks nearly meeting the Welch bound are then constructed from some known relative difference sets using the general connection.", "paper_title": "NEW NEARLY OPTIMAL CODEBOOKS FROM RELATIVE DIFFERENCE SETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000293643300008"}
