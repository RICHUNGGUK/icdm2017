However, blast modelling is a complex problem owing to more numerous fluid-structure interactions (FSIs) and the high-frequency loading that accompanies blast exposures. This study investigates FE mesh design for blast modelling using a sphere in a closed-ended shock tube meshed with varying element sizes using both tetrahedral and hexahedral elements. FSI was consistent for sphere-to-fluid element ratios between 0.25 and 4, and acceleration response was similar for both element types (R-2=0.997). Tetrahedral elements were found to become increasingly volatile following shock loading, causing higher pressures and stresses than predicted with the hexahedral elements. Deviatoric stress response was dependent on the sphere mesh size (p<0.001), while the pressure response was dependent on the shock tube mesh size (p<0.001). The results of this study highlight the necessity for mesh sensitivity analysis in blast models.", "paper_title": "Mesh considerations for finite element blast modelling in biomechanics", "paper_id": "WOS:000320089000004"}
