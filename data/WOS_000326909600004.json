The basis for such a task is usually a training set consisting of labeled patterns. In real-world settings, however, such labeled data are usually scarce, and the corresponding models might yield unsatisfying results. Unlabeled data, on the other hand, can often be obtained in huge quantities without much additional effort. A prominent research direction in the field of machine learning is semi-supervised support vector machines. This type of binary classification approach aims at taking the additional information provided by the unlabeled patterns into account to reveal more information about the structure of the data at hand. In some cases, this can yield significantly better classification results compared to a straightforward application of supervised models. One drawback, however, is the fact that generating such models requires solving difficult non-convex optimization tasks. In this work, we present a simple but effective gradient-based optimization framework to address the induced problems. The resulting method can be implemented easily using black-box optimization engines and yields excellent classification and runtime results on both sparse and non-sparse data sets.
