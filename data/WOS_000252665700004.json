In this context, we propose an optimization solution which operates on two levels. The first one aims to constitute a set of MAs building their routes, called Workplans. At this stage, Workplans must incorporate all nodes, representing information providers in the multimodal network, in order to explore it completely. Thanks to an evolutionary approach, the second level must optimize nodes' selection in order to increase the number of satisfied users. The assignment of network nodes to the required services must be followed by a Workplan update procedure in order to deduce final routes paths. Finally, simulation results are mentioned to invoke the different steps of our adopted approach. (c) 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
