Their general approach is now applied to a multivariate control chart instead of a univariate control chart. A cost model for the economic-statistical design of a Hotelling T-2 control chart is derived to deal with situations involving a Weibull shock model with an increasing failure rate. Application of the proposed T-2 control chart design is demonstrated through a numerical example. A sensitivity analysis of the model is performed.", "paper_title": "Multivariate extension to the economical design of (X)over-bar control chart under Weibull shock model", "paper_id": "WOS:000242208900001"}
