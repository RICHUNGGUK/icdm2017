In this paper we present the common implementation of these processes in the Monte Carlo generator PYTHIA8, using relations between the parameters of the two models. The program offers several options related to the treatment of the UV region of the effective theories, including the possibility of using a form factor for the running gravitational coupling. Characteristic results obtained with PYTHIA8 have been used to validate the implementations as well as to illustrate the key features and effects of the model parameters. The results presented in this paper are focused on mono-jet, di-photon and di-lepton final states at the LHC. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
