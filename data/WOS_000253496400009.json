In this work, the pseudo-bond graph model has been developed to predict the temperature distribution in this process, which includes the study of essential temperature dynamics inside the material. For each section of the through-process rolling section, an individual pseudo-bond graph model has been developed, and finally those are connected to each other. By using this model one can predict the output temperature at the end of the runout table for a given set of input parameters at the entry of reheat furnace. (c) 2007 IMACS.
