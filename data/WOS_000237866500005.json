Recognizing affective states from physiological cues is an effective way of implementing implicit human-robot interaction. Several machine learning techniques have been successfully employed in affect-recognition to predict the affective state of an individual given a set of physiological features. However, a systematic comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of these methods has not yet been done. In this paper, we present a comparative study of four machine learning methods-K-Nearest Neighbor, Regression Tree (RT), Bayesian Network and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as applied to the domain of affect recognition using physiological signals. The results showed that SVM gave the best classification accuracy even though all the methods performed competitively. RT gave the next best classification accuracy and was the most space and time efficient.", "paper_title": "An empirical study of machine learning techniques for affect recognition in human-robot interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000237866500005"}
