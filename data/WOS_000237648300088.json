Based on the disassembly mechanism and the characteristics of parts and assembly-groups, the disassembly functions are classified into three categories; accessibility, transmission of disassembly power and disassembly structure. To determine the influencing parameters, some assembly-groups of an automobile are disassembled. The weighting values for the influencing factors are calculated by using of AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process). Using these weighting values, the point tables for the using purpose are determined. Finally, an optimal design guideline for the using purpose of an assembly-group can be decided.", "paper_title": "Design for using purpose of assembly-group", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300088"}
