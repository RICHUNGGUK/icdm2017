In the MBMS system, a group of adjacent base stations (BSs) can form a multimedia broadcast single-frequency network (MBFSN) area, hereinafter referred to as MBSA, and are synchronized to collaboratively transmit multimedia data. By forming a MBSA, the MBMS users can avoid excessive inter-cell handovers as well as have better radio efficiency at the cell-edge. This paper studies the MBSA planning (MBSAP) problem under the constraints that each BS can supply only a limited number of video programs. With the information of the probability of user handover and popularity of video programs, MBSAP seeks to maximize the total system rewards by simultaneously: (I) arranging a list of video programs served by each BS, and (2) organizing BSs into a set of MBSAs. In this paper, the MBSAP problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. We also propose a genetic algorithm (GA) based algorithm and a Fusion-and-Refinement (FUSE) algorithm due to the high computational complexity of ILP. Simulation results show that the performance of GA and FUSE are competitive to that of ILP. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
