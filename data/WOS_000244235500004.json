The moving loads represent sources of noise and vibration generated by moving vehicles, and the analysis describes the propagation of the disturbances generated in soil. A finite-element time-domain analysis in convected coordinates with a simple upwind scheme is presented, including a special set of boundary conditions permitting the passage of outgoing waves in the convected coordinate system. The modification of frequency-dependent damping to convected coordinates is described, and the convected formulation of boundary elements is presented and used for illustrating the effect of 'high-speed' motion. Finally, a procedure for the coupling of a local finiteelement model with a boundary-element model of an exterior, or open, domain is described. The paper uses recent results from the Danish research programme 'Damping Mechanisms in Dynamics of Structures and Materials' as a basis for a general discussion and review of the recent literature on the subject.
