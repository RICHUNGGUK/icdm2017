More specifically, we design a second-order (super-twisting) control algorithm for the speed regulation of a DC motor. For this, a switching control for the multi-cellular converter is derived in order to supply the correct reference value for the speed regulation. A practical implementation of the controller is realised using a laboratory set-up. The performance and the validity of the controller are shown experimentally.", "paper_title": "High-order sliding mode control of a DC motor drive via a switched controlled multi-cellular converter", "paper_id": "WOS:000295462000004"}
