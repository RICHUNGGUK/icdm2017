However, WEAN employs the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) medium access control (MAC) protocol, which consumes a significant portion of the energy resources of a mobile device. Hence, minimizing the energy consumption of the WLAN interface in mobile devices has recently attracted considerable interest in both academia and industry. This article provides a survey and an experimental study of the energy consumption issues and energy-efficient technologies of the MAC protocol in IEEE 802.11 WLAN. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
