Both the cubic and quartic solvers give highly accurate roots and place no restrictions on the magnitude of the polynomial coefficients. The key to the algorithm is a proper rescaling of both polynomials. This puts upper bounds on the magnitude of the roots and is very useful in stabilizing the root finding process. The cubic solver is based on dividing the cubic polynomial into six classes. By analyzing the root surface for each class, a fast convergent Newton-Raphson starting point for a real root is obtained at a cost no higher than three additions and four multiplications. The quartic solver uses the cubic solver in getting information about stationary points and, when the quartic has real roots, stable Newton-Raphson iterations give one of the extreme real roots. The remaining roots follow by composite deflation to a cubic. If the quartic has only complex roots, the present article shows that a stable Newton-Raphson iteration on a derived symmetric sixth degree polynomial can be formulated for the real parts of the complex roots. The imaginary parts follow by solving suitable quadratics.", "paper_title": "Algorithm 954: An Accurate and Efficient Cubic and Quartic Equation Solver for Physical Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000363733000008"}
