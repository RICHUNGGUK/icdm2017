The relationships between these costs and revenues are taken into consideration when deciding which vertices should be spanned by the solution tree. The survey contains a classification of the problems falling within this category and an overview of the methods developed to solve them. It also fists several graph preprocessing procedures and analyzes their validity for the different variants of the problem. Finally, a brief comparison is made between the profit versions of the Steiner tree problem and of the travelling salesman problem.", "paper_title": "Steiner tree problems with profits", "paper_id": "WOS:000239192100003"}
