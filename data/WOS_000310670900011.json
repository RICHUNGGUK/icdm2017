Two of the global regulators involved in controlling gene expression during the infection cycle of the bacterium are Fur and HNS. In this paper, we demonstrate computationally that Fur and HNS have disproportionately high density of binding sites in the Pathogenicity Islands on the Salmonella chromosome. Moreover, the frequency of binding sites for the two proteins is correlated throughout the genome of the organism. These results indicate a complex interplay between Fur and HNS in regulating cellular global behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
