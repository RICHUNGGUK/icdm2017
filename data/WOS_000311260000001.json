Specifically, it plays a crucial role within the 3D digital model acquisition pipeline, in which the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is considered the de facto standard for pair-wise alignment of range images. Nevertheless, the success of ICP depends on several assumptions. A new family of registration techniques have been recently proposed based on evolutionary computation paradigm to solve the common ICP problems. Unlike previous contributions, we propose a novel self-adaptive evolutionary image registration algorithm able to search for the values of both the control and the problem solving parameters to achieve accurate alignments, simultaneously. It combines two different population-based optimization approaches that are concerned with the proper optimization of the control parameters and the image alignments, respectively. The performance of our proposal is compared with several state-of-the-art image registration methods. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
