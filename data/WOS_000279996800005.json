This paper presents a new class of tissue-like P systems with cell separation, a feature which allows the generation of new workspace. We study the efficiency of the class of P systems and draw a conclusion that only tractable problems can be efficiently solved by using cell separation and communication rules with the length of at most 1. We further present an efficient (uniform) solution to SAT by using cell separation and communication rules with length at most 6. We conclude that a borderline between efficiency and non-efficiency exists in terms of the length of communication rules (assuming P not equal NP). We discuss future research topics and open problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
