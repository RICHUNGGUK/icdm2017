The objective of CVRP. known demands oil the cost of originating and terminating at a delivery depot, is to determine the optimal set of routes for a set of vehicles to deliver customers. CVRP is known to be NP-hard problem, and then it is difficult to solve this problem directly when the problem size is large. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm of simulated annealing and tabu search is applied to solve CVRP. It takes the advantages of simulated annealing and tabu search for solving CVRP. Simulation results are reported oil classical fourteen instances and twenty large-scale benchmark instances. From simulation results, the proposed algorithm finds eight best solutions of classical fourteen instances. Additionally. the solutions of the proposed algorithm have also admirable performance for twenty large-scale benchmark instances. It shows that the proposed algorithm is competitive with other existing algorithms for solving CVRP.
