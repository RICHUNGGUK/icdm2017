In the presence of a significant overlapping, the task of learning from imbalanced data can be a very difficult problem. Additionally, if the overall imbalance ratio is different from local imbalance ratios in overlap regions, the task can become in a major challenge. This paper explains the behaviour of the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) rule when learning from such a complex scenario. This local model is compared to other machine learning algorithms, attending to how their behaviour depends on a number of data complexity features (global imbalance, size of overlap region, and its local imbalance). As a result, several conclusions useful for classifier design are inferred.", "paper_title": "On the k-NN performance in a challenging scenario of imbalance and overlapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000258579900005"}
