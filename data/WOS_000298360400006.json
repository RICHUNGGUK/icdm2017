The integer-valuedness and monotonicity of the iterative procedure with respect to the objective function ensures that the algorithm is finite. As a result, either a unique optimal solution of the original assignment problem or a system of constraints is obtained. In the latter case, the system of constraints can be used to obtain all optimal solutions. Examples illustrating the algorithm are discussed.", "paper_title": "Method of sequential modification of the objective function in the assignment problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000298360400006"}
