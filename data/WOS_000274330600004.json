The paper presents a novel topology mixer that leads to better performance in terms of linearity, isolation and power consumption for low supply voltage. The measuring results of the proposed mixer achieve: 7.6 dB power conversion gain, 11.4 dB double side band noise figure, 3 dBm input third-order intercept point, and the total dc power consumption of this mixer including output buffers is 2.45 mW from a 1 V supply voltage. The current output buffer is about 2 mW, the excellent LO-RF, LO-IF and RF-IF isolation achieved up to 37.8, 54.8 and 38.2 dB, respectively.", "paper_title": "A 5.25-GHz low-power down-conversion mixer in 0.18-mu m CMOS technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000274330600004"}
