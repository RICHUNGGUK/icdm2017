By using these technologies, ordinary objects such as coffee mugs or advertisement posters provide digital information that can be easily processed The second trend is set by (semantic) Web services that provide a way to automatically invoke functionalities across the Internet lowering interoperability barriers. The PERCI system, discussed in the article, provides a bridge between these two technologies allowing the invocation of Web services using the information gathered from the tags to effectively transform every object in a service proxy.", "paper_title": "Bringing semantic services to real-world objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000253367300004"}
