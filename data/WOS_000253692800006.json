One of the major drawbacks of the SOM algorithm is the difficulty for nonexpert users to interpret the information contained in a trained SOM. In this paper, this problem is addressed by introducing an enhanced version of the Clusot algorithm. This algorithm consists of two main steps: 1) the computation of the Clusot surface utilizing the information contained in a trained SOM and 2) the automatic detection of clusters in this surface. In the Clusot surface, clusters present in the underlying SOM are indicated by the local maxima of the surface. For SOMs with 2-D topology, the Clusot surface can, therefore, be considered as a convenient visualization technique. Yet, the presented approach is not restricted to a certain type of 2-D SOM topology and it is also applicable for SOMs having an n-dimensional grid topology.", "paper_title": "Automatic cluster detection in Kohonen's SO-M", "paper_id": "WOS:000253692800006"}
