In drug design, their relevance is already well established to search for the most suitable alternative to a target drug. In the QSAR field they are currently the key factor in read-accross strategy along with the defined chemical space. Similarity indices for binary variables are usually called similarity coefficients and their first definitions date back to the end of the 19th century provided by scientists especially interested in taxonomic studies. Till date, more than 50 different similarity coefficients have been found in the literature, each having its own mathematical properties and characteristics and used in different scientific fields. In this paper, five new similarity coefficients for binary data are proposed and compared with some well-known similarity coefficients.", "paper_title": "New Similarity Coefficients for Binary Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000310398600009"}
