In this paper, we give an O(n)-time algorithm for the case where the average upper bound is ineffective, i.e., U = infinity. On the other hand, we prove that the time complexity of the problem with an effective average upper bound is Omega(n log n) even if the average lower bound is ineffective, i.e., L = infinity.
