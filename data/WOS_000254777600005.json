We show that syntactic incremental branching programs capture previously studied models of computation for the problem GEN, namely marking machines (Cook, S.A. in J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 9(3):308-316, 1974) and Poon's extension (Proc. of the 34th IEEE Symp. on the Foundations of Computer Science, pp. 218-227, 1993) of jumping automata on graphs (Cook, S.A., Rackoff, C.W. in SIAM J. Comput. 9:636-652, 1980). We then prove exponential size lower bounds for our syntactic incremental model, and for some other variants of branching program computation for GEN. We further show that nondeterministic syntactic incremental branching programs are provably stronger than their deterministic counterpart when solving a natural NL-complete GEN sub-problem. It remains open if syntactic incremental branching programs are as powerful as unrestricted branching programs for GEN problems.", "paper_title": "Incremental branching programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000254777600005"}
