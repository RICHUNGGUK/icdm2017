Document images are represented by graphs whose nodes correspond to the objects in the images. Consequently, the image matching problem is then converted to graph matching. To deal with the instability of object segmentation, a multi-granularity object tree is constructed for a document image. Each level in the tree corresponds to one possible object segmentation, while different levels are characterized by various object granularities. Some graphs can be generated from the tree and the objects associated with each graph may be of different granularities. Two graphs with the maximum similarity are found from the multi-granularity object trees of the two near-duplicate document images which are to be matched. The encouraging experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
