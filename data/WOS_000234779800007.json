In order to represent structural features common to such semistructured data, we propose a linear ordered term tree, which is a rooted tree pattern consisting of ordered tree structures and internal structured variables with distinct variable labels. For a set of edge labels Lambda, let partial derivative TT Lambda be the set of all linear ordered term trees. For a linear ordered term tree t in partial derivative TT Lambda, the term tree language of t, denoted by L-Lambda(t), is the set of all ordered trees obtained from t by substituting arbitrary ordered trees for all variables in t. Given a set of ordered trees S, the minimal language problem for partial derivative TL Lambda = {L-Lambda(t) vertical bar t is an element of partial derivative TT Lambda} is to find a linear ordered term tree t in partial derivative TT Lambda such that LA (t) is minimal among all term tree languages which contain all ordered trees in S. We show that the class partial derivative TT Lambda is polynomial time inductively inferable from positive data, by giving a polynomial time algorithm for solving the minimal language problem for partial derivative TT Lambda (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Ordered term tree languages which are polynomial time inductively inferable from positive data", "paper_id": "WOS:000234779800007"}
