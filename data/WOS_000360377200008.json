Physically-based method becomes predominant in smoke simulation in computer graphics community. It prevails over traditional methods for its plausible visual effect. Significant results have been carried out over past two decades. We give a latest overview of state-of-the-art of smoke simulation and also compare various techniques according to their characteristics. We discuss several issues in terms of computational efficiency, numerical stability, numerical dissipation, and runtime performance. A number of open challenging problems are also addressed for further exploration.", "paper_title": "Physically-based smoke simulation for computer graphics: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000360377200008"}
