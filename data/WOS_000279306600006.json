This class includes the class of stationary fuzzy metrics, and in particular, when the fuzzy metric is principal, we obtain a family of metrics which are compatible with the topology induced by the fuzzy metric. Also, we study some aspects of the completion of strong fuzzy metrics and we find a class of completable stationary fuzzy metrics which includes the class of stationary fuzzy ultrametrics.
