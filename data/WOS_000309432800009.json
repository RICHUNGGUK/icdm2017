In this paper, a low-cost active 3D triangulation laser scanner for indoor navigation of miniature mobile robots is presented. It is implemented by moving both a camera and a laser diode together on the robot's movable part. The movable part is actuated by a servo motor through a gear train to achieve +/- 90 degrees scanning view angle. The software module includes image processing and data post-processing. 3D world coordinates are calculated from 2D image coordinates based on the triangulation principle. With a 3D laser scanning method, navigation algorithms for obstacle avoidance and gateway passing are proposed. Finally, experiments are conducted to validate performance of the scanner and to test the efficiency of the navigation algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
