However, most of prior studies on auction are mainly restricted to channel allocation with the assumption of fixed transmitting power and/or neglecting spectrum holders' interference restrictions. Few of them jointly considers the channel and power allocation. Additionally, power allocation may cause non-identical interference relationships among unlicensed users due to the variable interference ranges. In this paper, we propose two truthful double auction schemes under single-channel demand and multi-channel demand, respectively. We theoretically prove that the two auction schemes both achieve the desired economic properties. Results from numerical evaluation demonstrate our analysis.", "paper_title": "Double Auction for Joint Channel and Power Allocation in Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000366469000006"}
