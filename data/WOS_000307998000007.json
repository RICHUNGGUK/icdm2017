In particular, we show that the worst-case cost of an optimal affine policy can be times the worst-case cost of an optimal fully-adaptable solution for any delta > 0, where m is the number of linear constraints. We also show that the worst-case cost of the best affine policy is times the optimal cost when the first-stage constraint matrix has non-negative coefficients. Moreover, if there are only k a parts per thousand currency sign m uncertain parameters, we generalize the performance bound for affine policies to , which is particularly useful if only a few parameters are uncertain. We also provide an -approximation algorithm for the general case without any restriction on the constraint matrix but the solution is not an affine function of the uncertain parameters. We also give a tight characterization of the conditions under which an affine policy is optimal for the above model. In particular, we show that if the uncertainty set, is a simplex, then an affine policy is optimal. However, an affine policy is suboptimal even if is a convex combination of only (m + 3) extreme points (only two more extreme points than a simplex) and the worst-case cost of an optimal affine policy can be a factor (2 - delta) worse than the worst-case cost of an optimal fully-adaptable solution for any delta > 0.", "paper_title": "On the power and limitations of affine policies in two-stage adaptive optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000307998000007"}
