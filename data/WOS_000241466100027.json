Uni- as well as bidirectional trails are investigated and characteristic patterns in the distribution of workers on the trail are identified. Some of these patterns have already been observed empirically. They give rise to unusual flow characteristics which are also discussed. The question of possible functions of the observed traffic patterns and the resulting flow characteristics will be treated for simplified biological scenarios.", "paper_title": "Traffic patterns and flow characteristics in an ant trail model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241466100027"}
