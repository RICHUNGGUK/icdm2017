Many types of filters have been developed during the last years in order to satisfy the demands of modern applications in both terrestrial systems and onboard spacecrafts, leading to a great variety of aspects such as transfer functions, resonator implementations or coupling structures. This paper revisits some of the last advances in this area, including the modeling and full-wave simulation. Some recent designs using dual-mode cavities along with other novel implementations in ridge waveguide will be shown.", "paper_title": "Recent Advances in Filter Topologies and Realizations for Satellite Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000299025200009"}
