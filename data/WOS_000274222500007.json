Considering average case analysis allows for better results. In this work we consider the uniform distribution over k-colorable graphs with n vertices and exactly cn edges, c greater than some sufficiently large constant. We rigorously show that all proper k-colorings of most such graphs lie in a single \"cluster\", and agree on all but a small, though constant, portion of the vertices. We also describe a polynomial time algorithm that whp finds a proper k-coloring of such a random k-colorable graph, thus asserting that most such graphs are easy to color. This should be contrasted with the setting of very sparse random graphs (which are k-colorable whp), where experimental results show some regime of edge density to be difficult for many coloring heuristics.", "paper_title": "Why Almost All k-Colorable Graphs Are Easy to Color", "paper_id": "WOS:000274222500007"}
