ZNF217 is a candidate oncogene located at 20q13, a chromosomal region frequently amplified in breast and ovarian cancer, and correlated with shorter patient survival in these cancers. To properly address the difficulties in managing complex gene interactions given our limited sample, statistical significance of edge strengths was evaluated using bootstrapping and the less reliable edges were pruned to increase the network robustness. We found that 13 out of the 35 genes associated with deregulated ZNF217 expression in breast tumours have been previously associated with survival and/or prognosis in cancers. Identifying genes involved in lipid metabolism opens new fields of investigation to decipher the molecular mechanisms driven by the ZNF217 oncogene. Moreover, nine of the 13 genes have already been identified as putative ZNF217 targets by independent biological studies. We therefore suggest that the algorithms for inferring local BNs are valuable data mining tools for unraveling complex mechanisms of biological pathways from expression data.
