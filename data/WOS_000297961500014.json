This paper examines specifically colonnade systems with two rows of columns, one over the other, under various ground motions. The computed results show that the frequency content of the ground motion affects mostly the response. The displacements of the upper level columns in respect to the displacements of the lower level columns are affected more by the frequency content of the excitation.
