Modeling techniques for context information are classified into six different categories and benchmarked according to their support with regard to 12 service requirements described in this work. One of these modeling techniques is used in the framework of a distributed context handling and delivery system that is also part of this article's contribution and a representative wireless ad hoc application scenario is presented. This end user scenario and many others are possible thanks to the flexibility and adaptability of the above mentioned context handling and delivery system.", "paper_title": "Information modeling and handling for context-aware multimedia services", "paper_id": "WOS:000241747800019"}
