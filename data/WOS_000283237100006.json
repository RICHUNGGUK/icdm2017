Therefore, the latest distribution management systems tend to incorporate optimization functions for the short-term scheduling of the various energy and control resources available in the network (e. g., embedded generators, reactive power compensators and transformers equipped with on-load tap changers). The short-term scheduling procedure adopted in the paper is composed by two stages: a day-ahead scheduler for the optimization of distributed resources production during the following day, an intra-day scheduler that every 15 min adjusts the scheduling in order to take into account the operation requirements and constraints of the distribution network. The intra-day scheduler solves a non-linear multi-objective optimization problem by iteratively applying a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) algorithm. The linearization of the optimization function and the constraints is achieved by the use of sensitivity coefficients obtained from the results of a three-phase power flow calculation. The paper shows the application of the proposed approach to a medium-voltage 120 buses network with five wind plants, one photovoltaic field, ten dispatchable generators, and two transformers equipped with on-load tap changers.", "paper_title": "Short-Term Scheduling and Control of Active Distribution Systems With High Penetration of Renewable Resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000283237100006"}
