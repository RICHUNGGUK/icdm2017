In this paper, we present arguments based on physics that the main reason for higher exposure of children (also women and men with smaller heads and likely thinner pinnae) to radiofrequency energy from mobile phones is the closer placement of the cell phone radiation source by several millimeters to the tissues of the head, e. g., the brain. Using heterogeneous anatomically derived shaped models of the head, we have previously reported that the exposure increases by a compounding rate of 10%-15% for every single millimeter of closer location of the radiating antenna. This is similar to the report of similar to 20% increase for every millimeter in the Foster and Chou's paper from their (1) even though their simplistic (1) is valid only for a homogenous tissue slab of in finite size and the radiation source that is a wire dipole rather than a mobile telephone. Both of their assumptions for (1) are obviously not applicable for human exposures to mobile telephones. Actually, the physical reason for such a rapid drop off of coupled energy is that the radiofrequency electromagnetic fields close to a radiating source in the so-called near-field region reduce in strength very rapidly with every millimeter of distance, even faster than in the far-field region, where the electromagnetic fields reduce inversely with the square of the distance from the source.", "paper_title": "Yes the Children Are More Exposed to Radiofrequency Energy From Mobile Telephones Than Adults", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200073"}
