The proposed algorithm, CoreTrimmer, iterates over each internal node d in the resolution graph that 'consumes' a large number of clauses M (i.e., a large number of original clauses are present in the unsat core with the sole purpose of proving d) and attempts to prove them without the M clauses. If this is possible, it transforms the resolution graph into a new graph that does not have the M clauses at its core. CoreTrimmer can be integrated into a fixpoint framework similarly to Malik and Zhang's fix-point algorithm RUN_TILL_ FIX. We call this option TRIM_TILL_FIX. Experimental evaluation on a large number of industrial CNF unsatisfiable formulas shows that TRIM_TILL_FIX doubles, on average, the number of reduced clauses in comparison to RUN_TILL_FIX. It is also better when used as a component in a bigger system that enforces short timeouts.", "paper_title": "An approach for extracting a small unsatisfiable core", "paper_id": "WOS:000260263300001"}
