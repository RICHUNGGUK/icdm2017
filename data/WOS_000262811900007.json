We prove the convergence of the limiting stationary or periodic distribution to the exponential distribution. In a scheme of series, we consider the C-convergence of the waiting time process to a diffusion process with constant coefficients and reflection at the zero boundary. Examples of computation of the diffusion coefficient in terms of characteristics of the arrival flow and service time are given.", "paper_title": "Limit theorems for queueing systems with doubly stochastic poisson arrivals (Heavy traffic conditions)", "paper_id": "WOS:000262811900007"}
