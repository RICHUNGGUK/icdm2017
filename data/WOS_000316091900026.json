An example scenario is a disaster area, where forwarding information generated in the incident location, like victims' medical data, to a coordination point is critical for quick, accurate and coordinated intervention. New applications are being developed based on mobile devices and wireless opportunistic networks as a solution to destroyed or overused communication networks. But the performance of opportunistic routing methods applied to emergency scenarios is unknown today. In this paper, we compare and contrast the efficiency of the most significant opportunistic routing protocols through simulations in realistic disaster scenarios in order to show how the different characteristics of an emergency scenario impact in the behaviour of each one of them.
