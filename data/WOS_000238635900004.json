This paper introduces a novel minimum interference routing algorithm, Light Minimum Interference Routing (LMIR), which is based on a new approach to the identification of critical links. This approach reduces the computational complexity involved in finding a path for the establishment of an LSP. The LMIR is shown to have the same precision as existing algorithms but with less computational complexity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
