Special attention is given to the CF elements equal to 1. We define two complementary equivalence relations on the set of slopes, based on their CF expansions. A new description of digital lines is presented; we show how to define a straight line or upper mechanical word by two sequences of positive integers fulfilling some extra conditions. These equivalence relations and this new description enable us to analyze the construction of digital lines and upper mechanical words. The analysis of suprema of equivalence classes under one of these relations leads to a result which involves Fibonacci numbers. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
