In this paper, we give new complexity results, namely the NP-hardness of MMM and MIM in induced subgrids and we point out some promising research directions. We also sketch the general framework of a unified approach to show the NP-hardness of some problems in subgrids.", "paper_title": "A note on the NP-hardness of two matching problems in induced subgrids", "paper_id": "WOS:000327033900017"}
