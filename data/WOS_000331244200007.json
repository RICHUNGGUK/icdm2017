This paper presents a novel quantum steganography protocol based on probability measurements for transmitting n qubits secret message in an insecure quantum channel. In the protocol, senders embed the secret message into the cover data by POVM measurements. Then, receivers can correctly extract the secret message and recover the cover data with a certain probability by selecting two sets of appropriate protective measurement operators to act projective measurements, respectively. More importantly, the existence of the secret message has no influence on the cover data. In addition, the security of our protocol does not rely on other protocols. The paper analyzes the secrecy and the security in detail.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL QUANTUM STEGANOGRAPHY PROTOCOL BASED ON PROBABILITY MEASUREMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000331244200007"}
