The protocol uses a scoring mechanism to aggregate and rank resource provider assets and Internet router data tables (called grid routing tables) for storage and retrieval of the assets. Then, we discuss the simulation framework used to model the protocol and the results of the experimentation. The simulator utilizes a simulation engine core that can be reused for other network protocol simulators considering time management, event distribution, and a simulated network infrastructure. The techniques for constructing the simulation core code using C++/CLR are also presented in this paper. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
