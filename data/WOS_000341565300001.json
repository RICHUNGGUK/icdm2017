HT detection and diagnosis are challenging due to the huge number of gates in modern IC designs and the high cost of testing. We propose a scalable and efficient HT detection and diagnosis scheme based on segmentation and consistency analysis of gate-level properties. In addition, we employ a self-consistency-based approach, where we conduct variable elimination and create subsegments from a fixed set of power measurements of the entire IC to minimize the number of power measurements. We evaluate our HT detection and diagnosis schemes on a set of ISCAS and ITC benchmarks.", "paper_title": "Self-Consistency and Consistency-Based Detection and Diagnosis of Malicious Circuitry", "paper_id": "WOS:000341565300001"}
