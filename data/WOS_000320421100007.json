Cloud reliability analysis and modeling are not easy tasks because of the complexity and large scale of the system. Due to the complexity of cloud computing systems, the reliability models for pure software/hardware or conventional networks cannot be simply applied to study the cloud reliability. This paper focuses on reliability evaluation using hybrid methods, which combine MTTF/MTTR and CTMC models. We take into account not only service faults, but also the effect of physical-resource breakdowns. Based on the proposed model, the formal calculation of the system's reliability is given. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through an example.", "paper_title": "RELIABILITY EVALUATION OF CLOUD COMPUTING SYSTEMS USING HYBRID METHODS", "paper_id": "WOS:000320421100007"}
