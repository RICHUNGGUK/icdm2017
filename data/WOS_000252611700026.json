In this regard, context plays an essential role in semantic understanding of human behavioral and social signals from sensor data. This paper put forward an event-based dynamic context model to address the problems of context awareness in the analysis of group interaction scenarios. Event-driven multilevel dynamic Bayesian network is correspondingly proposed to detect multilevel events, which underlies the context awareness mechanism. Online analysis can be achieved, which is superior over previous works. Experiments in our smart meeting room demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Group interaction analysis in dynamic context", "paper_id": "WOS:000252611700026"}
