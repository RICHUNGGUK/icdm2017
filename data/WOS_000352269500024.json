Here, we describe the VIrtual Constrution TOol for pRoteins (Victor) C++ library, an open source platform dedicated to enabling inexperienced users to develop advanced tools and gathering contributions from the community. The provided application examples cover statistical energy potentials, profile-profile sequence alignments and ab initio loop modeling. Victor was used over the last 15 years in several publications and optimized for efficiency. It is provided as a GitHub repository with source files and unit tests, plus extensive online documentation, including a Wiki with help files and tutorials, examples and Doxygen documentation.", "paper_title": "The Victor C plus plus library for protein representation and advanced manipulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000352269500024"}
