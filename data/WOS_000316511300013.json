Kinematics and workspace of the proposed parallel manipulator are systematically studied. The proposed mechanism with two rotations includes the bottom fixed platform, two servo electrical cylinders, one supporting pillar, the top platform and some joints. First the kinematics characteristics of the 2-DOF parallel manipulator are analyzed and geometric description are given. Second some analytic formulae are derived for solving inverse displacement and forward displacement for the two rotations of the proposed 2-DOF mechanism. Third workspace for this 2-DOF mechanism is constructed and analyzed. The analytic results are verified by its simulation mechanism to be consistent with the calculated ones. The proposed mechanism has very simple structure and low cost and can realize two rotations in space. An example is given using in proprioceptive mechanism of vehicle driving simulator.
