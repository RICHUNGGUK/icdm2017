The Lambda modes are eigenfunctions associated with a given configuration of the reactor, which have successfully been used to describe unstable events in BWRs. To compute several eigenvalues and its corresponding eigenfunctions for a nuclear reactor is quite expensive from the computational point of view. Krylov subspace methods are efficient methods to compute the dominant Lambda modes associated with a given configuration of the reactor, but if the Lambda modes have to be computed for different perturbed configurations of the reactor more efficient methods can be used. In this paper, different methods for the updating Lambda modes problem will be proposed and compared by computing the dominant Lambda modes of different configurations associated with a Boron injection transient in a typical BWR reactor.
