To increase the efficiency of spectrum sensing and ensure the fairness and accuracy in sensing progress, we propose a sub-spectrum sensing scheme based on reputation. After that we extend the reputation in the scheme proposed to the spectrum allocation process. The simulation shows that our scheme can defense Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification (SSDF) attacks effectively, and increase the efficiency and fairness of the spectrum sensing.", "paper_title": "SUB-SPECTRUM SENSING BASED ON REPUTATION IN CRNS", "paper_id": "WOS:000305169200019"}
