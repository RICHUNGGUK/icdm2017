The signal transmitted by each mobile terminal (MT) is submitted to a nonlinear operation consisting of a clipping device followed by a frequency-domain filtering operation, so as to reduce the envelope fluctuations and peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) while maintaining the spectral occupation of conventional MC-CDMA signals. At the base station, an iterative receiver employing multiple antennas jointly performs turbo multi-user detection and the estimation and cancellation of nonlinear distortion effects Performance results show that the proposed receiver structures can achieve good performances that are very close to those obtained with linear transmitters, even for high system load and/or when a very low-PMEPR MC-CDMA transmission is intended for each MT.", "paper_title": "A turbo SDMA receiver for strongly nonlinearly distorted MC-CDMA signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000265375500006"}
