For example, one patient with four cases and another one with five cases, only first four cases of these two patients are paired and the left one case may be ignored. In this paper, in order to dynamically determine matching pairs among cases and pair all cases between two patients, we propose a multiple measurements case-based reasoning (MMCBR) to be used for building liver cancer recurrence predictive models. MMCBR and single measurement case-based reasoning (SingleCBR) are evaluated and compared. According to experiment results in this study, the performance of MMCBR models is better than that of SingleCBR models. Multiple measurements accumulated during a period of time do have benefits for building predictive models with improved performance based on this proposed MMCBR method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
