Following the approach of Friedman and Tillich, we use this fact to improve on the first linear programming bound on the rate of low-density parity check (LDPC) codes, as the function of their minimal relative distance. This improvement, combined with the techniques of Ben-Haim and Litsyn, improves the rate versus distance bounds for LDPC codes in a significant subrange of relative distances.", "paper_title": "On Coset Leader Graphs of LDPC Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000357939400002"}
