This paper presents a new algorithm that solves the optimal wire retiming problem with polynomial-time worst case complexity. Since the new algorithm avoids binary search and is essentially incremental, it has the potential of being combined with other optimization techniques. Experimental results show that the new algorithm is very efficient in practice.", "paper_title": "Optimal wire retiming without binary search", "paper_id": "WOS:000240078200001"}
