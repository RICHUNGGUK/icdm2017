In this paper, we studied the errors on stress and strain measurement in dynamic tensile tests by using finite-element analysis. Two strain and one stress measures were discussed. Mainly, we considered the influence of the material and multiple geometrical and testing parameters. We were limited to the case of elastic behaviour of the material. We observed that the errors on the strain measures are essentially influenced by the geometrical parameters. On the other hand, the error on the stress measure are highly correlated to stress field homogeneity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
