This method is based on the pulse width variability (PWV), and it exploits the respiratory information present in the pulse wave velocity and dispersion. It allows to estimate respiration signal from only a pulse oximeter which is a cheap and comfortable sensor. Evaluation is performed over a database containing electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure (BP), PPG, and respiratory signals simultaneously recorded in 17 subjects during a tilt table test. Respiratory rate estimation error is computed obtaining of 1.27 +/- A 7.81 % (0.14 +/- A 14.78 mHz). For comparison purposes, we have also obtained a respiratory rate estimation from other known methods which involve ECG, BP, or also PPG signals. In addition, we have also combined respiratory information derived from different methods which involve only PPG signal, obtaining a respiratory rate error of -0.17 +/- A 6.67 % (-2.16 +/- A 12.69 mHz). The presented methods, PWV and combination of PPG derived respiration methods, avoid the need of ECG to derive respiration without degradation of the obtained estimates, so it is possible to have reliable respiration rate estimates from just the PPG signal.", "paper_title": "Deriving respiration from photoplethysmographic pulse width", "paper_id": "WOS:000315450100023"}
