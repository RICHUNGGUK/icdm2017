Thus, the mobile users that are on the move and receive an MBMS service may have to deal with dynamic changes of network resources when crossing the Cell's edge, introducing new types of handovers (MBMS Handovers); from Point-to-Point to Point-to-Multipoint transmission mode Cell and vice versa. Executing an MBMS Handover using the existing handover control approach, as described in 3GPP TR 25.922 specifications, results in inefficiencies due to the approach used. In this paper, we highlight these inefficiencies and propose and evaluate a new handover control approach to address them. As illustrated in our performance evaluation, compared to the existing approach, the proposed approach improves the overall system capacity and link performance and avoids any QoS degradation (seamless handover) during an MBMS Handover.
