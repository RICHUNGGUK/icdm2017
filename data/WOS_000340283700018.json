This paper describes empirical data collected during a year-long human-centered game design process, in which design ideas generated by high-school students were bridged with bioinformatics and parallel computing learning concepts. Our research shows that fun' and engaging game elements are actually well suited for addressing the sociotechnical aspects of CI projects. We provide a human-centered game design methodology, as well as a case study, in which this methodology is applied to the design of parallel computing-focused mini-games. This research has implications for integrating large-scale computing concepts such as shared resources and services into gaming experiences. It also has implications for supporting learning through enjoyable and fun experiences as part of a larger CI collaborative environment.
