This paper deals with the theory of solving the closed-loop eigenvalue problem for active flexible multibody systems with multiple-input multiple-output proportional-integral-derivative (PID) type feedback controllers and multiple degrees of freedom finite element models. Modal analyses are performed on both a simple and complex active flexible multibody system in order to illustrate the difference between current modal analysis method for such systems and the proposed theory derived in this paper.
