However, there are situations in which \"prime users\" should be given higher priority, as for example in the transmission of emergency messages. In this paper, we examine a prioritization policy that can be implemented at the physical layer. In particular, we evaluate the performance of a prioritized transmission scheme based on spectrum pooling and on the assignment of higher signal-to-noise ratio channels to higher-priority users. This performance is compared to that of unprioritized (or \"symmetric\") schemes, and the impact of prioritization on the unprioritized users is discussed.", "paper_title": "Prioritized Resource Allocation in Wireless Spectrum Pooling", "paper_id": "WOS:000311527600004"}
