As an alternative to them, in this paper, we propose a class of energy-preserving exponentially-fitted methods. For this aim, we show sufficient conditions for energy-preservation in terms of the coefficients of continuous stage Runge-Kutta (RK) methods, and extend the theory of exponentially-fitted RK methods in the context of continuous stage RK methods. Then by combining these two theories, we derive second and fourth order energy-preserving exponentially-fitted schemes.", "paper_title": "An energy-preserving exponentially-fitted continuous stage Runge-Kutta method for Hamiltonian systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000342210300012"}
