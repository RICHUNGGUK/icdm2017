These systems have a tree topology, in which a central base station is connected to a number of antennas located at tree leaves via cables represented by the tree edges. Each inner node corresponds to a power equipment, of which the available types differ in the number of output ports and/or by power gain at the ports. This paper focuses on the equipment selection problemthat amounts to, for a given passive DAS tree topology, selecting a power equipment type for each inner node and assigning the outgoing edges of the node to the equipment ports. The performance metric is the power deviation at the antennas from the target values. We consider as objective function the minimization of either the total or the largest power deviation over all antennas. Our contributions are the development of exact pseudo-polynomial time algorithms and (additive) fully-polynomial time approximation schemes for both objectives. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the algorithms. We also extend some results to account for equipment cost.", "paper_title": "Exact and Approximation Algorithms for Optimal Equipment Selection in Deploying In-Building Distributed Antenna Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000352569000003"}
