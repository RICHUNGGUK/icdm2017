Based on it, we present a concurrent dynamic logic of knowledge, belief and certainty for MAS, which is called CDKBC logic. Furthermore, a CDKBC model is given for interpreting this logic. We construct a CDKBC proof system for the logic and show that the proof system is sound and complete, and prove that the validity problem for the system is EXPTIME-complete. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
