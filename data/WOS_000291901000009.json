The construction of the proposed boundary conditions is based on characteristic analysis and applied for boundaries with arbitrary shape and orientation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed boundary treatment enables to convect out of the computational domain complex flow features with little distortion. In addition, it is shown that small-amplitude acoustic disturbances could be convected out of the computational domain, with no significant deterioration of the overall accuracy of the method. Furthermore, it was found that application of the proposed boundary treatment for viscous flow over a cylinder yields superior performance compared to simple extrapolation methods.
