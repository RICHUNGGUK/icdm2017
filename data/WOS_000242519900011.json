The availability of Grid Services (e.g. GT3) presents a potentially feasible method to overcome the barriers of sharing heterogeneous computational resources. However, a lack of sophisticated coordination mechanisms for specifying workflow deters the widespread adoption of Grid Services. There is a need for a seamless, flexible, demand-based service to enable engineers and scientists to submit jobs to a computational Grid from remote sources in a manner that ensures that jobs are executed in an efficient, controlled method. In this paper, we propose a system that adopts Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS) as a coordination language to define and manage workflow among Grid Services to meet engineering requirements. A prototype system is built and evaluated with a case study from the automotive industry to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
