Properly combined, the features can be used for creating novel applications that are ideal for pocket-sized devices, but may not be useful in laptop computers, such as interactively capturing and analyzing images on the fly. In this paper we consider building mosaic images of printed documents and natural scenes from low resolution video frames. High interactivity is provided by giving a real-time feedback on the video quality, while simultaneously guiding the user's actions. In our contribution, we analyze and compare means to reach interactivity and performance with sensor signal processing and GPU assistance. The viability of the concept is demonstrated on a mobile phone. The achieved usability benefits suggest that combining interactive imaging and energy efficient high performance computing could enable new mobile applications and user interactions.", "paper_title": "Interactive multi-frame reconstruction for mobile devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000331715200003"}
