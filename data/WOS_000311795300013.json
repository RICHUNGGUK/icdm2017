Experimental results in a series of well-known benchmark problems support the effectiveness of this approach in improving classification performance. Although the need for cross-validation processes obviously leads to higher training requirements and more computational effort, the operation load is never much higher; in many cases it is even lower than that of competitive RAB schemes.", "paper_title": "Real AdaBoost With Gate Controlled Fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000311795300013"}
