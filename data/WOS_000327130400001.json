In this paper, we study graph similarity queries with edit distance constraints. Inspired by the -gram idea for string similarity problems, our solution extracts paths from graphs as features for indexing. We establish a lower bound of common features to generate candidates. Efficient algorithms are proposed to handle three types of graph similarity queries by exploiting both matching and mismatching features as well as degree information to improve the filtering and verification on candidates. We demonstrate the proposed algorithms significantly outperform existing approaches with extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets.", "paper_title": "Efficient processing of graph similarity queries with edit distance constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000327130400001"}
