In the IM group network, two IM users are considered connecting if they are in the same group, which is the essential difference from previous topology. We study worms under IM group topology for the first time. After analyzing the real data, we propose some new propagation approaches of worms and prove their efficiency. To prevent IM group worms, we propose some new defense methods and define some new items. Results can be greatly helpful to administrators of the IM service.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Instant Messaging Group Worms", "paper_id": "WOS:000265103800094"}
