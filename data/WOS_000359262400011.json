DoE is the field that deals with the problem of how to design the most optimal and economic experimentation. The goal is to identify a highly nonlinear and possibly high-dimensional system, together with the minimal experimental effort required. The theory is well developed for linear and polynomial models; however, they are often not suitable for general use. For this reason, a fuzzy model in the form of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) is used, because it has the properties of a universal approximator. The method works iteratively by sampling the system in the input domain and evolving the fuzzy model. The method is demonstrated with a simulation, which shows the potential of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Evolving Fuzzy-Model-Based Design of Experiments With Supervised Hierarchical Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000359262400011"}
