A large number of performance parameters under several operation conditions are needed in order to ensure compliance to specifications. In this paper, we present a low-cost test methodology that determines significant performance parameters, such as path gain IIP(3), quadrature imbalances, noise, bit error rate, and error vector magnitude through a single test setup. The proposed test methodology is applicable for both single-carrier and multicarrier systems. Simulation and measurement results indicate that these performance parameters can be calculated and estimated accurately through a single test setup and using a shorter test sequence than required by traditional techniques. In addition, a calibration technique is presented for single-carrier systems to recover marginally failing devices through analytically correcting performance parameters.", "paper_title": "Low-Cost Characterization and Calibration of RF Integrated Circuits through I-Q Data Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000267436000006"}
