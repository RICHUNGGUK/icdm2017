Soil defects induce stresses, counter-slopes and joint openings, leading to violations of the serviceability limit state (SLS). A model has been developed that includes a description of the soil spatial variability within the framework of geostatistics, where the correlation length of soil properties is the main parameter. It is based on a mechanical description of the soil-structure interaction between a set of segmented buried pipes and the soil support, represented by a modified Vlassov model. The results show that the magnitude of the induced effects depends primarily on the following four factors: the magnitude of the soil variability, the soil-structure stiffness ratio, the structure-connection stiffness ratio (relative flexibility) and the soil-structure length ratio.
