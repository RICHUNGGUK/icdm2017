Specifically, the proposed m-trail allocation method ensures that any healthy link is traversed by at least one uninterrupted m-trail during a multi-link failure, which can be achieved by launching no more than (d + 1) link-disjoint m-trails per link originating from the MN. Based on such a sufficient condition, we study the performance of the m-burst framework by solving an integer linear program (ILP) and a novel heuristic, and implement the method for up to three link failures. To avoid high computation complexity in solving the ILP, a heuristic algorithm is developed for deriving (d + 1) link-disjoint m-trails between the MN and each link of the network. Numerical results show that the proposed methods yield significantly better performance than previous methods in the reference backbone network topologies.", "paper_title": "Multi-link Failure Localization via Monitoring Bursts", "paper_id": "WOS:000344989200002"}
