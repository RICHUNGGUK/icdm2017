Simulations can be very helpful for the optimization of SPECT and PET cameras, and for investigating the importance of several physical effects involved in image formation. In this paper, a simulation study for evaluating various aspects inuencing image formation in detectors for Nuclear Medicine is presented. To this end, the EGSnrc Monte Carlo code has been used, which transports photons and electrons in any material and handling various physical phenomena. Here, some detector systems are simulated, consisting of a parallel-hole collimator and a pixellated scintillator. Various effects are investigated, such as electron transport, uorescence photons, collimator septa penetration. Results are evaluated by means of energy spectra, photon uxes, uniformity of response, SNR and spatial resolution. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
