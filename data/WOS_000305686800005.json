This work employs a bibliometric approach, based on patent citation, non-patent citation, and public-private co-authorship of scientific publications to measure the use of public research in Hsinchu Science Park (HSP) in Taiwan. The result shows that the number of jointly published papers has increased constantly, implying the collaboration between HSP and universities has become more common. However, from the aspect of co-patenting, patent citation, and non-patent reference, technological innovation stemming from public research needs to be enhanced.", "paper_title": "Measuring the use of public research in firm R&D in the Hsinchu Science Park", "paper_id": "WOS:000305686800005"}
