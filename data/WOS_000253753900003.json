In this paper we describe O(n log n) time algorithms for computing the detour and spanning ratio of a planar polygonal path. By generalizing these algorithms, we obtain O(n log(2) n)-time algorithms for computing the detour or spanning ratio of planar trees and cycles. Finally, we develop subquadratic algorithms for computing the detour and spanning ratio for paths, cycles, and trees embedded in E-3, and show that computing the detour in E-3 is at least as hard as Hopcroft's problem.", "paper_title": "Computing the detour and spanning ratio of paths, trees, and cycles in 2D and 3D", "paper_id": "WOS:000253753900003"}
