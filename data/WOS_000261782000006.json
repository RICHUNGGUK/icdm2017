The method realizes the optimal decomposition families of states. We also derive the additivity of the entanglement of formation and thus calculate the entanglement cost. These results are used to find out the undistillable, entanglement of some states. We illustrate our method by investigating the two-qubit state, the separable state, the maximally correlated state, the isotropic state and the Werner state. We also discuss the realization of Werner state in experiment.", "paper_title": "ENTANGLEMENT OF FORMATION FROM OPTIMAL DECOMPOSITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000261782000006"}
