Numerical modelling of biocomposites at different length scales provides an improved understanding of the mechanical behaviour of structures such as bone, and also guides the development of multiscale mechanical models. Here, a three-dimensional nano-scale model of mineralised collagen microfibril based on the finite element method was employed to investigate the effect of material and structural factors on the mechanical equivalent of fracture properties. Fracture stress and damping capacity as functions of the number of cross-links were obtained under tensile loading conditions for different densities and Young's modulus of the mineral phase. The results show that the number of cross-links and the density of mineral as well as Young's modulus of mineral have an important influence on the strength of mineralised collagen microfibrils which in turn clarify the bone fracture on a macroscale.", "paper_title": "Effect of material and structural factors on fracture behaviour of mineralised collagen microfibril using finite element simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000346066800004"}
