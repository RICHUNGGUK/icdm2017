A well-known approach involves rewriting the query using ontological knowledge. We focus here on the basic rewriting technique which consists of rewriting the initial query into a union of conjunctive queries. First, we study a generic breadth-first rewriting algorithm, which takes any rewriting operator as a parameter, and define properties of rewriting operators that ensure the correctness of the algorithm. Then, we focus on piece-unifiers, which provide a rewriting operator with the desired properties. Finally, we propose an implementation of this framework and report some experiments.", "paper_title": "Sound, complete and minimal UCQ-rewriting for existential rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000357876900003"}
