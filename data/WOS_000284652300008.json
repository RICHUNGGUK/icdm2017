The optimization of the DSL network is a cumbersome task due to the abundance of physical layer configuration parameters and significant differences between lines with respect to interference and attenuation. This paper discusses concepts for dynamic optimization techniques that trade off rate, latency, stability, and power usage in an automated and transparent fashion. The techniques use an initial configuration selection to swiftly obtain a near-optimal configuration and then proceed to acquire additional statistics on noise and interference in order to be able to fine-tune the configuration and gradually increase performance. Optimization results for a DSL network that is carrying video services are presented by aid of the Dynamic Line Management module in the Alcatel-Lucent 5530 Network Analyzer.
