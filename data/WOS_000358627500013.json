The method can be initiated by evaluating a scenario describing the current-best intervention. This provides the starting point for three evaluation cycles, focusing on model assumptions, alternative interventions and management targets. The outcome of this method is a list of management targets that can and cannot be achieved, the potential interventions that correspond to these targets, and the assumptions and uncertainties associated with these interventions. It was applied to a case study for environmental flow management in the Macquarie Marshes, Australia. We identified feasible management targets based on ecological outcomes in flood suitability across different locations, climate conditions and species, and the suitable environmental flow volumes that correspond to these targets.
