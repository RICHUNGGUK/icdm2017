Each machine has at most one maintenance activity, which can be performed at any time throughout the planning horizon. The length of the maintenance activity increases linearly with its starting time. The objective is to minimize the total completion time or the total machine load. We show that both versions of the problem can be optimally solved in polynomial time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
