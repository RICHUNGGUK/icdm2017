The first model for the reaction kinetics uses the mean field deterministic governing equations which adaptively operate at the time scales of LBM, whilst the second model uses kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) technique that operates at time scales much smaller than those of LBM. It is found that the kMC-LBM method exhibits noticeably different physics than the mean field-LBM in the context of species generation and transport. This is due to the strong interplay between micro and meso/macro time scales in the flow field. The micro time scales are associated with the reaction whereas the meso/macro time scales are associated with diffusion and convection mechanism. The results indicate that there is a need for multi-scale temporal scaling that seamlessly links the reaction kinetics to the transport processes. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
