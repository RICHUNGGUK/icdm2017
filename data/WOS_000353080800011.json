In this paper, we aim to save energy by both switching base stations on/off and adaptively adjusting their transmission power according to the present traffic conditions for heterogenous wireless cellular networks. We formulate a novel linear programming model for the Traffic-Aware Topology Management (TAM) problem to find the best possible topology which minimizes the overall power consumption of the network while satisfying a certain Quality of Service level in Wideband Code Division Multiple Access packet-switched cellular networks. Although the optimization tools provide the optimum solutions, it is not possible to handle large instances due to the space and computational complexity. Hence, we propose a Green TAM Algorithm to solve the large-scale realistic instances of the formulated problem and compare our results with the results of two previously proposed methods, a greedy heuristic and a commercial optimization tool. We show that the proposed TAM scheme helps to maintain an energy-aware network and saves significant amount of energy by adjusting the network topology to the current traffic conditions adaptively.
