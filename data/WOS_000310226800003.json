We propose a novel construction method for a matroidal network to address this issue. Furthermore, we investigate some properties of the matroidal network based on our construction method. New relations between the matroidal network and its associated matroid are developed through various examples.", "paper_title": "A construction method of matroidal networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310226800003"}
