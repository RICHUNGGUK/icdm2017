To solve this problem, this paper presents an adaptable face recognition approach that uses filter fusion representation. The key idea is to use context-aware filter fusion to get better image from a bad illumination one. Genetic algorithm is the tool for adaptation for individual context category. These can provide robust face recognition on illumination context-awareness under uneven environments. Gabor wavelet representation can also provide a robust feature for image enhancement. Using these approaches, we have developed a robust face recognition technique that can recognize with a notable success and it has been tested on Inha DB and FERET face images.", "paper_title": "Adaptive context-aware filter fusion for face recognition on bad illumination", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000065"}
