The system offers advanced pro. ling of a user's field of specialization by exploiting the concept of sub-ontology extraction, i.e., each sub-ontology may subsequently represent a particular user pro. le. Semantic pro. ling of a user's field of specialization or interest is necessary functionality in any medical domain information retrieval system; this is because the (structural and semantic) extent of information sources is massive and individual users are only likely to be interested in specific parts of the overall knowledge documents on the basis of their area of specialization. The prototypical system, OntoMOVE, has been specifically designed for application in the medical information systems domain. OntoMOVE utilizes semantic web standards like RDF(S) and OWL in addition to medical domain standards and vocabularies encompassed by the UMLS knowledge sources.
