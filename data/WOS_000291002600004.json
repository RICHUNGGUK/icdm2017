First, Gabor features are extracted from face images, followed by dimensionality reduction using 2DPCA algorithm, which serves as the feature vectors of the proposed method. Finally, the bionic classifier is trained for classification. The experiment on AR and PIE face database is reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed method and compare it with Gabor-2DPCA algorithm and Gabor-PCA algorithm.", "paper_title": "BIONIC FACE RECOGNITION USING GABOR TRANSFORMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000291002600004"}
