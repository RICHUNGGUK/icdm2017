By using the stochastic analysis approach. employing some free-weighting matrices and introducing an appropriate type of Lyapunov functional which takes into account the ranges of delays, some new delay-range-dependent and rate-dependent stability criteria are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to guarantee the delayed genetic regulatory networks to be robustly asymptotically stable in the mean square. As a result, the new criteria are applicable to both fast and slow time-varying delays. Five numerical examples are also used to demonstrate the usefulness of the main results and less conservativeness of the proposed method. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
