The polynomial (F) over tilde (mu)(q; t) can be regarded as the Hilbert series of a certain doubly-graded S(n)-module M(mu), or as a q, t-analogue of n! based on permutation statistics inv(mu) and maj(mu) that generalize the classical inversion and major index statistics. This paper uses the combinatorial definition of (F) over tilde (mu) to prove some recursions characterizing these polynomials, and other related ones, when mu is a two-column shape. Our result provides a complement to recent work of Garsia and Haglund, who proved a different recursion for two-column shapes by representation-theoretical methods. For all mu, we show that e (F) over tilde (mu)(q, t) is divisible by certain q-factorials and t-factorials depending on mu. We use our recursion and related tools to explain some of these factors bijectively. Finally, we present fermionic formulas that express e (F) over tilde ((2n)) (q, t) as a sum of q, t-analogues of n!2(n) indexed by perfect matchings.", "paper_title": "Recursions and divisibility properties for combinatorial Macdonald polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000287819500003"}
