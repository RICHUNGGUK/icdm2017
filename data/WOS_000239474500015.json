It is shown that for each number of pebbles, the two models have the same expressive power both in the deterministic case and in the nondeterministic case. Furthermore, nondeterministic (resp. deterministic) tree-walking automata with n + 1 pebbles can recognize more languages than those with n pebbles. Moreover, there is a regular tree language that is not recognized by any tree-walking automaton with pebbles. As a consequence, FO+posTC is strictly included in MSO over trees.", "paper_title": "Expressive power of pebble automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474500015"}
