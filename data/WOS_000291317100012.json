Current methods for evaluating MIN reliability are derived from universal generating function methods (UGFMs). Unfortunately, the existing known UGFM has two significant flaws. 1) Each individual term is required to be transformed into a graph to verify its feasibility. 2) The method fails to determine the real reliability. Hence, a novel revised UGFM is developed to solve the general MIN reliability problem with the same time complexity as that of the existing known UGFM.", "paper_title": "A Novel Label Universal Generating Function Method for Evaluating the One-to-all-Subsets General Multistate Information Network Reliability", "paper_id": "WOS:000291317100012"}
