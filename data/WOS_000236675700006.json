In this paper, we extend the fundamental concept, iterated upwind compensation of error, to incorporate a new degree of freedom-that of gauge transformations-with the goal of constructing a monotonicity preserving option for MPDATA. We further augment this scheme by adapting the idea of summing the recursive relations to improve the overall accuracy. This process leads to a theoretical connection of this MPDATA scheme to flux-limited algorithms.
