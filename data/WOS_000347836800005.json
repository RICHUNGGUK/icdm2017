Moreover the concept of generalized differentiability, its properties and switching points related to derivative of fuzzy number-valued functions are discussed in detail. Finally, the fuzzy differential equation is considered based on the concept of length function and it is illustrated by solving some numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Solving fuzzy differential equations based on the length function properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000347836800005"}
