The difficulty in extending the two-receiver result to three-receivers involves extending the Csiszar-sum lemma to three or more sequences, a standard difficulty in this area. In this work we bypass the difficulty by using a new information inequality, for less noisy receivers, that is employed in the converse. We also generalize our result to obtain the capacity region for a class of less noisy receivers.", "paper_title": "The Capacity Region of the Three Receiver Less Noisy Broadcast Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000291922500004"}
