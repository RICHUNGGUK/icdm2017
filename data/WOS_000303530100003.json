We also investigate the related notion of schedulability and a notion that we call online feasibility. Finally, we show that discrete-time schedules are as powerful as continuous-time schedules, which answers another open question in the above mentioned survey.", "paper_title": "Feasibility Analysis of Sporadic Real-Time Multiprocessor Task Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000303530100003"}
