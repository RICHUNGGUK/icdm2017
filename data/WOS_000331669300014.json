The intuitive interpretation and mathematical proofs are presented to reveal the efficient working mechanism of LRM. Through analyzing the physical meaning of coefficients and regularization items, we find that LRM provides more useful information and advantages than the conventional similarity measure model which calculates the distance between two entities (i.e. conventional point-to-point, C-PtP). Inspired by the advantages of LRM, the linear reconstruction measure steered nearest neighbor classification framework (LRM-NNCF) is designed with eight classifiers according to different decision rules and models of LRM. Evaluation on several face databases and the experimental results demonstrate that these proposed classifiers can achieve greater performance than the C-PtP based 1-NNs and competitive recognition accuracy and robustness compared with the state-of-the-art classifiers.
