However, many of these news services often require users to either manually input their profiles or subscribe to existing news channels. This results in lack of intelligence and personalization, and thus make these services less attractive to users. In this paper, an integrated model that combines query expansion with ranking function adaptation for online information routing is proposed and tested using two different large scale corpora. The experimental results show that this new model can deliver much better quality information than existing models. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
