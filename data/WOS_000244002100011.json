The methodology generates continuous vector data through constrained remove operations of vertices on the server side, maintains consistent topology via a set of constraint rules, and restores original vector data through a reconstruction operator on the client side. The prototype system was implemented to investigate the performance of the methodology in terms of the preservation of consistent topology, transmission time, and qualities of the resulting visualizations. The method is shown to be scalable to large data sets, to produce graphically acceptable results and to maintain topology.", "paper_title": "Efficient transmission of vector data over the Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000244002100011"}
