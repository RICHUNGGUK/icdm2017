The presented approach is particularly suitable when sensors with limited sensing capability are considered. In this case, strategies based on sensor fusion may exhibit poor results, as several unreliable measurements may be included in the fusion process. On the other hand, our approach implements a distributed strategy able to select only the node with the most accurate estimate and to propagate it through the whole network in finite time. The algorithm is based on the definition of a metric of the estimate accuracy, and on the application of an agreement protocol based on max-consensus. We prove the convergence, in finite time, of all the local estimates to the most accurate one at each discrete iteration, as well as the equivalence with a centralised Kalman filter with multiple measurements, evolving according to a state-dependent switching dynamics. An application of the algorithm to the problem of distributed target tracking over a network of heterogeneous range-bearing sensors is shown. Simulation results and a comparison with two distributed Kalman filtering strategies based on sensor fusion confirm the suitability of the approach.", "paper_title": "Distributed Kalman filtering via node selection in heterogeneous sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000357933000008"}
