Auletta et al. (J Auton Agent Multi-Agent Syst, to appear) proposed a characterization of correspondences for which the Revelation Principle holds, i.e., they described restrictions on misreporting under which a social choice function is implementable if and only if it is truthfully implementable. In this paper, we demonstrate that the characterization proposed in [1] is incorrect, and, building on their work, give a correct characterization. We also provide an example that demonstrates that our characterization is different from that of Auletta et al.", "paper_title": "Mechanism design with partial verification and revelation principle", "paper_id": "WOS:000285998200011"}
