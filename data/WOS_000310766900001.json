Here we propose the hypothesis explaining the tropism of human parvovirus B19. Our speculations are based on experimental results related to the capsid proteins VP1 and VP2. These proteins were not detectable in nonpermissive cells in course of these experiments, although the corresponding mRNAs were synthesized. Our interpretation of these results is an inhibition of translation in nonpermissive cells by human miRNAs. We bring support to our hypothesis and propose detailed experimental procedure to test it.
