The appliances are connected to the network, directly receiving the sequence of instructions (parameter/value pairs) constituting the recipe to perform a task requested by the user. The recipes are issued by the computational intelligence algorithms in the core of the social network. Users, appliances and social network are part of an entire ecosystem that we realized in the frame of the EU project Social&Smart. In this paper we describe the architecture, the information infrastructure and the first achievements of the Social&Smart ecosystem within the general cadre of an Open Internet of Things (Open IoT).", "paper_title": "Social things: Now we can", "paper_id": "WOS:000358145300004"}
