Against this changing network landscape, the authors design an SDN-based, scalable multimedia multicast streaming framework, which optimizes multimedia flow management and provides scalability and flexibility. The proposed framework is capable of in-network identification, processing, and management of media streams. It implements network-layer multicast similar to IP multicast, but it allows admission control in a multicast context. An implemented prototype shows the proposed framework's possibilities and results.", "paper_title": "SDM(2)Cast An OpenFlow-Based, Software-Defined Scalable Multimedia Multicast Streaming Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000361067500006"}
