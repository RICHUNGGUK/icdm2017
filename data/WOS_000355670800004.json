We describe a simple process through which the Euclidean space is partitioned into simplices on which the integrand is smooth, generalising the standard practice of dividing the interval used in one-dimensional problems. Our procedure is combined with existing adaptive cubature algorithms to significantly reduce the necessary number of function evaluations and memory requirements of the integrator. The method is embarrassingly parallel and can be trivially scaled across many cores with virtually no overhead. Our method is particularly pertinent to the integration of Green's functions, a problem directly related to the perturbation theory of impurity models. In three spatial dimensions, we observe a speed-up of order 100 which increases with increasing dimensionality.", "paper_title": "Numerical Integration of Discontinuous Functions in Many Dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000355670800004"}
