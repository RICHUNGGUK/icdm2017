Given the declining enrollments in IS that led ACM/AIS to redesign its curriculum in an attempt to help universities reverse this trend, we need to assess the value placed on this curriculum by stakeholders. Although all majors in a business school are typically required to take the foundations of IS course, its real or perceived value to businesses and future employers is unclear. A first step in evaluating the entire curriculum is to focus on the foundations of IS course. Results differ among the stakeholders, and discussions highlight the need to continually improve the curriculum to fit the needs and the assigned importance of the diverse stakeholders.", "paper_title": "Foundations of Information Systems Course Content: A Comparison of Assigned Value by Faculty, Recruiters, and Students", "paper_id": "WOS:000381274600034"}
