The dynamic response is analyzed using the Muki and Stemberg Method. The load transfer problem is formulated in terms of a second-kind Fredholm integral. The dynamic impedance of the pile groups is computed using the pile-soil-pile dynamic interaction factors. The shear force, bending moment and pore pressure is obtained using the superposition method. Numerical results indicate that the pile flexibility ratio and the pile distance have considerable influence on the dynamic response of the piles and the poroelastic medium.
