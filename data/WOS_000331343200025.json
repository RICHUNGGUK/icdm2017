This property promotes the use of DVC in systems where processing power or energy use at the encoder is constrained. Examples include wireless devices and surveillance. This paper proposes a multi-hypothesis transform domain single-view DVC system that performs symbol level coding with a non-binary low-density parity-check code. The main contributions of the system relate to the methods used for combining multiple side information hypotheses at the decoder. The system also combines interpolation and extrapolation in the side information creation process to improve the performance of the system over larger group-of-picture sizes.", "paper_title": "A Symbol Based Distributed Video Coding System Using Multiple Hypotheses", "paper_id": "WOS:000331343200025"}
