We firstly use an efficient support vector machine (SVM) to parametrize the model of HCS. Then we develop a new SVM-based learning structure to better implement human control strategy learning in tracking and capturing control. The approach is fundamentally valuable in dealing with some problems such as small sample data and local minima, and so on. Therefore this approach is efficient in modeling, understanding and transferring its learning process. The simulation results attest that this approach is useful and feasible in generating tracking trajectory and catching objects autonomously.", "paper_title": "SVM-based learning control of space robots in capturing operation", "paper_id": "WOS:000252021100005"}
