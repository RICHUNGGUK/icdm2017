Suggestions are made for how simulation analysis, considered in the explicit context of discrete-event simulation models, can create new opportunities for meaningful research and more efficient modeling. Modeling decisions can play a significant role in the performance of analytical procedures. How a simulation model is designed can enable, inhibit, or even invalidate analytical procedures and methodology research results.", "paper_title": "Simulation Modeling for Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000274379300002"}
