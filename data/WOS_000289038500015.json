It is necessary for the mobile user to perform a handover between the base stations to acquire the services found within the wireless network. To accommodate the security requirements and convenience, it is necessary to take mutual authentication and fast handover into account when examining the process of inter-domain handover. This paper proposes a secure inter-domain handover authentication protocol with short authentication latency, which provides fast handover for retaining the wireless network connectivity under the security requirement of identity authentication. This maintains user anonymity, replay attack resistance in login and inter-domain handover, and the forward/backward secrecy of key generation, which other studies do not provide. The long authentication latency may cause network disconnection, and the mobile user must re-login to the network to receive service. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the short authentication latency as an essential factor. This paper focuses on the authentication latency shortened by a fast handover. This proposed protocol reduces the handover authentication latency more than other schemes. This study's proposed protocol is more secure and efficient than found in previous research.", "paper_title": "A Short Latency Inter-domain Handover Authentication Protocol for Wireless Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000289038500015"}
