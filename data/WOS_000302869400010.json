The ability of a geographically distributed community of scientists to access and analyze large amounts of data has emerged as a significant requirement for furthering science. In data intensive computing environment with uncountable numeric nodes, resource is inevitably unreliable, which has a great effect on task execution and scheduling. Novel algorithms are needed to schedule the jobs on the trusty nodes to execute, assure the high speed of communication, reduce the jobs execution time, lower the ratio of failure execution, and improve the security of execution environment of important data. In this paper, a kind of trust mechanism-based task scheduling model was presented. Referring to the trust relationship models of social persons, trust relationship is built among computing nodes, and the trustworthiness of nodes is evaluated by utilizing the Bayesian cognitive method. Integrating the trustworthiness of nodes into a Dynamic Level Scheduling (DLS) algorithm, the Trust-Dynamic Level Scheduling (Trust-DLS) algorithm is proposed. Moreover, a benchmark is structured to span a range of data intensive computing characteristics for evaluation the proposed method. Theoretical analysis and simulations prove that the Trust-DLS algorithm can efficiently meet the requirement of data intensive workloads in trust, sacrificing fewer time costs, and assuring the execution of tasks in a security way in large-scale data intensive computing environment.", "paper_title": "Bayesian Cognitive Model in Scheduling Algorithm for Data Intensive Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000302869400010"}
