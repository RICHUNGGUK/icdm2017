MRI was carried out at four time points. We compare two different methods to detect group differences in the longitudinal and cross-sectional data. Both methods are based on non-rigid registration of the images to a mouse brain atlas. The whole brain volume measurements on 27 TASTPM and wild-type animals are reproducible to within 0.4% of whole brain volume. The agreement between different methods for measuring volumes in a serial study is shown. The ability to quantify changes in growth between strains in whole brain, hippocampus and cerebral cortex is demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Deformation based morphometry analysis of serial magnetic resonance images of mouse brains", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485200008"}
