The method achieves high order of accuracy in space together with essentially non-oscillatory behavior using a non-linear WENO reconstruction operator on unstructured triangular meshes. High order accuracy in time is obtained via a local Lagrangian space-time Galerkin predictor method that evolves the spatial reconstruction polynomials in time within each element. The final one-step finite volume scheme is derived by integration over a moving space-time control volume, where the non-conservative products are treated by a path-conservative approach that defines the jump terms on the element boundaries. The entire method is formulated as an Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method, where the mesh velocity can be chosen independently of the fluid velocity. The new scheme is applied to the full seven-equation Baer-Nunziato model of compressible multiphase flows with relaxation source terms in two space dimensions. The use of a Lagrangian approach allows an excellent resolution of the solid contact and the resolution of jumps in the volume fraction. The high order of accuracy of the scheme in space and time is confirmed via a numerical convergence study. Finally, the proposed method is also applied to a reduced version of the compressible Baer-Nunziato model for the simulation of free surface water waves in moving domains. In particular, the phenomenon of sloshing is studied in a moving water tank and comparisons with experimental data are provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
