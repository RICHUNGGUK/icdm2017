If a partial differential operator is of splitting rank 2, such as the operator associated with Poisson or Helmholtz, the corresponding PDE is solved via a generalized Sylvester matrix equation, and a bivariate polynomial approximation of the solution of degree (n(x), n(y)) is computed in O((n(x)n(y))(3/2)) operations. Partial differential operators of splitting rank >= 3 are solved via a linear system involving a block-banded matrix in O(min(n(x)(3)n(y), n(x)n(y)(3))) operations. Numerical examples demonstrate the applicability of our 2D spectral method to a broad class of PDEs, which includes elliptic and dispersive time-evolution equations. The resulting PDE solver is written in MATLAB and is publicly available as part of CHEBFUN. It can resolve solutions requiring over a million degrees of freedom in under 60 seconds. An experimental implementation in the JULIA language can currently perform the same solve in 10 seconds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
