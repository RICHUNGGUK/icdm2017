(2) A new mechanism supporting a user to buy digital information over the Internet without revealing what he/she has bought, while protecting the providers from cheating users.", "paper_title": "New Identity-Based Blind Signature and Blind Decryption Scheme in the Standard Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000269648400010"}
