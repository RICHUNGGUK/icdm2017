One category of robust economic designs considers the uncertainty in the estimates of the cost and process parameters and makes the design suitable to operate well in any scenario arising out of the uncertainty. Other category of robust economic design considers different possible discrete scenarios for a single process and makes the control chart robust to all possible scenarios. The approach suggested for the robust designs for each category is different and somewhat complicated. The present paper proposes a design approach by introducing a simple statistic for the robust economic design problem of a 'process with multiple scenarios'. SGA has been used in the optimization. The suggested statistic handles the information regarding the relative frequency of occurrence of each scenario of the process for the robust designs. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
