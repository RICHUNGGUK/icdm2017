The film budget, schedule or location may not allow it. In these cases. the scenes are shot at daytime. and the,night look' is achieved by placing a blue filter in front of the lens and under-exposing the film. This technique. that the American film industry has used for many decades. is called 'Day for Night' (or 'American Night' in Europe.) But the images thus obtained don't usually took realistic: they tend to be too bluish, and the objects' brightness seems unnatural for night-light. In this article we introduce a digital Day for Night algorithm that achieves very realistic results. We use a set of very simple equations, based oil real physical data and visual perception experimental data. To simulate the loss of visual acuity we introduce a novel diffusion Partial Differential Equation (PDE) which takes luminance into account and respects contrast, produces no ringing. is stable. very easy to implement and fast. The user only provides the original day image and the desired level of darkness of the result. The whole process from original day image to final night image is implemented in a few seconds, computations being mostly local.", "paper_title": "Visual acuity in day for night", "paper_id": "WOS:000239034100008"}
