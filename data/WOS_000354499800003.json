Methods for MLIR are categorized as: (1) Fusion-based methods that merge results from multiple retrieval runs, and (2) Direct methods that build a unique index for the entire collection. Merging results of individual runs reduces the overall effectiveness, while more effective direct methods suffer from either time complexity and memory overhead, or over-weighting of index terms. In this paper, we propose a direct MLIR approach by using the language modeling framework that includes a novel multilingual language model estimation for documents, and a new way to globally estimate word statistics. These contributions enable ranking documents in multiple languages in one retrieval phase without having the problems of the previous direct methods. Moreover, our approach has the advantage of accommodating multilingual feedback information which helps to prevent query drift, and consequently to improve the performance. Finally, we effectively address the common case of incomplete coverage of translation resources in our proposed estimation methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the previous MLIR approaches.", "paper_title": "Multilingual information retrieval in the language modeling framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000354499800003"}
