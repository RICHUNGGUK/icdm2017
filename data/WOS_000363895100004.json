Most commonly these are histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), histogram of optical flow (HOF) and motion boundary histograms (MBH) descriptors. While such approach is very powerful for classification, it is also computationally expensive. This paper addresses the problem of computational efficiency. Specifically: (1) We propose several speedups for densely sampled HOG, HOF and MBH descriptors and release Matlab code; (2) We investigate the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency of descriptors in terms of frame sampling rate and type of Optical Flow method; (3) We investigate the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency for computing the feature vocabulary, using and comparing most of the commonly adopted vector quantization techniques: k-means, hierarchical k-means, Random Forests, Fisher Vectors and VLAD.", "paper_title": "Video classification with Densely extracted HOG/HOF/MBH features: an evaluation of the accuracy/computational efficiency trade-off", "paper_id": "WOS:000363895100004"}
