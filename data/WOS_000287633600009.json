Recent router designs are based on general-purpose programmable processors, which increase their potential vulnerability. To address this issue, a Secure Packet Processing platform has been developed that can flexibly protect emerging router systems. Both instruction-level operation of embedded processors and I/O operations of router ports are monitored to detect anomalous behavior. If such behavior is detected, a recovery system is invoked to restore the system into an operational state. Experimental results show that processor-based attacks can generally be determined by a processing monitor within a single instruction. I/O anomalies, including unexpected packet broadcast or delay, can be detected by an I/O monitor with limited overhead. Overall, the system overhead for secure monitoring is limited to a fraction of the overall system space, memory, and power budget. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
