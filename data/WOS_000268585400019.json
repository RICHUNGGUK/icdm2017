The architecture of amorphous computers is random, since they consist of a plethora of identical computational units spread randomly over a given area. Within a limited radius the units can communicate wirelessly with their neighbors via a single-channel radio. We consider a model whose assumptions on the underlying computing and communication abilities are among the weakest possible: all computational units are finite state probabilistic automata working asynchronously, there is no broadcasting collision detection mechanism and no network addresses. We show that under reasonable probabilistic assumptions such amorphous computing systems can possess universal computing power with a high probability. The underlying theory makes use of properties of random graphs and that of probabilistic analysis of algorithms. To the best of our knowledge this is the first result showing the universality of such computing systems.", "paper_title": "On the Universal Computing Power of Amorphous Computing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000268585400019"}
