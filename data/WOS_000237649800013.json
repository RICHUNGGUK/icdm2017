Defining an AQoS model, i.e. possible adaptation operators, predictable constraints and qualities that will be included in an instance of AQoS which accompanies a media file, and consequently initialising its values is a complex process. In this paper, we present our conceptual model design for implementing the AQoS.", "paper_title": "Implementing the MPEG-21 adaptation quality of service in dynamic environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800013"}
