The results from a set of experiments show that product reviews ordered by their types (i.e., presenting an attribute/experience-based review before another type) are perceived to be more helpful and easier to comprehend. We further observed that displays of attribute-based product reviews followed by experience-based product reviews are perceived to be more helpful for a search product. Likewise, displays of experience-based product reviews followed by attributebased product reviews are more helpful for an experience product. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
