The IETF outlined the label merging feature in MPLS-allowing the configuration of MultiPoint-to-Point connections (MP2P)-as a means of reducing label space in LSRs. We found two main drawbacks in this label space reduction scheme: a) it should be separately applied to a set of LSPs with the same egress LSR-which decreases the options for better reductions, and b) LSRs close to the edge of the network experience a greater label space reduction than those close to the core. The later implies that MP2P connections reduce the number of labels asymmetrically. In this article we propose a solution to these drawbacks achieved by stacking an additional label onto the packet header. We call this type of reduction Asymmetric Merged Tunnels (AMT). A fast framework for computing the optimal reduction using AMTs is proposed. Our simulations show that the label space can be reduced by up to 20% more than when label merging is used.", "paper_title": "Label Space Reduction in MPLS Networks: How Much Can A Single Stacked Label Do?", "paper_id": "WOS:000262062200006"}
