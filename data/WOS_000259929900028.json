In order to face the problem of modeling time constraints in Promela. a timed extension of the language is presented. Next, timed Promela is translated to timed automata with discrete data, that is timed automata extended with integer variables. The translation enables verification of Promela specifications via tools accepting timed automata as input, such as VerICS or Uppaal. The translation is illustrated with a well known example of Fischer's mutual exclusion protocol. Some experimental results are also presented.", "paper_title": "Translation of Timed Promela to Timed Automata with Discrete Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000259929900028"}
