Also an algorithmic approach is introduced to find the shortest path in a three-dimensional. Using both implementations, a comparison is made between the expert system approach and the algorithmic approach. It is concluded that the expert system shows great potential. The expert system indeed finds the best routes, and it outperforms the algorithm approach in computation time, too.", "paper_title": "A knowledge-based approach to dynamic route planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000254356900008"}
