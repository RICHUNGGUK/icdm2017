What is the answer when human-driven e-business process negotiation (eBPN), specifically, becomes a necessity? Workflow research already specifies certain tools that allow collaborative design of workflow models by multiple parties. But this paper goes beyond this to describe how peculiar decision-support demands also arise for the negotiation of the other, more \"general\", terms of such an eBPN contract. It also shows how existing e-negotiation tools lack holistic support for the interplay between \"workflow-specific\" and \"general\" strategy. Given this critical gap, this paper presents the \"general\" strategy-support (GSS) segment of our wider project: \"Soft E-business Process Negotiation Approach\" (SEPNA). Novel use of multi-criteria decision-making methods in the workflow composition domain and holistic support of the general strategy-support requirements combine as two of its key distinctions vis-a-vis alternative approaches. It specifies re-usable design prescriptions to address this gap, formalized primarily as an object model. Technical feasibility and contribution significance are shown by executing a set of previously unsupported eBPN scenarios on a prototype implementation of these prescriptions.", "paper_title": "GENERAL STRATEGY SUPPORT IN SOFT E-BUSINESS PROCESS NEGOTIATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000285686600001"}
