In this paper, both body-passive physical systems and brain-active control systems can be represented using the bond graph paradigm. Bond graphs are combined with genetic programming to evolve low-level building blocks into systems with high-level functionalities including both topological configurations and parameter settings. Design spaces of coadapted mechatronic subsystems are automatically explored in parallel for overall design optimality. A quarter-car suspension system case study is provided. Compared with conventional design methods, semiactive suspension designs with more creativity and flexibility are achieved through this approach.", "paper_title": "Cooperative body-brain coevolutionary synthesis of mechatronic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257098700005"}
