In this paper, we show that for every connected graph with diameter 2 and minimum degree at least 2, its proper connection number is at most 3 and the bound is sharp. Then, we give an upper bound 3n/delta+1 - 1 of the proper connection number for every connected graph of order n >= 4 and minimum degree delta. We also show that for every connected graph G, the proper connection number pc(G) is upper bounded by pc(G[D]) + 2, where D is a connected two-way (two-step) dominating set of G. Bounds of the form pc(G) <= 4 or pc(G) = 2, for many special graph classes follow as easy corollaries from this result, which include connected interval graphs, asteroidal triple-free graphs, circular arc graphs, threshold graphs and chain graphs, all with minimum degree at least 2. Furthermore, we get the sharp upper bound 3 for the proper connection numbers of interval graphs and circular arc graphs through analyzing their structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
