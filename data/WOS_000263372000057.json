The CAGA combines the chain-like agent structure with dynamic neighboring genetic operators to get higher optimization capability. An agent in chain-like agent structure represents a candidate solution to the optimization problem. Any agent interacts with neighboring agents to evolve. With dynamic neighboring genetic operators, they compete and cooperate with their neighbors, and can use knowledge to increase energies. Global numerical optimization problem and feature selection problem are the most important problems for evolutionary algorithm, especially for genetic algorithm. Hence, the experiments of global numerical optimization and feature selection are necessary to verify the performance of genetic algorithms. Corresponding experiments have been done and show that CAGA is suitable for real coding and binary coding optimization problems, and has more precise and more stable optimization results.
