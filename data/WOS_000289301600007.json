Once the data are clustered, finding the optimal number of informative subgroups within a dataset is a problem that, while important for understanding the underlying phenotypes, is one for which there is no robust, widely accepted solution. Results: To address this problem we developed an 'informativeness metric' based on a simple analysis of variance statistic that identifies the number of clusters which best separate phenotypic groups. The performance of the informativeness metric has been tested on both experimental and simulated datasets, and we contrast these results with those obtained using alternative methods such as the gap statistic.", "paper_title": "Defining an informativeness metric for clustering gene expression data", "paper_id": "WOS:000289301600007"}
