At onset, all groups had increased cortical excitability. At the end of follow-up the refractory group was associated with a broad increase in cortical excitability. Conversely, cortical excitability decreased in all seizure free groups after introduction of an effective medication.", "paper_title": "CORTICAL EXCITABILITY AND REFRACTORY EPILEPSY: A THREE-YEAR LONGITUDINAL TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION STUDY", "paper_id": "WOS:000316807400003"}
