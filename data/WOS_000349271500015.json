The DEMATEL method was used to obtain the weight coefficients of criteria, on the basis of which the alternatives were evaluated. The selection of criteria for evaluating Forklifts was based on an analysis of available literature. The evaluation and selection of Forklifts was carried out using a new multi-criteria method - the MABAC (Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison) method. This paper presents a practical application and a sensitivity analysis of the MABAC method. The sensitivity analysis was conducted in three stages. In the first stage, a stability analysis was carried out on the solution reached by the MABAC method, depending on changes made to the weights of the criteria. In the second and third stages, a consistency analysis of the results from the MABAC method was carried out depending on both the changes in the measurement units in which the values of individual criteria are presented and on the formulation of the criteria. The SAW, COPRAS, TOPSIS, MOORA and VIKOR methods were tested under the same conditions. Based on the results obtained, it was shown that the SAW, COPRAS, TOPSIS, MOORA and VIKOR methods do not meet one or more of the conditions set, while the MABAC method showed stability (consistency) in its solutions. Through the research presented in this paper, it is shown that the new MABAC method of multi-criteria decision-making is a useful and reliable tool for rational decision-making.
