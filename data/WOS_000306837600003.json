In an NMR experimental implementation, we generate multipartite entangled states starting from initial separable pseudo-pure states by simulating nearest-neighbor XY interactions in a 3-spin linear chain of nuclear spin qubits. For simulating XY interactions, we follow algebraic method of Zhang et al. [Phys. Rev. A 72 (2005) 012331]. Bell state between end qubits has been generated by using only the unitary evolution of the XY Hamiltonian. For generating W-state and GHZ-state a single qubit rotation is applied on second and all the three qubits, respectively after the unitary evolution of the XY Hamiltonian.", "paper_title": "ENTANGLEMENT IN A 3-SPIN HEISENBERG-XY CHAIN WITH NEAREST-NEIGHBOR INTERACTIONS, SIMULATED IN AN NMR QUANTUM SIMULATOR", "paper_id": "WOS:000306837600003"}
