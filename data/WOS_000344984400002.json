In this article, a negative multinomial reputation model for self-organized networks is proposed. Compared with binary parameter based binomial reputation model, our model is featured with multiple parameters which can depict objective facts more precisely and accurately. Moreover, free from fixed increment on parameters in binomial model, the increment in our model can be 2 or more, which makes our model flexible and suitable for more practical applications such as networks with sleep mechanisms. Through three metrics of measurement, i.e. convergence time to detecting malicious entities, success rate of malicious entities, and success rate of benign entities, our model shows a better performance in the simulations and excels in these three aspects.", "paper_title": "Negative Multinomial Reputation for Self-Organized Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000344984400002"}
