This structure is a prerequisite for camera calibration and pose computation. Until now, no general method has been described for N > 2. The main contribution of this work is to state the problem in terms of a system of linear equations to solve. We give a closed-form solution as well as bundle adjustment-like refinements, increasing the technical applicability and numerical stability. Our theoretical approach generalizes and extends all those described in existing works for N = 2 in several respects, as we can treat simultaneously pairs of orthogonal lines and pairs of circles within a unified framework. The proposed algorithm may be easily implemented, using well-known numerical algorithms. Its performance is illustrated by simulations and experiments with real images.", "paper_title": "Euclidean structure from N >= 2 parallel circles: Theory and algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000237552900019"}
