We apply the method to two well known problems, companion caching and weighted caching. For weighted caching, we increase the interval of weights where FIFO is known to be optimal. For companion caching, we give much simpler proofs for several known results, and give a new bound for the case of three types without reorganization or bypassing.", "paper_title": "Calculating lower bounds for caching problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000248376200005"}
