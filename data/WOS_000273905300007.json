In particular, the security models also capture the notion of insider security. The generic construction relies on the existence of a special class of efficient public key encryption schemes which allow the encryption randomness to be recovered during decryption. We also propose two efficient instantiations for the generic construction and show that one of them has less message expansion and yields smaller ciphertext when compared with all the existing signcryption schemes.
