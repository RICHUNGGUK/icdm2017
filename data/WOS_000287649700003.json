Based only on the continuous output information, an observer is proposed ensuring the reconstruction of the entire state (continuous and discrete) in finite time. For the observer design an exact sliding mode differentiator is used, which allows the finite time convergence of the observer trajectories to the actual trajectories. The design scheme includes both cases: zero control input and nonzero control input. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed observer.", "paper_title": "State exact reconstruction for switched linear systems via a super-twisting algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000287649700003"}
