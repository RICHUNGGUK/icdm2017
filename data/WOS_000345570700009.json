An important contribution in this context is given by modal logics for strategic ability, in the setting of multiagent games, such as ATL, ATL*, and the like. Recently, Chatterjee, Henzinger, and Piterman introduced Strategy Logic, which we denote here by CHP-SL, with the aim of getting a powerful framework for reasoning explicitly about strategies. CHP-SL is obtained by using first-order quantifications over strategies and has been investigated in the very specific setting of two-agents turned-based games, where a nonelementary model-checking algorithm has been provided. While CHP-SL is a very expressive logic, we claim that it does not fully capture the strategic aspects of multiagent systems. In this article, we introduce and study a more general strategy logic, denoted SL, for reasoning about strategies in multiagent concurrent games. As a key aspect, strategies in SL are not intrinsically glued to a specific agent, but an explicit binding operator allows an agent to bind to a strategy variable. This allows agents to share strategies or reuse one previously adopted. We prove that SL strictly includes CHP-SL, while maintaining a decidable model-checking problem. In particular, the algorithm we propose is computationally not harder than the best one known for CHP-SL. Moreover, we prove that such a problem for SL is NONELEMENTARY. This negative result has spurred us to investigate syntactic fragments of SL, strictly subsuming ATL*, with the hope of obtaining an elementary model-checking problem. Among others, we introduce and study the sublogics SL[NG], SL[BG], and SL[1G]. They encompass formulas in a special prenex normal form having, respectively, nested temporal goals, Boolean combinations of goals, and, a single goal at a time. Intuitively, for a goal, we mean a sequence of bindings, one for each agent, followed by an LTL formula. We prove that the model-checking problem for SL[1G] is 2EXPTIME-COMPLETE, thus not harder than the one for ATL*. In contrast, SL[NG] turns out to be NONELEMENTARY-HARD, strengthening the corresponding result for SL. Regarding SL[BG], we show that it includes CHP-SL and its model-checking is decidable with a 2EXP TIMElower-bound. It is worth enlightening that to achieve the positive results about SL[1G], we introduce a fundamental property of the semantics of this logic, called behavioral, which allows to strongly simplify the reasoning about strategies. Indeed, in a nonbehavioral logic such as SL[BG] and the subsuming ones, to satisfy a formula, one has to take into account that a move of an agent, at a given moment of a play, may depend on the moves taken by any agent in another counterfactual play.", "paper_title": "Reasoning About Strategies: On the Model-Checking Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000345570700009"}
