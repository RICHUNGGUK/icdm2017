The potential of this technology has meant that information sharing has been routinely promoted through databases that have encouraged stakeholder participation in communities around these services. In this paper we discuss the Anatomical Model Database (AMDB) (Gianni et al. Functional imaging and modeling of the heart. Springer, Heidelberg, 2009; Gianni et al. Phil Trans Ser A Math Phys Eng Sci 368:3039-3056, 2010) which both facilitate a database-centric approach to collaboration, and also extends this framework with new capabilities for creating new mesh data. AMDB currently stores cardiac geometric models described in Gianni et al. (Functional imaging and modelling of the heart. Springer, Heidelberg, 2009), a number of additional cardiac models describing geometry and functional properties, and most recently models generated using a web service. The functional models represent data from simulations in geometric form, such as electrophysiology or mechanics, many of which are present in AMDB as part of a benchmark study. Finally, the heartgen service has been added for producing left or bi-ventricle models derived from binary image data using the methods described in Lamata et al. (Med Image Anal 15:801-813, 2011). The results can optionally be hosted on AMDB alongside other community-provided anatomical models. AMDB is, therefore, a unique database storing geometric data (rather than abstract models or image data) combined with a powerful web service for generating new geometric models.", "paper_title": "Share and enjoy: anatomical models database-generating and sharing cardiovascular model data using web services", "paper_id": "WOS:000326053000002"}
