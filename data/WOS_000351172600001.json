The latter incorporates information about the exact solution that cannot be represented on the mesh. To define this flux, we solve the governing equations along suitable mesh segments under the assumption that the flux varies linearly along these segments. This procedure yields second-order accurate fluxes on the edges of the mesh. Then, we use curl-conforming elements of the same order to lift these edge fluxes into the mesh elements. In so doing, we obtain a stabilized control volume FEM formulation that is second-order accurate and does not require mesh-dependent stabilization parameters. Numerical convergence studies on uniform and nonuniform grids along with several standard advection tests illustrate the computational properties of the new method. Published 2015.
