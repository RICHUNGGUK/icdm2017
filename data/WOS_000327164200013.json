In the SEM, appropriately defined entities, denominated \"spy elements\", inspect their neighbourhood and without atomic memory operations update in parallel all the dynamic data dependencies, including those between themselves, between the original objects of the current problem and among entities of different kind. The application of the SEM to meshless simulation models obviates the use of binning algorithms relying on sorting or atomics, and concomitantly renders their implementation fully particle centric. On the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 480, an optimised particle-based fluid simulator runs 1.4-2.3 times faster when the binning aided by the state-of-the-art parallel sorter is eliminated and data updating is delegated to the SEM, and is at least 40 times faster than a highly optimised single-threaded version running on a single core of the Intel Xeon X5650 2.66 GHz.
