However, when models are compared by fitting data that have been mathematically transformed in different ways, R-2 is a flawed statistic, even when the data are properly weighted in accord with the transformations. The reason is that in its most commonly used form. R-2 can be expressed in terms of the excess variance (s(2)) and the total variance in y (s(y)(2)) - the first of which is either invariant or approximately so with proper weighting, but the second of which can vary substantially in data transformations. When given data are analyzed \"as is\" with different models and fixed weights, s(y)(2) remains constant and R-2 is a valid statistic. However, then s(2), and chi(2) in weighted fitting, are arguably better metrics for such comparisons. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
