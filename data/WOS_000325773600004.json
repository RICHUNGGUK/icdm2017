However, there is little design for achieving the dual performances simultaneously. In this paper, we develop a practical passive cluster-based node-disjoint many to one multipath routing protocol to satisfy the requirements of energy efficiency and QoS in practical WSNs. Passive clustering approach is put to use in the first round, while active clustering technique is taken in the other rounds. Implementation of smart delay strategy makes the cluster distribute uniformly, as well as lessen the number of nodes that have taken part in routing. Among cluster heads, a node-disjoint many to one multipath routing discovery algorithm, which is composed of the optimal path searching process and multipath expansion process, is implemented to find multiple paths at the minimum cost. The simulation results show the proposed protocol achieved very good performance both in energy efficiency and QoS.", "paper_title": "Passive cluster-based multipath routing protocol for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000325773600004"}
