Our methodology is based on principal component analysis, which enables us to transform and reduce the BGP updates into different AS clusters that are likely affected by distinct major events. We demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our methodology through simulations and real BGP data.", "paper_title": "Principal Component Analysis of BGP Update Streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000277207600012"}
