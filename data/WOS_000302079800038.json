We restrict our attention to the rank-1 quantum chromatic number chi((1))(q)(G), which upper bounds the quantum chromatic number, but is defined under stronger constraints. We study its relation with the chromatic number chi(G) and the minimum dimension of orthogonal representations xi(G). It is known that xi(G) <= chi((1))(q)(G) <= chi(C). We answer three open questions about these relations: we give a necessary and sufficient condition to have xi(G) = chi((1))(q)(G), we exhibit a class of graphs such that xi(G) < chi((1))(q)(G), and we give a necessary and sufficient condition to have chi((1))(q) (G) < chi(G). Our main tools are Kochen-Specker sets, collections of vectors with a traditionally important role in the study of contextuality of physical theories and, more recently, in the quantification of quantum zero-error capacities. Finally, as a corollary of our results and a result by Avis et al. on the quantum chromatic number, we give a family of Kochen-Specker sets of growing dimension.", "paper_title": "Kochen-Specker Sets and the Rank-1 Quantum Chromatic Number", "paper_id": "WOS:000302079800038"}
