Over the past 15 years a body of literature has emerged that brings together a variety of approaches to capture, map or measure the dynamics of TH relationships. We apply bibliographic coupling and co-citation in combination with content analysis to develop a better understanding of this literature. We identify several clusters that can be aggregated to two broad streams of work-one 'neo-evolutionary', the other 'neo-institutional' in nature. We make this observation both for bibliographic coupling and co-citation analyses which we take as indication of an emerging differentiation of the field. Our content analysis underlines this observation about the 'two faces' of the TH. We conclude this paper with a discussion of future opportunities for research. We see great potential in developing the application side of TH indicators.", "paper_title": "Triple Helix indicators as an emergent area of enquiry: a bibliometric perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000332697600010"}
