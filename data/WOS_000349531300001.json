We study the parameterized complexity of these problems and initiate a systematic study of the complexity of its fragments. Only the monotone fragment has been considered so far and proven to be of same complexity as the unrestricted problems. Here, we consider all fragments obtained by semantically restricting circuits or formule to contain only gates (connectives) from a fixed set B of Boolean functions. We obtain a dichotomy result by showing that for each such B, the weighted satisfiability problems are either W [P] -complete (for circuits) or W [SAT] -complete (for formule) or efficiently solvable. We also consider the related enumeration and counting problems.", "paper_title": "Parameterized Complexity of Weighted Satisfiability Problems: Decision, Enumeration, Counting", "paper_id": "WOS:000349531300001"}
