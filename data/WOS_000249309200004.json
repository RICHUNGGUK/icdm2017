This problem is exacerbated by the lack of high-level design-automation tools that consider the increasingly important impact of physical features, such as interconnect, on integrated circuit area, performance, and power consumption. Using physical information to guide decisions in the behavioral-level stage of system design is essential to solve this problem. In this paper, we present an incremental floorplanning high-level-synthesis system. This system integrates high-level and physical-design algorithms to concurrently improve a design's schedule, resource binding, and floorplan, thereby allowing the incremental exploration of the combined behavioral-level and physical-level design space. Compared with previous approaches that repeatedly call loosely coupled floorplanners for physical, estimation, this approach has the benefits of efficiency, stability, and better quality of results. The average CPU time speedup resulting from unifying incremental physical-level and high-level synthesis is 24.72 x and area improvement is 13.76%. The low power consumption of a state-of-the-art low-power interconnect-aware high-level-synthesis algorithm is maintained. The benefits of concurrent behavioral-level and physical-design optimization increased for larger problem instances.", "paper_title": "Unified incremental physical-level and high-level synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000249309200004"}
