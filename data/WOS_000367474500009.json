D2D communication was introduced into the cellular network in order to improve the efficiency of resource utilization and increase the system throughput. However, there exist interferences between D2D links and cellular links due to the resource reuse. In order to efficiently limit the cases of interference, a joint resource allocation scheme for D2D communication under a cellular network is proposed. The scheme, based on the user's Quality of Service (QoS), defines a new utility function to balance the increasing system throughput and the interference in the cellular users D2D communication. The optimal D2D transmitting power is obtained through optimizing the utility function by using the convex optimization theory. The simulation shows that the scheme can fulfill the user's QoS requirements efficiently, improve the system throughput and the reliability of the resources as well.", "paper_title": "Joint Resource Allocation Scheme for Device-To-Device Communication under a Cellular Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000367474500009"}
