Despite gaming's significant implications for the Internet, no general framework exists for validating various and sometimes contradicting game traffic models. Practitioners must therefore find and study dozens of reports and papers, some with conflicting measurements, to understand traffic characteristics and use this information in their systems. This survey looks at the most representative first-person shooter (FPS) game traffic to provide a one-stop shop for practitioners.", "paper_title": "A Survey of First-Person Shooter Gaming Traffic on the Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000281547800010"}
