Additionally, an algorithm to compute the pressure profile along the radial direction in spherical coordinates has also been implemented. The latter is particularly useful for systems showing a spherical symmetry such as micelles and vesicles. These methods yield precise pressure fields based on the Irving-Kirkwood contour integration and are particularly useful for biomolecular force fields. The present methods are applied to several systems including a buckled membrane and a vesicle.

Ireland Licensing provisions: Standard CPC licence, http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/licence/licence.html No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 7799 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 149739 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C++. Computer: All. Operating system: All. Supplementary material: The input and expected output for the examples given in the manuscript can be downloaded here. Classification: 7.7. Nature of problem: A precise calculation of the pressure (stress) field requires the implementation of the contour integration [2] for each pair in the cluster potentials. Solution method: We have implemented the method for calculating the local-volume average of the pressure field expressed by a contour integration with a delta function for the given molecular configuration obtained by molecular dynamics simulation [3]. Restrictions: Because the definition of pressure field is based on the contour integration, the long-range interactions represented as Ewald summation are not included. In addition, the potential represented as a combination of pair and angle potential, such as Tersoff and Stillinger-Weber potential, and the interaction as a geometric constraint (shake, rigid body, etc.) are not available for current version. Running time: The examples provided take between 3 and 6 min each to run. References: [1] S. Plimpton, Fast parallel algorithms for short-range molecular dynamics, J. Comput. Phys. 117 (1995) 1-19.
