These guarantees are largely a function of the number and the structure of the Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) that make up the IEEE 802.15.4 network. One of the impediments of the IEEE 802.15.4 specification towards the support of large-scale networks like WSNs is that it does not define how to separate the active periods of each WPAN operating in the network. This results in the WPAN interference problem. This problem is amplified as the number of WPANs scales. Existing solutions argue for a centralised or distributed approach. In this paper, we present the Super Frame (SF) resolution algorithm that implements a hybrid approach, and uses preexisting mechanisms within the standard to minimise the impact of the WPAN interference problem, without compromising coverage or connectivity.", "paper_title": "Dynamic topology control for the IEEE 802.15.4 network", "paper_id": "WOS:000280104500008"}
