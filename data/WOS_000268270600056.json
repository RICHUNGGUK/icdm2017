Based on the feedback control theory and combining with micro-chip processor, sensors, phonic chip, oil-compressor and mechanism technology, we design an interactive resource recycling Expert System -\"Recycling Squeezed Cans Device\" (RSCD) and the proposed interactive RSCD is an automaton device and achieves the following attractive functions: (1) Automatic guiding and detecting system, (2) Security protection system, (3) Automatic classification system, (4) Automatic squeezing system, (5) Automatic distributed collection system, (6) Automatic refund system. We design a heuristic feedback control algorithm imbedded in processor chip and the proposed interactive RSCD has the following special features: the Automatic guiding and detecting system using phonic chip associated with sensors and panel light indicator can easily lead users to operate the RSCD, the Security protection system using sensors associated with electromagnetic switches and safety mechanism designs can protect users harmless and the RSCD as well, the Automatic classification system using sensors associated with mechanic device and the design relating to rotating stepping motor can precisely discriminate whether the recycling used cans material belongs to metal or nonmetal type, and moreover, classify Iron or Aluminum type, the Automatic squeezing system using oil-compressor associated with sensors, and the design as to the compressing device can rapidly squeeze the recycling used cans into under about 115 of its original volume, the Automatic distributed collection system using sensors associated with stepping motor, micro-switches, and the design concerning the collection device can precisely distributed collect the recycling compressed cans into two different cans collection tanks, and the Automatic refund system using micro-switches associated with counter, and the design as to the rotating withdrawing device quickly give back the desired refunds. We install the proposed interactive RSCD in several different areas in public and make numerous simulations, the test results show that the proposed interactive RSCD is efficient for handling the resource recycling problems as to the recycling used Iron and/or Aluminum cans.
