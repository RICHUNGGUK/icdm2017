Traditionally, potential candidates are interviewed and the most qualified are selected. Applicable methodologies that could take various candidate competencies and inherent uncertainties of human evaluation into consideration and then pinpoint the most qualified person with a high degree of reliability would be beneficial. In the last decade, computing with words (CWW) has been the center of attention of many researchers for its intrinsic capability of dealing with linguistic, vague, interdependent, and imprecise information under uncertain environments. This paper presents a CWW approach, based on the specific architecture of Perceptual Computer (Per-C) and the Linguistic Weighted Average (LWA), for competency based selection of human resources in construction firms. First, human resources are classified into two types of main personnel: project manager and engineer. Then, a hierarchical criteria structure for competency based evaluation of each main personnel category is established upon the available literature and survey. Finally, the perceptual computer approach is utilized to develop a practical model for competency based selection of personnel in construction companies. We believe that the proposed approach provides a useful tool to handle personnel selection problem in a more reliable and intelligent manner. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
