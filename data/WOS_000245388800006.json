Similar formulations are also derived for designing regression functions which are robust to uncertainties in the regression setting. The proposed formulations are independent of the underlying distribution, requiring only the existence of second order moments. These formulations are then specialized to the case of missing values in observations for both classification and regression problems. Experiments show that the proposed formulations outperform imputation.", "paper_title": "Second order cone programming approaches for handling missing and uncertain data", "paper_id": "WOS:000245388800006"}
