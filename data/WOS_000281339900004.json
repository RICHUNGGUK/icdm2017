Performance of the geometric mean neuron model was evaluated using various learning algorithms like the back-propagation and resilient propagation on various real life data sets. Comparison of the performance of this model was made with the performance of multilayer perceptron. It has been shown that the geometric mean based aggregation function with resilient propagation (RPROP) performs the best both in terms of accuracy and speed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
