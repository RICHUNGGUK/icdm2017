In fact, we can say that a computational epistemology exists that requires our attention. By 'computational epistemology' I mean the computational processes implied or required to achieve human knowledge. In that category we can include AI, supercomputers, expert systems, distributed computation, imaging technologies, virtual instruments, middleware, robotics, grids or databases. Although several authors talk about the extended mind and computational extensions of the human body, most of these proposals don't analyze the deep epistemological implications of computer empowerment in scientific practices. At the same time, we must identify the principal concept for e-Science: Information. Why should we think about a new epistemology for e-Science? Because several processes exist around scientific information that require a good epistemological model to be understood.", "paper_title": "Computational Epistemology and e-Science: A New Way of Thinking", "paper_id": "WOS:000272849900010"}
