This primitive coordinates transmission of distinct waveforms on orthogonal polarizations and applies a unitary matched filter bank on receive. This avoids the information loss inherent in single-channel matched filters. A further advantage of this scheme is the elimination of range sidelobes.", "paper_title": "A simple signal processing architecture for instantaneous radar polarimetry", "paper_id": "WOS:000245306000003"}
