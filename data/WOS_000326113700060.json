Approaches based on either UML or SysML permit to efficiently manage the design of complex systems in different areas. In this paper a SysML modeling approach is proposed for the design of real-time applications based on the MARTe framework. The MARTe framework has been recently adopted for the development of real-time systems in several European experimental fusion reactors. The proposed approach allows to achieve a better standardization of the development cycle and a better documentation of the developed systems. Furthermore, by using model-2-text tools it is possible to automatically generate part of the real-time executable code and the application configuration file. The proposed approach has been applied for the modeling of the control system for the Frascati Tokamak Upgrade.", "paper_title": "Modeling of MARTe-Based Real-Time Applications With SysML", "paper_id": "WOS:000326113700060"}
