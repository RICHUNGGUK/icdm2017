A smooth distribution of resources minimizes logistical problems and results in cost savings. Line-of-balance (LOB) is a resource-based scheduling system that is used in projects that exhibit repetitive characteristics, performs resource allocation as a matter of course, but does not deal with resource leveling. In the past, researchers experienced declines in productivity whenever they leveled resources in different linear scheduling models by adjusting activities' production rates. The objective of this research is to develop a genetic algorithm-based resource leveling model for LOB schedules that does not impact productivity negatively. This model is based on the natural rhythm principle, according to which a crew of optimum size will be able to complete an activity in the most productive way. The natural rhythm principle allows shifting the start time of an activity at different units by adjusting the number of crews without changing the duration of the activity in any one unit and without violating the precedence relationships between activities. An LOB schedule is established for a pipeline project and is used to illustrate the proposed resource leveling model. It was observed that the model provides a smoother resource utilization histogram. Performing resource leveling in LOB scheduling without sacrificing productivity is the major contribution of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "Resource Leveling in Line-of-Balance Scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000323825100004"}
