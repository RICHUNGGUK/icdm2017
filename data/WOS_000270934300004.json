We propose the FASA (Fairness insured Aggressive Sub-channel Allocation) algorithm, which is a dynamic channel allocation algorithm that considers all of the users' channel state information conditionally in order to maximize throughput while taking into account fairness. A dynamic power allocation algorithm, i.e., an improved CHC algorithm, is also proposed in combination with the FASA algorithm. It collects the extra downlink transmit power and re-allocates it to other potential users. Simulation results show that the joint allocation scheme with the improved CHC power allocation algorithm provides an additional increase of sector throughput while simultaneously enhancing fairness. Four frames of time delay for CQI feedback and scheduling are considered. Furthermore, by addressing the difference between uplink and downlink scheduling in an IEEE 802.16e OFDMA TDD system, we can employ the uplink channel information directly via channel sounding, resulting in more accurate uplink dynamic resource allocation.", "paper_title": "Fairness-insured Aggressive Sub-channel Allocation and Efficient Power Allocation Algorithms to Optimize the Capacity of an IEEE 802.16e OFDMA/TDD Cellular System", "paper_id": "WOS:000270934300004"}
