The new method contains mainly two parts dealing with artistic enhancement and color adjustment, respectively. First, through feature extraction and simplification, an abstract shadow map is constructed for the input image, which is then taken as a guide for emphasizing the light-shadow contrast and the important shadow lines. Next, to simulate the intense color emotion often subjectively added by the artist, a color adjustment technique is proposed to generate lively colors with sharp contrast imitating the artistic vision. The preprocessing operation is compatible with existing stylization and stroke-based painterly rendering techniques, and it can also produce different types of stylization results independently.", "paper_title": "Artistic preprocessing for painterly rendering and image stylization", "paper_id": "WOS:000341372200002"}
