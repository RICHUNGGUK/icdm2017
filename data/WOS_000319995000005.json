It utilizes an entangled pair of qubits and presents a higher bit-rate transfer of information together with a higher security than ping-pong protocol. The security of protocol is enhanced by introducing a control factor for each message mode. It is explicitly showed that the protocol has a high degree of security against a class of individual attacks, and successfully resolves the famous Wojcik attack.", "paper_title": "SECURITY ENHANCED DIRECT QUANTUM COMMUNICATION WITH HIGHER BIT-RATE", "paper_id": "WOS:000319995000005"}
