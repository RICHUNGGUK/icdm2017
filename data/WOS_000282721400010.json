Depending on the assumption on the integrality of the variables, this problem can be modeled as a nonlinear programming or as a (mixed) integer nonlinear programming problem. In both cases, this class of problems is very difficult to solve, both from a theoretical and a practical viewpoint. We propose a fast heuristic algorithm, and a local search post-optimization procedure. A series of computational comparisons with a heuristic method for general nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear programming and with global optimization methods shows that the proposed algorithms provide high-quality solutions within very short computing times.
