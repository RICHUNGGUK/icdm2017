Sufficient criteria on ultimate boundedness of stochastic HNN are firstly obtained, which fills up a gap and includes deterministic systems as our special case. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the correctness and effectiveness of our theoretical results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
