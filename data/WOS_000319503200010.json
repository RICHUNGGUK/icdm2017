By using a new integral inequality, we first present a passivity condition for the nominal networks, and then extend the result to the case with linear fractional weight uncertainties. The proposed conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities, and thus can be checked easily. Examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Passivity analysis for uncertain BAM neural networks with time delays and reaction-diffusions", "paper_id": "WOS:000319503200010"}
