Schemes that assign sensing resources to missions thus become necessary. In this article, we formally define the sensor-mission assignment problem and discuss some of its variants. In its most general form, this problem is NP-hard. We propose algorithms for the different variants, some of which include approximation guarantees. We also propose distributed algorithms to assign sensors to missions which we adapt to include energy-awareness to extend network lifetime. Finally, we show comprehensive simulation results comparing these solutions to an upper bound on the optimal solution.", "paper_title": "Sensor-Mission Assignment in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280544800009"}
