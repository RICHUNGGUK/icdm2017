Algebraic soft-decision (ASD) decoding of RS codes can obtain significant coding gain over hard-decision decoding. Compared with other ASD algorithms, the low-complexity chase (LCC) decoding algorithm needs less computation complexity with similar or better coding gain. To reduce the latency of the interpolation, multiple interpolators can be applied. However, the interpolator has to finish the forward interpolation (FI) which costs more iterations before it turns to the unified-backward-forward interpolator (UBFI). In this paper, FI and UBFI are carried out by two di r erent interpolators. A novel pipelined interpolator (NPI) architecture is proposed which includes a parallel forward interpolator (PFI) and a reduced-complexity multiinterpolator (RCMI). For the (255, 239) RS code with eta = 5, the interpolation latency and the efficiency will be 44% and 1.76 times of the previous design, respectively.", "paper_title": "NOVEL PIPELINED INTERPOLATOR FOR REED-SOLOMON DECODER BASED ON LOW-COMPLEXITY CHASE DECODING", "paper_id": "WOS:000209245200019"}
