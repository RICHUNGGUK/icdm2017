However, there is no systematic study on constraint-based sequential pattern mining. In this paper, we investigate this issue and point out that the framework developed for constrained frequent-pattern mining does not fit our mission well. An extended framework is developed based on a sequential pattern growth methodology. Our study shows that constraints can be effectively and efficiently pushed deep into the sequential pattern mining under this new framework. Moreover, this framework can be extended to constraint-based structured pattern mining as well.", "paper_title": "Constraint-based sequential pattern mining: the pattern-growth methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000245125100002"}
