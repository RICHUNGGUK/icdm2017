Using Engle's multiplicative-error model (MEM) formulation, range-based volatility is proposed as an intraday proxy for several GARCH frameworks. The performances of these different approaches for two 8-year market data sets: the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ composite index, are studied and compared. The impact of significant changes in intraday data has been found to reflect in the MEM-GARCH volatility. For some frameworks it is also possible to use lagged values of range-based volatility to delay the intraday effects in the conditional variance estimation. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
