We establish new lower bounds in the number of matrices for the mortality, zero in the left upper corner, vector reachability, matrix reachability, scalar reachability and freeness problems. Also, we give a short proof for a strengthened result due to Bell and Potapov stating that the membership problem is undecidable for finitely generated matrix semigroups R subset of Z(4x4) whether or not KI4 is an element of R for any given vertical bar k vertical bar > 1. These bounds axe obtained by using the Claus instances of the PCP.", "paper_title": "Undecidability bounds for integer matrices using claus instances", "paper_id": "WOS:000249798500002"}
