It can protect SPIHT compressed images by only fast scrambling a tiny portion of crucial data during the coding process while keeping all the virtues of SPIHT intact. Intensive experiments are conducted to validate and evaluate the proposed algorithm; the results show that the efficiency and the compression performance of JCSE-SPIHT are very close to original SPIHT. In security analysis, JCSE-SPIHT is proved to be immune to various attacks not only from traditional cryptanalysis, but also by utilizing sophisticated image processing techniques.
