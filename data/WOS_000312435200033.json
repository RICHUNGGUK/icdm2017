However, this approach tends to increase the time complexity in terms of time delays, and thus, making necessary the study of the behavior of such time delays and the differential equations which model such a behavior. Time delays need to be known a priori, but from a dynamic, real-time behavior. To do so, this paper presents the use of a dynamic, priority exchange scheduling. The objective is to show how to tackle multiple time delays, as well as faults that are bounded, and the dynamic response from real-time scheduling approximation. The novelty of this approach is to use both, the appearance of faults and time delays, as perturbations considering nonlinear behavior through a fuzzy TKS approach, in a codesign strategy. The related control law is designed considering fuzzy logic for nonlinear time delays coupling and inherent local fault appearance.", "paper_title": "NETWORKED CONTROL SYSTEMS DESIGN CONSIDERING SCHEDULING RESTRICTIONS AND LOCAL FAULTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000312435200033"}
