In this article we propose a new method inspired by a multi-agent based system that was initially used for classification and attribute selection in microarray analysis. Best classifying gene subset selection is a common problem in the field of bioinformatics. If we regard the software metrics measurement values of a software module as a genome of that module, and the real world dynamic characteristics of that module as its phenotype (i.e. failures as disease symptoms) we can borrow the established bioinformatics methods in the manner first to predict the module behavior and second to data mine the relations between metrics and failures.", "paper_title": "Detecting fault modules using bioinformatics techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000250862700008"}
