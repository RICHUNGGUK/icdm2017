Open-ended carbon nanotubes alias tubulenes can be seen as an embedding of a benzenoid system to a surface of a cylinder with some perimeter edges being joined. Carbon nanotubes are interesting materials with some unusual properties and have therefore been of great interest for researchers in the last 20 years. We use a new term spherical benzenoid system for either a benzenoid system or a tubulene, since both of them can be embedded on a sphere. Zhang Zhang polynomial (also called Clar covering polynomial) of a spherical benzenoid system is a counting polynomial of resonant structures called Clar covers. Cube polynomial is a counting polynomial of induced hypercubes in a graph. In [39] authors established the one-to-one correspondence between Clar covers of a benzenoid system G and hypercubes of its resonance graph R(G). In this paper the equality of two polynomials is extended to spherical benzenoid systems using a different method of proving in one part.", "paper_title": "Equivalence of Zhang-Zhang Polynomial and Cube Polynomial for Spherical Benzenoid Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000353424200011"}
