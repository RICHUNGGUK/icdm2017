The proposed controller can stabilize the switched systems containing strong uncertainties with actuator faults and its nominal systems (i.e., without actuator faults) without necessarily changing any structures and/or parameters of the proposed controllers, and treats faulty and healthy actuators in a unified way. The proposed method is independent of arbitrary switching laws. A practical haptic display system with switched virtual environments shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.
