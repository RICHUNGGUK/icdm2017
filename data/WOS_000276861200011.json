Although the ITMs have been extensively used in rigid and affine registration of multi-modal images, their computation and accuracy are critical issues in deformable image registration. Three important aspects of using ITMs in multi-modal deformable image registration are considered in this paper: computation, inverse consistency, and accuracy; a symmetric formulation of the deformable image registration problem through the computation of derivatives and resampling on both source and target images, and sufficient criteria for inverse consistency are presented for the purpose of achieving more accurate registration. The techniques of estimating ITMs are examined and analytical derivatives are derived for carrying out the optimization in a computationally efficient manner. ITMs based on Shannon's and Renyi's definitions are considered and compared. The obtained evaluation results via registration functions, and controlled deformable registration of multi-modal digital brain phantom and in vivo magnetic resonance brain images show the improved accuracy and efficiency of the developed formulation. The results also indicate that despite the recent favorable studies towards the use of ITMs based on Renyi's definitions, these measures are seen not to provide improvements in this type of deformable registration as compared to ITMs based on Shannon's definitions.
