The results indicate that structuring the electronic consultations leads to higher-quality focused debates, however, it can create participation difficulties and barriers to less-sophisticated and educated citizens, so it might result in reduced participation and exclusion of some groups. This can increase the \"quality,\" but at the same time decrease the \"quantity\" of e-participation.", "paper_title": "A Multi-Method Evaluation of Different Models of Structured Electronic Consultation on Government Policies", "paper_id": "WOS:000314505700006"}
