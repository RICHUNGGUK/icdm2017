We highlight that the DGS structure has such advantages as consuming less silicon area and providing another degree of design freedom to optimize the switch performances. To prove the concept, we analyze, design, and characterize a single-pole single-throw (SPST) switch using a DGS LPF in 65-nm CMOS technology. We show that the DGS LPF SPST switch with active size of 125 x 88 mu m(2) can cover an ultrawideband from DC to 77 GHz.
