Therefore, it is possible to expand MQDF to high dimension space by kernel trick. This paper presents a new kernel-based method to pattern recognition, Kernel Modified Quadratic Discriminant Function (KMQDF), based on MQDF and kernel method. The proposed KMQDF is applied in facial expression recognition. JAFFE face database and the AR face database are used to test this algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed KMQDF with appropriated parameters can outperform 1-NN, QDF, MQDF classifier.", "paper_title": "Kernel modified quadratic discriminant function for facial expression recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000240262900007"}
