The distinctiveness of the MoveOn database results from the requirements of the application domain-an information support and operational command and control system for the two-wheel police force-and also from the specifics of the adverse open-air acoustic environment. In this article, we first outline the target application, motivating the database design and purpose, and then report on the implementation details. The main challenges related to the choice of equipment, the organization of recording sessions, and some difficulties that were experienced during this effort, are discussed. We offer a detailed account of the database statistics, the suggested data splits in subsets, and discuss results from automatic speech recognition experiments which illustrate the degree of complexity of the operational environment.", "paper_title": "The MoveOn database: motorcycle environment speech and noise database for command and control applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000319776500010"}
