Issues concerning the efficient maintenance of the structure, plus its handling in various applications are explored. Our main aim is to provide to computer science researchers that would like to explore the specific area, an up-to-date comprehensive material covering a wide range of applications. This kind of up-to-date survey is missing from the current bibliography and we hope that it will help young researchers to get familiar with the notions of this research area.", "paper_title": "Wavelet trees: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000306542400007"}
