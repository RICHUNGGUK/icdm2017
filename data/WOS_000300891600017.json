This algorithm combines a classic genetic algorithm with a local searcher. The performance of the local searcher relies on the combination of a tabu search algorithm with a neighborhood structure termed N (S) that are thoroughly described and analyzed. Also, two evolution models are considered: Lamarckian and Baldwinian evolution. We report results from an experimental study across conventional benchmark instances showing that the proposed algorithm outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods and that Lamarckian evolution is better than Baldwinian evolution.", "paper_title": "A competent memetic algorithm for complex scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000300891600017"}
