Although the rigid body motion is enforced weakly similarly to the DLM (Distributed Lagrange Multiplier) method of Glowinski et al. [2], there are some essential differences between the two formulations. The present formulation uses a Lagrange multiplier which is defined globally (as opposed to the locally defined multipliers in the DLM method) which makes it computationally more efficient. The present formulation was derived and discussed in detail in [1]. Here we discuss some improvements in the formulation and show the results of a validation problem.", "paper_title": "A fictitious domain method for particle sedimentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236456400062"}
