We find that the invariance property of sliding mode control ensures nullity of the matched bilinear term in the system on the sliding mode. Moreover, using the upper bound covariance control approach and combining the sliding phase and hitting phase of the system design, we will derive the control feedback gain matrix G, which is essential to the controller u(t) design, to achieve the performance requirements. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the control effect of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Sliding mode controller design with H-infinity norm and variance constraints for bilinear stochastic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000253656200032"}
