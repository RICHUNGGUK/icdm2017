An extensive literature review has been conducted and provides an overview of variables influencing the acceptance of social robots categorized by utilitarian variables, hedonic variables, user characteristics, social normative beliefs and control beliefs. In a user study, in which 60 participants interacted with a social robot, both the robot itself and the interaction experience the users had with the robot were evaluated. The results indicate that especially the variables of usefulness, adaptability, enjoyment, sociability, companionship and perceived behavioral control are important evaluating the user acceptance of social robots. Hence, the present study contributes to human-robot interaction research by designating the variables that lead to social robot acceptance. Subsequently, this study may serve as a onset in developing an integral model which takes into consideration the relevant determinants of social robot acceptance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
