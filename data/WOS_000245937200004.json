Intuitively, in the cut-f-mode of derivation the sentential form is partitioned (cut) into several subwords, where some of these subwords are distributed to the components, which derive them according to the underlying f-mode of derivation, and finally the new sentential form is obtained by concatenating all the subwords-derived or not-in their original order. According to the original motivation from distributed artificial intelligence, the new functioning mode appears to be more realistic than the original model. We investigate the cut-mode versions of the basic derivation modes and some of their combined versions. It turns out that in most cases, the cut-f-mode is at most as powerful as the corresponding non-cut-mode, that is, the f-mode itself. In some cases the power is even reduced to that of context-free grammars.", "paper_title": "Cooperating distributed grammar systems as models of distributed problem solving, revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000245937200004"}
