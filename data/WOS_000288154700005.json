The authors outline oeuvre citation exhaustivity, or the practice of citing across the body of work of an author, and model the resulting frequency distributions to identify research disciples and admirers. A Geeta distribution provided the best fits for both recitation frequency and oeuvre citation exhaustivity distributions. The findings provide a novel way to identify the influence of an author based on citer analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
