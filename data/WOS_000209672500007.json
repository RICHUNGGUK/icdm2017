This paper introduces the status of IoT development in China, including policies, R&D plans, applications, and standardization. With China's perspective, this paper depicts such challenges on technologies, applications, and standardization, and also proposes an open and general IoT architecture consisting of three platforms to meet the architecture challenge.
