Where it curves meet, even when they afford a common normal direction, they need to satisfy an algebraic condition, called the vertex enclosure constraint, to allow for an interpolating piecewise polynomial C-1 surface. Here we prove the existence of an additional, more subtle constraint that governs the admissibility of curve networks for G(2) interpolation. Additionally, analogous to the first-order case but using the Monge representation of surfaces, we give a sufficient geometric, G(2) Euler condition on the curve network. When satisfied, this condition guarantees existence of an interpolating surface. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.
