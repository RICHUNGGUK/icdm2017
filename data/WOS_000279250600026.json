This paper proposes an ontology-based approach to adaptable WPA (OWPA). OWPA introduces domain ontology to organize the enterprise data and uses a well-defined OWPA rule to express an authorization constraint. OWPA can represent more complex authorization constraints by flexibly using the enterprise data, the workflow data, the user-input data, and the built-in functions. By a high-usability interactive interface, OWPA allows users to define and modify the OWPA rules easily without any programming work. Moreover, OWPA is bound to the workflow modeling tool and the workflow monitor respectively to adapt to dynamic workflow modification in workflow definitions and workflow instances. OWPA has been applied in three enterprises in China.", "paper_title": "OWPA: An Ontology-Based Approach to Adaptable Workflow Participant Assignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000279250600026"}
