Communication delays between sensors and controller are modelled by a finite state Markov chain where the transition probability matrix is partially known. Stability criteria are obtained based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and a novel methodology for designing a partially mode delay dependent state feedback controller has been proposed. The controller is obtained by solving linear matrix inequality optimisation problems using cone complimentarity linearisation algorithm. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.", "paper_title": "Robust partially mode delay dependent H-infinity control of discrete-time networked control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000306409300017"}
