We consider multisymplectic (MS) schemes based on Fourier spectral approximations and show that, in addition to a MS conservation law, conservation laws related to linear symmetries of the PDE are preserved exactly. We compare spectral integrators (MS versus non-symplectic) for the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation, focusing on their ability to preserve local conservation laws and global invariants, over long times. Using Lax-type nonlinear spectral diagnostics we find that the MS spectral method provides an improved resolution of complicated phase space structures. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.
