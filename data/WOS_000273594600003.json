The applied methodology is based on the separation of the analysis into service discipline independent and dependent parts. New expressions are derived for the vector-generating function of the stationary number of customers and for its mean in terms of vector quantities depending on the service discipline. They are valid for a broad class of service disciplines and both for zero- and nonzero-switchover-times polling models. We present the service discipline specific solution for the nonzero-switchover-times model with gated and exhaustive service disciplines. We set up the governing equations of the system by using Kronecker product notation. They can be numerically solved by means of a system of linear equations. The resulting vectors are used to compute the service discipline specific vector quantities.", "paper_title": "Unified analysis of BMAP/G/1 cyclic polling models", "paper_id": "WOS:000273594600003"}
