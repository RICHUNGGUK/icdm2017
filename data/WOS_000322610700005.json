This game was previously described in a parameterized complexity context to show lower bounds for parameterized formulas (Beyersdorff et al. (2013) [2]) and for the classical pigeonhole principle (Beyersdorff et al. (2010) [1]). The main point of this note is to show that the asymmetric game in fact characterizes tree-like Resolution proof size, i.e. in principle our proof method allows to always achieve the optimal lower bounds. This is in contrast with previous techniques described in the literature. We also provide a very intuitive information-theoretic interpretation of the game. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
