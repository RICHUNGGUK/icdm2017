Psi(B) is a nonlinear measure which quantifies the interaction between two time-signals including their first and second derivatives. Similarity measure, noted SimilB, between the time activity curve (TAC) of each pixel and the mean value of the TACs of a reference region of the scintigraphic image series is calculated. The resulting SimilB map is a functional image representing regions with different temporal dynamics. Some new properties of Psi(B) are presented. Particularly, we show that Psi(B) as a similarity measure is robust to both scale and time shift. The proposed method is applied to nuclear cardiac sequences for visualization and analysis of the ventricular emptying pattern, which may be useful in studying motion or conduction abnormalities. Results of a normal subject and four patients with abnormal ventricular contraction patterns are presented to highlight the suitability of this operator for studying non-stationary TAC series.
