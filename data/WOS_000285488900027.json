The idea is to discover new nondominated solutions in the promising area of search space. It can be achieved by applying mutation only to the most converged and the least crowded individuals. In other words, the proximity and diversity can be improved because new nondominated solutions are found in the vicinity of the individuals highly converged and less crowded. Empirical results on multiobjective knapsack problems (MKPs) demonstrate that the proposed approach discovers a set of nondominated sokutions much closer to the global Pareto front while maintaining a better distribution of the solutions.", "paper_title": "Improving Proximity and Diversity in Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000285488900027"}
