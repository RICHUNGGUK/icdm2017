These inequalities relate the information in the sum of n independent random variables to the information contained in sums over subsets of the random variables, for an arbitrary collection of subsets. As a consequence, a simple proof of the monotonicity of information in central limit theorems is obtained, both in the setting of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) summands as well as in the more general setting of independent summands with variance-standardized sums.", "paper_title": "Generalized entropy power inequalities and monotonicity properties of information", "paper_id": "WOS:000247606300001"}
