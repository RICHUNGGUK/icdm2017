The paper presents an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) finite element method for plane and axisymmetric quasi-static penetration into sand which overcomes the problems associated with the classical approaches. An operator-split is applied which breaks up solution of the governing equations over a time step into a Lagrangian step, a mesh motion step, and a transport step. A unique feature of the ALE method is an advanced hypoplastic rate constitutive equation to realistically predict stress and density changes within the material even at large deformations. In addition, an efficient optimization-based algorithm has been implemented to smooth out the non-convexly distorted mesh regions that occur below a penetrator. Applications to shallow penetration and pile penetration are given which make use of the developments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
