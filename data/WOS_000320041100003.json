We have implemented this algorithm, and particularized it to several subfamilies of this class of numerical semigroups: free and telescopic numerical semigroups, and numerical semigroups associated to an irreducible plane curve singularity. The recursive nature of this procedure allows us to give bounds for the embedding dimension and for the minimal generators of a semigroup in any of these families.", "paper_title": "Constructing the set of complete intersection numerical semigroups with a given Frobenius number", "paper_id": "WOS:000320041100003"}
