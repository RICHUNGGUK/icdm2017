The resulting quadrature rules allow for the rapid high-accuracy solution of Dirichlet boundary value problems for Laplace's equation and the Helmholtz equation on such domains under a mild assumption on the boundary data. Our approach can be adapted to other boundary value problems and certain aspects of our scheme generalize to the case of surfaces with singularities in three dimensions. The performance of the quadrature rules is illustrated with several numerical examples. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
