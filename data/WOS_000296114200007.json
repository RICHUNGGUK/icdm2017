It was found that the excavation depth, width, the soft clay bottom depth and the rock-like soil depth are all related to the settlement influence zone. The potential failure surface, as deduced from the failure mechanism, covering the above-mentioned parameters, is consistent with the settlement influence zone. Thus, a simple method based on the analysis results is proposed to predict the settlement influence zone. Ten case histories and statistical data for the settlements in the Shanghai area were used to verify the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
