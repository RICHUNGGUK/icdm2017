These methods use the lowest order Raviart-Thomas mixed finite element space as the trial functional space and associate control-volumes, or covolumes, with the vector variable as well as the scalar variable. Chou et al. [6] established a one-half order convergence in discrete L2--norms. In this paper, we establish a first order convergence for both the vector variable as well as the scalar variable in discrete L-2-norms.", "paper_title": "Convergence of an upwind control-volume mixed finite element method for convection-diffusion problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000251794300006"}
