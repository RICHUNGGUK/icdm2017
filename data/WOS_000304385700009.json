The computational bottleneck of such applications is found in the treatment of electrostatics, where higher-order multipoles and a self-consistent treatment of polarization effects are needed. We have implemented a CPU accelerated code, based on the Tinker program suite, for the computation of induced dipoles. The largest test system used shows a speedup factor of over 20 for a single precision GPU implementation, when comparing to the serial CPU version. A discussion of the optimization and parametrization steps is included. Comparison between different graphic cards and CPU-CPU embedding is also given. The current work demonstrates the potential usefulness of CPU programming in accelerating this field of applications.", "paper_title": "Computation of Induced Dipoles in Molecular Mechanics Simulations Using Graphics Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000304385700009"}
