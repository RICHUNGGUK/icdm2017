The operations are redefined in the discrete particle swarm algorithm. To improve the performance the simulated annealing algorithm is combined with discrete particle swarm. We use SA to enhance the results of local best positions instead of current positions. The experimental results show that our hybrid discrete particle swarm algorithm is effective and efficient to solve open-shop problems.", "paper_title": "A hybrid discrete particle swarm algorithm for open-shop problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300021"}
