We construct two halfspaces on {0, 1}(n) whose intersection has threshold degree circle minus(root n), an exponential improvement on previous lower bounds. This solves an open problem due to Klivans [A Complexity-Theoretic Approach to Learning, Ph.D. thesis, MIT, Cambridge, MA, 2002] and rules out the use of perceptron-based techniques for PAC learning the intersection of two halfspaces, a central unresolved challenge in computational learning. We also prove that the intersection of two majority functions has threshold degree O(log n), which is tight and settles a conjecture of O'Donnell and Servedio [Proceedings of the 35th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), 2003, pp. 325-334]. Our proof consists of two parts. First, we show that for any nonconstant Boolean functions f and g, the intersection f(x) boolean AND g(y) has threshold degree O(d) if and only if parallel to f - F parallel to(infinity) + parallel to g - G parallel to(infinity) < 1 for some rational functions F, G of degree O(d). Second, we determine the least degree required for approximating a halfspace and a majority function to any given accuracy by rational functions. Our technique further allows us to obtain direct sum theorems for polynomial representations of composed Boolean functions. In particular, we give an improved lower bound on the approximate degree of the AND-OR tree.", "paper_title": "THE INTERSECTION OF TWO HALFSPACES HAS HIGH THRESHOLD DEGREE", "paper_id": "WOS:000328889400013"}
