While ranked retrieval has been actively studied lately, existing efforts have focused only on supporting ranking over numerical or text data. However, many real-life data contain a large amount of categorical attributes, in combination with numerical and text attributes, which cannot be efficiently supported - unlike numerical attributes where a natural ordering is inherent, the existence of categorical attributes with no such ordering complicates both the formulation and processing of ranking. This paper studies the efficient and effective support of ranking over categorical data, as well as uniform support with other types of attributes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
