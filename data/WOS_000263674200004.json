The estimation of the parameters is based on the Monte Carlo simulation technique of Gibbs sampling mixed with a Metropolis-Hastings step. Also, we obtain a posterior distribution which is conjugate to a generalized Dirichlet likelihood. For the selection of the number of clusters, we used the integrated likelihood. The performance of our Bayesian algorithm is tested and compared with the maximum likelihood approach by the classification of several synthetic and real data sets. The generalized Dirichlet mixture is also applied to the problems of IR eye modeling and introduced as a probabilistic kernel for Support Vector Machines.", "paper_title": "On Bayesian analysis of a finite generalized Dirichlet mixture via a Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000263674200004"}
