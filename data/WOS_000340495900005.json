Such gains are achieved through the joint management of the individual access technologies in a Heterogeneous Wireless Network. The objective of this work is to expand on the existing body of work to accommodate heterogeneity not just at the traditional access-network level but to other connectivity modes such as dynamic spectrum access. Such modes affect operator profitability in both the long and short terms. Specifically, we explore the design of a cost-management model that adapts to the short-term variability in connectivity costs. We also display the operational aspects and effectiveness of this functionality through both simulation and an analytical model.
