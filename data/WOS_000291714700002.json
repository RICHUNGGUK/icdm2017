Also, two usual pattern recognition techniques, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA), were investigated. Four interpretable factors were identified through PMF analysis, in connection with the mineralogical/chemical features of lake sediments in the catchment areas: phosphate and sulphur source, carbonates, silicates and heavy metal-bearing minerals. Also, to properly modify individual uncertainty estimates, a new PMF factor was identified, explaining a possible Pb contamination source. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
