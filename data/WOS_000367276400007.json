Membrane fission is a process by which a biological membrane is split into two new ones in such a manner that the contents of the initial membrane get distributed or separated among the new membranes. Inspired by these biological phenomena, new kinds of models were considered in the discipline of Membrane Computing, in the context of P systems with active membranes, and tissue P systems that use symport/antiport rules, respectively. This paper combines the two approaches: cell-like P systems with symport/antiport rules and membrane separation are studied, from a computational complexity perspective. Specifically, the role of the environment in the context of cell-like P systems with membrane separation is established, and additional borderlines between tractability and NP-hardness are summarized.
