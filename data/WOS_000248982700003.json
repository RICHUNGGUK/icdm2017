There are some interesting results concerning the hamiltonicity and the fault tolerant hamiltonicity of the alternating group graphs. In this article, we propose a new concept called panpositionable harniltonicity. A hamiltonian graph G is panpositionable if for any two different vertices x and y of G and for any integer I satisfying d(x, y) <= I <= vertical bar V(G)vertical bar - d(x, y), there exists a hamiltonian cycle C of G such that the relative distance between x, y on C is I. We show that AG(n) is panpositionable hamiltonian if n >= 3.
