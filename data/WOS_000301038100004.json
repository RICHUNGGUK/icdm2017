Unlike the simple session models, where sessions are sequences of web pages requested from the server (or served from a browser/proxy cache) and viewed in the browser (which may not guarantee a direct relationship between subsequent web pages in the session), we define a more realistic session model in which a session is a set of paths traversed in the web graph that corresponds to a user navigation performed by following links on web pages. We define the session construction process from raw server logs as a new graph problem and present a novel algorithm, Smart-SRA (Smart Session Reconstruction Algorithm), to solve this problem efficiently. An experimental evaluation based on data collected from real web access scenarios showed that Smart-SRA produces more accurate user sessions than the session construction methods found in the literature.
