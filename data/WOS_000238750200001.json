This Decision Support System (DSS) uses an incremental knowledge acquisition technique called Multiple Classification Ripple Down Rules (MCRDR) and a breast cancer treatments knowledge base. This system integrate MCRDR inference engine and use knowledge bases to reach advanced reasoning level during the decision making process. The knowledge base will be built from clinical protocols, and its content will be updated by the doctor using the MCRDR component. This DSS infers a cancer treatment from the (clinical or pathological) input data supplied by the physician and it also allows the maintenance of the knowledge base. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
