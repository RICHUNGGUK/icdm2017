First, a generalized version of our previous method is described, where a discretization technique is applied only for the constrained state variables. Next, it is proven that the problem is reduced to the finite-time optimal control problem of a certain discrete-time linear system with discrete-valued inputs. Finally, a new efficient algorithm for solving this optimization problem is proposed. Several numerical simulations show that this solver is much faster than the CPLEX solver.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous optimization of continuous control inputs and discrete state waypoints", "paper_id": "WOS:000237082600021"}
