This paper proposes using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to analyze the service quality perceived by the passengers of a public transportation system. This technique is characterized by its high capability for prediction and for capturing highly non-lineal intrinsic relations between the study variables without requiring a pre-defined model. First, an ANN model was developed using the data gathered in a Customer Satisfaction Survey conducted on the Granada bus metropolitan transit system in 2007. Next, three different methods were used to determine the relative contribution of the attributes. Finally, a statistical analysis was applied to the outcomes of each method to identify groups of attributes with significant differences in their relative importance. The results show that statistical significant differences exist among several categories of attributes that have a greater or lesser impact on service quality and satisfaction. All the methods agree that Frequency is the most influential attribute in the service quality, and that other attributes such as Speed, Information and Proximity are also important (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
