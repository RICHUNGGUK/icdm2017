The proposed DOM includes two stages. The first stage is to find the point R by applying the difference equation operation to an ECG signal. The second stage looks for the points Q and S based on the point R to find the QRS complex. From the QRS complex, the T wave and P wave can be obtained by the existing methods. Some records (QRS complex and T and P waves) of ECG signals in MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is tested to show the DOM has a much more precise detection rate and faster speed than other methods.
