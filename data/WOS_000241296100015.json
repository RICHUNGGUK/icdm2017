In the conventional polygonal approximation methods, the sizes of an object and an approximating polygon are quite different, therefore there are so many error pixels between them. The proposed method reduces the size of error regions by adjusting the size of the polygon to that of an object. Simulation results show outstanding performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A new vertex adjustment method for polygon-based shape coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000241296100015"}
