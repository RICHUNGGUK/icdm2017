This is an obstacle for research teams in the fields of Chemistry and the Life Sciences who are interested in conducting this kind of experiment but do not have enough programming skills. To overcome these limitations, we have designed BDT, an easy-to-use graphic interface for AutoGrid/AutoDock.", "paper_title": "BDT: an easy-to-use front-end application for automation of massive docking tasks and complex docking strategies with AutoDock", "paper_id": "WOS:000239725900024"}
