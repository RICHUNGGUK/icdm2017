As a special case, the method is used for estimating the parameters of the normal distribution and Cauchy distribution. For the Cauchy distribution, neither the moment estimation method nor the maximum likelihood estimation method works properly for estimating the parameters. The quantiles for obtaining confidence intervals and point estimates for the parameters of the two-parameter Cauchy distribution are given in the paper. It is shown that the estimators obtained in this paper are unbiased with respect to the median and possess some optimal properties.", "paper_title": "A simple method for estimating parameters of the location-scale distribution family", "paper_id": "WOS:000285347900003"}
