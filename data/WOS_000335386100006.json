Among other requirements, synchronization of keys, simultaneity, dependence, detecting illegitimate tags, eliminating unwanted tag processing, and denial-of-proof attacks have not been fully addressed by many. Our protocol addresses these important gaps by taking a holistic approach to grouping proofs and provides forward security, which is an open research issue. The protocol is based on simple (XOR) encryption and 128-bit pseudorandom number generators, operations that can be easily implemented on low-cost passive tags. Thus, our protocol enables large-scale implementations and achieves EPC C1G2 compliance while meeting the security requirements.", "paper_title": "A Robust Grouping Proof Protocol for RFID EPC C1G2 Tags", "paper_id": "WOS:000335386100006"}
