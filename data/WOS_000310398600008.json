It is shown that the structural homeomorphism is an equivalence relation on the family of structural descriptors. An exact relation between molecular structures corresponding to the homeomorphic descriptors is derived. Thereby, the average properties of the molecular structures are compared.", "paper_title": "Structural Homeomorphism between Structural Descriptors and Relation between Corresponding Structures: A Mathematical Picture", "paper_id": "WOS:000310398600008"}
