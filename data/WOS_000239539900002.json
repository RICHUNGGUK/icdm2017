Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a brief appraisal of Einstein's work. Findings - The paper reminds the reader of the 1905 discoveries, such as photoelectric phenomena, special theory of relativity and Brown's motions. Originality/value - The paper deals with the problem of how Einstein's concept contradicts or follows the Faraday concept of electromagnetic fields.", "paper_title": "100th anniversary of Albert Einstein's papers with regard to field theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000239539900002"}
