In this method, we first collect the statistics of injection/ejection events in periodic boundary conditions (PBC). Once sufficient statistics are collected, we remove the PBC and turn on the SBC. In the SBC simulations, we allow particles leaving the system to be truly ejected from the simulation, and randomly inject particles at the boundaries by resampling from the injection/ejection statistics collected from the current or previous simulations. With the SBC, we can measure thermodynamic quantities within the grand canonical ensemble, based on the particle number and energy fluctuations. To demonstrate how useful the SBC algorithm is, we simulated a hard disk gas and measured the pair distribution function, the compressibility and the specific heat, comparing them against literature values.
