To build classification devices training sets of drugs with known activities are needed. For many such classification problems, not only qualitative but also quantitative information of a specific property (e.g. binding affinity) is available. The latter can be used to build a regression scheme to predict this property for new compounds. Predicting a compound property explicitly is generally more difficult than classifying that the property lies below or above a given threshold value. Hence, an indirect classification that is based on regression may lead to poorer results than a direct classification scheme. In fact, initially researchers are only interested to classify compounds as potential drugs. The activities of these compounds are subsequently measured in wet lab. Results: We propose a novel approach that uses available quantitative information directly for classification rather than first using a regression scheme. It uses a new type of loss function called weighted biased regression. Application of this method to four widely studied datasets of the CoEPrA contest (Comparative Evaluation of Prediction Algorithms, http://coepra.org) shows that it can outperform simple classification methods that do not make use of this additional quantitative information.", "paper_title": "Exploring classification strategies with the CoEPrA 2006 contest", "paper_id": "WOS:000274973800003"}
