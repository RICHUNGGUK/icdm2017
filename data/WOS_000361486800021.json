The known lower bounds for the secrecy capacity of compound finite-state memoryless channels under discrete alphabets are extended to arbitrary uncertainty sets and continuous alphabets under the strong secrecy criterion. The conditions under which these bounds are tight are given. Under the saddle-point condition, the compound secrecy capacity is shown to be equal to that of the worst-case channel. Based on this, the compound Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output wiretap channel is studied under the spectral norm constraint and without the degradedness assumption. First, it is assumed that only the eavesdropper channel is unknown, but is known to have a bounded spectral norm (maximum channel gain). The compound secrecy capacity is established in a closed form and the optimal signaling is identified. The compound capacity equals the worst-case channel capacity and thus establishing the saddle-point property; the optimal signaling is Gaussian and on the eigenvectors of the legitimate channel and the worst-case eavesdropper is isotropic. The eigenmode power allocation somewhat resembles the standard water-filling but is not identical to it. More general uncertainty sets are considered and the existence of a maximum element is shown to be sufficient for a saddle-point to exist, so that signaling on the worst-case channel achieves the compound capacity of the whole class of channels. The case of rank-constrained eavesdropper is considered and the respective compound secrecy capacity is established. Subsequently, the case of additive uncertainty in the legitimate channel, in addition to the unknown eavesdropper channel, is studied. Its compound secrecy capacity and the optimal signaling are established in a closed form as well, revealing the same saddle-point property. When a saddle-point exists under strong secrecy, strong and weak secrecy compound capacities are equal.", "paper_title": "The Secrecy Capacity of Compound Gaussian MIMO Wiretap Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000361486800021"}
