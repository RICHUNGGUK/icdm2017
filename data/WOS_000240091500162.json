In this paper, we focus on car plate localization-the first step of car plate recognition. We propose a hybrid method based on Pulse Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) and wavelet analysis. First of all, we use PCNN to enhance the image. Then, regions of interest (ROIs) will be get through wavelet analysis. After that, PCNN enhancement is applied again in ROIs, followed by a training and classification process for final labelling ROIs as car plate regions or not. Experiment results show that the precision can get 96%, which is higher than other localization methods on the same image database.", "paper_title": "Car plate localization using pulse coupled neural network in complicated environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500162"}
