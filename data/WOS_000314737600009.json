Furthermore, the policy strategy is needed in order to influence the managers or drivers to find the optimum and the most effective route for a trip plan in supporting the logistic operations of SCM. In this paper we analyze the effectiveness of the coordination model of the environmental conditions that are affecting for the travelling time based on multi-agent system for a road transportation network for supply chain management. A number of experimental cases have been used to evaluate the proposed approach transportation network problems in some Malaysian cities. Finally, experimental results affirmed that the proposed approach is practical and efficient. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
