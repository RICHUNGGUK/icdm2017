Although some physical sensors can acquire emotional state, installing them in all spaces would be too cost-prohibitive-aside from raising strong privacy concerns in exposing individuals' physical conditions. These issues lead us to investigate other ways to estimate users' emotions. In particular, we focus on estimating degrees of emotion from users' writing and speech. In this paper, we propose an emotion estimation methodology for context-aware services. To do so, we developed a method for calculating the degree of emotion in emotional predicates, which consist of verbs and adverbs. To demonstrate the feasibility of the ideas proposed in this paper, we performed a survey and compared the users' responses with degrees of emotion estimated by the proposed method.
