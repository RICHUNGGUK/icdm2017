The question is how much damage can be done by a malicious participant sitting inside the system. We assume that all the participants (including internal adversaries) have bounded memory - at any moment, they can store only a fixed number of messages of a fixed size. The Dolev-Yao adversaries can compose, decompose, eavesdrop, and intercept messages, and create fresh values (nonces), but within their bounded memory. We prove that the secrecy problem is PSPACE-complete in the bounded memory model where all actions are balanced and a potentially infinite number of the nonce updates is allowed. We also show that the well-known security protocol anomalies (starting from the Lowe attack to the Needham-Schroeder protocol) can be rephrased within the bounded memory paradigm with the explicit memory bounds.
