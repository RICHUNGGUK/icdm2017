Of particular significance in the proposed scheme is that the bandwidth of the uplink data transmission is dynamically allocated to each ONU without the intervention of the OLT. In this way, software-based DBA processing can be eliminated in the OLT and ONUs, resulting in the simple, fast, and cost-effective operation of the DBA in TDM-PON. The performance of the proposed scheme was evaluated by performing a statistical analysis and numerical analysis of the average packet end-to-end delay. We confirmed the superior performance of the proposed scheme by comparing the results obtained for this technique with those of other EPONs.", "paper_title": "Decentralized DBA scheme based on power detection in TDM-PON", "paper_id": "WOS:000249809000010"}
