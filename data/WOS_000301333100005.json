The goal of this problem is to find an optimal sequence to transfer the old virtual topology into new one, and during the transiting process, the services are not disrupted. Moreover, each lightpath in the virtual topology is protected by the FIPP p-cycle and can survive against a single-link failure. In this article, a heuristic algorithm and a genetic algorithm are proposed to solve this problem. Simulations are also performed to evaluate the performance of proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Virtual topology transition sequence problem in WDM networks with FIPP p-cycles protection", "paper_id": "WOS:000301333100005"}
