The energy management system realizes load-frequency control (LFC), an economic operation and an electric vehicle integration into the smart grid. The main component is the HiMPC, which allows covering different time scales, regarding constraints (e.g. power ratings) and predictions (e.g. on renewable generation), as well as rejecting disturbances (e.g. due to fluctuating renewable generation) based on a systematic model- and optimization-based design. For the electric vehicle integration, an aggregator is proposed as link between HiMPC and individual vehicle. The aggregator in particular provides predictions to the HiMPC on the availability of electric vehicles for LFC based on the current mobility demand and the statistical mobility behavior of the vehicle users. Throughout the paper, the energy management system is evaluated for the smart grid of an intermediate city.", "paper_title": "Energy Management for Smart Grids With Electric Vehicles Based on Hierarchical MPC", "paper_id": "WOS:000323569900033"}
