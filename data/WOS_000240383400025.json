This paper proposes a self-organizing technique for enhancing the coverage of WSNs which consists of mobile and stationary nodes. The mobile nodes will relocate themselves to find the best deployment under various kinds of situations for covering largest area. The new locations of mobile nodes are determined by parallel particle swarm optimization (PPSO) which is suitable for solving multi-dimension function optimization in continuous space. Especially, the mobile nodes deployment with PPSO is useful in situations while some area need cooperative measuring with multiple nodes, and can be adjusted dynamically according to the requirement of environment. The experimental results verify that mobile nodes deployment with PPSO has good performance in quickness, coverage and connectivity.", "paper_title": "Dynamic deployment optimization in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400025"}
