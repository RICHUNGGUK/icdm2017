It is shown that the combination of depth and image correspondences from the Kinect can yield a reliable estimate of the location and pose of the camera, though noise from the depth sensor introduces an unpleasant jittering of the rendered view. Kalman filtering of the camera position was found to yield a much more stable view. Results show that the system is accurate enough for in situ augmented reality applications. Skeleton tracking using Kinect data allows the appearance of participants to be augmented, and together these facilitate the development of cultural heritage applications.", "paper_title": "Augmented reality applications for cultural heritage using Kinect", "paper_id": "WOS:000360337300001"}
