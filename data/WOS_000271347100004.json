In the context of this paper, we propose an error recovery mechanism which can handle one failed subjob of a workflow. The error recovery mechanism has a maximum of three phases, depending on the impact of the error. In each phase, We use a dedicated algorithm to remap the subjobs of the workflow to the resources. The main contributions of the paper are the error recovery mechanism for SLA-based workflows and the mapping algorithm G-map, which is used in the first phase of the recovery mechanism. The G-map remaps the groups of subjobs, which are directly affected by an error. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is validated through simulation results.", "paper_title": "A recovery mechanism for errors caused by a late subjob in a system handling SLA-based Grid workflows", "paper_id": "WOS:000271347100004"}
