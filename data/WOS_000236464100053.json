The relationship is twofold: On the one hand, we prove that every non-empty problem that is closed under disjoint unions and has Datalog width one can be formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with a countable template that is W-categorical. Structures with this property are of central interest in classical model theory. On the other hand, we identify classes of CSPs that can be solved in polynomial time with a Datalog program. For that, we generalise the notion of the canonical Datalog program of a CSP, which was previously defined only for CSPs with finite templates by Feder and Vardi. We show that if the template Gamma is omega-categorical, then csp(Gamma) can be solved by an (1, k)-Datalog program if and only if the problem is solved by the canonical (1, k)-Datalog program for Gamma. Finally, we prove algebraic characterisations for those w-categorical templates whose CSP has Datalog width (1, k), and for those whose CSP has strict Datalog width l.", "paper_title": "Datalog and constraint satisfaction with infinite templates", "paper_id": "WOS:000236464100053"}
