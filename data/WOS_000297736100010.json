An incompressible viscous fluid fills the porous space inside the channel. Long wavelength and zero Reynolds number approximation are used in the flow modeling. Expressions of stream function, longitudinal pressure gradient, and temperature are developed. Various interesting phenomena associated with peristalsis, such as pumping and trapping, are discussed in detail. Further the effects of various pertinent parameters on temperature field and heat transfer coefficient are explained with the help of graphs and tables. It is found that pressure rise over one wavelength decreases in pumping region for large values of slip parameter. Similar behavior is observed for temperature field by increasing the slip parameter. However, the volume of trapped bolus decreases by increasing the slip parameter.
