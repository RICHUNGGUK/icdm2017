In this paper, we consider the DMUs as the players in a cooperative game, where the characteristic function values of coalitions are defined to compute the Shapley value of each DMU, and the common weights associate with the imputation of the Shapley values are used to determine the ultimate cross efficiency scores. In the end, an empirical example is illustrated to examine the validity of the proposed method, and we also point out some further research directions in future. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
