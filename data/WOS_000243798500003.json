Firstly, we introduce generalized pointwise S-quasi-proximities and prove that S-FPQPS-the category of generalized pointwise S-quasi-proximity spaces-is isomorphic to TFRNS-the category of topological fuzzy remote neighborhood spaces. Secondly, we introduce generalized S-quasi-proximities and prove that S-FQPS-the category of generalized S-quasi-proximity spaces-is isomorphic to S-FPQPS. Finally, we study generalized quasi-proximities and discuss the relationships between this kind of quasi-proximities And generalized pointwise quasi-uniformities. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
