Standard CGenFF procedures were followed to obtain bonded interaction parameters, which were validated by geometry optimizations, comparison to the results of calculations at the MP2/6-31+G(d) level of theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, partial atomic charges were assigned so that the energy of hydrogen bonding of the model compounds with water was correctly reproduced. The availability of these parameters will facilitate computational studies of enzymes that generate acyladenylate intermediates during catalytic turnover. In addition, given that the N-phosphonosulfonimidoyl moiety is a stable transition state analog for the reaction of ammonia with an acyladenylate, the parameters developed in this study should find use in efforts to develop novel and potent inhibitors of various glutamine-dependent amidotransferases that have been validated as drug targets. Topology and parameter files for the model compounds used in this study, which can be combined with other CGenFF parameters in computational studies of more complicated acylphosphates and N-phosphonosulfonimidates are made available.", "paper_title": "Optimized CGenFF force-field parameters for acylphosphate and N-phosphonosulfonimidoyl functional groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000326193200046"}
