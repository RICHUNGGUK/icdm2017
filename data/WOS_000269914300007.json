In this paper, we first introduce their underlying inspirations and working principles. It is well known that the regular NSA detectors are not guaranteed to always occupy the maximal coverage of the nonself space. Therefore, we next employ the clonal optimization method to optimize these detectors so that the best anomaly detection performance can be achieved. A new motor fault detection scheme using the proposed NSA is also presented and discussed. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach with an interesting example of motor bearings fault detection, in which the detection rates of three bearings faults are significantly improved.", "paper_title": "Clonal optimization-based negative selection algorithm with applications in motor fault detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000269914300007"}
