Semiconductor foundries highly recommend using the double-via insertion (DVI) method to improve yield and reliability of designs. This work applies the DVI method in the post-stage of an X-architecture clock routing for double-via insertion rate improvement. The proposed DVI-X algorithm constructs the bipartite graphs of the partitioned clock routing layout with single vias and redundant-via candidates (RVCs). Then, DVI-X applies the augmenting path approach associated with the construction of the maximal cliques to obtain the matching solution from the bipartite graphs. Experimental results on benchmarks show that DVI-X can achieve higher double-via insertion rate by 3% and less running time by 68% than existing works. Moreover, a skew tuning technique is further applied to achieve zero skew because the inserted double vias affect the clock skew.", "paper_title": "Post-Routing Double-Via Insertion for X-Architecture Clock Tree Yield Improvement", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125600032"}
