Then, the thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility of H-2 dissociation on the pristine and functionalized CNTs have been compared. The dissociation energy of the H-2 molecule on the pristine and functionalized CNT has been calculated to be about -1.00 and -1.55 eV, while the barrier energy is found to be about 3.70 and 3.51 eV, respectively. Therefore, H-2 dissociation is thermodynamically more favorable on the CNT-CHD system than on the pristine tube, while the favorability of the dissociation on the pristine tube is higher in term of kinetics.", "paper_title": "Hydrogen dissociation on diene-functionalized carbon nanotubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000313077100023"}
