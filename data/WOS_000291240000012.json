An essential feature of TFSTS methods is that they are exact in both the internal stages and the updates when solving the unperturbed harmonic oscillator y '' = -omega(2)y for known frequency omega. Based on the linear operator theory, the necessary and sufficient conditions for TFSTS methods of up to order five are derived. Two specific TFSTS methods of orders four and five respectively are constructed and their stability and phase properties are examined. In the five numerical experiments carried out the new integrators are shown to be more efficient and competent than some well-known methods in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
