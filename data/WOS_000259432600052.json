The information is extracted using an over-complete global feature combination, and then the most useful features are selected by sequential forward floating selection (SFFS). This new method has been tested in two problems: trained integration of iris and face biometrics; on-line signature verification system based on global information and a one-class classifier (Parzen Window Classifier). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies and proposes a set of \"artificial\" features for combining biometric matchers, created starting from the scores of the matchers. We show that a classifier trained on such set of features gains a noticeable performance improvement with respect to fixed fusion rules and other trained fusion methods. Moreover, we show that an on-line signature matcher based on the \"artificial\" features gains a noticeable performance improvement with respect to a matcher based on the \"original\" global features.
