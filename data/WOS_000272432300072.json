Quantitative weightings from the AHP model are used to identify drugs that the pharmacy can produce in advance, i.e. on a MTS (make to stock) basis Because of its ease of implementation and results it enabled to reach, the approach developed at Georges Pompidou has been extended to other pharmacies in France. More generally, the work carried out in this paper is an example of illustration of how AHP can be used (with its strengths and weaknesses) as a decision-support tool in health care management.
