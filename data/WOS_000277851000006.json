However, most of the current approaches do not take into account the use of a COW (geographical data warehouse) metamodel or query language to make available the simultaneous specification of multidimensional and spatial operators. To address this, this paper discusses the UML class diagram of a GDW metamodel and proposes its formal specifications. We then present a formal metamodel for a geographical data cube and propose the Geographical Multidimensional Query Language (GeoMDQL) as well. GeoMDQL is based on well-known standards such as the MultiDimensional eXpressions (MDX) language and OGC simple features specification for SQL and has been specifically defined for spatial OLAP environments based on a GDW. We also present the GeoMDQL syntax and a discussion regarding the taxonomy of GeoMDQL query types. Additionally, aspects related to the GeoMDQL architecture implementation are described, along with a case study involving the Brazilian public healthcare system in order to illustrate the proposed query language.
