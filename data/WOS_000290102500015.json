The main problem arises when deciding the best mobility model for a particular application. In some cases, it is very important to emulate hotspots or, in general, zones with different user (or node) densities. Current models do not allow complete control over hotspots, or in other words, they do not allow any general node density to be defined in the simulation area. Usually, when hotspots are modelled, closed zones are created with different numbers of users in each area, thus ensuring a fixed node density in each area. However, this approach results in an unfair comparison among users since they cannot move across zones. This paper proposes a new mechanism to solve these drawbacks. Using this mechanism, any general node density can be emulated allowing nodes to move around the entire simulation area. Any mobility model can be applied together with this density control mechanism, provided that the mobility model ensures a uniform node distribution. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
