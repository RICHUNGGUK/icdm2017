The DE algorithm has been used in many practical cases and has demonstrated good convergence properties. It has only a few control parameters, which are kept fixed throughout the entire evolutionary process. However, it is not an easy task to properly set control parameters in DE. We present an algorithm-a new version of the DE algorithm-for obtaining self-adaptive control parameter settings that show good performance on numerical benchmark problems. The results show that our algorithm with self-adaptive control parameter settings is better than, or at least comparable to, the standard DE algorithm and evolutionary algorithms from literature when considering the quality of the solutions obtained.", "paper_title": "Self-adapting control parameters in differential evolution: A comparative study on numerical benchmark problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242751400002"}
