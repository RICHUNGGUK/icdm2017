However, additive or multiplicative preferences should be aggregated with feasible operators. To resolve this problem, this study proposes a new MCDM aggregation model, capable of handling situational group MCDM problems based on the ME-OWA (maximal entropy ordered weighted averaging) and ME-OWGA (maximal entropy ordered weighted geometric averaging) operators. The proposed model is also applied not only to evaluate the service quality of airlines but also select the most appropriate desalination technology. The results of previous MCDM methods can be covered with proposed model.", "paper_title": "MCDM aggregation model using situational ME-OWA and ME-OWGA operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000239909300004"}
