Such raw scans, however, are often noisy, incomplete, and significantly corrupted, making semantic scene understanding difficult, if not impossible. Unfortunately, in most existing workflows, scan quality is assessed after the scanning stage is completed, making it cumbersome to correct for significant missing data by additional scanning. In this work, we present a guided real-time scanning setup, wherein the incoming 3D data stream is continuously analyzed, and the data quality is automatically assessed. While the user is scanning an object, the proposed system discovers and highlights potential missing parts, thus guiding the operator (or an autonomous robot) as where to scan next. The proposed system assesses the quality and completeness of the 3D scan data by comparing to a large collection of commonly occurring indoor man-made objects using an efficient, robust, and effective scan descriptor. We have tested the system on a large number of simulated and real setups, and found the guided interface to be effective even in cluttered and complex indoor environments.", "paper_title": "Guided Real-Time Scanning of Indoor Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000327310800019"}
