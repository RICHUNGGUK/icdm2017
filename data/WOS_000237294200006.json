The proposed circuit employs only plus-type second-generation current conveyors (CCII+s) as active elements, together with two resistors and two capacitors for realizing floating inductance and FDNR. Both of the capacitors in the floating inductance realization are grounded. Also, electronically tunable floating FDNR is obtained with the proposed circuit. The nonideality effects of the current conveyors on the proposed circuit are given. The proposed circuit is used in a low-pass ladder filter, and simulated with SPICE to exhibit its performance.", "paper_title": "Novel floating inductance and FDNR simulators employing CCII+s", "paper_id": "WOS:000237294200006"}
