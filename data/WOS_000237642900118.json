WSRF can be exploited for developing high-level services for distributed data mining applications. This paper describes Weka4WS, a framework that extends the widely-used Weka toolkit for supporting distributed data mining on WSRF-enabled Grids. Weka4WS adopts the WSRF technology for running remote data mining algorithms and managing distributed computations. The paper describes the implementation of Weka4WS using the WSRF libraries and services provided by Globus Toolkit 4. A performance analysis of Weka4WS for executing distributed data mining tasks in two network scenarios is presented.", "paper_title": "WSRF services for composing distributed data mining applications on grids: Functionality and performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900118"}
