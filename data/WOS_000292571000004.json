A set SaS dagger V is a restrained dominating set if every vertex in V-S is adjacent to a vertex in S and to a vertex in V-S. The restrained domination number of G, denoted gamma (r) (G), is the smallest cardinality of a restrained dominating set of G. A graph G is said to be cubic if every vertex has degree three. In this paper, we study restrained domination in cubic graphs. We show that if G is a cubic graph of order n, then gamma(r) (G) >= n/4, and characterize the extremal graphs achieving this lower bound. Furthermore, we show that if G is a cubic graph of order n, then gamma(r) (G) <= 5n/11. Lastly, we show that if G is a claw-free cubic graph, then gamma (r) (G)=gamma(G).", "paper_title": "Restrained domination in cubic graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000292571000004"}
