The mechanical structure and electric control system are illustrated in detail. The sub-pixel edge location method is used for confirming the inspection region. The second-difference and energy accumulation method are used for identifying the small moving objects. The algorithms of shape recognition and moving trajectory discrimination are used to extract the foreign substances. A prototype was developed and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the inspector. Inspections performed by the prototype have proved the effectiveness and value of proposed algorithms in automatic real-time inspection.", "paper_title": "A vision-based intelligent inspector for wine production", "paper_id": "WOS:000209203700003"}
