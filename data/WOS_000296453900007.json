During the analysis of the data, five modes of information behavior were uncovered. These provide us with a reconceptualization of core information-seeking and search activities, as well as a fruitful opening to redevelop, augment, or complement existing models of information behavior. The findings resonate with emerging theories of decision making and judgement and illustrate the need for information behavior researchers to undertake research in differing contexts. The work illuminates an issue of current concern for public policy: police use of information in decision making.", "paper_title": "Information Behavior and Decision Making in Time-Constrained Practice: A Dual-Processing Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000296453900007"}
