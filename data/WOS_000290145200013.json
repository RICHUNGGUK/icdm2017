The technique can retrieve the original image without distortion, after the embedded message has been extracted. Histogram-based scheme is a remarkable breakthrough in reversible watermarking schemes, in terms of high embedding capacity and low distortion. This scheme is lack of capacity control due to the requirement for embedding large-scale data, because the largest hidden capacity is decided by the amount of pixels with the peak point. In this paper, we propose a reversible watermarking scheme to enlarge the number of pixels with the peak point as large as possible. This algorithm is based on an adaptive edge-guided interpolation, furthermore, hides messages by interpolation-error, i.e. the difference between the original and interpolated image value. Simulation results compared with other state-of-the-art reversible watermarking schemes in this paper demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Reversible Watermarking Using Adaptive Edge-Guided Interpolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000290145200013"}
