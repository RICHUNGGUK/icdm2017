The idea is using multisurface fitting to take full advantage of spatial structure information. Each site of low-resolution pixels is fitted with one surface, and the final estimation is made by fusing the multisampling values on these surfaces in the maximum a posteriori fashion. With this method, the reconstructed high-resolution images preserve image details effectively without any hypothesis on image prior. Furthermore, we extend our method to a more general noise model. Experimental results on the simulated and real-world data show the superiority of the proposed method in both quantitative and visual comparisons.", "paper_title": "Interpolation-Based Image Super-Resolution Using Multisurface Fitting", "paper_id": "WOS:000305577600018"}
