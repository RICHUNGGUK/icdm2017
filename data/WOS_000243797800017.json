Because of the short life and the large variety involved in commercial products, they must be configured accordingly. It is a task for the configuration change management. This paper presents an integrated model for modeling the change behavior of product parts, and for evaluating alternative suppliers for each part by applying fuzzy theory, T transformation technology, and genetic algorithms. The proposed model is based on the concepts of part change requirements, fuzzy performance indicators, and the integration of different attributes, to allow the part supplier selection of a specific commercial product to be explored and modeled. The application of this approach is illustrated through a case study of a TFT-LCD product for part change optimization. In terms of change performance, experimental analyses with different genetic parameters allowed the potential alternative suppliers for the product parts to be evaluated. The results of the experimental analyses show that this proposed methodology is a suitable approach and provides a quality solution for products with a complex configuration. In addition, the numerical results obtained from the new approach were compared with the results obtained by linear programming. The result shows that the proposed algorithm is reliable and robust.
