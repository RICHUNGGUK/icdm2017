Dynamical neural field theory provides a theoretical framework macroscopically describing the activity of neuron ensemble. Based on it, our clustering approach is essentially close to the neurophysiological nature of perception. It is also computationally stable, insensitive to noise, flexible, and tractable for data with complex structure. Some examples are given to show the feasibility.", "paper_title": "A New Clustering Approach on the Basis of Dynamical Neural Field", "paper_id": "WOS:000291633200006"}
