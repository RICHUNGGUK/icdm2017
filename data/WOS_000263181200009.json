The proposal, in line with the recent trend, incorporates the current observation. The introduced proposal is characterized by the exact moments obtained from the dynamical system. This is in contrast with recent works where the moments are approximated either numerically or by linearizing the observation model. We show further that the newly introduced proposal performs better than other similar proposal functions which also incorporate both state and observations.", "paper_title": "Gaussian proposal density using moment matching in SMC methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000263181200009"}
