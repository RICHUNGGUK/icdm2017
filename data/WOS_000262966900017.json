The accuracy and computational efficiency of improved versions of the parameterized scalar profile (PSP) model are assessed and compared with commonly used mixing models such as Curl, modified Curl, interaction by exchange with the mean and Euclidean minimum spanning tree. Different generalizations of the PSP mixing model for spatially inhomogeneous flow Configurations are presented. The selected test cases focus On molecular mixing and avoid interference with other models. Simulation results for a three-Stream problem, involving two inert scalars, and a multi-scalar test case with mean-scalar-gradients are presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
