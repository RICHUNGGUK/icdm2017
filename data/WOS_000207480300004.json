To develop such a system, a mechanism for content protection is required. In this paper, a new architecture integrating fingerprint with cryptosystem is proposed to protect digital contents (image and video) from unauthorized viewing and illegal redistribution. Then, a scheme integrating anti-collusion code and Home Page public-key cryptosystem (PKC) is described. Such a scheme is shown feasible and realistic for implementing with respect to computation/transmission cost.
