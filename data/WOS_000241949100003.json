However, receivers in a multicast group must access the multicast stream simultaneously, and this restriction on synchronous access diminishes the benefit of multicast because users in a video-on-demand service usually issue requests asynchronously, i.e., at anytime. In this paper, we not only formulate this streaming problem but also propose a new multicast infrastructure, called buffer-assisted on-demand multicast, to allow receivers accessing a multicast stream asynchronously. A timing control mechanism is integrated on intermediate routing nodes (e.g., routers, proxies, or peer nodes in a peer-to-peer network) to branch time-variant multicast sub-streams to corresponding receivers. Besides, an optimal routing path and the corresponding buffer allocations for each request must be carefully determined to maximize the throughput of the multicast stream. We prove that the time complexity to solve this routing problem over general graph networks is NP-complete, and then propose a routing algorithm for overlay networks to minimize server load. Simulation results demonstrate that buffer-assisted on-demand multicast outperforms many popular streaming methods.", "paper_title": "Buffer-assisted on-demand multicast for VOD applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000241949100003"}
