A unified mean value theorem is first established for general functions of complex variables, covering the analytic functions, non-analytic functions and real-valued functions. Based on so introduced theorem, convergence results of the augmented algorithm are obtained under mild conditions. Simulations are provided to support the analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
