Previous approaches reported in literature to handle the presence of outliers mainly focus on developing a robust procedure for a given threshold; this is related to solving a nontrivial optimization problem. The drawback of this approach is that the selection of a robust threshold, which is crucial for the resulting fit is ignored. This paper points out that the best fit can be achieved by a robust wavelet shrinkage with a robust threshold. We propose data-driven selection methods for a robust threshold. These approaches are based on a coupling of classical wavelet thresholding rules with pseudo data. The concept of pseudo data has influenced the implementation of the proposed methods, and provides a fast and efficient algorithm. Results from a simulation study and a real example demonstrate the promising empirical properties of the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "Robust wavelet shrinkage using robust selection of thresholds", "paper_id": "WOS:000262439800003"}
