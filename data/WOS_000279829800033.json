By the exponential learning effect, we mean that the processing time of a job is defined by an exponent function of the sum of the normal processing times of the already processed jobs. We consider the following objective functions: the makespan, the total completion time, the sum of the quadratic job completion times, the total weighted completion time and the maximum lateness. For some special single machine problems and flow shop problems, we show that the problems can be solved in polynomial time.", "paper_title": "SCHEDULING PROBLEMS WITH EXPONENTIAL LEARNING FUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000279829800033"}
