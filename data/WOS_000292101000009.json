However, embedding of other types of networks on double-loop networks has not been well studied due to the topological complexity of double-loop networks. The traditional L-shape [1], designed to compute the diameter of double-loop networks, is not effective to solve the embedding problem. We propose a novel tessellation approach to partition the geometric plane of double-loop networks into a set of parallelogram tiles, called P-shape. Based on the characteristics of P-shape, we design a simple embedding scheme, namely, P-shape embedding, that embeds meshes and tori on double-loop networks in a systematic way. Under P-shape embedding, we evaluate the embedding metrics of dilation, average dilation, and congestion, which depend heavily on the parameters of P-shape. A main merit of P-shape embedding is that a large fraction of embedded mesh/torus edges have edge dilation 1, resulting in a low average dilation. These are the first results, to our knowledge, for embedding meshes and tori on double-loop networks which is of great significance due to the popularity of these architectures. Our P-shape construction bridges between regular graphs and double-loop networks, and provides a powerful tool for studying double-loop networks.", "paper_title": "Embedding Meshes and Tori on Double-Loop Networks of the Same Size", "paper_id": "WOS:000292101000009"}
