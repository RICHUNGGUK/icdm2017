Thus, algorithms that can tackle them effectively, both in result quality and run time, are necessary. Among these specific algorithms for high-dimensional problems, memetic algorithms, which are the result of the hybridization of an evolutionary algorithm and a local improvement technique, have arisen as very powerful optimization systems for this type of problems. A very effective algorithm of this kind is the MA-SW-Chains algorithm. On the other hand, general purpose computing using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) has become a very active field because of the high speed-up ratios that can be obtained when applied to problems that exhibit a high degree of data parallelism. In this work we present a new design of MA-SW-Chains to adapt it to the GPU-based massively parallel architecture. The experiments with the new GPU memetic technique, compared to the original sequential version, prove that the results are obtained with the same quality but with a reduction of the run time of two orders of magnitude. This great improvement in computing time makes our proposal suitable for future optimization problems with a dimensionality several orders of magnitude greater than current high-dimensionality standards (i.e. problems with millions of variables). The remarkable run time reduction comes at the cost of a higher design and implementation overhead compared to the GPU-based single-threaded counterpart. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
