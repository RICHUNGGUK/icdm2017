The UCF uses I non-traditional approach to achieving parallelism, employing an abstract taskgraph representation to describe Computation and communication. This representation has a number of advantages that affect the performance of the resulting simulation. We demonstrate performance of the system on a solid mechanics algorithm, two different computational fluid-dynamics (CFD) algorithms, as well as coupled CFD/mechanics algorithms. We show performance of the UCF using LIP to 2000 processors.
