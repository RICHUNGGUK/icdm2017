In this paper, using another way to obtain exponential working space - membrane separation, it was shown that Satisfiability Problem and Hamiltonian Path Problem can be deterministically solved in linear or polynomial time by a uniform family of P systems with separation rules, where separation rules are not changing labels, but polarizations are used.
