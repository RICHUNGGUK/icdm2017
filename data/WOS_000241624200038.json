Many factors can affect their quality. Modeling and measuring these factors are by nature uncertain and subjective tasks. In addition, representing relationships between these factors is a complex task. In this paper, we propose an approach for modeling and supporting the assessment of Web-based applications quality. Our proposal is based on Bayesian Networks.", "paper_title": "Modeling Web-based applications quality: A probabilistic approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624200038"}
