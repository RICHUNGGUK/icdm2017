However, change of view causes significant difficulties for recognizing gaits. This paper proposes a new framework to construct a new view-invariant feature for cross-view gait recognition. Our view-normalization process is performed in the input layer (i.e., on gait silhouettes) to normalize gaits from arbitrary views. That is, each sequence of gait silhouettes recorded from a certain view is transformed onto the common canonical view by using corresponding domain transformation obtained through invariant low-rank textures (TILTs). Then, an improved scheme of procrustes shape analysis (PSA) is proposed and applied on a sequence of the normalized gait silhouettes to extract a novel view-invariant gait feature based on procrustes mean shape (PMS) and consecutively measure a gait similarity based on procrustes distance (PD). Comprehensive experiments were carried out on widely adopted gait databases. It has been shown that the performance of the proposed method is promising when compared with other existing methods in the literature.", "paper_title": "A New View-Invariant Feature for Cross-View Gait Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000324575700009"}
