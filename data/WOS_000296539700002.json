Moreover, it is extremely difficult to obtain an accurate diagnosis as the urinary incontinence very often is related to the neurological system. In this article a model with capabilities for urological diagnosing is proposed. This model is specialized towards the diagnosis of urological dysfunctions with neurological etiology. For this reason the model explores all the neural centres involved in both the urological phases, voiding and micturition. Once these centres have been studied it becomes possible to establish a direct relation between neural centres which present an anomalous functioning and neurological dysfunctions.
