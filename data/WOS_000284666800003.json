It exploits the high correlation among image block pixels to produce a difference histogram. Secret data is embedded based on a multi-level histogram shifting mechanism with reference to the integer median of each block. The image blocks are divided into four categories due to four corresponding embedding strategies, aiming at preserving the medians during data embedding. In decoder, the median pixels are retrieved first followed by the hidden data extraction, and the host image can be accurately recovered via an inverse histogram shifting mechanism after removing the secret data from the marked image. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our scheme and demonstrate that it outperforms several previous methods in terms of capacity and marked image's quality. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
