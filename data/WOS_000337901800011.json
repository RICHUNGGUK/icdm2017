In this paper, we present our analogy-based story generation (ASG) approach in the Riu system, focusing on analogical retrieval and projection. We report on an empirical user evaluation about Riu's capability to retrieve and generate short noninteractive stories using the story analogies through mapping (SAM) algorithm. This work provides the foundation for exploration of ASG in more complex and interactive computational narrative works.", "paper_title": "Shall I Compare Thee to Another Story?-An Empirical Study of Analogy-Based Story Generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000337901800011"}
