The application considered requires generation of large sets of data for the training and test sets needed for neural network estimation and removal of a systematic error called chromaticity. Also, the problem requires a convenient choice of image encoding parameters; in our case, the one-dimensional lowest order moments proved to be an adequate solution. These parameters are then used as inputs to a feed forward neural network, trained by backpropagation, to remove chromaticity.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT COMPUTATION AND NEURAL PROCESSING OF ASTROMETRIC IMAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000273224600008"}
