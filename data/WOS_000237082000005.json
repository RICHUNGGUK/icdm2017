To achieve this aim, we introduce indexed higher order pi-calculus, which is similar to higher order pi-calculus except that every prefix of any process is assigned to indices. Furthermore we present corresponding indexed bisimulations for this calculus, and prove the equivalence between these indexed bisimulations. As an application of this result, we prove the equivalence between strong/weak context bisimulation and strong/weak normal bisimulation.", "paper_title": "More on bisimulations for higher order pi-calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000237082000005"}
