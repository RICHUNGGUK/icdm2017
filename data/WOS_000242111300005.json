This model is developed by integrating the capabilities of a multiobjective design problem, a multicriteria design optimization tool, a Pareto frontier gap analyzer, metamodeling methods, and use of the Pareto frontier as a constraint for feasibility assessment. Although the tools are independent of the domain, their application is illustrated using two examples: a simple three-objective mathematical problem and a five-objective passenger vehicle design problem. The feasibility of the desired product specifications is determined with respect to the problem's Pareto frontier, which is considered to be the necessary constraint to satisfy.", "paper_title": "A constraint-based approach to feasibility assessment in preliminary design", "paper_id": "WOS:000242111300005"}
