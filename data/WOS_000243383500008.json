In this paper we consider the \"average-case\" performance of two closely related versions of Rule k for the model of random unit disk graphs constructed from n random points in an l(n) x l(n) square. We show that if k >= 3 and l(n) = o(root n), then for both versions of Rule k, the expected size of the Rule k dominating set is a Theta(l(n)(2)) as n > infinity. It follows that, for l(n) in a suitable range, the expected size of the Rule k dominating sets are within a constant factor of the optimum.", "paper_title": "The expected size of the Rule k dominating set", "paper_id": "WOS:000243383500008"}
