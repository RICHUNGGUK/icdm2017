Numerical results of a single code, that can handle PDEs in first-order form on complicated polygonal geometries, are shown for a variety of PDEs: variable coefficient div-curl, scalar elliptic PDEs, elasticity equation, stationary linearized Navier-Stokes, scalar fourth-order elliptic PDEs, telegrapher's equations, singular PDEs, etc. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
