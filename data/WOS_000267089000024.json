In this paper, we integrate 12 original binding site prediction algorithms, and use a 'window' of consecutive predictions in order to contextualise the neighbouring results. We combine either random selection or Tomek links under-sampling with SMOTE over-sampling techniques. In addition, we investigate the behaviour of four feature selection filtering methods: bi-normal separation, correlation coefficients, F-Score and a cross entropy based algorithm. Finally, we remove some of the final predicted binding sites on the basis of their biological plausibility. The results show that we can generate a new prediction that significantly improves on the performance of any one of the individual algorithms. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
