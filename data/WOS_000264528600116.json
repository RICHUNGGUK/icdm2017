In order to promote student interaction, this paper integrates the concept of cooperative learning into an E-learning environment. However, how to assess individual student achievement in groups is an important issue needing to be solved. Since a teacher can not observe students' interactions in an E-learning environment, the peer assessment appears more important. Peer assessment in a group is an important part of both teaching and the learning processes that allow student to assess the others' contributions in a group. Based on the concept of student-centered learning, a fuzzy peer assessment system (FPAS) is developed to satisfy the requirements of cooperative learning in an E-learning environment. All students participate all phases of the assessment processes: cooperatively creating the peer assessment questionnaire, assessing other peers' works. and finally assigning the appropriate score to each student.
