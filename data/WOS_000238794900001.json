Presently, there are three major proposals for designing quantum computing gates based on quantum dot technology: (i) electrons trapped in microcavity; (ii) spintronics; (iii) biexcitons. We survey these designs and show mathematically how, in principle, they will generate 1-bit rotation gates as well as 2-bit entanglement and, thus, provide a class of universal quantum gates. Some physical attributes and issues related to their limitations, decoherence and measurement are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Quantum dot computing gates", "paper_id": "WOS:000238794900001"}
