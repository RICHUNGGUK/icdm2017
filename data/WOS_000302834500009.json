Estimating DOA with paired microphone arrays creates imaginary sound sources because of time delay of arrival (TDOA) being identical between real and imaginary sources. Imaginary sound sources can create chronic problems in multiple Sound Source Localization (SSL), because they can be localized as real sound sources. Our proposed approach is based on the observation that each microphone array creates imaginary sound sources, but the DOA of imaginary sources may be different depending on the orientation of the paired microphone array. With the fact that a real source would always be localized in the same direction regardless of the array orientation, we can suppress the imaginary sound sources by minimum filtering based on Steered Response Power-Phase Transform (SRP-PHAT) method. A set of experiments conducted in a real noisy environment showed that the proposed method was accurate in localizing multiple sound sources.", "paper_title": "Full Azimuth Multiple Sound Source Localization with 3-Channel Microphone Array", "paper_id": "WOS:000302834500009"}
