The square-root B-spline neural networks is used to formulate the output PDFs with the dynamic weightings. As a result, the concerned FDD problem can be transformed into a robust FDD problem subjected to a continuous time uncertain nonlinear system with time delays. Delay-dependent criteria to detect and diagnose the system fault are provided by using linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques. It is shown that this new criterion can provide higher sensitivity performance than the existing result. Simulations are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Delay-dependent fault detection and diagnosis using B-spline neural networks and nonlinear filters for time-delay stochastic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257124100011"}
