In this paper, a sufficient and necessary condition 2 pi/3-periodic of phase difference between the prime and dual filter banks is proposed. With this condition, it is proposed that the phase function theta(l) (omega) of wavelet filters can be uniquely determined by the phase function theta(0)(omega) of the scaling filters. Imposed on a necessary constraint to theta(0)(omega), phase function theta(l)(omega) can be obtained which results in the analytical of the 3-band dual tree complex wavelet. Furthermore, the complex filter banks are obtained using the wavelet matrix factorization approach. Then the dual tree 3-band complex wavelet is analytical that indicates approximately shift invariance property. In addition, it also has more direction selectivity because there are more sub-bands than dyadic wavelet transform is frequency domain.", "paper_title": "A SUFFICIENT AND NECESSARY CONDITION FOR CONSTRUCTION OF 3-BAND DUAL TREE COMPLEX WAVELET", "paper_id": "WOS:000319995600005"}
