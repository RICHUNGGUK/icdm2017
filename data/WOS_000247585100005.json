The proposed system architecture is used for description in real-time image object's shape basing on features such as contour and occupied region. The proposed hardware architecture splits the computational burden into several processes where calculations of mentioned object's features are made simultaneously in order to improve system's speed. A novel approximation method for estimation of peak's height in the curvature scale space (CSS) representation of the shape as well as the artificial neural network (ANN) used in system development process for generalization of the data samples received from the approximation module. These methods make hardware realizations of main computational-consuming modules of the system more time efficient. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
