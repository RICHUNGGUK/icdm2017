But their detection performances were not satisfactory when applied on data collected using a video-based detector system. The video-based detector system is gaining popularity as it was reported to be cost-effective, less prone to damage compared to loop detectors embedded in road pavement, and possesses surveillance capability. It is able to provide the homogeneity of traffic measurements with greater reliability in non-incident situations. In this study, a simple detection rule was used to develop algorithms that use video-based data for detecting lane-blocking incidents. A set of 96 incidents from Singapore's Central Expressway was used for calibrating these algorithms, with another 64 incidents for validation. Two single-station algorithms, named dual-variable (DV) and flow-based DV algorithms were developed. They have similar detection logic, but the latter includes a pre-incident traffic flow condition in its detection framework. On average, the flow-based DV algorithm outperformed the DV algorithm, and both proved to be effective techniques when compared to some existing loop-detector-based algorithms.", "paper_title": "Single-station algorithm using video-based data for detecting expressway incidents", "paper_id": "WOS:000235482300004"}
