Under some specific conditions, the cross-correlations between two GCL sequences are shown to have exactly the same magnitudes as those of their corresponding Zadoff-Chu sequences regardless of the employed unimodular sequences. In this paper, we first investigate the sufficient conditions under which such a relation holds. We then use them to construct a new class of optimal zero-correlation zone (ZCZ) sequence sets which can be considered to be an extension of the so-called GCL-ZCZ sequence sets.", "paper_title": "Cross-Correlation Properties of Generalized Chirp-Like Sequences and Their Application to Zero-Correlation Zone Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567100034"}
