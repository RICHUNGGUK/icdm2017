Any such function is identified with a function F: Q -> P, where P < Q = F-q(n). The latter has a reduced trace representation F = tr(P)(Q)(Phi) where Phi(x) is a uniquely defined polynomial of a special type. It is shown that the most accurate generalization of results on parameters of bent functions from the case l = 1 to the case l > 1 is obtained if instead of the nonlinearity degree of a function one considers its binary nonlinearity index (in the case l = 1 these parameters coincide). We construct a class of HB functions that generalize binary HB functions found in [1]; we indicate a set of parameters q and n for which there are no other HB functions. We introduce the notion of the period of a function and establish a relation between periods of (hyper-)bent functions and their frequency characteristics.", "paper_title": "Bent and hyper-bent functions over a field of 2(l) elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000255537100002"}
