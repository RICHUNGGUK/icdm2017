This paper describes a fuzzy goal programming method for evaluation and selection of machine tool alternatives for a manufacturing company in Iran. Our approach applied triangular numbers into traditional goal programming method, and we investigated deriving fuzzy weights of criteria from the pair-wise comparison matrix with fuzzy elements. To our knowledge, no previous work investigated such problem with fuzzy goal programming. In almost fuzzy decision making problems other fuzzy methods like fuzzy AHP, fuzzy TOPSIS and etc. are used. And most of them obtained the crisp weights from fuzzy pair-wise decision matrix. Moreover, in this method we obtain the fuzzy weights by solving a simple linear programming. As a result of the study, we find that the proposed method is practical for ranking machine tool alternatives with respect to multiple conflicting criteria.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy goal programming based procedure for Machine Tool Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000346978800033"}
