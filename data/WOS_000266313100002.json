Shannon, in his seminal work, determined the capacities for all isomorphism classes of undirected graphs with up to five vertices, except for the 5-cycle, which was finally settled by Lovasz in 1979. The work of Shannon is here paralleled for digraphs; the Sperner capacity is determined for all but 8 of the 9846 isomorphism classes of digraphs with at most 5 vertices.", "paper_title": "SPERNER CAPACITY OF SMALL DIGRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000266313100002"}
