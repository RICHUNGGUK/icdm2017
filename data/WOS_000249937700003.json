Various field tests. were developed for assessment of the fitness in general population. We aimed to assess the applicability and effectiveness of the specific software for UKK 2-km walking test data management. Descriptive results and statistical analysis on physical fitness of 383 adults are presented. The UKK 2-km walking test could be used as a feasible alternative for measurement of cardiovascular fitness. The test was integrated to exercise related health promotion programme, and widely available information technologies will be used for data management. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
