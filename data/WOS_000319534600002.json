A proposed description of the formal rules of an open L-system can be used to model almost all types of grape bunches. When growing a grape bunches, the overall shape for controlling the development is first given by users through the provided user interface, which determines the parameters used for rules. The interaction simulation process then simulates the natural thinning effect between the newborn internode and the existing grape structure via a communication module for the adjustment of the growing directions of branches, twigs and berries during the interpretation of generated string. As experimental results show, our approach is capable of modeling almost all types of grape bunches effectively with realistic visual effects. Also, our approach can be extended to modeling many panicle berry bunches. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
