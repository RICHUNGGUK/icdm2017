Our approach is based on the notion of encrypted postorder numbers that support the integrity and confidentiality requirements of XML content as well as facilitate efficient identification, extraction, and distribution of selected content portions. By using such notion, we develop a structure-based routing scheme that prevents information leaks in the XML data dissemination, and assures that content is delivered to users according to the access control policies, that is, policies specifying which users can receive which portions of the contents. Our proposed dissemination approach further enhances such structure-based, policy-based routing by combining it with multicast in order to achieve high efficiency in terms of bandwidth usage and speed of data delivery, thereby enhancing scalability. Our dissemination approach thus represents an efficient and secure mechanism for use in applications such as publish-subscribe systems for XML Documents. The publish-subscribe model restricts the consumer and document source information to the routers to which they register with. Our framework facilitates dissemination of contents with varying degrees of confidentiality and integrity requirements in a mix of trusted and untrusted networks, which is prevalent in current settings across enterprise networks and the web. Also, it does not require the routers to be aware of any security policy in the sense that the routers do not need to implement any policy related to access control.", "paper_title": "A new model for secure dissemination of XML content", "paper_id": "WOS:000255354900003"}
