When considering geometries with symmetry, a natural question to consider is whether and how the symmetry can be leveraged to derive an efficient solver for the underlying system of linear equations. In this work we provide a simple representation-theoretic analysis that demonstrates how symmetries of the geometry translate into block diagonalization of the linear operators and we show how this results in efficient linear solvers for surfaces of revolution with and without angular boundaries.", "paper_title": "Fast and Exact (Poisson) Solvers on Symmetric Geometries", "paper_id": "WOS:000362293300014"}
