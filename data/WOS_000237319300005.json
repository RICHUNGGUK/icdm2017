The thermodynamics of such RNA-RNA interactions can be understood as the sum of two energy contributions: (1) the energy necessary to 'open' the binding site and (2) the energy gained from hybridization. Methods: We present an extension of the standard partition function approach to RNA secondary structures that computes the probabilities P-u[i, j] that a sequence interval [i, j] is unpaired. Results: Comparison with experimental data shows that P-u[i, j] can be applied as a significant determinant of local target site accessibility for RNA interference (RNAi). Furthermore, these quantities can be used to rigorously determine binding free energies of short oligomers to large mRNA targets. The resource consumption is comparable with a single partition function computation for the large target molecule. We can show that RNAi efficiency correlates well with the binding energies of siRNAs to their respective mRNA target.", "paper_title": "Thermodynamics of RNA-RNA binding", "paper_id": "WOS:000237319300005"}
