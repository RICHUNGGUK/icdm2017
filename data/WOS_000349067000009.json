In this paper, a method of unfalsified control with channel probing is proposed to enable transmission power to converge to an expected value (stable state) as soon as possible. A mathematical model of power control in ad hoc networks is difficult to be established because of the complexity of the wireless communication environment. The model-free algorithm, unfalsified control, is thus remarkably fit for power convergence. With the help of a channel probing technique, new nodes that want to access an active network can quickly determine whether they can join the existing network or not and calculate the expected transmitting power, thus saving energy by avoiding redundant attempts. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in terms of seven evaluation indices.", "paper_title": "Unfalsified Control with Channel Probing in Ad Hoc Power Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000349067000009"}
