How to support ubiquitous real-time multimedia applications, especially in a heavy traffic environment, becomes a critical issue in modern CATV networks. In this paper, we propose a time guaranteed and efficient upstream minislots allocation algorithm for supporting quality-of-service (QoS) traffic over data over cable service interface specification (DOCSIS) CATV networks to fulfill the needs of real-time interactive services, such as video telephony, video on demand (VOD), distance learning, and so on. The proposed adaptive fast expansion algorithm and the loading statistics with dynamic swapping algorithm have been shown to perform better than that of the multimedia cable network system (MCNS) DOCSIS.", "paper_title": "An adaptive fast expansion, loading statistics with dynamic swapping algorithm to support real time services over CATV networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000243371900008"}
