The benefits and drawbacks of the different methodologies are discussed, and illustrated by an experimental validation on a test bench containing wet-clutches. In general, all strategies yield a good engagement quality once they converge. The model-based strategies seems most suited for an online application, because they are inherently more robust and require a shorter convergence time. The model-free strategies meanwhile seem most suited to offline calibration procedures for complex systems where heuristic tuning rules no longer suffice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
