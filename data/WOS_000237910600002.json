To achieve this goal, a typical methodology in mobile communication is a mobile device and its server first establish a session key, then use the session key to encrypt all subsequent messages. However, establish such an authenticated session key itself is a hard work, and only use the session key to encrypt subsequent messages also cannot provide nonrepudiation. Therefore, there is a desire to seek an alternative method. In this paper, we would like to propose a new authenticated encryption protocol for mobile communication. The proposed protocol, compared with other authenticated encryption protocols, will simultaneously achieve confidentiality, integrity, authentication, nonrepudiation, and perfect forward secrecy.
