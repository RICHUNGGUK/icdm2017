In this paper, a necessary and sufficient condition is presented to strictly decrease the quadratic optimal performance index after control input extensions. A similar result is also provided for H(2) optimal control problem. These results show an essential difference between single-input and multi-input control systems. Several examples are taken to illustrate related problems.", "paper_title": "The effects of redundant control inputs in optimal control", "paper_id": "WOS:000272033000004"}
