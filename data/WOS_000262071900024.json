The performance of carbon nanotube (CNT) field-effect transistor is studied using the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. The effects of elastic and inelastic scattering and the impact of parameters, such as electron-phonon coupling strength and phonon energy, on the device performance are analyzed. (C) 2007 IMACS.
