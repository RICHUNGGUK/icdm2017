Central to this development has been the advent of technologies such as bar codes, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems, and wireless sensors which when attached to a product, form part of the product's embedded systems infrastructure. The increasing integration of these technologies dramatically contributes to the evolving notion of a \"smart product\", a product which is capable of incorporating itself into both physical and information environments. The future of this revolution in objects equipped with smart embedded technologies is one in which objects can not only identify themselves, but can also sense and store their condition, communicate with other objects and distributed infrastructures, and take decisions related to managing their life cycle. The object can essentially \"plug\" itself into a compatible systems infrastructure owned by different partners in a supply chain. However, as in any development process that will involve more than one end user, the establishment of a common foundation and understanding is essential for interoperability, efficient communication among involved parties and for developing novel applications. In this paper, we contribute to creating that common ground by providing a characterization to aid the specification and construction of \"smart objects\" and their underlying technologies. Furthermore, our work provides an extensive set of examples and potential applications of different categories of smart objects.", "paper_title": "Taxonomy, technology and applications of smart objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000289258800010"}
