This paper describes a new approach to measuring the macrolevel impacts of ICTs across a range of development areas. The indirect effects of one area on others is taken into consideration by a simultaneous equation model that permits the inclusion of multiple development areas. The model is applied to data pertaining to four development areas in 64 countries: trade flows, agricultural productivity, R&D, and quality of life. ICT readiness is found to have a positive association with trade flows and R&D, but the impact depends on the country's development level. The strengths and limitations of this modeling approach, and the implications of the results, are assessed.", "paper_title": "Impact of information and communication technologies on country development: Accounting for area interrelationships", "paper_id": "WOS:000259772000002"}
