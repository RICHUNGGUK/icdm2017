It consists in the iterative duplication of a length-bounded prefix or suffix of a given word. We give a sufficient condition for the closure of a class of languages under bounded prefix-suffix duplication. Consequently, we get that the class of regular languages is closed under bounded prefix-suffix duplication; furthermore, we propose an algorithm which decides whether a regular language is a finite kappa-prefix-suffix duplication language. An efficient algorithm solving the membership problem for the k-prefix-suffix duplication of a language is also presented. Finally, we define the kappa-prefix-suffix duplication distance between two words, extend it to languages and show how it can be computed for regular languages.", "paper_title": "Bounded Prefix-Suffix Duplication: Language Theoretic and Algorithmic Results", "paper_id": "WOS:000368178900008"}
