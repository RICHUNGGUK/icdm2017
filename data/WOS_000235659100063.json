In order to speed up the way to make the digital specimen information resources interoperable based on semantic annotation using ontologies, three toolkits have been exploited to support the ontology building and the semantic annotation about the university digital museum information resources. These include toolkits for ontology editing, web content semantic annotation, and database content semantic annotation.", "paper_title": "Toolkits for ontology building and semantic annotation in UDMGrid", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100063"}
