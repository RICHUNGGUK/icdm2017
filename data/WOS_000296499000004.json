Here, we propose a Genetic Hough Transform, which combines the Hough Transform and Genetic Algorithm, as a method for eliminating background motion. Our method can handle cases in which the background may contain only a few, if any, feature points. These points can be used to estimate the motion between two successive frames. In addition to dealing with featureless backgrounds, our method can successfully handle motion blur. Experimental comparisons of the results obtained using the proposed method with other methods show that the proposed approach yields a satisfactory estimate of background motion.", "paper_title": "Scaling-Translation Parameter Estimation using Genetic Hough Transform for Background Compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000296499000004"}
