Inspired from the typical local and global learning machine Maxi-Min Margin Machine (M-4) and the idea of the Locality Preserving Projections (LPP), we propose a novel large margin classifier, the Generalized Locality Preserving Maxi-Min Margin Machine (GLPM), where the within-class matrices are constructed using the labeled training points in a supervised way, and then used to build the classifier. The within-class matrices of GLPM preserve the intra-class manifold in the training sets, as well as the covariance matrices which indicate the global projection direction in the M-4 model. Moreover, the connections among GLPM, M-4 and LFDA are theoretically analyzed, and we show that GLPM can be considered as a generalized M-4 machine. The GLPM is also more robust since it requires no assumption on data distribution while Gaussian data distribution is assumed in the M-4 machine. Experiments on data sets from the machine learning repository demonstrate its advantage over M-4 in both local and global learning performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
