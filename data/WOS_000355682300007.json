We consider mixedWSNs that consist of sparse static sensor deployments and mobile sensors that move continuously to monitor uncovered (vacant) areas in the sensor field. Mobile sensors move autonomously and cooperatively by executing a path planning algorithm. Using a simplified scenario, the article derives the optimal path strategy for a single mobile sensor to search two nonconnected uncovered regions with the minimum average detection delay or with the maximum dynamic coverage. The resulting optimal strategy confirms that it is better to search areas that are less likely to hide a target but are located closer to the mobile node, rather than heading toward the most likely area. Based on the insights gained from the simplified scenario and the theory of coverage processes, the article proposes a surrogate method to approximate the best searching neighborhood radius (a design parameter of the path planning algorithm) that optimizes the dynamic coverage and event detection time capabilities of mixed WSN deployments. Extensive simulation results indicate that this approach can achieve very good results, both for a single and for multiple collaborating mobile sensors.", "paper_title": "Optimized Cooperative Dynamic Coverage in Mixed Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000355682300007"}
