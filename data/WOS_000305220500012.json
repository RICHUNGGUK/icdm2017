In this paper, we present how one can digitize those difficult objects by modifying a commercial 3-D acquisition system with an interchangeable ultraviolet and infrared light source. Experimental results show that the proposed technique can generate accurate 3-D models of these optically challenging objects without major modifications to the 3-D scanner. The results were obtained without preprocessing or multi-view manipulations. The precision of the 3-D measurements is evaluated relative to the visible spectrum acquisition obtained by painting the test objects with matte paint to suppress optical difficulties. Results shows that wavelength changes in the 3-D acquisition system do not change the scanner precision but solve many of the issues that specular and transparent objects poses.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional digitization of highly reflective and transparent objects using multi-wavelength range sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000305220500012"}
