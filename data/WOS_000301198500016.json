Strong diagnosability, and conditional diagnosability are both novel measurements for evaluating reliability and fault tolerance of a system. In this paper, some useful sufficient conditions are proposed to determine strong diagnosability, and the conditional diagnosability of a system. We then apply them to show that an n-dimensional augmented cube AQ(n) is strongly (2n - 1)-diagnosable for n >= 5, and the conditional diagnosability of is AQ(n) is 6n - 17 for n >= 6. Our result demonstrates that the conditional diagnosability of AQ(n) is about three times larger than the classical diagnosability.", "paper_title": "Strong Diagnosability and Conditional Diagnosability of Augmented Cubes Under the Comparison Diagnosis Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000301198500016"}
