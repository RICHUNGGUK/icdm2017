Temporal sequences of neuronal action potentials were transformed into the sinusoidal wave sequences and the sequences were analyzed by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in order to investigate the spectrum characteristic of a Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron. The transformation reflected the pure information of interspike interval and provided a new tool to observe the suprathreshold behavior induced by periodic input. In contrast with the previous SSR in network devices, SSR of single neuron is observed.", "paper_title": "Suprathreshold stochastic resonance in single neuron using sinusoidal wave sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600033"}
