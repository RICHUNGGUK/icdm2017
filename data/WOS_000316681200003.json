In two iterations, we used principal component breakdown analysis (PCBA) and criteria-based scores for individualized and personalized automated feedback on the phone, with the goal to track training quality and success and give feedback to the user, as well as to engage and motivate regular exercising. Qualitative feedback on the system was collected in a user study, and the system showed good evaluation results in an evaluation against manual expert assessments of video-recorded trainings.
