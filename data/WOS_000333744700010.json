We introduce a notion of knowledge state together with a new topology, capturing finite positive and negative information that guides a learning strategy. We use a leading example to illustrate how non-constructive proofs lead to continuous and effective learning strategies over knowledge spaces, and prove that our learning semantics is sound and complete w.r.t. classical truth, as it is the case for Coquand's and Krivine's approaches.", "paper_title": "KNOWLEDGE SPACES AND THE COMPLETENESS OF LEARNING STRATEGIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000333744700010"}
