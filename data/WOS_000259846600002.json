Sensitivity to temporal information, by itself, does not demonstrate that dynamics embedded in spike trains can be transmitted through a neural network. This study analyzes how synaptic transmission through three archetypical types of neurons (regular-spiking, thalamo-cortical and resonator), simulated by a simple spiking model, can affect the transmission of precise timings generated nonlinear deterministic system (i.e., the Zaslavskii mapping in the present study). The results show cells with subthreshold oscillations (resonators) are very sensitive to stochastic inputs, and are not a good candidate for transmitting temporally coded information. Thalamo-cortical neurons may transmit very well temporal patterns in the absence of background activity, but jitter accumulates along the synaptic chain. Conversely, we observed that cortical regular-spiking neurons can propagate filtered temporal information in a reliable way through the network, and with high temporal accuracy. We discuss the results in the general framework of neural dynamics and brain theories. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
