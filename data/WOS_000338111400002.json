We develop Integer Linear Programming (ILP) models to minimize both the required spare capacity and the maximum number of link frequency slots used for each of the three spectrum conversion cases. We also consider using the Bandwidth Squeezed Restoration (BSR) technique to obtain the maximal restoration levels for the affected service flows, subject to the limited frequency slot capacity on each fiber link. Our studies show that the spectrum conversion capability significantly improves spare capacity efficiency for an elastic optical network.", "paper_title": "Span-Restorable Elastic Optical Networks Under Different Spectrum Conversion Capabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000338111400002"}
