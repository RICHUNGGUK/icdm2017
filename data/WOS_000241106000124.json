However the work on economic view issued before mainly focused on the performance framework, in this paper a fuzzy performance modeling process and method is proposed as the further research. Considering the numerous dynamic and subjective indicators of performance, the related fuzzy method that the research largely relies on here is the best choice for its natural advantages in this area. Before the method for fuzzy performance modeling is put forward, the fuzzy performance modeling framework aligned with process and organization model is discussed firstly. Afterwards, a theorem is presented for conflict and redundancy validation of fuzzy rules that is necessary for performance modeling. Finally the fuzzy performance modeling and measurement method are suggested.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy performance modeling aligned with process and organization model of integrated system in manufacturing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000124"}
