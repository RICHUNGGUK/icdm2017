This paper proposes two different parallelization techniques to speedup the GF(p) elliptic curve multiplication in affine coordinates and the corresponding architectures. The proposed implementations are capable of resisting different side channel attacks based on time and power analysis. The 160, 192. 224 and 256 bits implementations of both the architectures have been synthesized and simulated for both FPGA and 0.13 mu CMOS ASIC. The final designs have been prototyped on a Xilinx Virtex-4 xc4vlx200-12ff1513 FPGA board and performance analyzes carried out. The experimental result and performance comparison show better throughput of the proposed implementations as compared to existing reported architectures.
