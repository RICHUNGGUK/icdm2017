The proposed fully second-order scheme is a hybridization between the immersed interface method (IIM), introduced to take into account Curved geometries in structured schemes, and the Lax-Wendroff scheme, usually used to improve order of approximations in time for partial differential equations. In particular, the IN proposed for two-dimensional acoustic wave equations with piecewise constant coefficients [C. Zhang, Rj. LeVeque, The immersed interface method for acoustic wave equations with discontinuous coefficients, Wave Motion 25 (1997) 237-2631] is extended through a simple least squares procedure to such Maxwell's equations. Numerical results from the simulation of electromagnetic scattering of a plane incident wave by a dielectric Circular cylinder appear to indicate that, compared to the original IIM for the acoustic wave equations, the augmented IN with [lie proposed least squares fitting greatly improves the long-time stability of [lie time-domain Solution. semi-discrete finite difference schemes using the IN for spatial discretization are also discussed and numerically tested in the paper.
