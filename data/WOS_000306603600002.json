MILP and MINLP algorithms are used. The model minimizes the total annualized cost of the mass exchange network (MEN). The procedure involves a two-stage process: first, using the MILP, the pinch point location is identified along with the selection of an optimal set of mass separating agents (MSAs). At this stage the effect of each selected MSA on COD is scrutinized. In the second stage, the MINLP is applied to realize the optimal matching of waste and lean streams through the direct minimization of equipment capital cost. An example is presented to show the applicability and advantages of the proposed novel procedure. The project was found to be highly profitable. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
