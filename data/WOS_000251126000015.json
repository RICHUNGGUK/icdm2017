We consider the case in which it is possible to exploit probabilistic information and use this information to obtain better solutions in comparison with standard non clairvoyant on-line algorithms. A wide computational analysis shows the effectiveness of our algorithm. Moreover, we also consider a test framework with a continuous generation of tasks in order to study the behavior of the proposed approach in real applications, which confirms the efficiency of our approach.
