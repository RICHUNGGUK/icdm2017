Adopting the collision-avoided rules, a new cellular automata model of pedestrian flow which updates in parallel is established. Using this model, we have simulated and studied the evacuation process of people in a hall. The spatial configuration of people is presented, which is more consistent with the scene of reality than that presented in the lattice-gas model. It is found that the escape time t(c) closely depends on the width of the door and the initial density of people, it scales as t(c) proportional to W-0.55 +/- 0.01 and t(c) proportional to p(0.98 +/- 0.01) approximate to p.", "paper_title": "A study on the evacuation of people in a hall using the cellular automato", "paper_id": "WOS:000251156900006"}
