In the regulative aspect of network parameters, conventional back-propagation (BP) and PSO tuning algorithms are used, and varied learning rates are designed in the sense of discrete-time Lyapunov stability theory. The performance comparisons of different intelligent forecasting structures including neural network (NN) structure with BP tuning algorithm (NN-BP), FNN structure with BP tuning algorithm (FNN-BP), FNN structure with BP tuning algorithm and varied learning rates (FNN-BP-V), FNN structure with PSO tuning algorithm (FNN-PSO) and newly-designed adaptive PSO (APSO) structure are verified by numerical simulations. In order to verify the effectiveness of the superior APSO forecasting structure in practical energy-saving load regulation, the load forecasting during every 15 min is also given, and its result is used to manipulate the scheduled unloading control of a real case in Taiwan campus.", "paper_title": "Performance comparisons of intelligent load forecasting structures and its application to energy-saving load regulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000324110600005"}
