Such networks rely on the power of participant nodes of the network (called peers) for communications and computation. Traditional applications of P2P multimedia include decentralized file sharing and content distribution. Yet, the value of the virtually unlimited amount of data distributed in the P2P network will be sacrificed if effective and efficient ways to locate the content are missing. This challenge has stimulated extensive research in recent years, and many new P2P content search methods have been proposed. This paper provides a timely review of influential work in the area of peer-to-peer (P2P) content search. We begin with a survey of text-based P2P search mechanisms and continue with an exposition of content-based and semantic-based approaches followed by a discussion of future directions.", "paper_title": "Advances In Peer-To-Peer Content Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000276185000007"}
