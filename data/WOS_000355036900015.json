Total 8 state of the art multi-label classification methods, BR, CC, CLR, HOMER, RAkEL, ECC, MLkNN, and BRkNN, are compared on 11 datasets. The empirical results clearly answer the two research questions, (1) whether empty prediction problems happen in commonly used state of the art multi-label classification methods and what their empty prediction rates (EPR) on different test sets are and (2) what multi-label classification methods are with overall highest/lowest EPRs. Specifically, it is empirically shown that every method considered all made empty predictions on different datasets. In addition, several thresholdbig methods which in theory can solve empty prediction are compared. The clear answers to the two research questions and the experimental findings are the main contributions of this work to multi-label classification. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
