To draw graphs symmetrically, we employ two steps. The first step is to find appropriate automorphisms. The second step is to draw the graph to display the automorphisms. Our aim in this paper is to construct maximally symmetric straight line drawings of triconnected planar graphs in linear time. Previously known algorithms run in quadratic time. We show that an algorithm of Fontet can be used to find an embedding in the plane with the maximum number of symmetries, and present a new algorithm for finding a straight line drawing that achieves that maximum. Both algorithms run in linear time.", "paper_title": "A linear time algorithm for constructing maximally symmetric straight line drawings of triconnected planar graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239558400002"}
