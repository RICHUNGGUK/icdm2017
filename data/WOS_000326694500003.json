The method consists of six steps: data preparation, page-level pattern identification, subjectivity analysis, container structure analysis, review properties identification, and review annotation. For the evaluation, we have implemented the method and tested it on various review websites. On the basis of the performed evaluation, we conclude that our method is capable of identifying and annotating the majority of reviews.
