Whereas this assumption can simplify the overall design, it cannot meet the increasing growth of traffic volume. We propose the use of multi-portal association in this paper, which allows traffic to go through multiple mesh portals so as to ease the performance bottleneck problem caused by single-portal association. We propose the multi-portal association scheme, and a method using the virtual-queue concept to support traffic dispatching within such multi-portal association scheme. The operation of the virtual-queue method is based on the centralized link state estimation and virtual queue emulation. The simulation results show that the proposed multi-portal association outperforms the conventional single-portal association. For the UDP traffic, in the simple-structured and short-distanced networks, the use of multi-portal association (with the virtual-queue dispatching method) is able to reduce 99% of packet loss and increase 500% of throughput, when comparing to the case of using single-portal association. In the more-complex structured networks, it can provide 60% reduction in packet loss and achieve 1500% increase of throughput. On the other hand, for the TCP traffic, in the simple-structured networks, the proposed solution can achieve 92% reduction in latency and 91% increase of throughput. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
