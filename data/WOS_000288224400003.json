An actor-oriented simulation framework captures the NoC's dynamic behavior and feeds its parameters to a rate-based power estimation model. Integrating this model into the proposed design flow enables the analysis of different design parameters and the identification of the most power-efficient application platform mappings.", "paper_title": "Exploring NoC-Based MPSoC Design Space with Power Estimation Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000288224400003"}
