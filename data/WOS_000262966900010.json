The final discretization is obtained combining the stabilized RD approach proposed in (Abgrall, J. Comp. Phys. 214, 2006) and (Ricclliuto and Abgrall, ICCFD4, Springer-Verlag 2006), with the conservative formulation already used in (Ricchiuto et al., J. Comp. Phys. 222, 2007) to simulate shallow water flows. The scheme proposed is a nonlinear variant of a Lax-Friedrichs type discretization. It is well balanced, it actually yields second-order of accuracy in smooth areas, and it preserves the positivity of the height of the water in presence of dry areas. This is made possible by the residual character of the discretization, by properly adapting the stabilization operators proposed in (Abgrall, J. Comp. Phys. 214, 2006) and (Ricchiuto and Abgrall, ICCFD4, Springer-Verlag, 2006), and thanks to the positivity preserving character of the underlying Lax-Friedrichs scheme. We demonstrate the properties of the discretization proposed oil a wide variety of tests. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
