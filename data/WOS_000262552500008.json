Standard LBM, being explicit time-marching in nature, requires a long time to attain steady state convergence, particularly at low Mach numbers due to the disparity in chatacteristic speeds of propagation of different quantities. In this paper, we present a preconditioned generalized lattice Boltzmann equation (GLBE) with forcing term to accelerate steady state convergence to flows driven by external forces. The use of multiple relaxation times in the GLBE allows enhancement of the numerical stability. Particular focus is given in preconditioning external forces, which can be spatially and temporally dependent. In particular, correct forms of moment projections of source/forcing terms are derived such that they recover preconditioned Navier-Stokes equations with non-uniform external forces. As an illustration, we solve an extended system with a preconditioned lattice kinetic equation for magnetic induction field at low magnetic Prandtl numbers, which imposes Lorentz forces on the flow of conducting fluids. Computational studies, particularly in three-dimensions, for canonical problems show that the number of time steps needed to reach steady state is reduced by orders of magnitude with preconditioning. In addition, the preconditioning approach resulted in significantly improved stability characteristics when compared with the corresponding single relaxation time formulation. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
