Network coding (NC) promises significant improvement in such environment thanks to its ability to mix data across time and flows. Therefore, it has been proposed to combine with TCP called TCP-NC by MIT. In this paper, we dedicated to quantifying the R, a key parameter for redundant packets, and make it close to the loss rate as much as possible, which has not been considered in the previous research. All of these are done by the sender who is completely unconscious of the network situation. Simulation results by NS2 under both wired and wireless networks showed that our method retains all the advantages of TCP-NC, and meanwhile outperforms TCP-NC and the other TCP variants in time-varying lossy networks.", "paper_title": "Bit-Express: A Loss Tolerant Network Transmission via Network Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464100042"}
