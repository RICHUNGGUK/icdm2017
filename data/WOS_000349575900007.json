The complexity of the problem is determined based on demand and supply characteristics. Demand varies with orders characterized by different quantities, product types, and release times. Supply varies with the number of flexible manufacturing routes but is constrained in a multi-line/multi-stage production system that contains certain types and numbers of identical and unrelated parallel machines. An order is typically split into separate jobs for parallel processing and subsequently merged for completion to reduce flow time. Split jobs that apply the same qualified machine type per order are compiled for quality and traceability. The objective is to achieve the feasible minimal flow time by determining the optimal assignment of the production line and machine type at each stage for each order. A simulation optimization approach is adopted due to the complex and stochastic nature of the problem. The approach includes a simulation model for performance evaluation, an optimization strategy with application of a genetic algorithm, and an acceleration technique via an optimal computing budget allocation. Furthermore, scenario analyses of the different levels of demand, product mix, and lot sizing are performed to reveal the advantage of simulation. This study demonstrates the value of the simulation optimization approach for practical applications and provides directions for future research on the stochastic hybrid flow shop scheduling problem.
