In designing a knowledge discovery process for racing, we faced several challenges that were overcome only when domain knowledge of racing was carefully infused within statistical modeling techniques. In this article, we describe how we leveraged expert knowledge of the domain to produce a real-time decision system for tire changes within a race. Our forecasts have the potential to impact how racing teams can optimize strategy by making tire-change decisions to benefit their rank position. Our work significantly expands previous research on sports analytics, as it is the only work on analytical methods for within-race prediction and decision making for professional car racing.", "paper_title": "TIRE CHANGES, FRESH AIR, AND YELLOW FLAGS: CHALLENGES IN PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS FOR PROFESSIONAL RACING", "paper_id": "WOS:000209646600010"}
