It is known that E(G) = LE(G) if G is regular. We now show that there axe non-regular graphs with the same property. We provide numerous examples for the inequality E(G) <= LE(G) and conjecture that it holds for all graphs.", "paper_title": "Relation between energy and Laplacian energy", "paper_id": "WOS:000252837700008"}
