With reconfigurable devices such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), designers are provided with a seductive tool to use as a basis for sophisticated but highly reliable platforms. Reconfigurable computing platforms potentially offer the enhancement of reliability and recovery from catastrophic failures through partial and dynamic reconfigurations; and eliminate the need for redundant hardware resources typically used by existing fault-tolerant systems. We propose a two-level self-healing methodology to offer 100% availability for mission critical systems with comparatively less hardware overhead and performance degradation. Our proposed system first undertakes healing at the node-level. Failing to rectify the system at the node-level, network-level healing is then undertaken. We have designed a system based on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGAs and Cirronet wireless mesh nodes to demonstrate autonomous wireless healing capability among networked node devices. Our prototype is a proof-of-concept work which demonstrates the feasibility of using FPGAs to provide maximum computational availability in a critical self-healing distributed architecture.", "paper_title": "FPGA based distributed self healing architecture for reusable systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000270169400002"}
