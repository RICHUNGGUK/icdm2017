The proposed algorithm represents the improved version of classical bacterial foraging algorithm which is a newly developed stochastic optimization tool. This optimization technique is applied for optimization of the fitness function which is fuzzy entropy. Classical bacterial foraging algorithm is improved by adaptively selecting the exploitation and exploration state in chemotaxis of E.coli. bacteria. The newly developed algorithm is applied on benchmark gray images and proved to be suitable for thresholding based image segmentation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
