Metamodel-based RBDO is one of emerging techniques used to overcome computational drawback. In this research, constraint boundary sampling is proposed to build metamodel that can predict optimum point accurately while satisfying constraints. Constraint boundary sampling is sequentially to locate sample points along constraint boundary by using kriging model and its mean squared error. Metamodel-based RBDOs with constraint boundary sampling are compared with that with conventional space-filling sampling. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
