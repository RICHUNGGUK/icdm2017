Nano and biotechnology along with information technology have the potential to constitute a new building paradigm. The paper describes the concept of nano- to meter-scale building, which is based on this potential. The concept is not focused on the application of nanomaterials like nanosilica or carbon nanotubes, but on a new way of building, which unfolds from the nano into the meter range. It is based on bionanorobots, producing building materials using carbon extracted from CO2 in the air. Criteria and requirements regarding relevant technologies are defined and compared to the current research in the fields of bioengineering, nanorobotics, and characteristics and production of carbon nanotubes. The paper also presents a concept of a new building technology that would enable control and monitoring of construction at the nano level, as well as requirements regarding design methods and tools including the building information model that will become the only human input to the automated nano- to meter-scale building process. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research and development. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Can we grow buildings?
