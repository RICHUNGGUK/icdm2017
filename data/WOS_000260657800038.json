We also present a simulation test of the proposed algorithm and a comparison with two hybrid predictive control methods: Explicit Enumeration and Branch and Bound (BB). The experiments involved controlling the temperature of a batch reactor by using two on/off input valves and a discrete-position mixing valve. The GA-hybrid predictive control strategy proved to be a suitable method for the control of hybrid systems, giving similar performance to that of typical hybrid predictive control strategies and a significant saving with respect to the computation time.
