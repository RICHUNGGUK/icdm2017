The scheme is described in the framework of the multiple relaxation times method and stability conditions are given. An analysis is done to link the scheme with an explicit finite differences approximation of the relaxation method proposed by Jin and Xin. Several numerical illustrations are given for the transport equation, Burger's equation, the p-system, and full compressible Euler's system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
