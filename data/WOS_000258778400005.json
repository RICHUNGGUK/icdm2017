In this paper, we present a complete composition-oriented, ontology-based methodology for discovering semantic Web services, which exploits functional and behavioral properties contained in OWL-S service advertisements to satisfy functional and behavioral client queries. To this aim, we build on top of the results contained in two recent articles, where we presented (1) a suitable data structure (viz. a dependency hypergraph) to collect functional information of services, and (2) a suitable notion of behavioral equivalence for Web services. We also discuss the architecture and the main implementation choices of the matchmaking system applying such a methodology.", "paper_title": "Ontology- and behavior-aware discovery of Web service compositions", "paper_id": "WOS:000258778400005"}
