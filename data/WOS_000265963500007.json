In this article, we provide an overview of user-centered design and use the development of Pocket Personal Assistant for Tracking Health (Pocket PATH) to illustrate how these principles and techniques were applied to involve patients in the development of this interactive health technology. Involving patient-users in the design and. testing ensured functionality and usability, therefore increasing the likelihood of promoting the intended health outcomes.", "paper_title": "User-Centered Design and Interactive Health Technologies for Patients", "paper_id": "WOS:000265963500007"}
