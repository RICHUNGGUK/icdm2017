Specifically, we extend the depth-first AND/OR Branch-and-Bound tree search algorithm to explore an AND/OR search graph by equipping it with an adaptive caching scheme similar to good and no-good recording. Furthermore, we present best-first search algorithms for traversing the same underlying AND/OR search graph and compare both algorithms empirically. We focus on two common optimization problems in graphical models: finding the Most Probable Explanation (MPE) in belief networks and solving Weighted CSPs (WCSP). In an extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate conclusively the superiority of the memory intensive AND/OR search algorithms on a variety of benchmarks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
