These molecular structure descriptors, introduced in the 1970s, have been much studied. Yet, a number of their properties, that seem to have evaded attention so far, are established in this work for the first time. Also a more recent degree-based descriptor, the geometric-arithmetic index, equal to Sigma(uv is an element of E) root d(u) d(v)/[(d(u) +d(v))/2], is analyzed. It is demonstrated that instead of the ratio of geometric and arithmetic means, almost any other means could be used.", "paper_title": "On Vertex-Degree-Based Molecular Structure Descriptors", "paper_id": "WOS:000294591400007"}
