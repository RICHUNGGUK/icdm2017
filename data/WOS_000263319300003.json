There are many fundamental problems that sensor networks research will have to address in order to ensure a reasonable degree of cost and system quality. Cluster formation and cluster head selection are important problems in sensor network applications and can drastically affect the network's communication energy dissipation. However, selecting of the cluster head is not easy in different environments which may have different characteristics. In this paper, in order to deal with this problem, we propose two fuzzy-based systems for cluster head selection in sensor networks. We call these systems: FCHS System1 and FCHS System2. We evaluate the proposed systems by simulations and have shown that FCHS System2 make a good selection of the cluster head compared with FCHS System1 and another previous system.", "paper_title": "Performance evaluation of two fuzzy-based cluster head selection systems for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000263319300003"}
