They can provide domain knowledge to requirement engineers, are reusable software components for web applications or intelligent agent developers, and can facilitate semi-automatic model verification and validation. They also assist in software extensibility, interoperability and reuse. All these benefits critically depend on the provision of a suitable ontology (ies). This paper introduces a semantically-based three stage-approach to assist developers in checking the consistency of the requirements models and choose the most suitable and relevant ontology (ies) for their development project from a given repository. The early requirements models, documented using the i* language, are converted to a retrieval ontology. The consistency of this retrieval ontology is then checked before being used to identify a set of reusable ontologies that are relevant for the development project. The paper also provides an initial validation of each of the stages. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
