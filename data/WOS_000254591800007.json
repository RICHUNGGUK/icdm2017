The detection of standby, the coverage factor and reboot delay of failed components are possibly considered. Time to failure of the components is assumed to follow exponential distribution. Time to repair and time to reboot of the failed components also follow exponential distributions. When time to failure, time to repair and time to reboot have uncertain parameters, a Bayesian approach is adopted to evaluate system characteristics. Monte Carlo Simulation is used to derive the posterior distribution for the mean time to system failure and the steady-state availability. Some numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the results derived in this paper. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
