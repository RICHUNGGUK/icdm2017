But, some text clustering algorithms cannot update existing clusters incrementally and, instead, have to recompute a new clustering from scratch. In view of above, this paper presents a novel down-top incremental conceptual hierarchical text clustering approach using CFu-tree (ICHTC-CF) representation, which starts with each item as a separate cluster. Term-based feature extraction is used for summarizing a cluster in the process. The Comparison Variation measure criterion is also adopted for judging whether the closest pair of clusters can be merged or a previous cluster can be split. And, our incremental clustering method is not sensitive to the input data order. Experimental results show that the performance of our method outperforms k-means, CLIQUE, single linkage clustering and complete linkage clustering, which indicate our new technique is efficient and feasible.
