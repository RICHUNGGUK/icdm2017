Moreover, we show how a simulated iCub robot can be trained, through an evolutionary algorithm, to display reaching and integrated reaching and grasping behaviours. The results demonstrate how the use of an implicit selection criterion, estimating the extent to which the robot is able to produce the expected outcome without specifying the manner through which the action should be realized, is sufficient to develop the required capabilities despite the complexity of the robot and of the task.", "paper_title": "Designing adaptive humanoid robots through the FARSA open-source framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000342977600003"}
