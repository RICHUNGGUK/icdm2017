The reference to activity has been successfully used to predict and promote the simulation performance. Tracking activity, however, uses only the inherent performance information contained in the models. To extend activity prediction in modeling, we propose the activity enhanced modeling with an activity meta-model at the meta-level. The meta-model provides a set of interfaces to model activity in a specific domain. The activity model transformation in subsequence is devised to deal with the simulation difference due to the heterogeneous activity model. Finally, the resource-aware simulation framework is implemented to integrate the activity models in activity-based simulation. The case study shows the improvement brought on by activity-based simulation using discrete event system specification (DEVS).", "paper_title": "Activity-based simulation using DEVS: increasing performance by an activity model in parallel DEVS simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000329833400002"}
