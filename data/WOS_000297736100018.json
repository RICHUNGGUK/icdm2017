The fluid motion is described by the incompressible NavierStokes equation coupled with a phase-field model based on van der Waals' free energy density and the CahnHilliard equation. A new phase-field boundary condition was implemented with minimization of the free energy in a direct way, to specifically improve the physical behavior of the contact line dynamics for moving immersed objects. Numerical stability and execution time were significantly improved by the use of the new boundary condition. Convergence toward the analytical solution was demonstrated for equilibrium contact angle, the LucasWashburn theory and Stefan's problem. The proposed model may be used for multi-phase flow problems with moving boundaries of complex geometry, such as the penetration of fluid into a deformable, porous medium.
