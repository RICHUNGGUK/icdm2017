E 69 (2004) 031603] and has developed novel treatment for partial wetting boundaries which involve droplets spreading on a hydrophobic surface combined with the surface of relative low contact angles and strips of relative high contact angles. The interaction between the fluid-fluid interface and the partial wetting wall has been typically considered. Applying the current method, the dynamics of liquid drops on uniform and heterogeneous wetting walls are simulated numerically. The results of the simulation agree well with those of theoretical prediction and show that the present LBM can be used as a reliable way to study fluidic control on heterogeneous surfaces and other wetting related subjects.
