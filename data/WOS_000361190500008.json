To extract the boundary easily, Z-map models are commonly employed. Using traditional approaches, boundaries cannot be extracted precisely from a Z-map model. A boundary extraction algorithm for the machining area detection is proposed based on morphological image processing in this paper. Firstly, the Z-map model is transformed into a binary image with a slicing plane. The binary image is then dilated and the boundary pixels of the dilated image are extracted and coded. Finally, preferable accurate boundaries are generated. Experimental results show that the machining area boundaries extracted by this algorithm are more precise and smoother than those using traditional Z-map methods.", "paper_title": "A novel algorithm for the extraction of machining areas based on morphological image processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000361190500008"}
