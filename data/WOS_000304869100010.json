An anisotropic metamaterial region, which is adapted to the Cartesian grid and designed by the coordinate transformation technique, is constructed around the curved boundary of the object, and the region occupied between the curved boundary and the inner boundary of the anisotropic metamaterial layer is discarded. The technique is validated via several numerical simulations. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
