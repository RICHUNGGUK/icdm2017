Based on our previous works on DNA computing, especially on DNA automaton and the relationship between enzymes and their computation ability with DNA automaton model. We combined different enzymes together to modify the cut and recognition sites with a programmable Tape head to embody the read and write symbol procedure on Turing tape. And this article will describe how the programmable Tape head moves in two direction and read/write procedure of Turing Tape in details.", "paper_title": "General DNA automaton model with R/W tape", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400028"}
