The Personal Access to Leadership project, PAL, is constructing tools to assist leaders in creative ways and assisting the development of leaders. The tools are knowledge-based systems employing shallow understanding of the domain. The approaches used provide guidance, but do not generate solutions. One aspect that continues under exploration in PAL is the use of stories for training and guiding leaders. In order to make such support systems work, a representation is needed to enable locating useful stories related to the task of a leader. This article defines a model for story representation for the PAL tools, called the PAL tool IdeaLab. The IdeaLab is the tool to which stories are being added, as a help system to support and extend the user's thinking.", "paper_title": "Knowledge representation for leadership stories", "paper_id": "WOS:000247602600009"}
