The proposed method is based on the use of an extensible-link mechanism model whose strain energy is minimized to find the optimal rigid design. This enables us to get rid of assembly constraints and the use of natural coordinates makes the objective function simpler. Two optimization strategies are developed and then discussed. The first one relies on alternate optimizations of design parameters and point coordinates. The second one uses multiple partial syntheses as starting point for a full synthesis process. The question of finding the global optimum is also addressed and developed. A simple algorithm is proposed to find several local optima among which the designer may choose the best one taking other criteria into account (e.g. stiffness, collision, size,...). Three applications are presented to illustrate the strategies while mentioning their limits.", "paper_title": "Optimal synthesis of planar mechanisms via an extensible-link approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000279842400006"}
