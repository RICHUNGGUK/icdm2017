Due to node movement, the MANET is frequently changing path and each path has different transmission rate so that it shows low performance when transmitters select a constant transmission late at the encoding time regardless path condition. So, we need an effective video transmission method that considers physical layer channel statistics, node's energy status, and network topology changes at the same time unlike the OSI layered protocol in that each layer is independent and hard to control adaptively video transmission according to the network conditions. In the proposed CVTP protocol, a source node selects an optimal path using multilayer information such as node's residual energy, channel condition and hop counts to increase path life time and throughput. And a video source can determine an adequate video coding rate to achieve high PSNR and loss packet loss ratio.", "paper_title": "Protocol design for adaptive video transmission over MANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300024"}
