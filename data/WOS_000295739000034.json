Some combinatorial constructions are presented and many infinite families of optimal two-dimensional optical orthogonal codes with weight 4 and lambda = 2 are obtained. Especially, we shall see that in many cases an optimal two-dimensional optical orthogonal code can not achieve the Johnson bound.", "paper_title": "Combinatorial Constructions for Optimal Two-Dimensional Optical Orthogonal Codes With lambda=2", "paper_id": "WOS:000295739000034"}
