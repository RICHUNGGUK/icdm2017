For this reason, characteristics such as performance, scalability and security are addressed in web server cluster design. Due to the rising energy costs and also to environmental concerns, energy consumption in this type of system has become a main issue. This paper shows energy consumption reduction techniques that use a load forecasting method, combined with DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling) and dynamic configuration techniques (turning servers on and off), in a soft real-time web server clustered environment. Our system promotes energy consumption reduction while maintaining user's satisfaction with respect to request deadlines being met. The results obtained show that prediction capabilities increase the QoS (Quality of Service) of the system, while maintaining or improving the energy savings over state-of-the-art power management mechanisms. To validate this predictive policy, a web application running a real workload profile was deployed in an Apache server cluster testbed running Linux.", "paper_title": "Power management by load forecasting in web server clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000297347400011"}
