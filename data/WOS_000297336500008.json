Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of applying multi-bit flip-flops to save the power consumption of the clock network. This paper presents: 1) a novel design methodology of applying multi-bit flip-flops at the post-placement stage, which can be seamlessly integrated in modern design flow; 2) a new problem formulation for post-placement optimization with multi-bit flip-flops; 3) flip-flop clustering and placement algorithms to simultaneously minimize flip-flop power consumption and interconnecting wirelength; and 4) a progressive window-based optimization technique to reduce placement deviation and improve runtime efficiency of our algorithms. Experimental results show that our algorithms are very effective in reducing not only flip-flop power consumption but also clock tree and signal net wirelength. Consequently, the power consumption of the clock network is minimized.", "paper_title": "Post-Placement Power Optimization with Multi-Bit Flip-Flops", "paper_id": "WOS:000297336500008"}
