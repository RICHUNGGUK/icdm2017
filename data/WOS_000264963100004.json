We examine here three types of such access structures: two that were studied before, compartmented access structures and hierarchical threshold access structures, and a new type of compartmented access structures that we present herein. We design ideal perfect secret sharing schemes for these types of access structures that are based on bivariate interpolation. The secret sharing schemes for the two types of compartmented access structures are based on bivariate Lagrange interpolation with data on parallel lines. The secret sharing scheme for the hierarchical threshold access structures is based on bivariate Lagrange interpolation with data on lines in general position. The main novelty of this paper is the introduction of bivariate Lagrange interpolation and its potential power in designing schemes for multipartite settings, as different compartments may be associated with different lines or curves in the plane. In particular, we show that the introduction of a second dimension may create the same hierarchical effect as polynomial derivatives and Birkhoff interpolation were shown to do in Tassa (J. Cryptol. 20:237-264, 2007).", "paper_title": "Multipartite Secret Sharing by Bivariate Interpolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000264963100004"}
