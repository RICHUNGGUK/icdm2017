Concepts of points, point axioms and related conditions such as the axiom of totality, the axiom of subobject, the axiom of complement, and the relational axiom of choice are introduced in Dedekind categories in order to connect abstract notions to set-theoretical intuition. This paper summarises logical interrelations of these axioms and provides some ideas for using them. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
