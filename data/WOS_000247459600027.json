Tightening security by making systems more inaccessible can hinder employees and make them less productive. It can also result in lower security as workers struggle to find ways around the security conditions to enable them to do their jobs. This study analyzes an information systems user survey to evaluate the tradeoffs between protection and accessibility. over one-third of the respondents report problems with interference from security provisions. A structural equation model explores the impact of these effects on eventual security levels, (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
