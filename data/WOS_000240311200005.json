The principle of microaggregation is to aggregate original database records into small groups prior to publication. Each group should contain at least k records to prevent disclosure of individual information, where k is a constant value preset by the data protector. Recently, microaggregation has been shown to be useful to achieve k-anonymity, in addition to it being a good masking method. Optimal microaggregation (with minimum within-groups variability loss) can be computed in polynomial time for univariate data. Unfortunately, for multivariate data it is an NP-hard problem. Several heuristic approaches to microaggregation have been proposed in the literature. Heuristics yielding groups with fixed size k tends to be more efficient, whereas data-oriented heuristics yielding variable group size tends to result in lower information loss. This paper presents new data-oriented heuristics which improve on the trade-off between computational complexity and information loss and are thus usable for large datasets.", "paper_title": "Efficient multivariate data-oriented microaggregation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240311200005"}
