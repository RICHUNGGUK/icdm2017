In the paper, we examine the situation in model-based collaborative work and discuss the different types of models that are needed and have to be dealt with in a shared engineering environment. On the basis of a generalized cooperation scenario we then address consistency problems related to the model data and present a set of methods for their solution, including model view extraction, model mapping, knowledge-based consistency checking, model matching, model reintegration and model merging.", "paper_title": "From data to model consistency in shared engineering environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000241630500055"}
