These tools feature either an overly high abstraction modeling strategy or lack the required flexibility to perform design exploration. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes SSDExplorer, a tool for fine-grained yet reasonably fast design space exploration of different SSD architectures highlighting possible bottlenecks. To prove its accuracy SSDExplorer has been validated with two real SSDs. SSDExplorer efficiency has been assessed by evaluating the impact of the NAND flash read retry algorithm impact on the SSD performance as a function of its internal architecture.", "paper_title": "SSDExplorer: A Virtual Platform for Performance/Reliability-Oriented Fine-Grained Design Space Exploration of Solid State Drives", "paper_id": "WOS:000361683200008"}
