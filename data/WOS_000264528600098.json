The requirements of ISO 9001:2000, ISO 14001:2004, and OHSAS 18001:2007 are comparatively assessed with respect to International Safety Management (ISM) Code clauses via using Fuzzy Axiomatic Design (FAD) while Analytic Network Process (ANP) enables to identify critical managerial processes of shipping business. Consequently, the fundamental structure of IPMS is proposed based on the quantitative outcomes of FAD and ANP approaches. In practice. the IPMS can be adopted into shore-based organizations in accordance with the prior principles of ship management companies. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
