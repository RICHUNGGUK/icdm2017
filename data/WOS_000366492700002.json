The SIMOLA project focused on user generated or crowd-sourced language content to support mobile, situated and collaborative learning [Petersen et al., 14] via an Android-based app called LingoBee. This paper will analyse key elements for successful mobile language learning by considering two different but complementary fields of investigation: the neuroscience of learning and mobile language learning. Furthermore it will propose an integrated framework to evaluate mobile language learning tools, which could potentially be used by learning designers and teachers. To demonstrate the evaluation framework, it will be applied to the SIMOLA app, LingoBee, to see if and how it meets the identified criteria.", "paper_title": "A Proposal for an Integrated Evaluation Framework for Mobile Language Learning: Lessons Learned from SIMOLA - Situated Mobile Language Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000366492700002"}
