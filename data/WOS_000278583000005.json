A modified pi-equivalent circuit is used to construct the KB-FDSMN model for improving reliability in the model generalization. This new model makes use of empirical formulas to quickly estimate some circuit parameters for reducing the number of independent variables, whereas a three-layer neural network is trained for the desirable accuracy and used to compute the rest of circuit parameters. This new approach provides an efficient scheme to model the on-chip magnetic film inductors. In comparison with the conventional neural network model and the standalone modified pi-equivalent model, this new KB-FDSMN model can map the input output relationships with fewer hidden neurons yet better accuracy and higher reliability in the model generalization.
