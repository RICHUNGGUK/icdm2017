A new tracking system based on exploitation of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements in WSN is proposed. The proposed system is designed in particular for WSNs that are deployed in close proximity and can transmit data at a high transmission rate. The close proximity and an optimized transmit power level enable accurate conversion of RSSI measurements to range estimates. Having an adequate transmission rate enables spatial-temporal correlation between consecutive RSSI measurements. In addition, advanced statistical and signal processing methods are used to mitigate channel distortion and to compensate for packet loss. The system is evaluated in indoor conditions and achieves tracking resolution of a few centimeters which is compatible with theoretical bounds.", "paper_title": "Enhancing RSSI-Based Tracking Accuracy in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000323705400002"}
