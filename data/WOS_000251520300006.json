The particle swarm optimization (PSO), as it is called now, does not require any gradient information of the function to be optimized, uses only primitive mathematical operators and is conceptually very simple. This paper investigates a novel approach to the designing of two-dimensional zero phase infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filters using the PSO algorithm. The design task is reformulated as a constrained minimization problem and is solved by a modified PSO algorithm. Numerical results are presented. The paper also demonstrates the superiority of the proposed design method by comparing it with two recently published filter design methods and two other state of the art optimization techniques.
