In this article we prove a uniformly computable version of this theorem for computably locally compact computable Hausdorff spaces X. We introduce a representation of the positive linear functionals I on K(X) and a representation of the Borel measures on X and prove that for every such functional I a measure mu can be computed and vice versa such that I(f) = integral f d mu.", "paper_title": "Computable Riesz Representation for locally compact Hausdorff spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000257026200003"}
