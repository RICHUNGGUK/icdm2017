However, critical problems such as limited frequency resources, interference, noise and channel fading, make it difficult to improve the throughput of WMNs. Current routing schemes based on network coding either passively wait for potential coding opportunities or fail to reflect the essence of wireless interference. Therefore, a novel Coding and Interference Aware Routing (CIAR) protocol is proposed in this paper, which not only actively detects potential coding opportunities in establishing paths but also takes into account the interference cost in path selection. The CIAR protocol can well make the tradeoffs for routing choices between facilitating more coding gains and mitigating interference. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed CIAR protocol performs better than traditional schemes in terms of average end-to-end throughput, average end-to-end delay and buffer overflow probability.
