Previous studies reported that the new procedure is as powerful as conventional solutions and generally more robust (i.e., insensitive) to violations of assumptions that underlie conventional solutions. The program also included a step-wise procedure based on the Bonferroni inequality to test comparisons among the repeated measurements. Both univariate and multivariate repeated measures data can be analyzed. Finally, the application of the SAS/IML program is illustrated with a numeric example. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
