To this end, we propose a robust face detection approach by combining multiple experts in both cascade and parallel manner. We design three detection experts which employ different feature representation schemes of local images: 2D Haar wavelet, gradient direction, and Gabor filter. The three features are classified using the same classification model, namely, a polynomial neural network (PNN) on reduced feature subspace. The detection experts are used in multiple stages with simple ones in proceeding stages and complex ones in succeeding stages for improving detection speed. Meanwhile, the output of each expert is combined with the outputs of its preceding experts to improve detection accuracy. The effectiveness of the multi-expert approach has been demonstrated in experiments on a large number of images. The obtained detection results are superior to the best individual expert and state-of-the-art approaches while the detection speed is fast. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society.
