The goal of this work is to propose a flexible event recognition system that can be used without relying on a long-term explicit tracking procedure. It is composed of three stages. The first one aims at defining and building a set of relevant features describing the shape and movements of the foreground objects in the scene. To this aim, we introduce new motion descriptors based on space-time volumes. Second, an unsupervised learning-based method is used to cluster the objects, thereby defining a set of coarse to fine local patterns of features, representing primitive events in the video sequences. Finally, events are modeled as a spatio-temporal organization of patterns based on an ensemble of randomized trees. In particular, we want this classifier to discover the temporal and causal correlations between the most discriminative patterns. Our system is experimented and validated both on simulated and real-life data.", "paper_title": "Visual event recognition using decision trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000279198900006"}
