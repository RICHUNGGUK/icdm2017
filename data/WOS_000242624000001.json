To this end, tools such as finite projective spaces and their algebraic varieties are employed. More precisely, in a first step an abstract construction, called t-lifting, is developed. It starts from a set X containing a t-DD and a group G acting on X. Then several explicit examples are given, where X is a subset of PG(n,q) and G is a subgroup of GL(n +1)(q). In some cases X is obtained from a cone with a Veronesean or an h-sphere as its basis. In other examples, X arises from a projective embedding of a Witt design. As a result, for any integer t >= 2 infinitely many non-isomorphic t-DDs are found.", "paper_title": "Lifting of divisible designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000242624000001"}
