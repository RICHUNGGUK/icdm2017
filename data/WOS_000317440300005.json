It is shown that the best estimate of d is obtained when S ( f, g) is postmultiplied by a diagonal matrix Q that is derived from the vectors that lie in the null space of S(f, g), where the correct value of d is defined as the degree of the greatest common divisor of the exact polynomials (f) over cap (y) and (g) over cap (y). The computed value of d is improved further by preprocessing f (y) and g(y), and examples of the computation of d using S(f, g), S(f, g)Q and B(f, g) are presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
