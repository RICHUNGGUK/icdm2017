Although many studies have addressed the problem of pathological RS classification, only a limited number of scientific works have focused in multi-scale analysis. This paper proposes a new signal classification scheme for various types of RS based on multi-scale principal component analysis as a signal enhancement and feature extraction method to capture major variability of Fourier power spectra of the signal. Since we classify RS signals in a high dimensional feature subspace, a new classification method, called empirical classification, is developed for further signal dimension reduction in the classification step and has been shown to be more robust and outperform other simple classifiers. An overall accuracy of 98.34 % for the classification of 689 real RS recording segments shows the promising performance of the presented method.", "paper_title": "Signal feature extraction by multi-scale PCA and its application to respiratory sound classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000305683500012"}
