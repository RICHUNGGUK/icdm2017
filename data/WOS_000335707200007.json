Aftermath of underground gas explosion on the bumps appearance at its early stage will be discussed. Discrete element method - hexagonal particles - is used in combination with boundary elements involving dynamical effects is the numerical tool for describing this phenomenon. Eigenparameters simulate the explosion. Some numerical examples show the ability of the method for applications to practice. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
