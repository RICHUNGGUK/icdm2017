The cost functions are job dependent and asymmetric. The problem consists of two sub-problems. The first one is to find a sequence of jobs and the second one is to find the job completion times that are optimal for the given sequence. We consider the second sub-problem and propose an algorithm solving the problem in O(n log n) time. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
