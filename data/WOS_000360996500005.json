A unified model consisting of a linear delayed dynamic system and a bounded static nonlinear operator is introduced, which covers most of the nonlinear systems with bounded nonlinear terms, such as the one-link robotic manipulator, chaotic systems, complex networks, the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), and the standard genetic regulatory network (SGRN). First, the definition of the tracking control is given. Second, the H (a) performance analysis of the closed-loop system including this unified model, reference model, and state feedback controller is presented. Then criteria on the tracking controller design are derived in terms of LMIs such that the output of the closed-loop system tracks the given reference signal in the H (a) sense. The reference model adopted here is modified to be more flexible. A scaling factor is introduced to deal with the disturbance such that the control precision is improved. Finally, a CSTR system is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the established control laws.", "paper_title": "H (a) reference tracking control design for a class of nonlinear systems with time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000360996500005"}
