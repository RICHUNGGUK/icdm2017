We evaluate the performances of Passive Optical Networks using different transmitted powers. To highlight the problem and analyze imperfect power, we propose a new approach based on technical issues of two transmitter groups. These groups correspond to high and low multiple access interference issued from different power classes. A compensation factor is added to the linear parallel interference cancelation structure to improve channel propagation errors. Transmission errors are evaluated analytically and by simulation, considering synchronous and asynchronous cases. The error probabilities of the proposed optical code division multiple access system are estimated using Gaussian approximation. We show that the optimization of the compensation factor gives better performances in terms of bit error rate than other classical receivers. It also shows that this approach on the one hand, overcomes the problem of multiple services in a network source optical code division multiple access and on the other hand, it avoids the imperfect power effects for different users.
