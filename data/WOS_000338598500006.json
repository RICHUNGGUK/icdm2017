Since the introduction of Multi-Hop Identity-Based PRE (MH-IBPRE) by Green and Ateniese, the ciphertext size and the decryption complexity grow linearly in the number of re-encryption \"hops\". In this paper, for the first time, we propose an MH-IBPRE that maintains the (constant) ciphertext size and computational complexity regardless of the number of re-encryption hops. Moreover, our scheme is bidirectional and also supports conditional re-encryption. The scheme is proven secure against selective identity and chosen-ciphertext attacks and collusion resistant in the standard model. As of independent interest, we also show that the conditional re-encryption can also be extended to a set of conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
