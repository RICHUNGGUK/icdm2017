Over the past years, many three-party authenticated key exchange protocols have been proposed. However, to our best knowledge, not all of them can meet the requirements of security and efficiency simultaneously. Therefore, in this paper, we would like to propose a new simple three-party password based authenticated key exchange protocol. Compared with other existing protocols, our proposed protocol does not require any server's public key, but can resist against various known attacks. Therefore, we believe it is suitable for some practical scenarios. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
