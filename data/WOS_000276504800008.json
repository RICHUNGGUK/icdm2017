Design/methodology/approach - The literature of comedy, newspaper coverage of comedy in the UK in 2008, observation of comedians in performance, and a small, informal interview programme with stand up comedians were used in the preparation of the paper. Findings - Stand up comedians, despite their own sense that they defy restriction and popular perception of their material as often offensive, do monitor their material for potential offence. They assess the extent of offence and modify their performances in response. In some cases they apply personal formulae to this process. Research limitations/implications - The interview programme is too small to claim to be fully representative and is intended only to give an indicative view of the field. Practical implications - Examination of comedians' practice has implications for information service institutions and the giving of access to potentially offensive content. Originality/value - The paper may be the first study of comedy in an information science context and it contains implications for further studies that use comedy as an example of content, and creative practice to further develop understanding of information provision issues.", "paper_title": "Comedy as freedom of expression", "paper_id": "WOS:000276504800008"}
