For a complex sequence of length we define the -compressed sequence of length whose terms are the sums . We prove that the -compression of a complementary collection of sequences is also complementary. The compression procedure can be used to simplify the construction of complementary -sequences of composite length. In particular, we construct several supplementary difference sets with even and , given here for the first time. There are 15 normalized parameter sets with for which the existence question was open. We resolve all but one of these cases.", "paper_title": "Compression of periodic complementary sequences and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000348340600005"}
