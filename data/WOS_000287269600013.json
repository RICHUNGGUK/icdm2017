In this paper, we propose an ideal linear multi-secret sharing scheme, based on monotone span programs, where each subset of the set of participants may have the associated secret. Our scheme can be used to meet the security requirement in practical applications, such as secure group communication and privacy preserving data mining etc. We also prove that our proposed scheme satisfies the definition of a perfect multi-secret sharing scheme.
