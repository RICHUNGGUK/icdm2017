A comprehensive analytical derivation is presented with regards to electrical properties of such a resistor standard in comparison to other standards. In addition, an error analysis is detailed, which reveals correlations of characteristic parameters in connection with equivalent circuit model development from the conversions from field-based S-parameters to circuit-based Y- or Z-parameters. Interesting properties and criteria are derived, allowing accurate parameter extractions. To validate the proposed numerical TRL calibration procedure with this new resistor standard concept and the developed error analysis, the characteristic impedance of a microstrip line is extracted from a commercial software. In addition, a further example with microstrip discontinuity is shown and the effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified.
