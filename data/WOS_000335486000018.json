The graph matching problem is firstly formulated as a constrained convex quadratic program by relaxing the feasible set from the permutation matrices to doubly stochastic matrices. To gradually push the doubly stochastic matrix back to be a permutation one, an objective function is constructed by adding a simple weighted concave regularization to the convex relaxation. By gradually increasing the weight of the concave term, minimization of the objective function will gradually push the doubly stochastic matrix back to be a permutation one. A concave-convex procedure (CCCP) together with the Frank-Wolfe algorithm is adopted to minimize the objective function. The algorithm can be used on any types of graphs and exhibits a comparable performance as the PATH following algorithm, a state-of-the-art graph matching algorithm but applicable only on undirected graphs.
