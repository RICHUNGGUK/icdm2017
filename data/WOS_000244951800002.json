A first prototype alloy has achieved property goals motivated by projected naval hull applications requiring extreme fracture toughness (C-v > 85 ft-lbs or 115 J corresponding to K-Id >= N 200 ksi.in(1/2) or 220 MPa.m(1/2)) at strength levels of 150-180 ksi (1,030-1,240 MPa) yield strength in weldable, formable plate steels. A continuous casting process was simulated by slab casting the prototype alloy as a 1.75'' (4.45 cm) plate. Consistent with predictions, compositional banding in the plate was limited to an amplitude of 6-7.5 wt% Ni and 3.5-5 wt% Cu. Examination of the oxide scale showed no evidence of hot shortness in the alloy during hot working. Isothermal transformation kinetics measurements demonstrated achievement of 50% bainite in 4 min at 360 degrees C. Hardness and tensile tests confirmed predicted precipitation strengthening behavior in quench and tempered material. Multi-step tempering conditions were employed to achieve the optimal austenite stability resulting in significant increase of impact toughness to 130 ft-lb (176 J) at a strength level of 160 ksi (1,100 MPa). Comparison with the baseline toughness-strength combination determined by isochronal tempering studies indicates a transformation toughening increment of 65% in Charpy energy. Predicted Cu particle number densities and the heterogeneous nucleation of optimal stability high Ni 5 nm austenite on nanometer-scale copper precipitates in the multi-step tempered samples was confirmed using three-dimensional atom probe microanalysis. Charpy impact tests and fractography demonstrate ductile fracture with C-v > 80 ft-lbs (108 J) down to -40 degrees C, with a substantial toughness peak at 25 degrees C consistent with designed transformation toughening behavior. The properties demonstrated in this first prototype represent a substantial advance over existing naval hull steels. Achieving these improvements in a single design and prototyping iteration is a significant advance in computational materials design capability.", "paper_title": "Prototype evaluation of transformation toughened blast resistant naval hull steels: Part II", "paper_id": "WOS:000244951800002"}
