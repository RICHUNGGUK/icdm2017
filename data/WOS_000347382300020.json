Sensor and actuator networks connect communication machines and devices so that they automatically transmit information, serving the growing demand for environmental data acquisition. The IEEE 802.11ah Task Group is working on a new standard to address the particular requirements of M2M networks: a large number of power-constrained stations; a long transmission range; small and infrequent data messages; low data rates; and a non-critical delay. This article explores the key features of this new standard, especially those related to the reduction of energy consumption in the medium access control layer. Given these requirements, a performance assessment of IEEE 802.11ah in four common M2M scenarios, i.e. agriculture monitoring, smart metering, industrial automation, and animal monitoring, is presented.", "paper_title": "IEEE 802.11AH: THE WIFI APPROACH FOR M2M COMMUNICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000347382300020"}
