The main idea of this load-balancing algorithm is based on the exploitation of the usual characteristics of these simulations, that is, cyclicity and predictability, to obtain a good load balance while preserving the locality of references. This algorithm is useful not only in the area of logic circuit simulation but also in systems presenting a cyclic execution pattern, that is, repetition over time, making the future behavior of the tasks predictable. An example of this is Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES), where several tasks are repeatedly executed in response to certain events. A comparison between the proposed algorithm and other load-balancing algorithms found in the literature reveals consistently better execution times with improvements in both load-balancing and locality of references that can be of help on current multicore desktop computers.", "paper_title": "CYCLIC: A LOCALITY-PRESERVING LOAD-BALANCING ALGORITHM FOR PDES ON SHARED MEMORY MULTIPROCESSORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000313087700007"}
