Erdos proved that the answer is Theta( n). We consider the analogous problem in three dimensions, and prove that the maximum number of points in the n x n x n grid with no three collinear is Theta(n(2)). This result is generalised by the notion of a 3D drawing of a graph. Here each vertex is represented by a distinct gridpoint in Z(3), such that the line-segment representing each edge does not intersect any vertex, except for its own endpoints. Note that edges may cross. A 3D drawing of a complete graph K-n is nothing more than a set of n gridpoints with no three collinear. A slight generalisation of our first result is that the minimum volume for a 3D drawing of K-n is Theta(n(3/2)). This compares favourably with Theta(n(3)) when edges are not allowed to cross. Generalising the construction for K-n, we prove that every k-colourable graph on n vertices has a 3D drawing with O(n root k) volume, which is optimal for the k-partite Turan graph.", "paper_title": "No-three-in-line-in-3D", "paper_id": "WOS:000245123200010"}
