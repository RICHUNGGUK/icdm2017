The scope of these tools is limited to local administrative domains. With such limited information, it is difficult to make accurate spam control decisions. We observe that sending servers process more information on their outgoing e-mail traffic than receiving servers do on their incoming traffic. Better spam control can be achieved if e-mail servers collaborate with one another by checking both outgoing and incoming traffic. However, the control of outgoing traffic provides little direct benefit to the sending server. Servers in different administrative domains presently have little incentive to improve spam control on other receiving servers, which hampers a move toward cross-domain collaboration. We propose a collaborative framework in which spam control decisions are drawn from the data aggregated within a group of e-mail servers across different administrative domains. The collaboration provides incentive for outgoing spam control. The servers that contribute to the control of outgoing spam are rewarded, while traffic restriction is imposed on the irresponsible servers. A Federated Security Context (FSC) is established to enable transparent negotiation of multilateral decisions among the group of collaborators without common trust. Information from trusted collaborators counts more for one's final decision compared to information from untrustworthy servers. The FSC mitigates potential threats of fake information from malicious servers. The collaborative approach to spam control is more efficient than a decision in isolation, providing dynamic identification and adaptive restriction to spam generators.", "paper_title": "Multilateral decisions for collaborative defense against unsolicited bulk e-mail", "paper_id": "WOS:000238108800007"}
