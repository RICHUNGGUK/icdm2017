The hardware model first generates a correlated Rayleigh fading variate sequence and then transforms it into a sequence of Nakagami-m or Weibull fading variates. A biquad processor facilitates the compact implementation of a Rayleigh variate generator with arbitrary autocorrelation properties. A combination of logarithmic and linear domain segmentations along with piece-wise linear approximations is used to accurately implement the nonlinear numerical functions required to transform the correlated Rayleigh fading process into Nakagami-m or Weibull fading processes. When implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-5 5VSX240TFF1738-2 FPGA, the fading simulator uses only 1.6% of the configurable slices, 1.2% of the DSP48E modules and 3 block memories, while operating at 120 MHz, generating 120 million complex variates per second. The throughput can be increased up to 373 MHz with this FPGA if two separate clock sources are utilized.", "paper_title": "Hardware Implementation of Nakagami and Weibull Variate Generators", "paper_id": "WOS:000305181800011"}
