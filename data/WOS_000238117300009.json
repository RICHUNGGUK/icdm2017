In this article, we present a hybrid column generation and constraint programming solution approach. This approach can be used to quickly produce solutions for operations management, and also to produce close-to-optimal solutions for long and mid term planning scenarios. We present computational results which illustrate the practical usefulness of the approach.", "paper_title": "A hybrid column generation and constraint programming optimizer for the Tail Assignment problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000238117300009"}
