This system can generate strange and interesting attractors. Some basic dynamical properties, such as bifurcations, and chaotic behaviors of the new chaotic system are investigated analytically and numerically. We propose a nonlinear control scheme to discuss codimension 1 and 2 Hopf bifurcations. In addition, a new circuit implementation of the chaotic attractor is reported and examined in PSpice. The new system is suitable for purposefully generating chaos in chaos-based engineering applications.", "paper_title": "Analysis, nonlinear control, and chaos generator circuit of another strange chaotic system", "paper_id": "WOS:000322741500001"}
