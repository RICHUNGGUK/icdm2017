A low complexity algorithm based on a limited search algorithm, which reduces the average number of the add-compare-select computation of the Viterbi algorithm, is proposed and seamlessly integrated with the SST-based decoder. The new decoding scheme has low overhead and facilitates low-power implementation for high throughput applications. We also propose an uneven-partitioned memory architecture for the trace-back survivor memory unit to reduce the overall memory access power. The new Viterbi decoder is designed and implemented in TSMC 0.18-mu m CMOS process. Simulation results show that power consumption is reduced by up to 80% for high throughput wireless systems such as Multiband-OFDM Ultra-wideband applications.", "paper_title": "Low-power limited-search parallel state Viterbi decoder implementation based on scarce state transition", "paper_id": "WOS:000249740800012"}
