It can be used for various purposes such as finding a cover in a graph, chemical structural computations, multi-level graph partitioning and so on. When a graph is too large to be handled by a single machine, we should use multiple machines. In this paper, we use Pregel, a cloud graph processing architecture which is able to process massive scale graph data in scalable and fault-tolerant ways. We propose a parallel maximal matching algorithm described in the Pregel's vertex-centric BSP model. We test our algorithm on an 8 node cluster and the results show that our algorithm can realize high quality matching for a large graph in a short time. Also, our algorithm is linearly scalable with the number of machines.", "paper_title": "A Parallel Maximal Matching Algorithm for Large Graphs Using Pregel", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784400026"}
