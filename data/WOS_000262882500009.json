At lower level the alternatives are evaluated based on the route and mode user decisions. The optimization objectives are to maximize the transit demand and minimize the private travel time, considering the user's behavior, the physical network, budget constraints and the network design constraints. The design criteria are considered as location constraints, they have been traditionally defined by node and link compatibilities defining lines, but we define a new location constraints based in to minimize the number of routing intersections. The demand mode splitting constraints may be defined by all or nothing mode assignment or like it is proposed by us in this paper by Logit distribution. The models defined with the above alternatives are large integer multicommodity flow network design problems with side constraints. These sets of alternatives are computationally studied to obtain conclusions. The experiments are presented using two networks, a small network and a medium size network. simulating the city of Seville. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
