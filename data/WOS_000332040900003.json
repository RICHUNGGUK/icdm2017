This work performs a detailed investigation of the applicability of unorganized architectures to the problem of seasonal streamflow series forecasting, considering scenarios associated with four Brazilian hydroelectric plants and four distinct prediction horizons. Experimental results indicate the pertinence of these models to the focused task.", "paper_title": "UNORGANIZED MACHINES FOR SEASONAL STREAMFLOW SERIES FORECASTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000332040900003"}
