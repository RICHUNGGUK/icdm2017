In this article, we discuss some of the new benefits and challenges of the emerging computational chemogenomics paradigm, particularly with respect to compound-protein interaction. Examples of experimentally validated computational predictions and recent trends in molecular feature extraction are presented. In addition, analyses of cross-family interactions are considered. We also discuss the expected role of computational chemogenomics in contributing to increasingly expansive network-level modeling and screening projects.", "paper_title": "Compound-Protein Interaction Prediction Within Chemogenomics: Theoretical Concepts, Practical Usage, and Future Directions", "paper_id": "WOS:000330109500004"}
