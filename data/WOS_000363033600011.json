By decomposing the problem into two sub-problems, we develop effective heuristic algorithms to solve the problem. We test the proposed algorithms on randomly generated instances as well as real data set from a large hospital. The numerical results show the effectiveness and potential practical value of the models and the algorithms.", "paper_title": "Resource-constrained machine scheduling with machine eligibility restriction and its applications to surgical operations scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000363033600011"}
