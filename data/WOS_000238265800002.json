The oscillatory motion of the fluid in the channel is driven by a periodic pressure gradient. The model adopted in this study is the coupled lattice Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model. Pressure boundary condition is used in the inlet and outlet boundaries, and extrapolation scheme is used in the solid boundaries. The dependence of the flow and heat transfer characteristics on different Womersley numbers and the amplitudes of the pressure gradient are presented. Results are consistent with those from previous numerical simulations and theoretical analyses.", "paper_title": "Simulation of two-dimensional oscillating flow using the lattice Boltzmann method", "paper_id": "WOS:000238265800002"}
