However, such a set of balls may not be optimal: subsets of the medial axis may exist without changing the reversivility of the input shape representation. In this article, we first prove that finding a minimum medial axis is an NP-hard problem for the Euclidean distance. Then, we compare two algorithms which compute an approximation of the minimum medial axis, one of them providing bounded approximation results. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
