In this paper, we seek to determine analytically the conditions under which this observation is true, not only for spatial ICA, but also for temporal ICA and for principal component analysis (PCA). In each case, we find conditions that the spatial alignment operator must satisfy to ensure invariance of the results. We illustrate our findings using functional magnetic-resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Our analysis is applicable to both intersubject and intrasubject spatial normalization.", "paper_title": "Effect of spatial alignment transformations in PCA and ICA of functional neuroimages", "paper_id": "WOS:000248562200004"}
