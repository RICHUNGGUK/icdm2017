The complete dynamic model of such a manipulator is easily established using the Lagrange's equation and MATHEMATICA. The structural properties of the overall system along with its subsystems are also well investigated and then exploited in further controller synthesis. The derived model is shown valid by reducing it to agree well with the mobile platform model. In order to solve the path tracking control problem of the wheeled mobile manipulator, a novel kinematic control scheme is proposed to deal with the nonholonomic constraints. With the backstepping technique and the filtered-error method, the nonlinear tracking control laws for the mobile manipulator system are constructed based on the Lyapunov stability theory. The proposed control scheme not only achieves simultaneous trajectory and velocity tracking, but also compensates for the dynamic interactions caused by the motions of the mobile platform and the two onboard manipulators. Simulation results are performed to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed control strategy.", "paper_title": "Dynamic modeling and tracking control of a nonholonomic wheeled mobile manipulator with dual arms", "paper_id": "WOS:000243284200002"}
