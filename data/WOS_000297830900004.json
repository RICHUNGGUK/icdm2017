More specifically, one usually uses machine learning (ML) techniques to build, from cancer gene expression data, automatic diagnosis models (classifiers). Cancer gene expression data often present some characteristics that can have a negative impact in the generalization ability of the classifiers generated. Some of these properties are data sparsity and an unbalanced class distribution. We investigate the results of a set of indices able to extract the intrinsic complexity information from the data. Such measures can be used to analyze, among other things, which particular characteristics of cancer gene expression data mostly impact the prediction ability of support vector machine classifiers. In this context, we also show that, by applying a proper feature selection procedure to the data, one can reduce the influence of those characteristics in the error rates of the classifiers induced.
