This improves on the previous o*((l + 2)(n))-time algorithm by Kral (2005) [1], as well as algorithms for important special cases, like L(2, 1)-labeling. For the latter problem, our algorithm works in 0*(3(n)) time. The progress is achieved by applying the fast zeta transform in combination with the inclusion-exclusion principle.
