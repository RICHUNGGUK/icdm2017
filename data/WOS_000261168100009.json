It turns out that the maximal violations have a decelerating increase as the dimension increases and tend to a finite value at infinity. The numerical values are given out up to d = 10(6) for positively maximal violations and d = 2 x 10(5) for negatively maximal violations. Counterintuitively, the negatively maximal violations tend to be a little stronger than the positively maximal violations. Further we show the states corresponding to these maximal violations and compare them with the maximally entangled states by utilizing entangled degree defined by von Neumann entropy. It shows that their entangled degree tends to some nonmaximal value as the dimension increases.", "paper_title": "MAXIMAL QUANTUM VIOLATION OF THE CGLMP INEQUALITY ON ITS BOTH SIDES", "paper_id": "WOS:000261168100009"}
