Compound class-specific descriptor value range patterns that accurately distinguish bioactive conformations from other low-energy conformers were identified for all 18 compound classes. Discriminatory patterns were often chemically intuitive and could be well rationalized on the basis of X-ray structures of the protein-ligand complexes. Target-specific descriptor patterns can be used as filters to screen conformational ensembles for bioactive conformations.", "paper_title": "Distinguishing between bioactive and modeled compound conformations through mining of emerging chemical patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000259398500002"}
