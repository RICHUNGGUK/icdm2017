The proposed controller synthesis differs from the conventional quadratic stabilization based on Lyapunov criterion and is based on the computation of the system's trajectory. In this paper, we show a LMI-based design method of the observer-based robust controller. The effectiveness of the proposed controller design approach is presented through a simple numerical example.", "paper_title": "Observer-Based Robust Stabilizing Controllers Based on the Trajectory for Polytopic Uncertain Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000279250100033"}
