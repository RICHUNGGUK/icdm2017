Properties of pseudo-primitive words are investigated in this paper. These properties link pseudo-primitive words with essential notions in combinatorics on words such as primitive words, (pseudo)-palindromes, and (pseudo)-commutativity. Their applications include an improved solution to the extended Lyndon-Schutzenberger equation u(1) u(2) ... u(l) = v(1) ... v(n) w(1) ... w(m), where u(1),..., u(l) is an element of {u, theta(u)}, v(1),..., v(n) is an element of (v, theta(v)}, and w(1),..., w(m) is an element of {w, theta(w)} for some words u, v, w, integers l,n,m >= 2, and an antimorphic involution theta. We prove that for l >= 4, n, m >= 3, this equation implies that u, v, w can be expressed in terms of a common word t and its image theta(t). Moreover, several cases of this equation where l = 3 are examined.", "paper_title": "PROPERTIES OF PSEUDO-PRIMITIVE WORDS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287762800012"}
