The resulting system of nonlinear and fully coupled similarity equations are integrated accurately by a finite difference scheme and by the Keller-box method. is observed that slip has a prominent effect on the velocity field, reducing drastically the axial velocity and the pressure. Moreover, the torque required to maintain the disk at rest decreases for increasing values of slip. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
