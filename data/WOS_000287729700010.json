In this study, a PM activity is imperfect in that a production system cannot be recovered as good as new and might cause the production system to shift to the out-of-control state with a certain probability. Numerical analyses are used to simulate the effect of changes in various parameters on the optimal solution for which the time that the process remains in the in-control state is assumed to follow a Weibull distribution. In addition, we investigate the effects of inspection errors and PM errors on the minimum total cost of the optimal inspection interval, inspection frequency and production quantity.
