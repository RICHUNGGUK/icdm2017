The logic combines the main features of decision logic (DL) and arrow logic (AL). DL represents and reasons about knowledge extracted from decision tables based on rough set theory, whereas AL is the basic modal logic of arrows. The semantic models of DL are functional information systems (FIS). ADL formulas, on the other hand, are interpreted in RIS. RIS, which not only specifies the properties of objects, but also the relationships between objects. We present a complete axiomatization of ADL and discuss its application to knowledge representation in multicriteria decision analysis.", "paper_title": "Arrow decision logic for relational information systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242418100012"}
