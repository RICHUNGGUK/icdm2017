In general, a user may expect a quick response that also satisfies her personalized requirements. Unfortunately, since there exist a huge number of users and massive updating microblogs in a microblogging system, personalized search on the system becomes a challenging task. In this paper, we design a new search engine containing four modules to infer the topics of microblogs and update the interests of users, build indexes efficiently, return microblogs for a keyword search, and personalize the order of microblogs, respectively. We also conduct a series of experiments on a real dataset to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Real-time and Personalized Search over a Microblogging System", "paper_id": "WOS:000342922700002"}
