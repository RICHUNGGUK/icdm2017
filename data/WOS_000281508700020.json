VOCs provide customized, homogeneous execution environments on a per-Virtual Organization basis, without the cost of physical cluster construction or the overhead of per-job containers. Administrative access and overlay network capabilities are granted to Virtual Organizations (VOs) that choose to implement VOC technology, while the system remains completely transparent to end users and non-participating VOs. Unlike existing systems that require explicit leases, VOCs are autonomically self-provisioned and self-managed according to configurable usage policies. The work presented here contains two parts: a technology-agnostic formal model that describes the properties of VOCs and a prototype implementation of a physical cluster with hosted VOCs, based on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. Test results demonstrate the feasibility of VOCs for use with high-throughput grid computing jobs. With the addition of a \"watchdog\" daemon for monitoring scheduler queues and adjusting VOC size, the results also demonstrate that cloud computing environments can be autonomically self-provisioned in response to changing workload conditions.
