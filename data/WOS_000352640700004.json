Most of concepts in data-oriented theory are modeled as problem-solution data structure. In this paper for suitable management these kinds of data structures, a special content addressable memory with fast access is designed which is named Midpoint memory.", "paper_title": "Midpoint Memory: A Special Memory Structure for Data-Oriented Models Implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000352640700004"}
