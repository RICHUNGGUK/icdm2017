However, very little research has been conducted to investigate knowledge sharing in supply chain management, especially inter-organizational knowledge integration from the technological or system perspectives. In the current study, we fill the gap in the literature by analyzing the characteristics and requirements of knowledge sharing in supply chains and proposing new knowledge sharing methods based on semantic web technology. We extend RDF/OWL for representing knowledge and design a query language based on this representing method. We also provide automatic combinatorial query and results integration functions to search the relevant knowledge distributed in supply chain and integrate heterogeneous knowledge from, multiple entities based on semantic reasoning and transformation.", "paper_title": "AN IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH OF KNOWLEDGE SHARING AND INTEGRATION IN SUPPLY CHAINS", "paper_id": "WOS:000285273700026"}
