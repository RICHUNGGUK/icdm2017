In case of shading, PV cells may experience a dramatic temperature increase, with consequent reduction of the provided power. Our model has been validated against experimental data, and has highlighted a counterintuitive PV cell behavior, that should be considered to improve the energy efficiency of PV arrays. Then, we propose a hotspot detection scheme, enabling to identify the PV module that is under hotspot condition. Such a scheme can be used to avoid the permanent damage of the cells under hotspot, thus their drawback on the power efficiency of the entire PV system.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Detection of Hotspot in Shaded Photovoltaic Cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000355218000004"}
