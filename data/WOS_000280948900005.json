A location estimation scheme using fuzzy-based Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) smoother is proposed in this paper. It combines the time-of-arrival (TOA) and the received signal strength (RSS) measurements to achieve high location accuracy. The fuzzy technique is used to interpolate several linear equations to approximate the nonlinear RSS measurement. The IMM is employed as a switch between the line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) states which are considered to be a Markov process with two interactive modes. By integrating the fuzzy filtering and the IMM method for range estimation between the corresponding base station (BS) and mobile station (MS), the proposed robust scheme, in association with data fusion, can efficiently mitigate the NLOS effects on the measurement range error. Simulation results are given to confirm the performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Mobile Location Estimation Using Fuzzy-Based IMM and Data Fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000280948900005"}
