Supersaturated design is shown to be helpful for such a critical first step. A general construction method for mixed-level supersaturated design is proposed. The newly constructed design has several advantages, including the flexibility for the number of runs and the assurance of upper bound of the (pairwise) dependency among all design columns. Specific applications to the construction of two-level and three-level mixed-level designs are discussed in detail. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.
