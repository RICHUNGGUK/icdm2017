In contrast with the traditional noise detection techniques where only I-D statistical information is used for noise detection and estimation, a novel noise detection method is proposed based on geometric characteristics and features (i.e., the 2-D information) of the corrupted pixel or the pixel region, leading to effective and efficient noise detection and estimation outcomes. A progressive restoration mechanism is devised using multipass nonlinear operations which adapt to the intensity and the types of the noise. Extensive experiments conducted using a wide range of test color images have shown that the AGFF is superior to a number of existing well-known benchmark techniques, in terms of standard image restoration performance criteria, including objective measurements, the visual image quality, and the computational complexity.", "paper_title": "Geometric Features-Based Filtering for Suppression of Impulse Noise in Color Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000268033300005"}
