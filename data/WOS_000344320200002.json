We focus on the sensing problem, the question of whether the heart has produced a spontaneous heartbeat or not. This question is plagued by uncertainties arising from the often unpredictable environment that a real pacemaker finds itself in. We develop a time domain tracking approach to this problem, as a complement to the usual frequency domain approach most frequently used. We develop our case study in the continuous ASM (Abstract State Machine) formalism, which is briefly summarised, through a series of refinement and retrenchment steps, each adding new levels of complexity to the model.", "paper_title": "A Continuous ASM Modelling Approach to Pacemaker Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000344320200002"}
