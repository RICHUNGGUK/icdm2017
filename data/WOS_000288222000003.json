The task becomes more difficult if features interact with each other, in which case the feature precedence information may suggest multiple machining sequences of the features. This paper considers interacting features in a feature-based model for process planning tasks. For each feature, precedence information is generated considering both roughing and finishing operations. A rule-based system is developed and implemented based on the information about machining precedence of the interacting features. The STEP-NC data model is used as the underlying data model. This model is object-oriented and compliant with the existing STEP standards. The output of the system is also in the STEP format through an information model developed using the EXPRESS language.", "paper_title": "Machining precedence of 21/2D interacting features in a feature-based data model", "paper_id": "WOS:000288222000003"}
