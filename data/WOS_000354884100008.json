Many opinion keywords carry varying polarities in different contexts, posing huge challenges for sentiment analysis research. Previous work on contextual polarity disambiguation makes use of term-level context, such as words and patterns, and resolves the polarity with a range of rule-based, statistics-based or machine learning methods. The major shortcoming of these methods lies in that the term-level features sometimes are ineffective in resolving the polarity. In this work, opinion-level context is explored, in which intra-opinion features and inter-opinion features are finely defined. To enable effective use of opinion-level features, the Bayesian model is adopted to resolve the polarity in a probabilistic manner. Experiments with the Opinmine corpus demonstrate that opinion-level features can make a significant contribution in word polarity disambiguation in four domains.", "paper_title": "Word Polarity Disambiguation Using Bayesian Model and Opinion-Level Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000354884100008"}
