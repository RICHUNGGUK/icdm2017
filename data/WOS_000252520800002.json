The flow field in the inlet header was obtained through the numerical solution of the governing partial differential equations including the conservation equations of mass and momentum in addition to the equations of the turbulence model. The results were obtained for different number of nozzles of 2-4, different inlet flow velocities of 1-2.5 m/s and different nozzle geometries in addition to incorporation of a second header. The results are presented in terms of mass flow rate distributions in the tubes of the heat exchanger and their standard deviations. The results indicate that the inlet flow velocity has insignificant influence on maldistribution while the nozzle geometry shape has a slight effect. Also, the results indicate that reducing the nozzle diameter results in an increase in the flow maldistribution. A 25% increase is obtained in the standard deviation as a result of decreasing the diameter by 25%. Increasing the number of nozzles has a significant influence on the maldistribution. A reduction of 62.5% in the standard deviation of the mass flow rate inside the tubes is achieved by increasing the number of nozzles from 2 to 4. The results indicate that incorporating a second header results in a significant reduction in the flow maldistribution. A 50% decrease in the standard deviation is achieved as a result of incorporation of a second header os seven holes. T is also found that the hole-diameter distribution at the exit of the second header has a slight influence on the flow maldistribution. Correlations of the flow maldistribution in terms of the investigated parameters are presented.
