In the first stage, the members of a group show their opinions on all the individuals of that group, regarding a specific attribute, by means of assessments within the unit interval. Taking into account this information, some aggregation operators and a family of thresholds, a subgroup of individuals is selected: Those members whose collective assessment reach a specific threshold. Now only the opinions of this qualified subgroup are taken into account, and a new subgroup emerges in the implementation of the aggregation phase. We analyze when this recursive procedure converges providing a final subgroup of qualified members, taking into account some extended ordered weighted averaging operators.
