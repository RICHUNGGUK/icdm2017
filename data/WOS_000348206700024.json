Although these approaches are shown to have superior performance to social-oblivious, stateless routing protocols (BinarySW, Epidemic), the improvement comes at the cost of considerable storage overhead required on the nodes. In this paper we present SANE, the first routing mechanism that combines the advantages of both social-aware and stateless approaches. SANE is based on the observation-that we validate on a real-world trace-that individuals with similar interests tend to meet more often. In SANE, individuals (network members) are characterized by their interest profile, a compact representation of their interests. By implementing a simple routing rule based on interest profile similarity, SANE is free of network state information, thus overcoming the storage capacity problem with existing social-aware approaches. Through thorough experiments, we show the superiority of SANE over existing approaches, both stateful, social-aware and stateless, social-oblivious. We discuss the statelessness of our approach in the supplementary file, which can be found on the Computer Society Digital Library at http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2307857, of this manuscript. Our interest-based approach easily enables innovative networking services, such as interest-casting. An interest-casting protocol is also introduced in this paper, and evaluated through experiments based on both real-world and synthetic mobility traces.", "paper_title": "Social-Aware Stateless Routing in Pocket Switched Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000348206700024"}
