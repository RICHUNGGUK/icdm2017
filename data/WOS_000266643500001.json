This has been particularly true in Shanghai, an urban area, occupying approximately the same area as New York or London. Here we report on our study of a social security smart card project developed and now operating in Shanghai. From the perspectives of modularity and societal learning, this case study demonstrates how localized e-government efforts may be implemented throughout the tiers of the municipal government, to present an e-government model that can be diffused to other parts of the country.
