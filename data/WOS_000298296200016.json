Packets are adaptively routed in the network according to congestion information, which makes the algorithm resilient to traffic and topology changes. However, the back-pressure algorithm requires routers to maintain a separate queue for each destination, which precludes its implementation in large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose a distributed cluster-based back-pressure routing algorithm that retains the adaptability of back-pressure routing while significantly reducing the number of queues that have to be maintained at each node.", "paper_title": "Cluster-Based Back-Pressure Routing Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000298296200016"}
