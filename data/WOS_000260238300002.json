Ideally, efficient schemes for maintaining consistency should take into account the following factors: lease duration of replicated data, data access pattern and system parameters. One method used to supply strong consistency in the web environment is the lease method. During the proxy's lease time from a web server, the web server can notify the modification to the proxy by invalidation or update. In this paper, we analyze lease protocol performance by the varying update/invalidation scheme, lease duration and read rates. By using these analyses, we can choose the adaptive lease time and proper protocol (invalidation or update scheme of the modification for each proxy in the web environment). As the number of proxies for web caching increases exponentially, a more efficient method for maintaining consistency needs to be designed. We also present three-tier hierarchies on which each group and node independently and aclaptively choose the proper lease time and protocol for each proxy cache. These classifications of the scheme make proxy caching adaptive to client access pattern and system parameters. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
