Different adjustment procedures are applied to raw radar estimates using gauge readings from a network of 12 raingauges. The stream flow is simulated for the 48.17 km(2) Molenbeek/Parkbeek catchment located in the Flemish region of Belgium based on a lumped conceptual model. Results showed that raw radar estimates can be greatly improved using adjustment procedures. The gauge-radar residuals however, remain large even after adjustments. The adjusted X-band radar estimates are observed to be better estimates than corresponding C-band estimates. Their application for stream flow simulation showed that raingauges and radars can simulate spatially more uniform winter storms with almost the same accuracy, whereas differences are more evident on summer events.", "paper_title": "Evaluating the accuracy of C- and X-band weather radars and their application for stream flow simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000326902800007"}
