The new scheme, abbreviated as DS, reproduces meticulously adequate repulsive forces to attenuate the interparticle penetration and thus stabilizes the calculations, even for highly deformed flows characterized by tensile stress states. By performing a set of simple two-phase flow simulations, we also show the inappropriateness of the simplified/anti-symmetric MPS pressure gradient models as they may result in predominant excessive repulsive forces and thus being unable to simulate the main flow features. The DS scheme is shown to provide physically sound and computationally stable simulations of such flows. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
