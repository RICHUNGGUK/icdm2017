Because general shredding operations generate mixed plastics of low value, a switching rule is needed rapidly to identify plastics for sortation by colour and type to increase plastics-to-plastics recycling value. The current paper develops a heuristic rule to determine the thresholds for a switching rule that reduces set-up time while managing queue space. Our recycling system is modelled as a multiclass queuing network in a simulation model. Results indicate that laser identification probe utilization, setups, and queue space are sensitive to the switching rule. Our work contributes important insights into the relationship between traffic intensity, setup time, and queue capacity, and generalizes to multiclass queuing systems in other applications.", "paper_title": "A switching rule for plastics identification in electronics recycling", "paper_id": "WOS:000258590000009"}
