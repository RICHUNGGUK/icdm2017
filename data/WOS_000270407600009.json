This kind of switch is considered with the aim to keep switch cost low by employing simple shared optical components and low-complexity space switching matrices. In particular, differentiation among classes of service in terms of loss performance for bufferless switches is addressed. The functionalities described refer to the high-speed multiservice networking context foreseeable for the future Internet. A switch control algorithm to manage service classes in a slotted multiplexing context is described. An analytical model to evaluate the loss probability of each class is developed and validated against a simulation and is used to prove the effectiveness of the quality-of-service approach. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme achieves basic class isolation as needed in core network optical packet switches.", "paper_title": "Loss Analysis of Multiple Service Classes in Shared-per-Wavelength Optical Packet Switches", "paper_id": "WOS:000270407600009"}
