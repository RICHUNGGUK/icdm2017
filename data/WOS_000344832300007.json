This methodology can be used as a decision support tool to help build an FFR identification model or other financial fraud or financial distress scenarios. The three stages of the proposed quantitative analysis approach are as follows: the data-preprocessing stage; the clustering stage, which uses an unsupervised neural network tool known as a growing hierarchical self-organizing map (GHSOM) to cluster sample observations into subgroups with hierarchical relationships; and the feature-extraction stage, which uncovers common features of each subgroup via principle component analysis. This study uses the hierarchal topology mapping ability of a GHSOM to cluster financial data, and it adopts principal component analysis to determine common embedded features and fraud patterns. The results show that the proposed three-stage approach is helpful in revealing embedded features and fraud patterns, using a set of significant explanatory financial indicators and the proportion of fraud. The revealed features can be used to distinguish distinctive groups.", "paper_title": "FEATURE EXTRACTION OF FRAUDULENT FINANCIAL REPORTING THROUGH UNSUPERVISED NEURAL NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000344832300007"}
