Addressing this issue, this paper presents the HCONE-merge approach, which is further extended towards automating the merging process. HCONE-merge makes use of the intended informal meaning of concepts by mapping them to WordNet senses using the Latent Semantic Indexing ( LSI) method. Based on these mappings and using the reasoning services of description logics, HCONE- merge automatically aligns and then merges ontologies. Since the mapping of concepts to their intended meaning is an essential step of the HCONE- merge approach, this paper explores the level of human involvement required for mapping concepts of the source ontologies to their intended meanings. We propose a series of methods for ontology mapping ( towards merging) with varying degrees of human involvement and evaluate them experimentally. We conclude that, although an effective fully automated process is not attainable, we can reach a point where ontology merging can be carried out efficiently with minimum human involvement.
