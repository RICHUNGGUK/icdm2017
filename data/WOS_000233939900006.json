The mobile stations (MSs) are dual-mode, having both ad hoc and cellular CDMA radios. An active MS is free to choose any available relay station (RS) within its ad hoc radio coverage area for dual-hop communication with the CDMA base station (BS). Communications between the RSs and the MSs use bandwidth which is available to the ad hoc radio and does not consume the CDMA capacity. Using this mechanism, CDMA interference can be reduced by dynamically selecting RSs which have more favorable CDMA link characteristics. Several relay station selection criteria are considered, namely, ad hoc relaying with low relative interference ( ARRI), with best link gain (ARLG), and with shortest distance (ARSD). The relay station selection protocols are compatible with existing wireless local area network (WLAN) standards such as IEEE 802.11. An analytic model is used to compute the effects on uplink and downlink CDMA capacities when out-of-band relaying is added. The results show that very significant capacity improvements are possible by using these criteria compared with conventional CDMA with hard or soft handoff. Ad hoc relaying which dynamically tracks CDMA link quality can achieve greater capacity improvements than that using a distance-based relay station selection. Relaying, which considers both signal and interference conditions, achieves better capacity than that based on signal link quality alone.", "paper_title": "Cellular CDMA capacity with out-of-band multihop relaying", "paper_id": "WOS:000233939900006"}
