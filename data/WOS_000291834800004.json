In this paper a lossy compression method for cartoon-like images is presented, which is based on edge information. Edges together with some adjacent grey/colour values are extracted and encoded using a classical edge detector, binary compression standards such as JBIG and state-of-the-art encoders such as PAQ. When decoding, information outside these encoded data is recovered by solving the Laplace equation, i.e. we inpaint with the steady state of a homogeneous diffusion process. For the discrete reconstruction problem, we prove existence and uniqueness and establish a maximum-minimum principle. Furthermore, we describe an efficient multigrid algorithm. The result is a simple codec that is able to encode and decode in real time. We show that for cartoon-like images this codec can outperform the JPEG standard and even its more advanced successor JPEG2000. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
