Traditional Bag-Of-Words (BOW) image-retrieval approaches to place recognition typically treat images in a holistic manner and are not capable of dealing with sub-scene dynamics, such as structural changes to a building fa double dagger ade or seasonal effects on foliage. However, by treating local features as observations of real-world landmarks in a scene that is observed repeatedly over a period of time, such dynamics can be modelled at a local level, and the spatio-temporal properties of each landmark can be independently updated incrementally. The method proposed models each place as a set of such landmarks and their geometric relationships. A new BOW filtering stage and geometric verification scheme are introduced to compute a similarity score between a query image and each scene model. As further training images are acquired for each place, the landmark properties are updated over time and in the long term, the model can adapt to dynamic behaviour in the scene. Results on an outdoor dataset of images captured along a 7 km path, over a period of 5 months, show an improvement in recognition performance when compared to state-of-the-art image retrieval approaches to place recognition.", "paper_title": "Generative Methods for Long-Term Place Recognition in Dynamic Scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000330972100006"}
