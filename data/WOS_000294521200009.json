This is a difficult problem and few efforts have been reported on its solution in the literature. The problem is first formulated in a form of stochastic scheduling model on Grid systems. Then, a stochastic heterogeneous earliest finish time (SHEET) scheduling algorithm is developed that incorporates the expected value and variance of stochastic processing time into scheduling. Our rigorous performance evaluation study, based on randomly generated stochastic parallel application DAG graphs, shows that our proposed SHEET scheduling algorithm performs much better than the existing scheduling algorithms in terms of makespan, speedup, and makespan standard deviation.
