For the most part, such work has been limited to English and other Latin-based languages. Consequently, algorithms such as Soundex and n-gram matching are of limited utility for languages such as Arabic, which has vastly different morphologic features that rely heavily on phonetic information. The dearth of work in this field is partly caused by the lack of standardized test data. Consequently, we have built a collection of 7,939 Arabic names, along with 50 training queries and 111 test queries. We use this collection to evaluate a variety of algorithms, including a derivative of Soundex tailored to Arabic (ASOUNDEX), measuring effectiveness by using standard information retrieval measures. Our results show an improvement of 70% over existing approaches.", "paper_title": "On the development of name search techniques for Arabic", "paper_id": "WOS:000236400000002"}
