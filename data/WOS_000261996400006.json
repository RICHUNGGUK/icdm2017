However, the background signal caused by the non-specific binding (NSB) between probe and target makes it difficult to obtain accurate measurements. To remove the background signal, there is a set of background probes on Affymetrix Exon arrays to represent the amount of non-specific signals, and an accurate estimation of nonspecific signals using these background probes is desirable for improvement of microarray analyses. Results: We developed a thermodynamic model of NSB on short nucleotide microarrays in which the NSBs are modeled by duplex formation of probes and multiple hypothetical targets. We fitted the observed signal intensities of the background probes with those expected by the model to obtain the model parameters. As a result, we found that the presented model can improve the accuracy of prediction of non-specific signals in comparison with previously proposed methods. This result will provide a useful method to correct for the background signal in oligonucleotide microarray analysis.", "paper_title": "Model-based analysis of non-specific binding for background correction of high-density oligonucleotide microarrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000261996400006"}
