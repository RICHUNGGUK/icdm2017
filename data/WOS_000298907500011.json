We also use a generated series for simulation study of Handoff performance showing the impact of multipath phenomena. Moreover, the extraction of the average signal has been used to reduce significantly the number of unnecessary Handoffs. The wireless propagation channel modeling is based on the linear model concept of the received power from the access point (AP). This concept has a crucial role in modeling new decentralized Handoff based on the ratio of expected and current signal slopes already provided by the linear model. Hence, a fuzzy-based solution is developed and a comparison with the analytical solution results is established. Until recently, Handoff mechanisms are implemented entirely in software, which increasingly becoming infeasible. Therefore, this work attempt to follow the top-down co-design approach providing hardware prototype which leads to reduce the power consumption and support high processing speed.
