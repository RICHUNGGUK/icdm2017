The separation of rule-based knowledge from the core application as explicit business rules has been the focus of existing approaches. However, they fail at supporting rules that are both high-level, i.e. defined in domain terms, and operational, i.e. automatically executable from the core application. In this paper we propose high-level languages for expressing business rules at the domain level as well as their connections to the core application. We provide support for automatically translating high-level rules to object-oriented programs and their connections to aspects, since these crosscut the core application. Separation of concerns is preserved at the domain and implementation levels, facilitating traceability, reusability and adaptability. A prototype implementation and a discussion on trade-offs are presented.", "paper_title": "A slice of MDE with AOP: Transforming high-level business rules to aspects", "paper_id": "WOS:000241450700013"}
