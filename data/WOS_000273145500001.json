The theoretical framework of the Structured Cam Clay (SCC) model is extended to describe the behaviour of cemented clay. The SCC model is modified to take into account special features of the behaviour of cemented clay. The widely used mean effective stress parameter is modified to include the influence of cementation on the strength and the plastic deformation of cemented clay. A new destructuring function is also suggested to represent the removal of the cementation structure, especially in the formation of the final failure state for artificially strongly cemented clay. The revised model is then employed to simulate and predict the behaviour of cemented clay with various degrees of cementation and confining stresses. The main features of the complicated behaviour of cemented clay can be reasonably represented well by the theoretical framework of the SCC model. Finally. the influence of cementation on the model parameters is discussed, and empirical equations are proposed to determine some of the key model parameters for engineering practice.
