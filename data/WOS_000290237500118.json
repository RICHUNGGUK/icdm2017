This novel service allows users to create their own agenda of activities within specified dates. Activities are selected from a list of recommended events according to last selected events, user preferences and other parameters. The proposed restrictions on the recommendation procedure have been found to capture static and dynamic user context. The recommendation function is linear and shows low computational cost. The events are extracted from web sources with almost no human manipulation, so the recommender is always showing new and recent events. The Ajax-based web interface eases the creation of the final plan, offering an interactive experience to the user. We consider that the trade-off between interactivity and recommendation complexity exits, and that the second issue is preferable in this type of services. The details about the design and implementation of the system are described, along with the issues the system resolves and some guidelines for enhancement. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
