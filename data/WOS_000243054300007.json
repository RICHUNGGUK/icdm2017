It is infeasible to expect users to be trained to work with a plethora of systems, especially as many of them will only see occasional use. Therefore, in the near future, systems will need user interfaces that allow intuitive access and usage. This paper examines a new style of user interface based on virtual reality.", "paper_title": "User interfaces for complex engineering software: Application of virtual reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000243054300007"}
