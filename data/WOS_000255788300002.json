It also introduces a method to learn good values of k and I based on a few positive and negative examples. Finally, it describes how the algorithm can be integrated in a tool for information extraction.", "paper_title": "Learning (k, l)-contextual tree languages for information extraction from web pages", "paper_id": "WOS:000255788300002"}
