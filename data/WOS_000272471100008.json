The goal of the pilot program was to obtain input regarding the assessment, functionality, and practicality of a nurse-to-patient electronic prototype. Registered nurse students were given a presurvey, instructions, and details on the use of the prototype, followed by a post-survey. Prototype speed and lack of bias were reported as most favorable. Registered nurse students requested additions of multiple diagnoses, patient acuity, and experience level of the nurse to enhance the prototype. Seventy-three percent (n = 24) of the participants said that they would use the prototype, and 15% (n = 5) said that they would not.", "paper_title": "Phase I Creating an Electronic Prototype to Generate Equitable Hospital Nurse-to-Patient Assignments", "paper_id": "WOS:000272471100008"}
