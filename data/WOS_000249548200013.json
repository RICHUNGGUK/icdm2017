Existing algorithms find qualitative sequential patterns in the sense that only items are included in the patterns. However, for many applications, such as business and scientific applications, quantitative attributes are often recorded in the data, which are ignored by existing algorithms. Quantity information included in the mined sequential patterns can provide useful insight to the users. In this paper, we consider the problem of mining sequential patterns with quantities. We demonstrate that naive extensions to existing algorithms for sequential patterns are inefficient, as they may enumerate the search space blindly. To alleviate the situation, we propose hash filtering and quantity sampling techniques that significantly improve the performance of the naive extensions. Experimental results confirm that compared with the naive extensions, these schemes not only improve the execution time substantially but also show better scalability for sequential patterns with quantities.
