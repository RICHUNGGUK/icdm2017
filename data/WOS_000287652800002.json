However, a lack of established design guidelines for such advanced interfaces makes many designs costly and ineffective. In this paper, a generic conceptual framework for developing IAIs is proposed to guide interface design. The framework integrates a user-centered design approach with the concept of proactive use of adaptive intelligent agents (AIAs), aiming at maximizing overall system performance. Based on existing design approaches, identified challenges, and IAI design needs, the framework uses a multiple-agent hierarchical structure to allocate tasks between operators and agents for optimizing operator-agent interaction. These AIAs provide interface aids as a means of reducing operator workload, and increasing situation awareness and operational effectiveness. The framework and associated IAI models provide guidance to design a knowledge-based system, such as a UAV control station interface.", "paper_title": "Optimizing Operator-Agent Interaction in Intelligent Adaptive Interface Design: A Conceptual Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000287652800002"}
