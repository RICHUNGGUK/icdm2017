However, the high frequency sub-bands also contain some important information corresponding to the edge and contour of face, reflecting the details of face, especially the top-level's high frequency sub-bands. In this paper, we propose a novel technique which is a joint of pixel-level and feature-level fusion at the top-level's wavelet sub-bands for face recognition. We convert the problem of finding the best pixel-level fusion coefficients of high frequency wavelet sub-bands to two optimization problems with the help of principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis, respectively; and propose two alternating direction methods to solve the corresponding optimization problems for finding transformation matrices of dimension reduction and optimal fusion coefficients of the high frequency wavelet sub-bands. The proposed methods make full use of four top-level's wavelet sub-bands rather than the low frequency sub-band only. Experiments are carried out on the FERET, ORL and AR face databases, which indicate that our methods are effective and robust. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
