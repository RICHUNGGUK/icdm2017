It is demonstrated that this formula is valid for all coefficients and suitable for general cases. Using it, different from other methods, each coefficient is independent to others and can be accessed directly due to its non-recursive characteristic.", "paper_title": "General non-recursive coefficients calculation formula for sinc (N) filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000298604100014"}
