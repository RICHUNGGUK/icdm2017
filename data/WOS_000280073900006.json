This paper mainly focuses on (1) mobile station-based mixed-web map module via mobile mash-up technology, (2) a new location-based mobile multimedia technology using ubiquitous sensor Net.-based five senses content, and (3) location awareness-based intelligent multi-agent technology that includes a location-based integrated retrieval agent, a mobile social network (MSN)-based multi-user detection agent and user-centric automatic mobile multimedia recommender agent. This paper aims at validating and inspecting the usability, suitability, and applicability of the suggested technology via various performance evaluation experiments.", "paper_title": "Location awareness-based intelligent multi-agent technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000280073900006"}
