For every constant k >= 3 we analyse the k-star game, where Avoider tries to avoid claiming k edges incident to the same vertex. We consider both versions of Avoider-Enforcer games - the strict and the monotone - and for each provide explicit winning strategies for both players. We determine the order of magnitude of the threshold biases f(F)(mon), f(F)(-) and f(F)(+), where F is the hypergraph of the game.", "paper_title": "Avoider-Enforcer star games", "paper_id": "WOS:000352198400010"}
