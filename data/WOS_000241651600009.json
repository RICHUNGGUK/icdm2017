Existing studies report results from their own implementations and provide suggestions for success. In this paper, we explain an approach used for assessing the suitability of software process and metrics for starting SPC implementation via control charts. The approach includes guidance to identify rational samples of a process as well as to select process metrics. We explain the application of the approach over a review process of a software and system development organization.", "paper_title": "Investigating suitability of software process and metrics for statistical process control", "paper_id": "WOS:000241651600009"}
