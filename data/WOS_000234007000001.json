However, for the important application area of drug discovery, a real-valued classification is preferable. In this paper we initiate a theoretical study of real-valued multiple-instance learning. We prove that the problem of finding a target point consistent with a set of labeled multiple-instance examples (or bags) is NP-complete, and that the problem of learning from real-valued multiple-instance examples is as hard as learning DNE Another contribution of our work is in defining and studying a multiple-instance membership query (MI-MQ). We give a positive result on exactly learning the target point for a multiple-in stance problem in which the learner is provided with a MI-MQ oracle and a single adversarially selected bag.
