Degond, S. Jin, L. Mieussens, A smooth transition between kinetic and hydrodynamic equations, Journal of Computational Physics 209 (2005) 665-694] in which we presented an automatic domain decomposition method for the solution of gas dynamics problems which require a localized resolution of the kinetic scale. The basic idea is to couple the macroscopic hydrodynamics model and the microscopic kinetic model through a buffer zone in which both equations are solved. Discontinuities or sharp gradients of the solution are responsible for locally strong departures to local equilibrium which require the resolution of the kinetic model. The buffer zone is drawn around the kinetic region by introducing a cut-off function, which takes values between zero and one and which is identically zero in the fluid zone and one in the kinetic zone. In the present paper, we specifically consider the possibility of moving the kinetic region or creating new kinetic regions, by evolving the cut-off function with respect to time. We present algorithms which perform this task by taking into account indicators which characterize the non-equilibrium state of the,as. The method is shown to be highly flexible as it relies on the time evolution of the buffer cut-off function rather than on the geometric definition of a moving interface which requires remeshing, by contrast to many previous methods. Numerical examples are presented which validate the method and demonstrate its performances. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
