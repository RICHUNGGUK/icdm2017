Wireless Rural Extensions (WiRE) is a low-power rural wireless network architecture that provides inexpensive, self-sustainable, and high-bandwidth connectivity. WiRE relies on a high-bandwidth directional wireless backbone with local distribution networks to provide focused IP coverage. WiRE also provides cellular connectivity using OpenBTS-based GSM microcells. It supports a naming and addressing framework that inter-operates with traditional telecom networks and enables a wide range of mobile services on a common IP framework. The entire WiRE network can be built by integrating a range of off-the-shelf components and existing open source tools.", "paper_title": "WiRE: A New Rural Connectivity Paradigm", "paper_id": "WOS:000302124800071"}
