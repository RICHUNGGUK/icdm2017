A brief description of the test program at the University of Waterloo is reported. For the simulation, a symmetric quarter of the test configuration is employed. Full three-dimensional finite element discretized geometry is considered together with elastic-plastic reinforcement embedded as truss elements in concrete. Two regularized numerical models of concrete, formulated within elastic-plastic-damage theories, are applied. The first one, called gradient damage, is refined by an additional averaging equation where gradient enhancement involves an internal length scale. In the second one, called rate-dependent damaged plasticity model, a viscoplastic strain rate is introduced. The results for the first model implemented in FEAP and the second model from ABAQUS are discussed in detail. Different issues of numerical simulation to properly predict punching shear behaviour in the slab-column configuration are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
