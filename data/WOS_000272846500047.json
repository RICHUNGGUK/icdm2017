Since there are various dimensions in the implementation of personalization, a variety of personalization strategies have been developed and embodied. Yet, little is known about the impact of different personalization dimensions on customer retention, which is the fundamental objective of personalization. This results in a lack of consensus about how best to characterize the personalization construct. In order to solve this problem, this study empirically investigates the effect of each classified personalization strategy and proposes the most highly recommended combination of personalization dimensions.
