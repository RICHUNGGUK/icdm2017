Furthermore, we give the discrete representation of H-1-norm by using wavelet coefficients, and apply it to the variational image decomposition models. Finally, we give the iterative algorithm, and present various numerical results on images to demonstrate the potential of our methods.", "paper_title": "WAVELET CHARACTERIZATION OF HARDY SPACE H-1 AND ITS APPLICATION IN VARIATIONAL IMAGE DECOMPOSITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000274916900006"}
