However, little work has been presented on the real-time generation of a dynamic snowing scene, partially due to the difficulty that the simulation of a dynamic snowing process involves the complex modeling of the wind field and the interaction between wind and snow. In this paper, by fully considering the physical characteristics of wind and snow, we construct a three-dimensional wind field based on the discrete form of the Boltzmann equation. According to the interaction laws between wind and snow, we simulate the falling of snow, deposition and erosion in 3D space. Experimental results show that realistic wind-driven snow scenes under different speeds of wind with different amounts of snowfall can be rendered in real-time.", "paper_title": "Real-time snowing simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000237468500004"}
