In this paper we present progressive image compression algorithm based on Vector Quantization (VG. Mean-Residual domain Adaptive Resolution Vector Quantization technique (MAR-VQ) that combines the adaptive resolution method with the mean-residual method has been developed. The adaptive resolution method changes the resolution of image adaptively according to the form of a pixel block texture in order to increase the performance of compound image compression. In addition, the mean-residual method was introduced as one of the additional techniques to increase continuous-tone image quality by VQ. As a result, MAR-VQ can realize much superior compression performance than the worldwide standard JPEG2000.", "paper_title": "Still image compression with mean-residual domain adaptive resolution vector quantization technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000243807200002"}
