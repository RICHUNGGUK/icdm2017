On this platform, how to achieve better search and integration of services has become an important research point. Based on some new technologies, this paper proposes an automatic service search model which adopts Semantic Web Services and agents to improve the intelligence of searching services. Moreover, QoS (quality of service) is brought into this model to provide reliable standards for automatic service search. From the services that are obtained from UDDI and match the users' requirements, the model automatically executes all the service flows which are integrated in the Web services and meet the requirements of QoS. After that, the sorted results are returned to the users according to the degrees of fulfillment of the requirements. In this way, the model helps the users make a decision on the service flow according to the results. Finally, we will give an example to illustrate how the model works.", "paper_title": "Carrying on automatic service recommendation by agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800026"}
