In this paper, we study these codes in the Lee metric. To simplify the notation, we use a slightly different description, yet equivalent. Given two integers a and b, an (a, b)-code is a set of vertices such that vertices in the code have a neighbours in the code and other vertices have b neighbours in the code. An (a, b)-code is exactly a perfect weighted covering of radius one with weight (b-a/b, 1/b). In this paper, we prove results of existence as well as of non-existence for (a, b)-codes on the multidimensional grid graphs.", "paper_title": "Weighted codes in Lee metrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000264547100006"}
