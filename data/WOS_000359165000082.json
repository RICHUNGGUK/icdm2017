The semantic gap problem is addressed in two ways. First, a dimensional reduction is applied using the (pre-calculated) distances among images. The dimension of the reduced vector is the number of preferences that we allow the user to choose from, in this case, three levels. Second, the conditional probability distribution of the random user preference, given this reduced feature vector, is modeled using a proportional odds model. A new model is fitted at each iteration. The score used to rank the image database is based on the estimated probability function of the random preference. Additionally, some memory is incorporated in the procedure by weighting the current and previous scores. Also, a novel evaluation procedure is proposed in this work based on the empirical commutative distribution functions of the relevant and non-relevant retrieved images. Good experimental results are achieved in very different experimental setups and tested in different databases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
