It has been recognized that maintaining a continuously awake connected dominating set (CDS) serves to reduce the route setup latency. Under the mobile backbone network (MBN) architecture introduced by Rubin et al., a mobile backbone (Bnet) is dynamically constructed to provide a topological covering of the network. The MBN employs a hybrid routing algorithm under which flows that travel a distance longer than a threshold are directed along routes across the Bnet. In turn, a limited span network-wide global route discovery process is applied for routing shorter distance flows. In this paper, we introduce and analyze an MBN based power saving protocol (MBN-PS) that employs this hybrid routing scheme. Under the MBN-PS scheme, dynamically elected backbone nodes are kept awake, while inactive non-backbone nodes can reside in sleep state. We analytically show that, when the number of network flows is above a minimal level, the throughput per watt efficiency attained in an ad hoc network under complete backbone coverage is better than that achieved by a corresponding network that does not form a backbone. We present a model for the calculation of the bit-per-joule performance of the network as a function of the distance threshold. We confirm the validity of our analytical approach through simulations. Using our method, a network designer is able to choose the optimal distance threshold to be used by this scheme, based on traffic loading conditions.", "paper_title": "Bit-per-joule performance of power saving ad hoc networks with a mobile backbone", "paper_id": "WOS:000273951000003"}
