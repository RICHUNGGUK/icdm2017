In this paper we study this problem with unit disc graphs and small m, which is motivated by the design of fault-tolerant virtual backbone for wireless sensor networks. We propose two approximation algorithms with constant performance ratios for m <= 2. We also discuss how to design approximation algorithms for the problem with arbitrarily large m.", "paper_title": "On minimum m-connected k-dominating set problem in unit disc graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000256777800002"}
