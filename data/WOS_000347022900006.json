The goal of this problem is to maintain high productivity levels by minimizing the number of workstations needed to reach a given output, while integrating in the assembly line a number of disabled workers. Being able to efficiently manage a heterogeneous workforce is especially important in the current social context where companies are urged to integrate workers with different profiles. In this paper we present mathematical models and heuristic methodologies that can help assembly line managers to cope with this additional complexity. We demonstrate by means of a robust benchmark how this integration can be done with losses of productivity that are much lower than expected. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
