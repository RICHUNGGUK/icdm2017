Such models have recently been used in the design of new compilation methods, e.g. for hardware synthesis or for programming with sublinear space. This paper relates such semantically motivated non-standard compilation methods to more standard techniques in the compilation of functional programming languages, namely continuation passing and defunctionalization. We fi rst show for the linear lambda-calculus that interpretation in a model of computation by interaction can be described as a call-by-name CPS-translation followed by a defunctionalization procedure that takes into account control-flow information. We then establish a relation between these two compilation methods for the simply-typed lambda-calculus and end by considering recursion.", "paper_title": "ON THE RELATION OF INTERACTION SEMANTICS TO CONTINUATIONS AND DEFUNCTIONALIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000350399900015"}
