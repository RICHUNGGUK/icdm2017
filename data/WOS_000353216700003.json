Although computational economists have developed various game-playing agents, well-established machine learning methods such as graphical models have not been applied before. Leveraging probabilistic graphical models, this paper presents a novel sequential Bayesian network (SBN) framework for building artificial game-playing agents. We show that many existing agents, including reinforcement learning, fictitious play, and many of their variants, have a unified Bayesian explanation within the proposed SBN framework. Moreover, we discover that SBN can handle various important settings of game playing, allowing for a broad scope of its use in economics. SBN not only provides a unifying and satisfying framework to explain existing learning approaches in virtual economies, but also enables the development of new algorithms that are stronger or have fewer restrictions. In this paper, we derive a new algorithm, Hidden Markovian Play (HMP), from the generic SBN model to handle an important but difficult setting in which a player cannot observe the opponent's strategy and payoff. It leverages Markovian learning to infer unobservable information, leading to higher quality of the agents. Experiments on real-world field experiments in evaluating economies show that our HMP model outperforms the baseline algorithms for building artificial agents.", "paper_title": "A unifying learning framework for building artificial game-playing agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000353216700003"}
