When security is the primary concern, signal interference may actually be very helpful. Starting with a stochastic network model, we are able to show that packet collisions caused by jamming nodes can indeed be used effectively to attain new levels of secrecy in multiterminal wireless environments. To this effect, we propose a practical jamming protocol that uses the well-known request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) handshake of the IEEE 802.11 standard as a signaling scheme. Various jammer selection strategies are investigated depending on the position of source, destination, and jamming nodes. The goal is to cause asmuch interference as possible to eavesdroppers that are located in unknown positions, while limiting the interference observed by the legitimate receiver. To evaluate the performance of each strategy, we introduce and compute a measure for the secure throughput. Our results show that jamming can increase the levels of secrecy significantly albeit at a substantial cost in terms of energy efficiency.", "paper_title": "Position-Based Jamming for Enhanced Wireless Secrecy", "paper_id": "WOS:000293924000011"}
