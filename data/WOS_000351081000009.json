The method is an extension of the multiresolution finite volume scheme used to solve hyperbolic and parabolic time-dependent PDEs. Such an approach guarantees a numerical solution of the Poisson equation within a user-defined accuracy tolerance. Most adaptive meshing approaches in the literature solve elliptic PDEs level-wise and hence at uniform resolution throughout the set of adapted grids. Here we introduce a numerical procedure to represent the elliptic operators on the adapted grid, strongly coupling inter-grid relations that guarantee the conservation and accuracy properties of multiresolution finite volume schemes. The discrete Poisson equation is solved at once over the entire computational domain as a completely separate process. The accuracy and numerical performance of the method are assessed in the context of streamer discharge simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
