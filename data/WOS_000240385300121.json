The orientationCode and diffCode are first defined using four directional templates and the differential operation, respectively. And then the matching score are computed to measure the similarity of the features. Finally, several fusion strategies are investigated for the matching scores of orientationCode and diffCode. Experimental results show that the orientationCode and diffCode can describe a palmprint effectively and the Sum, Product and Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) fusion strategies can greatly improve the accuracy of palmprint authentication.", "paper_title": "Multiple textural features based palmprint authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300121"}
