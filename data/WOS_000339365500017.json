Adopting double-sideband amplitude-shift-keying (DSB-ASK) as the only modulation is supported, this transmitter has very low power consumption. A novel analog baseband circuit is proposed to reduce the transmitter noise. With a G(m)('')- cancellation technology, a highly linear up-conversion active mixer and a power amplifier driver are designed. The transmitter has a measured output 1 dB compression point of 13.4 dBm. Occupying a silicon area of about 1 mm(2) and consuming 144 mW from a 1.8 V voltage supply, the transmitter makes the Mobile UHF RFID reader communicate with a transponder in a distance of 1 m conveniently.", "paper_title": "A novel low-noise high-linearity CMOS transmitter for mobile UHF RFID reader", "paper_id": "WOS:000339365500017"}
