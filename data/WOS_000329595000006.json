Most of algorithms are for 2D wireless networks, which cannot be directly applied to 3D wireless networks. In this paper, we study the guaranteed delivery in 3D wireless networks. We propose a series of routing algorithms by the iteration of specific angles on the Delaunay Triangulation network in 3D space, and prove that the proposed routing algorithms guarantee the certainty of data transmission. In our algorithms, the messages only need to carry information of 0(1) nodes and each node just keeps 1-hop neighbors' information. Simulation results show that our algorithms outperform Compass Routing I and greedy-random-greedy method in 3D Delaunay Triangulation networks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
