This reduces the effective switching capacitance and, hence, the dynamic power dissipation of a circuit. However, efficient design of large-scale circuits with DG devices is not well explored due to lack of proper modeling and large-scale design simulation tools. In this paper, we propose several low-power circuit options using independent gate FinFETs. We developed semianalytical models for different FinFET logic gates to predict their performance. An efficient circuit synthesis methodology comprised of proposed low-power logic options in FinFET design library has been developed. Results show about 8.5 % area savings and 18% power savings over conventional FinFET technology for ISCAS85 benchmark circuits in 45-nm technology with no performance penalty.", "paper_title": "Modeling and circuit synthesis for independently controlled double gate FinFET devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000250415500005"}
