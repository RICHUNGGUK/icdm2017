The intersection is still a proper superset of the deterministic context-free languages as well as of their reversals, while its membership problem is solvable in linear time. For the problem whether a given Church-Rosser or context-free language belongs to the intersection we show completeness for the second level of the arithmetic hierarchy. The equivalence of Church-Rosser and context-free languages is Pi(1)-complete. It is proved that all considered intersections are pairwise incomparable. Finally, closure properties under several operations are investigated.", "paper_title": "When Church-Rosser becomes context free", "paper_id": "WOS:000251516700017"}
