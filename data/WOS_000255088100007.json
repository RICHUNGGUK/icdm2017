We apply this approach to two hypergraph problems. We show that the Glauber dynamics for independent sets in a hypergraph mixes rapidly as long as the maximum degree A of a vertex and the minimum size m of an edge satisfy m >= 2 Delta + 1. We also show that the Glauber dynamics for proper q-colorings of a hypergraph mixes rapidly if m >= 4 and q > Delta, and if m = 3 and q >= 1.65 Delta. We give related results on the hardness of exact and approximate counting for both problems.
