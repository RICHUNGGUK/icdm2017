It is a process method with high productivity and few waste of material, widely used in transportation industry including automotive, shipbuilding, aerospace etc. During the rolling process of large-sized parts, crinkle and hollows often appear on surface, due to inconsistence of rolling motions with the deformation of ring part. Based on radial-axial ring rolling system configuration, motions and forces in rolling process are analyzed, and a dynamic model is formulated. Error of ring's end flatness and roundness are defined as the characteristic parameters of ring quality. The relationship between core roller feed speed, drive roller speed, the upper taper roller feed speed, and quality of ring part are analyzed. The stress and strain of the part are simulated in the Finite Element Method by DEFORM software. The simulation results provide a reference for the definition of ring rolling process parameters. It is able to make the deformation of the part be consistent with the process parameters, and improve product quality considerably.", "paper_title": "Optimization and Simulation of Machining Parameters in Radial-axial Ring Rolling Process", "paper_id": "WOS:000291215500008"}
