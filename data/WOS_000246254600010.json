A motivating example (Conjecture 2): Given an n-vertex graph H, write (PE) for the least p such that, for each subgraph H' of H, the expected number of copies of H' in G = G(n,p) is at least 1, and (pc), for that p for which the probability that G contains (a copy of) H is 1/2. Then (conjecture) (pc) = O(PE log n). Possible connections with discrete isoperimetry are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Thresholds and expectation thresholds", "paper_id": "WOS:000246254600010"}
