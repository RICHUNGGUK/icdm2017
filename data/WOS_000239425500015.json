The workshops of the Initiative for the Evaluation of XML retrieval (INEX) provide a forum for testing the effectiveness of retrieval strategies. In this paper, we present the two strategies used by the University of Kaiserslautern at INEX 2005: The first method uses background knowledge about the document schema (element relationships) to support queries with structural constraints. The second method exploits structural patterns in the retrieval results to find the appropriate results among overlapping elements. In the evaluation of the official results from the workshop, we find that element relationships does not improve retrieval quality for the test collection, but that patterns can lead to improved early precision.", "paper_title": "The University of Kaiserslautern at INEX 2005", "paper_id": "WOS:000239425500015"}
