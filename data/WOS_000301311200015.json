In this research, we use a cylindrical magnet spot, which is widely used in industrial AGVSs, to develop a guidance system for indoor AGV navigation This paper describes the navigation and control system of an AGV by magnet spot guidance with a differential drive. Furthermore, Hall-effect sensors, encoders, and counters are employed to achieve control and continuous guidance. Existing guidance methods use a gyro sensor and dead reckoning with encoders to calibrate against steering angle errors. Here, the maximum value of the magnetic flux density of the magnet spot, which is obtained by the Hall-effect sensor, is used to calibrate against steering angle errors and as a navigation guide for the AGV. Furthermore, real-time corrections for wheel-skidding errors are accomplished with a fuzzy controller. Thus, high-precision continuous guidance with stable and satisfactory navigation at high speeds is achieved. This guidance method was applied to real manufacturing processes in a ceramic plant and steel-bar reinforcement plant to examine its control ability, stability, and effectiveness. The proposed method was found to be robust to disturbances and uncertainty problems during tracking. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
