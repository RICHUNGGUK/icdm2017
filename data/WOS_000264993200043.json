The global stability of the equilibrium point is proved under mild conditions, where the activation function is neither differentiable nor strictly monotone. For the considered system, a novel robust stability criterion of the system is derived, which can be easily solved by efficient convex optimization algorithms. And two numerical examples are given to justify the obtained results. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
