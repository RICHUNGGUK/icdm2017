Further steps into this field are needed from the perspective of system synthesis and language preservation. First, the refinement of Petri nets is introduced based on a k-well-behaved Petri net, in which k tokens can be processed. Then, according to the different compositions of subsystems, well-, under- and overmatched refined Petri nets are proposed. In addition, the language and property relationships among sub-, original, and refined nets are studied to demonstrate behavior characteristics and property preservation in a system synthesis process. A manufacturing system is given as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in synthesizing and analyzing the Petri nets of complex systems.", "paper_title": "Preserving languages and properties in stepwise refinement-based synthesis of Petri nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000257020200005"}
