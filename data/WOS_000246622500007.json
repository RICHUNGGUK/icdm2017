This study mainly emphasizes the use of local search hybridized with a genetic algorithm (GA) and the impact of introducing parallelism. Our results indicate that a hybridization of a GA with a local search algorithm (simulated annealing) is beneficial and that the use of parallelism not only introduces a speedup in the algorithms compared (as expected) but also allows us to improve the quality of the solutions found.", "paper_title": "Comparative study of serial and parallel heuristics used to design combinational logic circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000246622500007"}
