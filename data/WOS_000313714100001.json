Here, we propose a tensor decomposition model Tri-ONTD to analyze three-way data. The model aims to discover the common characteristics of a series of matrices and at the same time identify the peculiarity of each matrix, thus enabling the discovery of the cluster structure in the data. In particular, the Tri-ONTD model performs adaptive dimension reduction for tensors as it integrates the subspace identification (i.e., the low-dimensional representation with a common basis for a set of matrices) and the clustering process into a single process. The Tri-ONTD model can also be regarded as an extension of the Tri-factor NMF model. We present the detailed optimization algorithm and also provide the convergence proof. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in author clustering, image clustering, and image reconstruction. In addition, the results of our proposed model have sparse and localized structures.", "paper_title": "Non-negative Tri-factor tensor decomposition with applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000313714100001"}
