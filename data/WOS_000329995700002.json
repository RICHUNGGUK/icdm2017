The algorithm guarantees finite buffer sizes and aims to solve a joint congestion control, routing, and scheduling problem in a multihop wireless network while satisfying per-flow average end-to-end delay constraints and minimum data rate requirements. This problem has been solved for both backlogged as well as arbitrary arrival rate systems. Moreover, we discuss the design of a class of low-complexity suboptimal algorithms, effects of delayed feedback on the optimal algorithm, and extensions of the proposed algorithm to different interference models with arbitrary link capacities.", "paper_title": "Delay-Guaranteed Cross-Layer Scheduling in Multihop Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000329995700002"}
