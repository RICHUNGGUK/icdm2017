In this paper, the multigranulation technique is introduced into incomplete information systems. Both tolerance relations and maximal consistent blocks are used to construct multigranulation rough sets. Not only are the basic properties about these models studied, but also the relationships between different multigranulation rough sets are explored. It is shown that by using maximal consistent blocks, the greater lower approximation and the same upper approximation as from tolerance relations can be obtained. Such a result is consistent with that of a single-granulation framework.", "paper_title": "Tolerance-based multigranulation rough sets in incomplete systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000343707700004"}
