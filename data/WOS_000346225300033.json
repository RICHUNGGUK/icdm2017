Since dynamic pricing of call rates is beneficial from both the perspectives of subscribers and service providers, our solution can significantly help to adapt this pricing mechanism in real market scenario. In order to deploy this scheme, we have incorporated the competing network provider's strategy into the mechanism of deciding dynamic price. Establishment of Nash equilibrium with the competing network provider has stabilized our pricing mechanism. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
