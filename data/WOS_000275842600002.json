In the first part of the paper, a simplified but useful description that stresses the cyclic nature of the catalytic process is introduced. The time-dependence of the substrate concentration after the initial transient phase is derived in a simple way that dispenses with the mathematical technique known as quasi-steady-state approximation. In the second part of the paper an exact one-dimensional formulation of HMM kinetics is considered. The whole problem is condensed in a single one-variable evolution equation that is a second-order non-linear autonomous differential equation, and the control parameters are reduced to three dimensionless quantities: enzyme efficiency, substrate reduced initial concentration, and enzyme reduced initial concentration. The exact solution of HMM kinetics is obtained as a set of Maclaurin series. From the same equation, a number of approximate solutions, some known, some new, are derived in a systematic way that allows a precise evaluation of the respective level of approximation and conditions of validity. The evolution equation obtained is also shown to be well suited for the numerical computation of the concentrations of all species as a function of time for any given combination of parameters.", "paper_title": "A General Treatment of Henri-Michaelis-Menten Enzyme Kinetics: Exact Series Solution and Approximate Analytical Solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000275842600002"}
