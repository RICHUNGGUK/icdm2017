TCP is a connection-oriented reliable end-to-end transport protocol which provides bitwise correct data transfer. TCP transmits data according to well-known rules that guarantee reliable delivery and attempt to ensure that the available capacity is shared equitably amongst users. However. this behaviour can result in delayed data transmission and highly variable throughput. We discuss the system requirements and parameters that would be needed for TCP to be successful in moving constant bit-rate real-time data and if TCP were to be used, the implications for applications such as e-VLBI, where we are more concerned with the timely arrival of data than guaranteed delivery. Experiments were conducted using bit-rates of hundreds of Mbit/s over dedicated European Gigabit lightpaths. The results show that fora lossy TCP connection using standard bandwidth-delay sized buffers, the packet arrival times for a constant bit-rate flow diverge from real-time arrival. Using sender-side buffering by increasing the Linux socket buffer sizes, by orders of magnitude in some situations, allows timely arrival of data at the TCP level with only temporary, though possibly lengthy, delays.
