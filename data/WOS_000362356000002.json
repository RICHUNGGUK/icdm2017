In the proposed methods, the application durations of the two voltages, as well as the selection of two output voltages used in the future sampling period, are determined by an optimization process to minimize current error inside the future sampling period and to eliminate current error at the end of the future sampling instant. By utilizing the two voltages with variable durations, the two proposed MPCC methods can reduce steady-state current errors and decrease output current ripples without increasing the sampling frequency in comparison with the conventional MPCC method, despite only three distinctive output voltages being allowed in the single-phase VSI. The two proposed methods along with the conventional MPCC method are compared in terms of current errors and total harmonic distortion. The effectiveness of the two proposed methods for the single-phase VSIs is verified with both simulation and experimental results.", "paper_title": "Predictive Current Control Methods With Reduced Current Errors and Ripples for Single-Phase Voltage Source Inverters", "paper_id": "WOS:000362356000002"}
