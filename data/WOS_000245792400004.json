In the Peta-Flops regime, these concern both, the way to exploit the increasingly available power and the need of designing algorithms which are scalable and fault-tolerant at the same time. An example of a probabilistic domain decomposition method, which is indeed scalable and naturally fault-tolerant, is presented. Grid computing should also be mentioned as an increasingly popular way to perform massively distributed computing: it represents a way to exploit computing power, aside the existing supercomputers. Beyond classical supercomputers there is the prospective quantum computer, in view of which it is advisable to start now a search for suitable algorithms for certain classes of problems.", "paper_title": "Supercomputing applications to the numerical modeling of industrial and applied mathematics problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000245792400004"}
