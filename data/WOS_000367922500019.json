This paper continues the line of research on high-speed multi-precision squaring on embedded processors. In particular, we present an optimized Karatsuba squaring method for 8-bit AVR processors. We compute the multiplication part with the fastest Karatsuba multiplication, and then the remaining two squaring parts are conducted with the fastest sliding block doubling squaring. As a result, The proposed method sets the new speed records for multi-precision squaring, improving the execution time by up to 8.49% compared with the best known works.
