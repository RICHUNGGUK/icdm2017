The sections were created thirty years ago and constitute the largest and most detailed study of human orbital anatomy to date. In order to preserve the collection, it was digitised. This paper documents a practical approach to the automatic reconstruction of a 3-D representation of the original objects from the digitised sections. To illustrate the results of our approach, we show a multi-planar reconstruction and a 3-D direct volume rendering of a reconstructed foetal head.", "paper_title": "Digitisation and 3D reconstruction of 30 year old microscopic sections of human embryo, foetus and orbit", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600057"}
