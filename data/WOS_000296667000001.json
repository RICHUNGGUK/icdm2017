Autonomous ABS system can take over the traction control of the vehicle either completely or partially. An antilock braking system using an on-off control strategy to maintain the wheel slip within a predefined range is studied here. The controller design needs integration with the vehicle dynamics model. A single wheel or a bicycle vehicle model considers only constant normal loading on the wheels. On the other hand, a four wheel vehicle model that accounts for dynamic normal loading on the wheels and generates correct lateral forces is suitable for reliable brake system design. This paper describes an integrated vehicle braking system dynamics and control modeling procedure for a four wheel vehicle. The vehicle system comprises several energy domains. The interdisciplinary modeling technique called bond graph is used to integrate models in different energy domains and control systems. The bond graph model of the integrated vehicle dynamic system is developed in a modular and hierarchical modeling environment and is simulated to evaluate the performance of the ABS system under various operating conditions.
