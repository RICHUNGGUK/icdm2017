Our goal is to not only conceptually review the results in this area but also to provide enough algorithmic details so that the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches can become quite clear. In this sense, our hope is that this paper would complement a series of recent review papers and catalyze future research in this rapidly evolving area. We conclude discussing our viewpoint on future research directions in this area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
