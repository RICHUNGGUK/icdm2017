The method relies on a doubly periodic global parameterization of the point cloud to the plane, so no segmentation of the point cloud is required. Based on some recent techniques for parameterizing higher genus meshes, when some mild conditions on the sampling density are satisfied, the algorithm generates a closed toroidal manifold which interpolates the input and is geometrically similar to the sampled surface.
