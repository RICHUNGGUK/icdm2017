However, these methods are not minimal due to the constraints of joint twists. This paper puts forward a new POE-based model, whose parameters are totally independent and conform to the formula of minimality. This is the first model that simultaneously satisfies the requirements of parametric continuity, completeness, and minimality with uniform and generic modeling rules. The proposed approach avoids the operations of normalization and orthogonalization which are necessary redundancy elimination steps with the traditional model. Simulations on a SCARA robot and experiments on an ABB IRB 120 robot prove that the new model outperforms in convergence, accuracy, and efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
