A new method for inter-satellite relative position determination between a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and spacecraft using X-ray pulsars is proposed in this paper. The geometric model of this method is formulated, and two different resolution algorithms are introduced and analyzed. The phase cycle ambiguity resolution is investigated, and a new strategy is proposed and formulated. Using the direct vector parameters of the pulsar, geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) is studied. It is shown that this method has advantages of simplicity and efficiency, and is able to eliminate the clock errors. The analytical results are verified numerically via computer simulations.", "paper_title": "Determination of inter-satellite relative position using X-ray pulsars", "paper_id": "WOS:000314751500007"}
