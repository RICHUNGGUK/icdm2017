We show that linearization of the inherent nonlinearities of both the vehicle motion and the sensor models frequently drives the Solution of the EKF-SLAM out of consistency, specially ill those Situations where uncertainty surpasses a certain threshold. We propose a mapping algorithm, Robocentric Map Joining, which improves consistency of the EKF-SLAM algorithm by limiting the level Of uncertainty in the continuous evolution of the stochastic map: (1) by building a sequence of independent local maps, and (2) by using a robot centered representation of each local map. Simulations and a large-scale indoor/outdoor experiment validate the proposed approach. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
