The human central nervous system is believed to obtain multiple forward-inverse models. The schema model enables agents to obtain multiple nonlinear forward models incrementally. This model is based on hypothesis testing theory whereas most modular learning methods are based on a Bayesian framework. As a specific example, we describe a schema model with a normalized Gaussian network (NGSM). Simulation revealed that NGSM has two advantages over MOSAIC's learning method: NGSM can obtain multiple model, incrementally and does not depend oil the initial parameters of the forward models.
