This study proposes a new method to find translation and rotation matrix of camera in a sport scene based on points at infinity. Vanishing point (point at infinity) of parallel lines is the image of the point at infinity, which corresponds to the projection of the intersection of parallel lines at infinity. According to projective geometry constraint, camera rotation of the projection matrix is directly computed using two vanishing points and rotation matrix of camera extracted from those points at infinity. Computer simulation and real data experiments are carried out to validate the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Camera parameters estimation in soccer scenes on the basis of points at infinity", "paper_id": "WOS:000302137600006"}
