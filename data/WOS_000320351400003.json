It is, therefore, important to understand the full spectrum of kNN queries, even before starting to work on how to process and optimise such queries. The aim of this paper is to give a complete picture of what kNN queries are capable of. In this study, we present a survey of kNN queries, in which we propose a taxonomy of kNN queries, comprising four perspectives: (i) a Space perspective, (ii) a Result perspective, (iii) a Query-Point perspective, and (iv) a Relationship perspective. These give a comprehensive overview of kNN queries. As kNN is a large area of research, in this paper, we confine the discussion to kNN queries on stationary objects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
