At the same time, it presents new challenges for the development of numerical algorithms. One is the effective exploitation of the differential between the speed of single- and double-precision arithmetic; the other is the efficient parallelization between the short-vector Single-Instruction, Multiple-Data (SIMD) cores. The first challenge is addressed by utilizing the well-known technique of iterative refinement for the solution of a dense symmetric positive definite system of linear equations, resulting in a mixed-precision algorithm, which delivers double-precision accuracy while performing the bulk of the work in single precision. The main contribution of this paper lies in addressing the second challenge by successful thread-level parallelization, exploiting fine-grained task granularity and a lightweight decentralized synchronization. The implementation of the computationally intensive sections gets within 90 percent of the peak floating-point performance, while the implementation of the memory-intensive sections reaches within 90 percent of the peak memory bandwidth. On a single CELL processor, the algorithm achieves more than 170 Gflops when solving a symmetric positive definite system of linear equations in single precision and more than 150 Gflops when delivering the result in double-precision accuracy.", "paper_title": "Solving systems of linear equations on the CELL processor using Cholesky factorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000257869100003"}
