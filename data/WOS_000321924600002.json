However, adapting Poisson image blending to video presents new challenges due to the added temporal dimension. In video, the human eye is sensitive to small changes in blending boundaries across frames and slight differences in motions of the source patch and target video. We present a novel video blending approach that tackles these problems by merging the gradient of source and target videos and optimizing a consistent blending boundary based on a user-provided blending trimap for the source video. Our approach extends mean-value coordinates interpolation to support hybrid blending with a dynamic boundary while maintaining interactive performance. We also provide a user interface and source object positioning method that can efficiently deal with complex video sequences beyond the capabilities of alpha blending.", "paper_title": "Motion-Aware Gradient Domain Video Composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000321924600002"}
