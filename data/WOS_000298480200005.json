Can we then infer that H is quasi-random? We show that the answer is negative if and only if alpha(1) = ... = alpha(k) = 1/k. This resolves an open problem raised in 1991 by Chung and Graham [J AMS 4 (1991), 151-196]. While hypergraphs satisfying the property corresponding to alpha(1) = ... = alpha(k) = 1/k are not necessarily quasi-random, we manage to find a characterization of the hypergraphs satisfying this property. Somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that (essentially) there is a unique non quasi-random hypergraph satisfying this property. The proofs combine probabilistic and algebraic arguments with results from the theory of association schemes. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
