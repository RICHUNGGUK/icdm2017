Design/methodology/approach - Data collected from 240 blog-based learning systems users in the context of higher education were tested against the model using the structural equation modelling approach. Findings - The results indicate the interrelationships between six system success variables: system quality, content quality, context and linkage quality, user satisfaction, system use, and learning performance. In particular, this study confirms that quality attributes positively affect user satisfaction, which in turn positively influences learning performance directly or indirectly through the mediation of system use. Originality/value - This study is a pioneering effort to develop and validate a blog-based learning systems success model.", "paper_title": "A model for assessing blog-based learning systems success", "paper_id": "WOS:000348443200008"}
