The solver makes use of a pseudo-staggered arrangement, in order to preserve sharp value changes in pressure and velocity fields across Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) porous walls; the resulting form of the pressure correction equation is able to achieve a fast convergence at very low permeability of the medium, also when it is associated with strong grid non-orthogonality. A description of the theory adopted for the implementation of a highly efficient C++ object oriented dynamic library is presented first. The library has been applied to the new compressible solver for the multi-dimensional simulation of the hydrodynamics of full-scale wall-flow Diesel Particulate Filters. Code validation has been performed against experimental data available from the published literature. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
