The survey's methodology is based on the classic SWEBOK reference document that comprehensively defines the taxonomy of software engineering domain. This is mixed with classic automation artefacts, such as the set of the most influential international standards and dominating industrial practices. The survey focuses mainly on research publications which are believed to be representative of advanced industrial practices as well.", "paper_title": "Software Engineering in Industrial Automation: State-of-the-Art Review", "paper_id": "WOS:000323569900003"}
