However, most of the study focuses on the case with step shifts in Poisson means. Relatively little attention has been paid to the case with linear drifts in Poisson means. This paper extends the window-limited generalized likelihood ratio (WGLR) test from the monitoring of normal means to Poisson processes, with focus on linear drifts. The comparison results with the adaptive cumulative sum (ACUSUM) charts and the weighted CUSUM (WCUSUM) charts show that the WGLR chart generally provides better detection performance than the other alternative methods in both the zero-state and steady-state cases.", "paper_title": "A window-limited generalized likelihood ratio test for monitoring Poisson processes with linear drifts", "paper_id": "WOS:000357936100001"}
