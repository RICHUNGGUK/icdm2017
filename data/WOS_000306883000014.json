It has three dynamometers that measure the force wrench applied on each third. We describe the calibration process, which compensates for the effects of weight and inertia, with the introduction of a new parameter that contains the Euler force. A driving simulation platform was built as a demonstration setup: one driver was asked to perform two tests as a proof of concept of the instrumented steering wheel. Our analysis of the force wrench of the individual hands during these tests showed that the driver did not apply a symmetrical effort when steering the wheel. In addition, the driver showed little mechanical efficiency in the task as it appeared that non-negligible energy was expended for non-turning axes. In conclusion, the instrumented steering wheel is ready to be fully used as a measurement device for the quantization of the driving task. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
