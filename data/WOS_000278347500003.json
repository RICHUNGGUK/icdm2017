Learning the preferences and habits of users then becomes an important step in allowing a system to provide such personalized services. Thus far, the exploration of these issues by the scientific community has not been extensive, but interest in the area is growing. Ambient Intelligence environments have special characteristics that have to be taken into account during the learning process. We identify these characteristics and use them to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of developments so far, providing direction to encourage further development in this specific area of Ambient Intelligence.", "paper_title": "Learning patterns in ambient intelligence environments: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000278347500003"}
