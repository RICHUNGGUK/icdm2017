Detecting student attention on web pages fulfills the recommendation of adequate knowledge components to students based on students' current interests. Previous studies have shown the application of learner attention in intelligent learning systems. This study proposes a methodology to analyze student on-line mouse movement patterns that indicate student attentions. The methodology can be combined with learning systems that implement pedagogical models such as inquiry-based learning and problem-solving learning activities. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methodology have been evaluated by student mouse movements in problem-solving scenarios.", "paper_title": "Detecting mouse movement with repeated visit patterns for retrieving noticed knowledge components on web pages", "paper_id": "WOS:000250094800025"}
