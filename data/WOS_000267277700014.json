By means of simple and well-defined geometries, the comparison of different coupling approaches among each other and with measurements should be possible. Design/methodology/approach - The physical setup consists of a C-core in conjunction with a reluctance rotor. The TESTCASE is designed to work in static operation and with motion induced voltage. Findings - Simulation results using different approaches as well as measurement results are presented. Practical issues in measurement and simulation are discussed. It was found that particular care has to be taken concerning the modeling of the air around the TESTCASE structure. Originality/value - With the proposed approach, it is possible to evaluate the coupled field circuit problem on a defined and well-known geometry. Simulation results can be compared to measurements.", "paper_title": "TESTCASE: a benchmark problem for coupled field-circuit simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000267277700014"}
