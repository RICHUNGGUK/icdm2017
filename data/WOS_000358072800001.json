Such a progression makes it possible to represent, integrate, query and reason about structured online data. Recent years have witnessed tremendous growth of mobile computing, represented by the widespread adoption of smart phones and tablets. The versatility of such smart devices and the capabilities of semantic technologies form a great foundation for a ubiquitous Semantic Web that will contribute to further realising the true potential of both disciplines. In this paper, the authors argue for values provided by the ubiquitous Semantic Web using a mobile service discovery scenario. They also provide a brief overview of state-of-the-art research in this emerging area. Finally, the authors conclude with a summary of challenges and important research problems.", "paper_title": "The Ubiquitous Semantic Web: Promises, Progress and Challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000358072800001"}
