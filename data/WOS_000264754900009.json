In this work we study the influence of raw types, i.e. parameterless instantiations of class types, over the semantics of an AspectJ-like language. As a result, we de. ne an operational semantics and a type system for a calculus, named Raw Aspect Featherweight Generic Java (Raw-AFGJ), that represents a minimal aspect-oriented extension of Raw Featherweight Generic Java. Through our calculus it is possible to achieve a better understanding of several subtleties of aspect weaving with the restrictions imposed by raw types support in the type system.", "paper_title": "On the Interaction of Advices and Raw Types in AspectJ", "paper_id": "WOS:000264754900009"}
