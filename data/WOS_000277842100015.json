Functional parallelism and data parallelism are supported by each of the message passing interface model and TCP/IP model. To consider the differences in heterogeneous computing resources and complexity of large-scale power system communities, a kernel-based multilevel algorithm is proposed for network partitioning. Since the bottleneck in distributed computation is low speed network communication, a bi-level latency exploitation technique is introduced for numerically solving system differential equations. The proposed grid-based implementation includes the core simulation engine, grid computing middleware, a Python interface and Python front-end utilities. Tests for a 39-bus network, a 4000-bus network and a 10,000-bus network are reported, and the results of these experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to execute the distributed simulations on computational grid infrastructure and provide efficient parallelism.
