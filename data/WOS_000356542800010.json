In particular, they together can provide systematic approaches for engineering intelligent software systems more efficiently and cost-effectively. As there is a large overlap between the two disciplines, the interplay is vital for both to be successful. In this paper, we divide the intersection of SE and KE into three subareas, namely Knowledge-Supported Software Engineering (KSSE), Engineering Knowledge as a Software (EKaaS), and Intelligent Software System Engineering (ISSE). For each subarea, we describe the challenges along with the current trends, and predict the future research directions that may have the most potential for success.", "paper_title": "Viewpoints Future Research Directions of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000356542800010"}
