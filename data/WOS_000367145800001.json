The problem is formulated as a decentralized linear quadratic game, and a linear dynamic feedback scheme that couples the tasks of learning the network topology and driving the network state is shown to solve the game and achieve a Nash equilibrium. This solution results in finite-time consensus in minimum time, and optimizes the transient behavior on the way to consensus with respect to a quadratic global performance measure.", "paper_title": "Optimal Distributed Finite-Time Consensus On Unknown Undirected Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000367145800001"}
