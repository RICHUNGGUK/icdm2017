The upper bound of derivative of the discrete time-varying delay is not restricted to one. A delay-dependent criterion of exponential stability under switching signals with an average dwell time is developed by employing free weighting matrices. The criterion is given in the form of linear matrix inequality. A state decay estimation for the switched system is explicitly given by considering the individual rate of decay of state for each subsystem. Two simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Improved stability of a class of switched neutral systems via Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and an average dwell-time scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000320356300007"}
