These algorithms continue a decoding procedure after the BP decoding algorithm terminates. We derive a condition that our decoding algorithms can correct an erased bit which is uncorrectable by the BP decoding algorithm. We show by simulation results that the performance of our decoding algorithms is enhanced compared with that of the BP decoding algorithm with little increase of the decoding complexity.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Decoding Algorithms for Low-Density Parity-Check Codes over the Binary Erasure Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000272394500005"}
