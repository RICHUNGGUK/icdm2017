An image is divided into three-type different regions according to image features. For different regions, a binary shock-type backward diffusion or a fuzzy backward diffusion is performed in the gradient direction to the isophote line, incorporating a forward diffusion in the tangent direction. Gaussian smoothing to the second normal derivative results in a robust process against noise. Experiments on real images show that this method produces better visual results of the enhanced images than some related equations.", "paper_title": "Region-based fuzzy shock filter with anisotropic diffusion for adaptive image enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300133"}
