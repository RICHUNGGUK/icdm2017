These experts normally have their own domain-specific designing methods and tools, which can lead to incompatibilities when one needs to work together using these those methods and tools. Having a proper framework which integrates different design tools is of interest, as such a framework can prevent incompatibilities between parts during the design process. In this paper, we propose our co-modelling methodology and co-simulation tools integration framework, which helps to maintain the domain specific properties of the model components during the co-design process of various mechatronic devices. To avoid expensive rework later in the design phase and even possible system failure, fault modelling and a layered structure with fault-tolerance mechanisms for the controller software are introduced. In the end, a practical mechatronic device is discussed to illustrate the methods and tools which are presented in this paper in details. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
