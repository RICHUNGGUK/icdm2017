The basic concept is that ageing in the microscale and the deformation and temperature rise in the macroscale should be analysed simultaneously. In the macroscale, mechanical analysis is carried out followed by thermal analysis. In the microscale, the diffusion of carbon is estimated considering the history of strain and temperature analysed by the macroscale analyses. Using the proposed method, metal forming analysis is conducted and experimental verification is conducted with emphasis on carbon content and deformation rate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
