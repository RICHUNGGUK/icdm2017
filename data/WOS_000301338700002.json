The algorithm presented in this work is an improvement on the work presented by Sussman and Ohta (SIAM J Sci Comput 2009). In this work, the method of Sussman and Ohta is extended in order to treat problems with contact angle dynamics. Furthermore, this work presents a more efficient method for computing volume-preserving motion by mean curvature than the method presented previously. The new method is tested on the following four 2D problems: (1) 3D axisymmetric (r-z) surface tension driven zero gravity droplet oscillation, (2) measurement of the magnitude of parasitic currents for a droplet on a substrate initialized in static equilibrium, (3) relaxation of a 2D droplet on a substrate to static shape, and (3) relaxation of a 2D bubble on a substrate to static shape.
