It consists in locating in a video the motions of translation and zoom, and the absence of camera motion (i.e static camera). The classification process is based on a rule-based system that is divided into three stages. From a parametric motion model, the first stage consists in combining data to obtain frame-level belief masses on camera motions. To ensure the temporal coherence of motions, a filtering of belief masses according to TBM is achieved. The second stage carries out a separation between static and dynamic frames. In the third stage, a temporal integration allows the motion to be studied on a set of frames and to preserve only those with significant magnitude and duration. Then, a more detailed description of each motion is given. Experimental results obtained show the effectiveness of the method. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
