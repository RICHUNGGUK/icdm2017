However, the treatment with 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) is limited because of its side effects. Many analogs and several nonsteroidal mimics with potent biological activity have been reported so far, and our rationale for designing the VDR agonists was on the basis of computer-aided drug design method by de novo design of A-ring and C/D-ring position of 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3). Pyrimidine-2,4-diamine was selected as A-ring, and naphthalene and benzene were chosen as C/D-ring. By linking different components, a virtue compound library was obtained. To evaluate the contribution to activity of each component, we performed a series of automated molecular docking operations. Results revealed that the 19-dimethyl derivatives (the C-19 position correspond to C-20 in 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)) show the favorable docking affinity to VDR. Moreover, the docking results are quite robust when further validated by molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, by free energy analysis using molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method, the driving force of the binding between VDR and the ligands is proved to be hydrophobic interactions. Thus, a possible strategy to design new series of VDR agonists is proposed. The strategy can be successfully applied to explain the high potential activities of the 19-dimethyl derivatives. It is anticipated that the findings reported here may provide useful information for designing effective VDR agonists as well as the therapeutic treatment of VDR-related diseases.", "paper_title": "Computer-aided de novo ligand design and docking/molecular dynamics study of Vitamin D receptor agonists", "paper_id": "WOS:000298756500018"}
