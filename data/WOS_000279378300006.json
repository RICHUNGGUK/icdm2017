Users hope to obtain a personalized service which is composed of customized devices among sharable devices in a ubiquitous smart space (which is called USS in this paper). However, the situations of each user are different and user preferences also are various. Although users request the same service in the same USS, the most suitable devices for composing the service are different for each user. For these user requirements, this paper proposes a device recommender system which infers and recommends customized devices for composing a user required service. The objective of this paper is the development of the systems for recommending devices through context-aware inference in peer-to-peer environments. For this goal, this paper considers the context and user preference. Also I implement a prototype system and test performance on the real ubiquitous mobile object (UMO).", "paper_title": "A Recommender System for Device Sharing Based on Context-Aware and Personalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000279378300006"}
