This algorithm is embedded with the heuristic walk mechanism based on random walk to deal with the constrained clustering problems given pairwise must-link and cannot-link constraints. Experimental results show that our approach is more effective on both the synthetic datasets and the real datasets compared with the Cop-Kmeans and ant-based clustering algorithm.
