Therefore, outsourcing keys (including passwords and data encryption keys) to professional password managers (honest-but-curious service providers) is attracting the attention of many users. However, existing solutions in a traditional data outsourcing scenario are unable to simultaneously meet the following three security requirements for keys outsourcing: 1) Confidentiality and privacy of keys; 2) Search privacy on identity attributes tied to keys; 3) Owner controllable authorization over his/her shared keys. In this paper, we propose CloudKeyBank, the first unified key management framework that addresses all the three goals above. Under our framework, the key owner can perform privacy and controllable authorization enforced encryption with minimum information leakage. To implement CloudKeyBank efficiently, we propose a new cryptographic primitive named Searchable Conditional Proxy Re-Encryption (SC-PRE) which combines the techniques of Hidden Vector Encryption (HVE) and Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE) seamlessly, and propose a concrete SC-PRE scheme based on existing HVE and PRE schemes. Our experimental results and security analysis show the efficiency and security goals are well achieved.", "paper_title": "CloudKeyBank: Privacy and Owner Authorization Enforced Key Management Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000364853800006"}
