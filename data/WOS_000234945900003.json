In this paper we present art algorithm based oil the possibilistic approach to Clustering that automatically finds both the number of rings and their position without any a priori knowledge. The algorithm has been tested oil realistic Monte Carlo LHCb simulated events and it has been shown very powerful in detecting complex images full of rings. The tracking-independent algorithm Could be usefully employed after a track based approach to identify remaining trackless rings. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
