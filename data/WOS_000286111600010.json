We introduce an interactive and mobile scanning system for the acquisition and synthesis of haptic textures that consists of a visually tracked handheld touch probe. The most novel aspect of our work is an estimation method for the contact stiffness of an object based solely on the acceleration and forces measured during stroking of its surface with the handheld probe. We establish an experimental relationship between the estimated stiffness and the contact stiffness observed during compression. We also measure the height-displacement profile of an object's surface enabling us to generate haptic textures. We show an example of mapping the textures on to a coarse surface mesh obtained with an image-based technique, but the textures may also be combined with coarse surface meshes obtained by manual modeling.", "paper_title": "Measurement-Based Modeling of Contact Forces and Textures for Haptic Rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000286111600010"}
