The computational domain may contain complex moving boundaries. The strategy of DFD is that the discrete form of partial differential equations at an interior point may involve some points outside the solution domain. The functional values at the exterior dependent points are evaluated by the approximate form of solution near the boundary. Compared to the previous work, the tedious task of constructing new interpolation tetrahedrons is eliminated, and this reduces the complexity of DFD implementation. An efficient algorithm for classifying mesh points is also presented. Simulation of flow around a stationary sphere is used to validate the numerical method, and three distinct flow regimes have been obtained with varied Reynolds numbers of up to 300. The ability of the method for flows with complex moving boundary is demonstrated by simulating flows over an undulating fish-like body. The results of force coefficient, structure of wake patterns and propulsive efficiency at critical Strouhal number have been presented. All predictions show a good agreement with the reference data.
