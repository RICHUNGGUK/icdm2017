To overcome this drawback, we present a multiobjective robust optimization methodology to address the effects of parametric uncertainties on multiple crashworthiness criteria, where several different sigma criteria are adopted to measure the variations. As an example, a full front impact of vehicle is considered with increase in energy absorption and reduction of structural weight as the design objectives, and peak deceleration as the constraint. A multiobjective particle swarm optimization is applied to generate robust Pareto solution, which no longer requires formulating a single cost function by using weighting factors or other means. From the example, a clear compromise between the Pareto deterministic and robust designs can be observed. The results demonstrate the advantages of using multiobjective robust optimization, with not only the increase in the energy absorption and decrease in structural weight from a baseline design, but also a significant improvement in the robustness of optimum.", "paper_title": "Crashworthiness design of vehicle by using multiobjective robust optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000291254600010"}
