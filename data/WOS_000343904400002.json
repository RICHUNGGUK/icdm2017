It allows virtual community formation among like minded users to share data and to organize collaborative social activities at commonly agreed upon places and times. Such an activity scheduling in real-time is non-trivial as it requires tracing multiple users' profiles, preferences, and other spatio-temporal contexts, like location, and availability. Inherent conflicts among users regarding choices of places and time slots further complicates unanimous decision making. In this paper, we propose an autonomic system for activity scheduling in MoSoN communities. Our system allows flexible activity proposition while efficiently handling the user conflicts. As evident from our simulation and testbed results and analysis, our system can schedule multiple simultaneous activities in real-time while incurring low message and time cost.", "paper_title": "Automatic Event Scheduling in Mobile Social Network Communities", "paper_id": "WOS:000343904400002"}
