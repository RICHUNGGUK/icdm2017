The error made by this numerical scheme is compared to exponential integrators which have been shown in Klein and Roidot (2011) [2] to perform best for stiff solutions of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation. Since many classic high order splitting methods do not perform well, we propose a stable extrapolation method in order to construct an efficient numerical scheme of order four. In addition, the conservation properties and the possibility of order reduction for certain initial values for the numerical schemes under consideration are investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
