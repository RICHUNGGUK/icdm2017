In this paper we propose to study juggling patterns from a pattern matching point of view. Inspired by pattern matching algorithms based on convolution, we propose a fast algorithm for finding transitions between juggling states. Apart from being a fun application of pattern matching theory, it provides a practical tool in the experimental design of (large) juggling patterns. We also provide a compact formula for counting the number of transitions of a given length between two juggling states.", "paper_title": "Juggling with pattern matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000237336000005"}
