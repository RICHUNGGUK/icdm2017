Knowledge resource library stored large amount of knowledge achieve, and it can be distill through all kinds of links. Technically, there are two concerns, one is to index through what kind of related strategy, establishes keyword controls, in order to apply the standard literature management tools, the other is how to adopt efficient storage strategies, in order to index and update the knowledge system fast, this thesis takes the operation process as a starting point, investigates the organization strategies towards knowledge classification process and storage, as well as provide a practice case based on research and develop of the steel product.", "paper_title": "The research on the method of process-based knowledge catalog and storage and its application in steel product R&D", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300079"}
