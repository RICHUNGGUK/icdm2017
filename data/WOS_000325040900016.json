However, traditional image fusion methods cannot meet the requirements of applications because they can lose spatial information or distort spectral characteristics. In this paper, a new wavelet method based on a local algorithm is presented. The proposed method fuses multi-spectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images to improve spatial information and preserve spectral characteristics. The main advantage of the new fusion method is the exploitation of the dependency between neighboring pixels. SPOT5 MS and PAN images were employed to execute the fusion methods. To compare with the new method, the principal component analysis (PCA), wavelet transformation, and PCA-based wavelet (PCA-FW) image fusion methods were selected. Qualitative and quantitative analyses and classification accuracy assessment were conducted to evaluate the performance of the fusion methods. The results demonstrate that the new wavelet method based on a local algorithm is better than traditional image fusion methods. The new fusion method can achieve a wide range of balance between high spatial resolution retention and spectral characteristic preservation; thus, the new method is suitable for different applications.
