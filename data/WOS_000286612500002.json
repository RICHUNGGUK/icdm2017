It is called \"double power-law\" since it behaves as two power laws respectively, in large and small degree region with a crossing in-between. The position of the crossing point is derived as a function of the three parameters. The probabilistic uncertainty of this law is studied with two possible information measures: a generalized measure called varentropy and the Shannon entropy formula.", "paper_title": "DOUBLE POWER-LAW DEGREE DISTRIBUTION AND INFORMATIONAL ENTROPY IN URBAN ROAD NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612500002"}
