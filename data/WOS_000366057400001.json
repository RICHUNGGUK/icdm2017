The algorithm is relatively easy to implement and converges quickly to the complete set of nondominated points. The algorithm maintains, at any point in time, a diverse set of nondominated points, and is thus ideally suited for fast approximation of the nondominated frontier. An extensive computational study demonstrates the efficacy of the triangle splitting method.", "paper_title": "A Criterion Space Search Algorithm for Biobjective Mixed Integer Programming: The Triangle Splitting Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000366057400001"}
