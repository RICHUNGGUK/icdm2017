The numerical method is based on applying the Taylor's expansions along the normal direction and incorporating the solution and its normal derivative jumps into the finite difference approximations. The fluid variables are solved in a staggered grid, and a new accurate interpolating scheme for the non-smooth velocity has been developed. The numerical results show that the scheme is second-order accurate. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
