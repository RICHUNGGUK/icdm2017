The main goal of XML is to facilitate the sharing of data across diverse information systems, especially via the Internet. XML Stylesheet Transformations (XSLT) is a standard approach to describing how to transform an XML document into another data format. The ever-increasing number of Web technologies being used in our everyday lives commonly employs XSLT to support data exchange among heterogeneous environments, and the associated increasing burdens on XSLT processors have increased the demand for high-performance XSLT processors. In this paper, we present an XSLT compiler, named Zebu, which can transform an XSLT stylesheet into the corresponding C program. The compiled program can be used to transform documents without the processing of XSLT stylesheets. The results of experimental testing using standard benchmarks show that the proposed XSLT compiler performs well in processing XML transformations.
