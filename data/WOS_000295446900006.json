Some multiagent platforms (MAP) are now providing baseline security features, such as authentication, authorization, integrity and confidentiality. However, they fail to support other features related to the sociability skills of agents such as agent groups. What is more, none of the listed MAPs provide a mechanism for preserving the privacy of the users (regarding their identities) that run their agents on such MAPs. In this paper, we present the security infrastructure (SI) of the Magentix MAP, which supports agent groups and preserves user identity privacy. The SI is based on identities that are assigned to all the different entities found in Magentix (users, agents and agent groups). We also provide an evaluation of the SI describing an example application built on top of Magentix and a performance evaluation of it.
