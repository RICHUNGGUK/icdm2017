In addition, the authors investigated the effects of an SCCR related to a \"combustion\" topic for sixth grade students conceptual change and scientific reasoning. An experimental research design including the Combustion Achievement Test (CAT), Scientific Reasoning Test (SRT) and Combustion Dependent Reasoning Test (CDRT) was applied for both experimental and conventional group students before, directly after, and after the sixth week of the research as pre-, post- and retention-test. Results indicated that the experimental group students significantly outperformed the conventional group students on both post- and retention- of CAT and CDRT scores. In addition, experimental group students performed better than conventional group students on the post-SRT scores. The success rate of conceptual change ranged from 70% to 100% for experimental group students for most web-based dual situated learning events. The nature of the scientific reasoning used by experimental group students mainly either made progression (PG) or maintain-correct (MTC) across most events from before to after web-based dual situated learning events. All of these results support the claim that students' conceptual change their scientific reasoning ability can be promoted through an SCCR digital learning program. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
