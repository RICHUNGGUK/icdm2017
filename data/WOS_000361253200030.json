Because the information that designers could master was limited, it was difficult to develop quickly the capability of satisfying consumer-oriented markets. This limitation may consequently cause the enterprises unnecessary risks. Based on this, a set of aesthetic evaluations and an optimization system for form aesthetics are proposed in this study. Calculations of explicit equations were performed so as to assisting in measuring the aesthetic characteristics; next, a fuzzy judgment was invoked to calculate the perceptual aesthetic measures of a product style so as to establish the overall aesthetic standard for the product. Aesthetic measurement principles were combined with the genetic algorithm (GA) and applied to the optimization of the product's shape. All-in-one stereos were chosen to serve as the target products as a case study. Further form optimization was conducted on two of the stereos and the questionnaire survey indicated that their aesthetic measures increased after the optimization. The errors that resulted from the equations for aesthetic measurements and judgments were also reduced accordingly. The precision and feasibility of the aesthetic theory that was constructed in this study were assessed, tested, and verified. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
