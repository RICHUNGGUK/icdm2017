In such environments, the development and evolution of ontologies must be seen as a dynamic process that has to be supported through the entire ontology life cycle, resulting to living ontologies. The aim of this paper is to present the Human-Centered Ontology Engineering Methodology (HCOME) for the development and evaluation of living ontologies in the context of communities of knowledge workers. The methodology aims to empower knowledge workers to continuously manage their formal conceptualizations in their day-to-day activities and shape their information space by being actively involved in the ontology life cycle. The paper also demonstrates the Human Centered ONtology Engineering Environment, HCONE, which can effectively support this methodology.", "paper_title": "Human-centered ontology engineering: The HCOME methodology", "paper_id": "WOS:000240040900006"}
