The sequences generate curves in the plane with an almost periodic structure. We generalize the results obtained by Davis and Knuth on the self-avoiding and planefilling properties of these curves, giving simple geometric criteria for a complete classification. Finally, we show how the automatic structure of the sequences leads to self-similarity of the curves, which turns the planefilling curves in a scaling limit into fractal tiles. For some of these tiles we give a particularly simple formula for the Hausdorff dimension of their boundary. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
