By means of classical analysis methods and Razumikhin technique, the criteria of uniform stability and uniform asymptotic stability for T-S fuzzy delay systems with impulse are obtained, respectively. Three numerical examples are also discussed to illustrate the efficiency of the obtained results.", "paper_title": "Stability of Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Delay Systems With Impulse", "paper_id": "WOS:000250372100003"}
