During the process of modeling, a hybrid learning algorithm combining backpropagation (BP) and least squares estimate (LSE) is adopted to identify linear and nonlinear parameters in the ANFIS. The validity and accuracy of modeling are tested by simulations and the simulation results reveal that the obtained ANFIS model can efficiently approximate the dynamic behavior of the SOFC stack. Thus it is feasible to establish the model of SOFC stack by ANFIS. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
