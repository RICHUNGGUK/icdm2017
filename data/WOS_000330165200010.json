We then present an alternate approach for the derivation of the exact joint distribution of (X-0, X-(r), Y-[r], Z([r]))(T), for r=1, ..., n. We show that these joint distributions can be expressed as mixtures of four-variate unified skew-elliptical distributions and these mixture forms facilitate the prediction of X-(r), say, based on the concomitants Y-[r] and Z([r]). Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of our results by a real data.", "paper_title": "Prediction based on linear combinations of order statistics and bivariate concomitants in the case of multivariate elliptical distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000330165200010"}
