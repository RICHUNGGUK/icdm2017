A stability theorem of fractional-order neural networks with time delay is derived. The stability conditions of the two-dimensional fractional-order neural networks with time delay are obtained. Furthermore, the three-dimensional fractional-order neural networks with different ring structures and time delay are proposed, and their stability conditions are derived. To illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results, numerical examples and simulations are also presented.", "paper_title": "Stability Analysis of Fractional-Order Neural Networks with Time Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000360565300013"}
