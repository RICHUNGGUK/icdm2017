Among these methods, locality preserving projection (LPP) is one of the most promising feature extraction techniques. Unlike the unsupervised learning scheme of LPP, this paper follows the supervised learning scheme, i.e. it uses both local information and class information to model the similarity of the data. Based on novel similarity, we propose two feature extraction algorithms, supervised optimal locality preserving projection (SOLPP) and normalized Laplacian-based supervised optimal locality preserving projection (NL-SOLPP). Optimal here means that the extracted features via SOLPP (or NL-SOLPP) are statistically uncorrelated and orthogonal. We compare the proposed SOLPP and NL-SOLPP with LPP, orthogonal locality preserving projection (OLPP) and uncorrelated locality preserving projection (ULPP) on publicly available data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed SOLPP and NL-SOLPP achieve much higher recognition accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
