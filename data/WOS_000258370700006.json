Thus, we refer to this approach as decisional trust, which can be achieved through the use of elements such as decisional DNA, reflexive ontologies, and security technologies. Decisional trust operates on three fronts: (1) the construction of decisional DNA as a knowledge structure capable of collecting an organization's decisional fingerprints; (2) the construction of Reflexive Ontologies as descriptions of concepts and relations with a set of selfcontained queries in a domain of study; and (3) the addition of security technologies. Our approach extends the use of Decisional DNA and Reflexive Ontologies with the aim of offering trustable decisions, and introduces elements for the exploitation of embedded, trustable, decisional knowledge which, added to security elements, can lead to trustable technologies. Fully developed, it would advance the notion of administering trustable knowledge in the current decision making environment.", "paper_title": "Combining technologies to achieve decisional trust", "paper_id": "WOS:000258370700006"}
