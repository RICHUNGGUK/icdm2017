The MATLAB platform is applied both for the neural identification and control of the distillation plant using the Levenberg-Marquardt approach, enabling also optimal input/output net configuration. The neural controller performance has been analyzed and illustrated via experimental tests on the pilot distillation column monitored under the LabVIEW platform. Both platforms have been linked together by constituting an integrated process control interface. The obtained experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the neural indirect adaptive control scheme as compared to proportional-integrative-derivative, when real-time multivariable control is demanded, even in presence of disturbances.
