We present a time space modelling approach and a generic software named ARPENTAGE - capable of clustering a territory based on its pluri-annual land-use organization. By adding the ability to represent, locate and visualize temporal changes in the territory, ARPENTAGE provides tools to build a Time-Dominant GIS. One main Markovian assumption is stated: the land-use succession in a given place depends only on the land-use successions in neighbouring plots. By means of stochastic models such as a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model and a Markov random field, ARPENTAGE performs an unsupervised clustering of a territory in order to reveal patches characterized by time space regularities in the land-use successions. Two case studies are developed involving two territories carrying environmental issues. Those territories have various sizes and are parameterized using long term surveys and/or remote sensing data. In both cases, ARPENTAGE detects, locates and displays in a GIS the temporal changes. This gives valuable information on the spatial and time dynamics of the land-use organization of those territories. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
