In this work, we present a non linear solver developed on OpenCL that is efficiently parallelizable on modern massively parallel architectures. We establish how parameterization relates to mesh smoothing and show how to efficiently and robustly solve the planar mesh parameterization problem with constraints. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach to real-time cut-and-paste editing and interactive mesh deformation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
