Most notably there are meta-variables ranging over formulae, variables, and terms, and properties of syntax such as alpha-equivalence, capture-avoiding substitution and assumptions about freshness of variables with respect to meta-variables. We present one-and-a-halfth-order logic, in which these concepts are made explicit. We exhibit both sequent and algebraic specifications of one-and-a-halfth-order logic derivability, show them equivalent, show that the derivations satisfy cut-elimination, and prove correctness of an interpretation of first-order logic within it. We discuss the technicalities in a wider context as a case-study for nominal algebra, as a logic in its own right, as an algebraisation of logic, as an example of how other systems might be treated, and also as a theoretical foundation for future implementation.", "paper_title": "One-and-a-halfth-order logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000257789100003"}
