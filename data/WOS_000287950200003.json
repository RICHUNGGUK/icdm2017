Traditionally, reliability analysis of combinational circuits is done using simulation or paper-and-pencil proof methods. But, these techniques do not ensure accurate results and thus may lead to disastrous consequences when dealing with safety-critical applications. In this paper, we mainly tackle the accuracy problem of these traditional reliability analysis approaches by presenting a formal reliability analysis framework based on higher-order-logic theorem proving. We present the higher-order-logic formalization of the notions of fault and reliability for combinational circuits and formally verify the von-Neumann fault models for most of the commonly used logic gates, such as, AND, NOT, OR, etc. This formal infrastructure is then used along with a computer program, written in C++, to automatically reason about the reliability of any combinational circuit within a higher-order-logic theorem prover (HOL). For illustration purposes, we utilize the proposed framework to analyze the reliability of a few benchmark combinational circuits. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
