This paper describes a social network monitoring system - the KIWI system - that enables users to register their interactions and visualize their social networks. The system was implemented in a distributed research community and the results have shown that KIWI facilitates collecting information about social interactions. Furthermore, the visualization of the social networks, given as feedback, appeared to have a positive impact on the group, augmenting their social network awareness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
