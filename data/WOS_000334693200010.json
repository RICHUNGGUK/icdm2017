Compared to traditional intrinsic-accuracy DACs, the static linearity is obtained by a series of subsidiary DACs which can shorten the calibration cycle with smaller additional circuits. The presented DAC is based on the segmented architecture and layout has been carefully designed so that better synchronization among the current sources can be achieved. The DAC is implemented in a standard 0.18-mu m CMOS technology and the current source block occupies less than 0.5mm(2). The measured differential nonlinearity (DNL) and integral nonlinearity (INL) performance is + 0.3LSB and + 0.5LSB, respectively, and the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) is 75 dB at 1MHz signal frequency and 200MHz sampling frequency.", "paper_title": "A 12-bit 200-MHz CURRENT-STEERING DAC WITH CALIBRATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000334693200010"}
