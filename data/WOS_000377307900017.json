Using stochastic geometry, we formulate the total outage probability at a typical RX in terms of the power and channel outage probability. The former incorporates a power receiver activation threshold at TX while the latter incorporates maximum transmit power at TX and interference at RX. For the special case of path-loss exponent of 4, we derive accurate expressions for the power, channel and total outage probability and study the effect of the system parameters on the outage performance.", "paper_title": "Outage Probability of Ad Hoc Networks With Wireless Information and Power Transfer", "paper_id": "WOS:000377307900017"}
