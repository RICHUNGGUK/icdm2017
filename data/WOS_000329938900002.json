In this paper, we look at the dual question of covering all edges of a graph by Hamilton cycles and prove that if a graph with maximum degree satisfies some basic expansion properties and contains a family of (1-o(1))/2 edge disjoint Hamilton cycles, then there also exists a covering of its edges by (1+o(1))/2 Hamilton cycles. This implies that for every > 0 and every pn-1 there exists a covering of all edges of G(n,p) by (1+o(1))np/2 Hamilton cycles asymptotically almost surely, which is nearly optimal.Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "paper_title": "On Covering Expander Graphs by Hamilton Cycles", "paper_id": "WOS:000329938900002"}
