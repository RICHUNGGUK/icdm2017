For k >= 1, the rainbow-k-connectivity of a graph G, denoted by rc(k)(G), is the minimum number of colors required to color the edges of G in such a way that every two distinct vertices are connected by at least k internally vertex-disjoint rainbow paths. In this paper, we study rainbow-k-connectivity in the setting of random graphs. We show that for every fixed integer d >= 2 and every k <= O(logn), p = (logn)(1/d)/n((d-1)/d) is a sharp threshold function for the property rc(k)(G(n, p)) <= d. This substantially generalizes a result in [Y. Caro. A. Lev, Y. Roditty, Z. Tuza, R. Yuster, On rainbow connection, Electron. J. Comb. 15 (2008)], stating that p = root logn/n is a sharp threshold function for the property rc(1)(G(n, p)) <= 2. As a by-product, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm that makes G(n, p) rainbow-k-connected using at most one more than the optimal number of colors with probability 1 - o(1), for all k <= O(logn) and p =n(-epsilon(1 +/- O(1))) for any constant epsilon is an element of vertical bar 10.1).
