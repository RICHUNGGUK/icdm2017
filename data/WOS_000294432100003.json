We show that \"white-box\" algorithms constructed with reusable components design can have significant benefits for researchers, and end users as well. We developed a component-based algorithm design platform, and used it for \"white-box\" algorithm construction. The proposed platform can also be used for testing algorithm parts ( reusable components), and their single or joint influence on algorithm performance. The platform is easily extensible with new components and algorithms, and allows testing of partial contributions of an introduced component. We propose two new heuristics in decision tree algorithm design, namely removal of insignificant attributes in induction process at each tree node, and usage of combined strategy for generating possible splits for decision trees, utilizing severalways of splitting together, which experimentally showed benefits. Using the proposed platform we tested 80 component-based decision tree algorithms on 15 benchmark datasets and present the results of reusable components' influence on performance, and statistical significance of the differences found. Our study suggests that for a specific dataset we should search for the optimal component interplay instead of looking for the optimal among predefined algorithms.", "paper_title": "Component-based decision trees for classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000294432100003"}
