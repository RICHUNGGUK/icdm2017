In this paper, we point out errors in an algorithm of Fossmeier and Kaufmann (CIAC, 1997) for recognizing proper 3-layer planar graphs, and then present a new characterization of this set of graphs that is partially based on their algorithm. Using the characterization, we then derive corresponding linear-time algorithms for recognizing and drawing proper 3-layer planar graphs. On the basis of our results, we predict that the approach of Fossmeier and Kaufmann will not easily generalize for drawings on four or more layers and suggest another possible approach along with some of the reasons why it may be more successful.", "paper_title": "Proper and planar drawings of graphs on three layers", "paper_id": "WOS:000235806300039"}
