Equal Length Cellular Automata (ELCA) are special classifications of CA having all generated equal length CA subspaces (cycles). Potential usages of ELCA have been reported for engineering applications [1-4]. A detailed analysis of ELCA generating linear and complemented linear rules has been presented in our work. General forms of characteristic matrix and characteristic polynomial for ELCA generation have been reported.
