The various previously considered trajectory-based operations can all be expressed in this formalism. It is shown that the generalized operations can simulate Turing machine computations. We consider the equivalence problem and a notion of unambiguity that is sufficient to make equivalence decidable for regular sets of trajectories under nonincreasing interpretations.", "paper_title": "Interpreted trajectories", "paper_id": "WOS:000240746400008"}
