This kind of fuzzy rules lets us represent knowledge about patterns of interest in an explanatory and understandable form which can be used by the expert. The evolutionary algorithm follows a multiobjective approach in order to optimize in a suitable way the different quality measures used in this kind of problems. Experimental evaluation of the algorithm, applying it to a market problem studied in the University of Mondragon (Spain), shows the validity of the proposal. The application of the proposal to this problem allows us to obtain novel and valuable knowledge for the experts.", "paper_title": "Multiobjective evolutionary induction of subgroup discovery fuzzy rules: A case study in marketing", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623700027"}
