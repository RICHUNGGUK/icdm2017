In this paper, a new enriched Co-based composition is proposed for dental application, starting from a conventional CoCrMo alloy. Macrostructural and microstructural investigations, mechanical and corrosion resistance evaluation, and metal ions release are carried out. The best composition, among the studied alloys, is identified for dental purpose.", "paper_title": "Study of Ti-Enriched CoCrMo Alloy for Dental Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200005"}
