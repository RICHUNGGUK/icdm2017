EQ-MAC protocol is an energy efficient and quality of service aware medium access protocol designed for wireless sensor networks. To extract some results from the developed model, we used analytical resolution, GreatSPN and WNSIM tools. Results demonstrate the efficiency of our protocol. This work demonstrates the usefulness and the possibility of using SAN or CPN for modeling and evaluating any other MAC protocols for wireless sensor networks. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
