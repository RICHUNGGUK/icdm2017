Identification of diatoms, i.e. assigning a new specimen to one of the known species, has applications in many disciplines, including ecology, palaeoecology and forensic science. The model we build represents life cycle and natural variation of both shape and texture over multiple diatom species, derived automatically from photographs and/or drawings. The model can be used to automatically produce drawings of diatoms at any stage of their life cycle development. Similar drawings are traditionally used for diatom identification, and encapsulate visually salient diatom features. In this article, we describe the methods used for analysis of photographs and drawings, present our model of diatom shape and texture variation, and finish with results of identification experiments using photographs and drawings as well as a detailed evaluation.", "paper_title": "A model of diatom shape and texture for analysis, synthesis and identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000240554700003"}
