To calculate the structural rank of the state matrices, to point out impulse modes and to study the structural controllability and observability, graphical methods are proposed. These methods are based on simple causal paths and causal manipulations on the bond graph model.", "paper_title": "Structural analysis of switching systems modelled by bond graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000235051400010"}
