There are several nice features of the proposed algorithm. The new method can significantly improve the distribution of sampling particles on the evolving interface. Unlike the original GBPM where footpoints (sampling points) tend to cluster to each other, the sampling points in the new method tend to be better separated on the interface. Moreover, by replacing the grid-based discretization using the cell-based discretization, we naturally decompose the interface into segments so that we can easily approximate surface integrals. As a possible alternative to the local polynomial least square approximation, we also study a geometric basis for local reconstruction in the resampling step. We will show that such modification can simplify the overall implementations. Numerical examples in two- and three-dimensions will show that the algorithm is computationally efficient and accurate.
