In a first step, a logic I(16) is presented as a Gentzen-type sequent calculus for an intuitionistic version of Odintsov's Hilbert-style axiom system LT (Kamide andWansing, 2009, Review of Symbolic Logic, 2, 374-395; Odintsov, 2009, Studia Logica, 91, 407-428). The cut-elimination theorem for I16 is proved using an embedding of I16 into Gentzen's LJ. The completeness theorem with respect to a Kripke-style semantics is also proved for I(16). The framework of I(16) is regarded as plausible and natural for the following reasons: (i) the properties of constructible falsity and paraconsistency with respect to some negation connectives hold for I(16), and (ii) sequent calculi for Belnap and Dunn's four-valued logic (Anderson et al., 1992, Entailment: The Logic of Relevance and Necessity; Belnap, 1977, A useful four-valued logic, In Modern uses of Multiple Valued Logic, pp. 5-37; Dunn, 1976, Philosophical Studies, 29, 149-168) and for Nelson's constructive four-valued logic (Almukdad and Nelson, 1984, Journal of Symbolic Logic, 49, 231-233) are included as natural subsystems of I16. In a second step, a logic IT(16) is introduced as a tableau calculus. The tableau system IT16 is an intuitionistic counterpart of Odintsov's axiom system for truth entailment satisfies(t) in SIXTEEN3 and of the sequent calculus for satisfies(t) presented in Wansing (2010, Journal of Philosophical Logic, to appear). The tableau calculus is also shown to be sound and complete with respect to a Kripke-style semantics. A tableau calculus for falsity entailment can be obtained by suitably modifying the notion of provability.", "paper_title": "Intuitionistic Trilattice Logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000284432700004"}
