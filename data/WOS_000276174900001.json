We also analyze the performance of such a network considering the presence of multiple-access interference and noise from incomplete dropping of the desired data and accidental dropping of the undesired data. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the proposed design with a two-node system operating at 2.5 Gbits/s. Error-free transmission is obtained and a 5.3 dB power penalty at a bit error rate of 10(-9) is measured for the worst connection configuration. The complete optical CDMA ring network is successfully demonstrated in truly asynchronous operation.", "paper_title": "Demonstration and Analysis of Asynchronous and Survivable Optical CDMA Ring Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000276174900001"}
