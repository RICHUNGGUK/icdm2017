This algorithm uses interval analysis to create a graph which has the same number of connected components as S. An example coming from robotics is presented to illustrate the interest of this algorithm for path-planning.", "paper_title": "Counting the number of connected components of a set and its application to robotics", "paper_id": "WOS:000237003200011"}
