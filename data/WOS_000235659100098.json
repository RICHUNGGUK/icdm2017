Helping users to locate relevant information in an efficient manner is very important both to users and to ICP services. This paper presents a new approach that employs a modified fuzzy ART network to group users dynamically based on their Web access patterns. Such a user clustering method should be performed prior to ICPs as the basis to provide personalized service. The experimental results of this clustering technique show the promise of our system.", "paper_title": "Application of a modified fuzzy ART network to user classification for Internet content provider", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100098"}
