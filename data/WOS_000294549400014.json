We provide some generalizations of the Halanay inequality, which is more accurate than the existing results. As applications, we discuss invariant set, dissipative synchronization, and global asymptotic stability for the Hopfield neural networks with infinite delays. We also prove that the dynamical systems with unbounded time-varying delays are globally asymptotically stable.", "paper_title": "Generalized Halanay Inequalities and Their Applications to Neural Networks with Unbounded Time-Varying Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000294549400014"}
