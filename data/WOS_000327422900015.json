However, given independent samples from the same absolutely continuous distribution, improved bounds can be attained. In this regard, we develop here point prediction based on L-statistics for predicting order statistics (OS) from a future sample as well as for predicting censored OS from a Type-II censored sample. An example is taken to illustrate these ideas, and the limiting case wherein a single independent sample is arbitrarily large is also discussed.", "paper_title": "Nonparametric prediction of future order statistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000327422900015"}
