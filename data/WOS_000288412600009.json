By the idea of Lyapunov function and the semi-martingale convergence theorem, both pth moment exponential stability and almost sure exponential stability are obtained. Moreover, the M-matrix technique is borrowed to make the results more applicable. Our criteria can be used not only in the case of bounded delay but also in the case of unbounded delay. Some earlier results are improved and generalized. An example is also given to demonstrate our results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
