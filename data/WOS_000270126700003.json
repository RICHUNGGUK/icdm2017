Oct. 2007, pp. 137-149], and also prove a couple of other theorems in the same vein. We point out two important ingredients needed for our proofs to work, and discuss some possible conclusions. Our key trick is to look at formulas of the type F = G Lambda H, where G and H are over disjoint sets of variables and have very different length-space properties with respect to resolution.
