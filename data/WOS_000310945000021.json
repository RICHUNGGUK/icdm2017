Natural language processing", " Text Analysis"], "paper_abstract": "In natural language processing (NIP), disambiguation is the procedure used to solve name conflicts of polysemic concepts (different meanings); in fact, phrase disambiguation is a problem not totally solved in NIP. Several disambiguation types exist; for instance, noun disambiguation (bank is a word with several meanings) or when a word is both used as a noun and as a preposition. Work herein reported describes an algorithm and its implementation to disambiguate prepositions in Spanish phrases; some of them are: a (to) (Translation to English are in bold for explanation purposes; they give only one of the senses of the Spanish word, which usually have multiple meanings.), ante (before), bajo (under), cabe (fits), desde (from), contra (against), en ( in), por (by), segun (according to), sin (without), entre (between), so (under), con (with), hacia (towards), sobre (about), hasta (until), de (of), tras (after), para (for). This tool will be used in a text analyzer (being built) that converts a text document to its corresponding ontology representation, with the goal of allowing another program to use the information to answer non trivial questions (**).
