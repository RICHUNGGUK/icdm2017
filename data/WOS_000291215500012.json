In this paper, the correlation of straight line length and driver's attention is studied through laboratory simulation experiment and regression analysis. It can be theoretically concluded that the maximum straight line length for prairie highway within which the driver could travel with proper attention is 5km. This study is significant both for prairie highway construction and Intelligent Transportation System.", "paper_title": "Analysis of the Maximum Straight Line Length for Prairie Highway using Driver's Heart Rate Variability", "paper_id": "WOS:000291215500012"}
