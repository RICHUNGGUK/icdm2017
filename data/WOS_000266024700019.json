Pie human model is constructed by a set of NURBS surfaces, and Me deformation and animation can be driven by motion capture data using a semantic model composed of 22 semantic joints. Each semantic joint includes 6 parameters. The deformation of each part of human model is implemented by use of coordinate interpolation based on the key coordinates which are seated on semantic joints and generated by the semantic model. Finally, the experimental results are illustrated, the main contributions and limitations are discussed.", "paper_title": "A SEMANTIC JOINT-BASED NURBS HUMAN BODY MODEL FOR MOTION CAPTURE DATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000266024700019"}
