In the proposed approach, an adjacent evaluation window is constructed to modify the threshold scheme of LBP. The neighbors of the neighborhood center g(c) are set as the evaluation center a(p). Surrounding the evaluation center, we set up an evaluation window and calculate the value of a(p), and then extract the local binary codes by comparing the value of a(p) with the value of the neighborhood center g(c). Moreover, this adjacent evaluation method is generalized and can be integrated with the existing LBP variants such as completed local binary pattern (CLBP) and local ternary pattern (LTP) to derive new image features against noise for texture classification. The proposed approaches are compared with the state-of-the-art approaches on Outex and CUReT databases, and evaluated on three challenging databases (i.e. UIUC, UMD and ALOT databases) for texture classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches present a solid power of texture classification under illumination and rotation variations, significant viewpoint changes, and significant large-scale challenging conditions. Furthermore, the proposed approaches are more robust against noise and consistently outperform all the basic approaches in comparison. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
