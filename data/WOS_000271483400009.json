The delivery of personalized, scalable, seamless, and trusted multimedia content delivery, while adequately protecting the content, is a key factor to provide seamless content services to the final user and provide a framework for user participation. This article describes novel forms of delivering seamless content services over P2P networks using multilayered/multiviewed content coding techniques, such as SVC/MVC, multisource/multinetwork streaming, and adaptation, with special focus on enabling content protection and lightweight asset management for a secure and privacy keeping content delivery. The implementation has been validated in the framework of the European Project SEA (IST-214063).", "paper_title": "PROTECTED SEAMLESS CONTENT DELIVERY IN P2P WIRELESS AND WIRED NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000271483400009"}
