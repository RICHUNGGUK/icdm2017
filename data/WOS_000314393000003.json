A clear and explicit definition of scope could help deciding which patterns match which parts of the domain to be represented. The authors demonstrate their argument by positioning existing conceptual data modeling patterns into a two-dimensional structuring framework that is constructed using two ontology-derived 'benchmark' patterns: an enterprise pattern for representing transactions (derived from the REA domain ontology) and an abstraction pattern for representing reality at different levels of abstraction (derived from the UFO foundational ontology). By means of an application scenario dealing with the conceptual design of a transactional enterprise database, the authors illustrate how the framework can be used to evaluate the relevancy and completeness of candidate patterns with respect to the problem at hand.", "paper_title": "RESEARCH NOTE Ontology-Based Structuring of Conceptual Data Modeling Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000314393000003"}
