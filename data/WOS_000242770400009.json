It is highly anticipated that the study of SNPs will help provide a means for elucidating the genetic component of complex diseases and variable drug responses. High-throughput technologies such as oligonucleotide arrays have produced enormous amount of SNP data, which creates great challenges in genome-wide disease linkage and association studies. In this paper, we present an adaptation of the cross entropy (CE) method and propose an iterative CE Monte Carlo (CEMC) algorithm for tagging SNP selection. This differs from most of SNP selection algorithms in the literature in that our method is independent of the notion of haplotype block. Thus, the method is applicable to whole genome SNP selection without prior knowledge of block boundaries. We applied this block-free algorithm to three large datasets (two simulated and one real) that are in the order of thousands of SNPs. The successful applications to these large scale datasets demonstrate that CEMC is computationally feasible for whole genome SNP selection. Furthermore, the results show that CEMC is significantly better than random selection, and it also outperformed another block-free selection algorithm for the dataset considered.", "paper_title": "Genome-wide tagging SNPs with entropy-based Monte Carlo method", "paper_id": "WOS:000242770400009"}
