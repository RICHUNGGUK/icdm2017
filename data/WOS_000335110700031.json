[H. Xiong, Z. Guan, Z. Chen, F. Li, An efficient certificateless aggregate signature with constant pairing computations, Information Science 219 (2013) 225-235] proposed a certificateless signature (CLS) scheme and used it to construct a certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) scheme with constant pairing computations. They demonstrated that both of their schemes are provably secure in the random oracle model under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. Unfortunately, by giving concrete attack, we demonstrate that their schemes are not secure against the Type II adversary, i.e. a Type II adversary could forge a legal signature of any message.
