These matrices are parameterized by positive integers L and N and a prime power q. The main result of this correspondence is that the simple condition L <= q + 1 is both necessary and sufficient for (L, N, q)-UDMs to exist. The existence proof is constructive and yields a coding scheme that is equivalent to a class of codes that was proposed by Rosenbloom and Tsfasman. Our work resolves an open problem posed recently in the literature.", "paper_title": "On the existence of universally decodable matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000247606300017"}
