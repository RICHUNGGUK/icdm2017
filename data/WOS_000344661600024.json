D-stability criteria are proposed to ensure that all the poles of the descriptor T-S fuzzy system are located within a disk contained in the unit circle. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is presented such that the closed-loop system is regular, causal, and D-stable, in spite of parameter uncertainties and multiple state delays. The corresponding solvability conditions for the desired fuzzy-rule-dependent nonfragile controllers are also established. Finally, examples are given to show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy-Model-Based D-Stability and Nonfragile Control for Discrete-Time Descriptor Systems With Multiple Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000344661600024"}
