These latter meshes originate from ONERA where they have been used for Euler simulations with the Elsa code. Elsa only uses block structured meshes so that we have transformed the \"ijk\" format of the mesh into a nonstructured one without modifying the location of vertices and the connectivity of the mesh, so that it is exactly the same mesh.
