In this paper, we argue the need for and significance of positioning the language and tool design from the perspective of practicality to address this challenge. We motivate, describe and justify such a practical design of a compilation framework for heterogeneous MPSoCs targeting the domain of streaming applications, named MAPS (MPSoC Application Programming Studio). MAPS defines a clean, light-weight C language extension to capture streaming programming models. A retargetable source-to-source compiler is developed to provide key capabilities to construct practical compilation frameworks for real-world, complex MPSoC platforms. Our results have shown that MAPS is a promising compiler infrastructure that enables programming of heterogeneous MPSoCs and increases productivity of MPSoC software developers.
