While much effort has been contributed to point-to-point communication based architecture and network game traffic, we proposed a server decentralized game architecture based on Jabber in order to have high availability, performance, scalability, fault tolerance and security. Three components of the architecture: players, game servers and record-keeper are defined and functioned. The architecture is implemented and instanced as a Chinese Chess game. The game data are packed with XML stanzas and delivered to the addressed player through XML streams. In order to test the availability, the game is experimented and the result is meaningful even though the test environment is rough.", "paper_title": "Chinese chess based on Jabber", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300083"}
