However, this algorithm has the following drawback: the classification efficiency is inversely proportional to the size of the training sample set. Therefore, to improve KMSE algorithm for obtaining efficient classification is significant. In this paper we analyze the disadvantages of the OLS algorithm, an improvement of KMSE algorithm, and propose to construct an improved KMSE (IKMSE) algorithm using the variable selection technique. We first select a small number of samples from the training sample set and call the selected samples elements. Then we use the elements to construct IKMSE algorithm, which has several advantages over other improved KMSE algorithms such as the OLS algorithm. Experiments show that IKMSE algorithm produces elements fewer than the total number of training samples. Consequently, the IKMSE-based classification procedure is much more efficient than the KMSE-based classification procedure. Experiments also show that the IIKMSE-based classification procedure is also more efficient and accurate than both SVM-based and the OLS-based procedures.", "paper_title": "A NEW KERNEL MSE ALGORITHM FOR CONSTRUCTING EFFICIENT CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000269395000029"}
