In given scheme, wavelet coefficients corresponding to the same spatial locations are grouped together. Two such groups, selected at random, constitute a supertree. Some of these supertrees are quantized to embed the watermark information in the image. In the process of cryptanalysis we first identify the groups which are quantized during the watermark insertion process. Then we select the non-quantized groups and quantize them too, to remove the watermark. Experimental results show that the watermark is completely removed by this attack. The cryptanalysis falls under the cipher text only jamming attack which requires only a single watermarked copy. Further, we suitably modify the WTQ scheme to make it robust against such cryptanalytic attacks.", "paper_title": "Analysis of the \"Wavelet Tree Quantization\" watermarking strategy and a modified robust scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000241949100007"}
