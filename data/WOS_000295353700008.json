In addition to cinemas, some well-known commercial video websites have started to provide traditional anaglyph 3D broadcast services \"red and blue color display.\" Owing to this trend, another multimedia revolution begins. However, there are too many choices of display technologies for users, such as anaglyph, gate-type, linear polarizer, circular polarizer and shutter, all of which typically require special monitors with different rendering methods. However, we cannot know what kinds of facilities will be adopted for the transmissions. Even with the support of different display technologies, there are still some technical problems because the same kind of rendering method cannot simultaneously support different 3D display technologies. Therefore, how to provide 3D multimedia services on the Internet becomes an important issue nowadays. This paper presents an efficient image compression strategy that provides services such as 3D, non-3D and even the free viewpoint video, and allows clients to select the compression strategies based on the types of the devices. Moreover, this paper proposes an algorithm that can optimize the packet priority for the transmission status while the videos are being transmitted on the Internet. Our experiments prove that this algorithm successfully integrates the image strategies with the packet priority and achieve \"a multi-mode 3D transmission system.\" 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
