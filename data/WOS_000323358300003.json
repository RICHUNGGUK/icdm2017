Disc-ring graphs possess many desirable topological properties in building parallel machines, such as fixed degree, small diameter, Hamiltonian decomposition, etc. We first examine the topological properties of disc-ring graphs and give an efficient routing algorithm for disc-ring graphs. We then bring forward a novel interconnection network of DQcube, which is a compound graph of disc-ring graph and hypercube. That is, it uses the hypercube as a unit cluster and connects many such clusters by means of a disc-ring graph at the cost that only one additional link is added to any node in each hypercube. The topological benefits of both basic graphs are preserved in the compound network. It utilizes the topological properties of hypercube to conveniently embed parallel algorithms into each cluster and the short diameter of disc-ring graph to support an efficient inter-cluster communication. The proposed methodologies for DQcube are further applied to many other compound graphs of disc-ring graph and hypercube-like graphs, including locally twisted cube, twisted cube, crossed cube, and Mobius cube, with diameter being a half of that of hypercube. We also give and analyze an efficient routing algorithm for the proposed compound networks in this article. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
