Obtained results extend and generalize the main results of [S. B. Nadler Jr., Multi-valued contraction mappings, Pacific Journal of Mathematics 30 (1969) 475-488] and [D. Wardowski, On set-valued contractions of Nadler type in cone metric spaces, Applied Mathematics Letters 24 (2011) 275-278]. Two examples are given to illustrate the usability of the results.
