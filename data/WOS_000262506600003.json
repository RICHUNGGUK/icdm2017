Two scenarios are considered: (1) the kinetics coefficients of the process are completely known and the process states are partly known (measured); (2) the kinetics coefficients and the states of the process are partly known. The contribution of the paper is twofold. From one side we formulate a hybrid (ANN and mechanistic) model that outperforms the traditional reaction rate estimation approaches. From other side, a new procedure for NN supervised training is proposed when target outputs are not available. The two scenarios are successfully tested for two benchmark problems, estimation of the precipitation rate of calcium phosphate and estimation of sugar crystallization growth rate.", "paper_title": "Artificial neural networks for modeling in reaction process systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000262506600003"}
