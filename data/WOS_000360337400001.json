Motivated by the applicability of the technique on smartphones, we explore this design space by introducing a way to map the available degrees of freedom and discuss the design decisions that were made. We subjected INSPECT to a formal user study against a baseline wand interaction technique using a Polhemus tracker. Results show that INSPECT is 12% faster in a 3D translation task while at the same time being 40% more accurate. INSPECT also performed similar to the wand at a 3D rotation task and was preferred by the users overall.", "paper_title": "INSPECT: extending plane-casting for 6-DOF control", "paper_id": "WOS:000360337400001"}
