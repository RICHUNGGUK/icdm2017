Digital surface models (DSM) acquired by laser scanning are also becoming popular for urban planning and other applications. This paper deals with the integration of data sets of these types. An Ikonos image of an urban area was oriented, with sub-pixel accuracy, using the DSM as ground control, in order to produce a true ortho-image. This method works successfully, solving the important problem of relief displacement of buildings. A straightforward procedure of predicting shadow areas from the DSM was also attempted, in order to compensate for sha dow effects. The success was limited due to the time difference between the acquisition of the two datasets.", "paper_title": "Geometric and radiometric improvement of an Ikonos panchromatic image using a digital surface model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600067"}
