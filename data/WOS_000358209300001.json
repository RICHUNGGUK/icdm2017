In this paper, we investigate the convergence rate estimate problem of a distributed localization algorithm which approximately formulates the localization problem as the convex feasibility problem including the consistent case and the inconsistent case. Although existing works established optimal consensus convergence analysis for this algorithm, they did not provide the convergence rate estimate. In this paper, we mainly show that for the consistent case the convergence rate of the optimal consensus will be exponential under some basic conditions, while for the inconsistent case we provide a necessary condition for the optimal consensus and a convergence rate estimate inequality. Furthermore, numerical examples are also provided to validate the established convergence and convergence rate results.", "paper_title": "Convergence Rate Estimate of Distributed Localization Algorithms in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000358209300001"}
