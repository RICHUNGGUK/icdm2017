We use a general DRAM/SRAM architecture for which previous proposals can be seen as particular cases. For this architecture, large SRAMs are needed to sustain high line rates and a large number of interfaces. A novel algorithm for DRAM bank allocation is presented that reduces the SRAM size requirements of previously proposed schemes by almost an order of magnitude, without having memory fragmentation problems. A technological evaluation shows that our design can support thousands of queues for line rates up to 160 Gbps.", "paper_title": "A DRAM/SRAM memory scheme for fast packet buffers", "paper_id": "WOS:000236116200009"}
