One of the most challenging shortcomings of TDD is the low level of granularity and abstraction. This may lead to production of software that is not acceptable by the end users. Additionally, exploiting of TDD is not applicable in the enterprise systems development. To overcome this defect, we have merged TDD with Model Based Testing (MBT) and suggested a framework named Model Based Test Driven Development (MBTDD). According to TDD, writing test cases comes before programming, and based on our improved method of TDD, modeling precedes writing test cases. To validate the applicability of the proposed framework, we have implemented a use case of Human Resource Management (HRM) system by means of MBTDD. The empirical results of using MBTTD show that our proposed method overwhelms existing deficiencies of TDD.", "paper_title": "MBTDD: MODEL BASED TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000317142000005"}
