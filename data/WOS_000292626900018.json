With the introduction of concept of packet displacement, a mathematical model is constructed to fully describe the real-time dynastic characteristic of MIMO wireless network, such as packet disordering. It is worthwhile mentioned that the resulting closed-loop systems are jump linear systems due to the newest signals executed subject to Markovian chains, based on which an adaptive and optimal controller is designed such that optimal H-infinity norm bound is obtained in terms of Markovian theory combined with linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques. Finally, experimental simulations are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "MIMO CHANNEL COMMUNICATION-BASED H-infinity CONTROL OF WIRELESS NETWORKED CONTROL SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000292626900018"}
