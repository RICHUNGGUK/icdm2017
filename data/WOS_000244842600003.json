The main problem of this routing scheme is the difference among the delays of selected paths, which causes reordering of a single flow's packets. In this paper, this problem is analyzed through a sociological perspective. We show that reordering problem is not inherently related to multipath routing, rather caused by the dominant capitalist view of the problem. Then, the problem is addressed through a Marxism perspective. We theoretically prove that by this perspective, there exists a routing scheme that minimizes latency and also the requirement of buffering at receiver.", "paper_title": "A sociological perspective on the reordering problem in multipath routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000244842600003"}
