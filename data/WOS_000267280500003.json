However, to enhance and maximize the benefits of adaptation, there is a need to go beyond mere computational and device capabilities to encompass the full spectrum of context-awareness. This paper presents a general approach for context-aware adaptive mining of data streams that aims to dynamically and autonomously adjust data stream mining parameters according to changes in context and situations. We perform intelligent and real-time analysis of data streams generated from sensors that is under-pinned using context-aware adaptation. A prototype of the proposed architecture is implemented and evaluated in the paper through a real-world scenario in the area of healthcare monitoring.", "paper_title": "Context-aware adaptive data stream mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000267280500003"}
