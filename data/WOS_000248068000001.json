The HFC filter is particularly effective for reducing high-impulse noise in digital images while preserving edge sharpness. Colour images that are corrupted with noise are generally filtered by applying a greyscale algorithm on each colour component separately. This approach causes artefacts especially on edge or texture pixels. Vector-based filtering methods were successfully introduced to overcome this problem. In this paper, we discuss an alternative technique so that no artefacts are introduced. The main difference between the new proposed method and the classical vector-based methods is the usage of colour component differences for the detection of impulse noise and the preservation of the colour component differences. The construction of the HFC filter involves three steps: (1) the estimation of the original histogram of the colour component differences, (2) the construction of suitable fuzzy sets for representing the linguistic values of these differences and (3) the construction of fuzzy rules that determine the output. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed filter outperforms many well-known filters (including vector-based approaches). (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
