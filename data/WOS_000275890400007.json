In this paper, we propose an MPSoC architecture for implementing real-time signal processing in gamma camera. Based on a fully analysis of the characteristics of the application, we design several algorithms to optimize the systems in terms of processing speed, power consumption, and area costs etc. Two types of DSP core have been designed for the integral algorithm and the coordinate algorithm, the key parts of signal processing in a gamma camera. An interconnection synthesis algorithm is proposed to reduce the area cost of the Network-on-Chip. We implement our MPSoC architecture on FPGA, and synthesize DSP cores and Network-on-Chip using Synopsys Design Compiler with a UMC 0.18 mu m standard cell library. The results show that our technique can effectively accelerate the processing and satisfy the requirements of real-time signal processing for 256 x 256 image construction.", "paper_title": "Design and Synthesis of a Multiprocessor System-on-Chip Architecture for Real-Time Biomedical Signal Processing in Gamma Cameras", "paper_id": "WOS:000275890400007"}
