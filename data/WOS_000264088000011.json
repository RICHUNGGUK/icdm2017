This problem was proposed by Hajiaghayi and Jain in SODA'06. Thereafter, using a Lagrangian relaxation technique, Segev et al. gave the first approximation algorithm to this problem in ESA'06, with performance ratio O(n(2/3) log l). We give a simpler and faster approximation algorithm to this problem with performance ratio O(n(2/3) log k) via greedy approach, improving the previously best known ratio in the literature.
