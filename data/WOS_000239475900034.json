According to the principles of Ludics, the commuting quantifiers have a \"locative\" nature, in particular, quantified formulas are not defined modulo variable renaming. The solution is given by defining a new correctness criterion for first-order multiplicative proof structures that characterizes the system obtained by adding a congruence implying for all x(A circle times B) = for all xA circle times for all xB to first-order multiplicative linear logic with locative quantifiers. In the conclusions we shall briefly discuss the interpretation of locative quantifiers as storage operators.", "paper_title": "Commutative locative quantifiers for multiplicative linear logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000239475900034"}
