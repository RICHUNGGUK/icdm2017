First, for such T-S fuzzy models, an H-infinity fault estimation observer with pole-placement constraint is proposed to achieve fault estimation. Based on the generalized Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma, the given finitefrequency observer possesses less conservatism compared with the design of the entire-frequency domain. Furthermore, the performance of the presented fault estimation observer is further enhanced by adding the degree of freedom. Finally, two examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.", "paper_title": "Analysis and Design of Robust H-infinity Fault Estimation Observer with Finite-Frequency Specifications for Discrete-Time Fuzzy Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000356386300001"}
