As usual for Set Packing problems, we seek a collection S' subset of S consisting of at least k sets subject to certain disjointness restrictions. In the r-Set Packing with t-Membership, each element of U belongs to at most t sets of S', while in r-Set Packing with t-Overlap, each pair of sets in S' overlaps in at most t elements. For both problems, each set of S has at most r elements. Similarly, both of our Graph Packing problems seek a collection K of at least k subgraphs in a graph G, each isomorphic to a graph H. H. In H-Packing with t-Membership, each vertex of G belongs to at most t subgraphs of K, while in H-Packing with t-Overlap, each pair of subgraphs in K overlaps in at most t vertices. For both problems, each member of H has at most r vertices and m edges, where t, r, and mare constants. Here, we show NP-completeness results for all of our packing problems. Furthermore, we give a dichotomy result for the H-Packing with t-Membership problem analogous to the Kirkpatrick and Hell dichotomy [Kirkpatrick and Hell 1978]. Using polynomial parameter transformations, we reduce the r-Set Packing with t-Membership to a problem kernel with O((r + 1)(r)k(r)) elements and the H-Packing with t-Membership and its edge version to problem kernels with O((r + 1)(r)k(r)) and O((m + 1)(m)k(m)) vertices, respectively. On the other hand, by generalizing [Fellows et al. 2008; Moser 2009], we achieve a kernel with O(r(r)k(r-t-1)) elements for the r-Set Packing with t-Overlap and kernels with O(r(r)k(r-t-1)) and O(m(m)k(m-t-1)) vertices for the H-Packing with t-Overlap and its edge version, respectively. In all cases, k is the input parameter, while t, r, and mare constants.", "paper_title": "Using Parametric Transformations Toward Polynomial Kernels for Packing Problems Allowing Overlaps", "paper_id": "WOS:000361246100004"}
