This in turn is vital to achieve service-oriented Grid computing that harnesses resources distributed worldwide based on users' objectives. Recently, numerous market-based RMSs have been proposed to make use of real-world market concepts and behavior to assign resources to users for various computing platforms. The aim of this paper is to develop a taxonomy that characterizes and classifies how market-based RMSs can support utility-driven cluster computing in practice. The taxonomy is then mapped to existing market-based RMSs designed for both cluster and other computing platforms to survey current research developments and identify outstanding issues.
