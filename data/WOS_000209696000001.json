We will firstly review our previous study on build wiretap channel I in which the eavesdropper sees a binary symmetric channel (BSC) with error probability p while the main channel is error free. To make p as close to 0.5 as possible, the paper introduces a novel security code which helps turning the original system to achieve unconditional secure communications. Extensive simulation is conducted and the results verify our approach.", "paper_title": "On Achieving Unconditional Secure Communications over Binary Symmetric Channels (BSC)", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696000001"}
