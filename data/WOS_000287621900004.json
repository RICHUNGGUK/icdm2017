In this context, continuous curved shape surface schemes using only the information related to the triangle corresponding to the patch under construction, emerged as attractive solutions responding to the requirements of resource-limited hardware environments. In this paper we provide a unifying comparison of the local parametric C curved shape schemes we are aware of, based on a reformulation of their original constructions in terms of polynomial Bezier triangles. With this reformulation we find a geometric interpretation of all the schemes that allows us to analyse their strengths and shortcomings from a geometrical point of view. Further, we compare the four schemes with respect to their computational costs, their reproduction capabilities of analytic surfaces and their response to different surface interrogation methods on arbitrary triangle meshes with a low triangle count that actually occur in their real-world use.
