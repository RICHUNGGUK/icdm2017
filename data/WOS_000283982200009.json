With attention to power-efficient communication in the body sensor network, RF power transfer was estimated and the required low-power ICs, which are important in the development of a healthcare system with miniaturization and system integration, are discussed based on the RFID platform. To analyze the power transformation, this paper adopts a 915-MHz industrial, scientific, and medical RF with a radiation power of 70 mW to estimate the power loss under the 1-m communication distance between an RFID reader (bioinformation node) and a transponder (biosignal acquisition nodes). The low-power ICs of the transponder will be implemented in the TSMC 0.18-mu m CMOS process. The simulation result reveals that the transponder's IC can fit in with the link budget of the UHF RFID system.", "paper_title": "A Low-Power RFID Integrated Circuits for Intelligent Healthcare Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283982200009"}
