However, there are some unresolved issues in building adaptive educational systems that adapt to individual traits. For example it is not obvious what is the appropriate educational theory with which to develop instructional resources and model individual traits. This paper describes an experiment using the Multiple Intelligence (MI) based adaptive intelligent educational system, EDUCE, that explores how different categories of resources are used when the learner has complete control and when adaptive presentation strategies are employed. In particular it explores how Musical/Rhythmic traits and resources impact on performance. Results suggest that students prefer using Musical/Rhythmic resources to other types of resources, however it is not clear how this preference can be best employed to enhance learning performance.", "paper_title": "Using multiple intelligence informed resources in an adaptive system", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100041"}
