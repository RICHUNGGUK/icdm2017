This paper presents a general validation approach that generalizes different expert-driven validation methods developed for specialized validation problems. In particular, we model the validation process as a sequence of validation operators, explore various properties of such sequences, and present theoretical results that provide for better understanding of the validation process. We also address the problem of selecting the best validation sequence among the class of equivalent sequence permutations. We demonstrate that this optimization problem is NP-hard and present two heuristic algorithms for improving validation sequences.", "paper_title": "Validation sequence optimization: A theoretical approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000248670900005"}
