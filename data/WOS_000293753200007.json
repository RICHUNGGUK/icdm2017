In this paper, we propose a self-stabilizing emulation technique that provides reliable communication on a virtual topology in the presence of transient faults in real topology. The proposed protocol improves the execution slowdown of previous two protocols [19, 20] and provides adaptive message delivery delay on the emulated channels, which is a new type of adaptability against transient faults.", "paper_title": "RELIABLE COMMUNICATION ON EMULATED CHANNELS RESILIENT TO TRANSIENT FAULTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000293753200007"}
