The SOS relaxation method is used to compute approximate invariants and approximate ranking functions with floating point coefficients. Then Gauss-Newton refinement and rational vector recovery are applied to approximate polynomials to obtain candidate polynomials with rational coefficients, which exactly satisfy the conditions of invariants and ranking functions. In the end, several examples are given to show the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Proving total correctness and generating preconditions for loop programs via symbolic-numeric computation methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000334183200003"}
