We obtain the basis with a novel spherical subdivision scheme that defines a partition acting as the domain of the basis functions. Our construction refutes earlier claims doubting the existence of a basis that is both orthogonal and symmetric. Experimental results for the representation of spherical signals verify that the superior theoretical properties of the SOHO wavelet basis are also relevant in practice.", "paper_title": "SOHO: Orthogonal and symmetric Haar wavelets on the sphere", "paper_id": "WOS:000255121300004"}
