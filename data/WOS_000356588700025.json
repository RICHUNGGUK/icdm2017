This issue is resolved for concentrated tampering. In contrast, for diverse tampering, only localization is realized. This paper presents a restoration method for the most accurate scheme tolerant against diverse tampering. We analyze the error probability and experimentally confirm that the proposed method accurately restores the tampered pixels. We also show two variations based on the fact that the authentication data used for deriving the watermark is a maximum length sequence code.", "paper_title": "Individual Restoration of Tampered Pixels for Statistical Fragile Watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000356588700025"}
