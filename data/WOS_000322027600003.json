Fault tolerance and transmission delay of networks are important concepts in network design. The notions are strongly related to connectivity and diameter of a graph, and have been studied by many authors. Wide diameter of a graph combines studying connectivity with the diameter of a graph. Diameter with width k of a graph G, k-diameter, is defined as the minimum integer d for which there exist at least k internally disjoint paths of length at most d between any two distinct vertices in G. Denote by D-c(W) (G) the c-diameter of G and kappa (G) the connectivity of G. We prove that D-a+b(W) (B * F) <= r(a) (F) + D-b(W) (B) + 1 for a <= kappa (F) and b <= kappa(B). The Rabin number r(c) (G) is the minimum integer d such that there are c internally disjoint paths of length at most d from any vertex v to any set of c vertices {v(1), v(2), ... , v(c)}.", "paper_title": "Wide-diameter of Product Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000322027600003"}
