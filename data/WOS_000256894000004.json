Remote data possession checking protocols permit checking that a remote server can access an uncorrupted file in such a way that the verifier does not need to know beforehand the entire file that is being verified. Unfortunately, current protocols only allow a limited number of successive verifications or are impractical from the computational point of view. In this paper, we present a new remote data possession checking protocol such that 1) it allows an unlimited number of file integrity verifications and 2) its maximum running time can be chosen at set-up time and traded off against storage at the verifier.", "paper_title": "Efficient remote data possession checking in critical information infrastructures", "paper_id": "WOS:000256894000004"}
