The objective is to construct a reduced-order model, winch ensures that the resulting error system under switching signal with ADT is exponentially stable with an H-infinity norm bound. A weighting factor cm is introduced to construct a Lyapunov function for switched delay systems such that ADT approach is used with piecewise Lyapunov matrices instead of common Lyapunov function matrices. Furthermore, sufficient conditions for the solvability of this problem are obtained in terms of strict linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which lessen the computation complexity. A numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of the developed method.", "paper_title": "NEW RESULTS ON MODEL REDUCTION FOR DISCRETE-TIME SWITCHED SYSTEMS WITH TIME DELAY", "paper_id": "WOS:000305161000034"}
