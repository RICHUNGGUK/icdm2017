This model consists of a set of meta-schedulers on each of the grid infrastructures of the Federated Grid. Each meta-scheduler has to implement a mapping strategy in order to improve two of the most common objective functions of task scheduling problems: makespan and resource performance. We consider four possible algorithms that have to provide a simple, decoupled, and coarse-grained solution that could be deployed in any Grid. The main axis of the algorithms is that they consider the performance of the infrastructures forming the Federated Grid, not only their state. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
