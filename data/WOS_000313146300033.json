Our task is distributed itemset mining, which is frequent itemset mining from horizontally partitioned databases stored in distributed places called sites. We focus on the fundamental case in which there are two sites and each site has a database managed by its owner. By dividing the process of distributed itemset mining into the set union and the set intersection, we show how to make the operations secure in the sense of undistinguishability of data, which is our criterion for privacy preserving based on the already proposed criterion, p-indistinguishability. Our method conceals the original data in each operation by inserting dummy data, where ZDDs, BDD-based directed acyclic graphs, are adopted to represent sets of itemsets compactly and to implement the set operations in constructing the distributed itemset mining process. As far as we know, this is the first technique which gives a concrete representation of sets of itemsets and an implementation of set operations for privacy preserving in distributed itemset mining. Our experiments show that the proposed method provides undistinguishability of dummy data. Furthermore, we compare our method with Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC), which is one of the well-known techniques of secure computation.", "paper_title": "Privacy Preserving Using Dummy Data for Set Operations in Itemset Mining Implemented with ZDDs", "paper_id": "WOS:000313146300033"}
