Typical tracking with histogram-wise matching provides robustness but has insufficient accuracy, because it does not involve spatial information. On the other hand, tracking with pixel-wise matching achieves accurate performance but is not robust against deformation of a target object. To find the best compromise between robustness and accuracy, in our paper, we combine histogram-wise matching and pixel-wise template matching via constrained optimization problem. Firstly, we propose a novel weight image representing both the probability of foreground and the degree of similarity between the template and a candidate target image. The weight image is used to formulate an objective function for the histogram-wise weight matching. Then the pixel-wise matching is formulated as a constrained optimization problem using the result of the histogram-wise weight matching. In consequence, the proposed approach optimizes pixel-wise template similarity (for accuracy) under the constraints of histogram-wise feature similarity (for robustness). Experimental results show the combined effects, and demonstrate that our method outperforms recent tracking algorithms in terms of robustness, accuracy, and computational cost. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
