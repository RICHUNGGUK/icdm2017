The problems discussed include single-machine and multiple-machine scheduling problems, the traveling salesman problem, vehicle routing problems, and many others. Each of these problems requires a different distance measure that takes the specific properties of the representation into account. The distance measures discussed in this paper are based on a general distance measure for string comparison called the edit distance. We introduce several extensions to the simple edit distance, that can be used when a solution cannot be represented as a simple permutation, and develop algorithms to calculate them efficiently.", "paper_title": "Distance measures based on the edit distance for permutation-type representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000243354600002"}
