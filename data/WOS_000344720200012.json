Akin to the controlled experiments designed to test the supposed mathematical ability of the famous horse \"Clever Hans,\" we perform two experiments to show how three state-of-the-art MIR systems produce excellent FoM in spite of not using musical knowledge. This provides avenues for improving MIR systems, as well as their evaluation. We make available a reproducible research package so that others can apply the same method to evaluating other MIR systems.", "paper_title": "A Simple Method to Determine if a Music Information Retrieval System is a \"Horse\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000344720200012"}
