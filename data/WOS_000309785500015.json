The proposed method proceeds by numerically inverting the conventional likelihood ratio test. In order to hedge against the risk of a spurious rejection, candidate points that are rejected by the conventional test undergo a finite-sample parametric bootstrap test. A projection technique is then exploited to produce conservative confidence sets for general functions of the parameters. A simulation study illustrates the performance of the parametric bootstrap approach in the context of a GARCH model with heavy-tailed and skewed innovations. That model is then used in an empirical application to construct simultaneous confidence intervals for multi-step ahead volatility forecasts for the returns on a major stock market index.
