Applying Raman spectroscopy to measure single-axis crystalline silicon, the relationship between the screw rotation amount and the strain is advanced. By using a laser with a 648 nm wavelength, the Raman spectra frequency shift of 0.47 cm(-1) is measured when the screw rotation amount is 1.5 mm. The strain coefficient b of -335.7 cm(-1), obtained for the (100) uniaxial strain silicon, agrees with the result of the lattice vibration model.", "paper_title": "Strain coefficient measurement for the (100) uniaxial strain silicon by Raman spectroscopy", "paper_id": "WOS:000293188100020"}
