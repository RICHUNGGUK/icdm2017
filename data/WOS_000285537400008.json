Firstly, the image is predetermined by using fast color quantization algorithm with clusters merging, and then a small number of dominant colors and their percentages can be obtained. Secondly, the spatial texture features are extracted using a steerable filter decomposition, which offers an efficient and flexible approximation of early processing in the human visual system. Thirdly, the pseudo-Zernike moments of an image are used for shape descriptor, which have better features representation capabilities and are more robust to noise than other moment representations. Finally, the combination of the color, texture and shape features provide a robust feature set for image retrieval. Experimental results show that the proposed color image retrieval is more accurate and efficient in retrieving the user-interested images. (c) 2010 Elsevier By.
