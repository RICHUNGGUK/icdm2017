Dealing with imbalance by means of resampling methods is an approach that has been deeply studied lately, primarily in the context of traditional (non-multilabel) classification. In this paper the process of synthetic instance generation for multilabel datasets (MLDs) is studied and MLSMOTE (Multilabel Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), a new algorithm aimed to produce synthetic instances for imbalanced MLDs, is proposed. An extensive review on how imbalance in the multilabel context has been tackled in the past is provided, along with a thorough experimental study aimed to verify the benefits of the proposed algorithm. Several multilabel classification algorithms and other multilabel oversampling methods are considered, as well as ensemble-based algorithms for imbalanced multilabel classification. The empirical analysis shows that MLSMOTE is able to improve the classification results produced by existent proposals. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
