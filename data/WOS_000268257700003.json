Not only can this cut down the cost of genotyping by filtering a large number of redundant SNPs, but also it can accelerate the study of genome-wide disease association. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid method called CMDStagger that combines the ideas of the clustering and the graph algorithm, to find the minimum set of tagSNPs. The proposed algorithm uses the information of the linkage disequilibrium association and the haplotype diversity to reduce the information loss in tagSNP selection, and has no limit of block partition. The approach is tested on eight benchmark datasets from Hapmap and chromosome 5q31. Experimental results show that the algorithm in this paper can reduce the selection time and obtain less tagSNPs with high prediction accuracy. It indicates that this method has better performance than previous ones.", "paper_title": "A hybrid clustering and graph based algorithm for tagSNP selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000268257700003"}
