Our approach is to connect individual researcher data on funding from Swedish university databases to data on incoming grants using the specific personal ID-number. Data on funding include the person responsible for the grant. All types of research income are considered in the analysis yielding a project database with a high level of precision. Results show that productivity can be explained by background variables, but that quality of research is more or less un-related to background variables.", "paper_title": "Research quality and diversity of funding: A model for relating research money to output of research", "paper_id": "WOS:000265778100009"}
