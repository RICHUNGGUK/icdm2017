To describe microstructures, this analysis shows that nonmanifold models are of interest. These models can be intuitively understood as combinations of wires, surfaces, and volumes. Minimum acceptable wall thickness, wire dimension, and laser density of energy are among the elements justifying this category of models. Taking into account this requirement, a model preparation and processing scheme is proposed that widens the laser beam trajectories with a concept of extended layer manufacturing technique. A tessellation process suited for non-manifold models has been developed for computer-aided design models imported from standard for the exchange of product files. After tessellation, several polyhedral subdomains form a nonmanifold polyhedron. To plan the trajectories of the laser beam, adaptive slicing and global 3D hatching processes as well as a \"welding\" process (for joining subdomains of different dimensionality) have been combined. Finally, two nonmanifold microstructures are fabricated according to the proposed model preparation and processing scheme.", "paper_title": "Product model preparation and processing for micromanufacturing", "paper_id": "WOS:000256582700004"}
