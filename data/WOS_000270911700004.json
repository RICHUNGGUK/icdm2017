Immersive environments can provide realistic context for team training, where success relies on practiced coordination between individual members. Using immersive virtual environments, medical teams can practice in situations that would otherwise be difficult or expensive to create. It has been shown that individuals perform poorly when the training environment differs significantly from practice 2005. Efforts have been made to close this gap using virtual environments. Interacting in a virtual space requires a robust locomotion paradigm. Locomotion paradigms are methods that allow an individual to move and navigate through virtual environments. Locomotion paradigms should be intuitive to the user, and not distract from the central task of medical training. In this paper, we describe and evaluate four locomotion paradigms, Look & Go, Push & Go, Point & Go, and Grab & Drag, using objective metrics to evaluate navigational efficiency. This study was performed with 98 volunteers predominantly of clinical backgrounds. With the comparison between the performances of game-playing and non-game-playing subjects, we have shown that game-playing experiences do not significantly affect the locomotion performances with the four proposed paradigms. The results of this study suggests the Grab & Drag as the best method among four locomotion paradigms in triage/trauma scenarios, where trainees need to find and help patients scattered in a large area.", "paper_title": "A study of locomotion paradigms for immersive medical simulation environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000270911700004"}
