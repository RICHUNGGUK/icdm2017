This paper presents a technique for such integration that is based on HTML widgets. We discuss three example systems (Google Book Classes, Tictoclookup, and MAJAX) that implement this technique. These systems can be easily adapted without requiring programming experience or expensive hosting.", "paper_title": "Web Services and Widgets for Library Information Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000278419600006"}
