The work done is based on a non-linear tool and several computer simulations. The study indicates how to analyze a Microgrid system that is subjected to a severe transient disturbance by using its large signal model without the necessity of the small signal analysis as it is commonly applied.", "paper_title": "Stability Analysis of a Microgrid System based on Inverter-Interfaced Distributed Generators", "paper_id": "WOS:000326321600003"}
