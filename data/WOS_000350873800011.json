The Fibonacci cube I\" (h) is the subgraph of the h-cube induced by the Fibonacci strings. These graphs are applicable as interconnection networks and in theoretical chemistry, and lead to the Fibonacci dimension of a graph. We derive a new characterization of Fibonacci cubes. The characterization is the basis for an algorithm which recognizes these graphs in linear time. Moreover, a graph which was recognized as a Fibonacci cube can be embedded into a hypercube using Fibonacci strings within the same time bound.", "paper_title": "Linear Recognition and Embedding of Fibonacci Cubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000350873800011"}
