Based on conventional triangular membership functions used in fuzzy inference systems, the modified triangular membership functions are proposed to improve a system's performance according to knowledge-based reasonings. The parameters of the considered controllers are tuned by means of genetic algorithms (GAs) using a fitness function associated with the system's performance indices. The merits of the proposed controllers are illustrated by considering a model of the induction motor control system and a higher-order numerical model. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
