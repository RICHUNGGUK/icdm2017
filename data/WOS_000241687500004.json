We discover that current systems for encrypting content to sets of users are subject to attacks on user privacy. We propose a new mechanism, private broadcast encryption, to protect the privacy of users of encrypted file systems and content delivery systems. We construct a private broadcast scheme, with a strong privacy guarantee against an active attacker, that achieves ciphertext length, encryption time, and decryption time comparable with the non-private schemes currently used in encrypted file systems.", "paper_title": "Privacy in encrypted content distribution using private broadcast encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000241687500004"}
