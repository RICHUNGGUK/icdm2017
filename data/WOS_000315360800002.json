The investigated laminate is made of glass-epoxy and graphite-epoxy plies to combine the lightness and economical attributes of the first with the high-stiffness property of the second using a modified variation of ACO so called the elitist ant system (EAS) in order to make the tradeoff between the cost and weight as the objective functions. First natural frequency was considered as a constraint The obtained results using the EAS method including the Pareto set, optimum stacking sequences, and the number of plies made of either glass or graphite fibers were compared with those using the genetic algorithm (GA) and any colony system (ACS) reported in literature. The comparisons confirm the advantage of hybridization and showed that the EAS algorithm outperformed the GA and ACS in terms of function's value and constraint accuracy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
