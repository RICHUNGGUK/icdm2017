Results for grounded type one-port active inductor incorporating frequency-dependent as well as frequency-independent negative resistances are examined. Later, the negative resistance aspect is extended from one-port to two-port active inductor circuit to ensure its use as a series element. The enhanced Q-values of all the inductive circuits are observed in accordance with the theory. Moderately high-Q values (similar to 100) with considerable inductances (similar to 0.2-1 nH) are obtained in the RF frequency ranges (similar to 5-9 GHz).
