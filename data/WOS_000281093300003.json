A RSEFNN-LF is constructed on-line via simultaneous structure and parameter learning In structure learning, an efficient rule and fuzzy set generation algorithm is proposed to generate fuzzy rules on-line and reduce the number of fuzzy sets in each dimension In parameter learning, the consequent part parameters are learned (hi nth a varying-dimensional Kalman filter algorithm whose input dimension varies with structure learning The antecedent part and feedback loop parameters are learned using a gradient descent algorithm The RSEFNN-LF is applied to dynamic system identification, chaotic sequence prediction, and speech recognition problems. This paper also compares the performance of the RSEFNN-LF with other recurrent fuzzy neural networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
