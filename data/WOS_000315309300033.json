Vibration analysis is a widely used condition monitoring technique for high-speed rotating machinery. Using the information contained in the vibration signals, an automatic method for bearing fault detection and diagnosis is presented in this work. Initially, a one-class v-SVM is used to discriminate between normal and faulty conditions. In order to build a model of normal operation regime, only data extracted under normal conditions is used. Band-pass filters and Hilbert Transform are then used sequentially to obtain the envelope spectrum of the original raw signal that will finally be used to identify the location of the problem. In order to check the performance of the method, two different data sets are used: (a) real data from a laboratory test-to-failure experiment and (b) data obtained from a fault-seeded bearing test. The results showed that the method was able not only to detect the failure in an incipient stage but also to identify the location of the defect and qualitatively assess its evolution over time.
