We classify the complexity, both classical and parameterized, of such problems by a Schaefer-style dichotomy result, that is, with a restricted set of allowed types of constraints. Our results show that there is a considerable amount of such problems that are NP-hard, but fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the distance.", "paper_title": "On the Hardness of Losing Weight", "paper_id": "WOS:000304065800011"}
