In the experimental results, the authors claimed that their approach could outperform several state-of-the-art algorithms. They also showed the superiority of their method by means of numerical experiments on Moving Peaks Benchmark (MPB). Despite the interesting idea of applying multi-population scheme on harmony search and using a new type of external archive for dealing with dynamic problems, we believe that there are two very important shortcomings in the result analysis, which we point out in this short note. The main motivation of the present note is to contribute toward preventing the same mistakes from happening by the other researchers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
