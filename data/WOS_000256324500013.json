The poroelastic medium is modeled using Biot's two-phased linear theory and the pile using one-dimensional elastic theory. By using the separation of variables technique, the torsional response of the soil layer is solved first. Then based on perfect contact between the pile and soil, the dynamic response of the pile is obtained in a closed form. Numerical results for torsional impedance of the soil layer are presented first to portray the influence of wave modes, slenderness ratio, pile-soil modulus ratio and poroelastic properties. A comparison with the plane strain theory is performed. The selected numerical results are obtained to analyze the influence of the major parameters on the torsional impedance at the level of the pile head. Finally, the dynamic torsional impedance of this study is compared with that for floating pile in elastic soil. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
