In this paper, we leverage the efficiency of BDDs for new areas in field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) computer-aided design (CAD) flow including cut generation and clustering by reducing these problems to BDDs and solving them using Boolean operations. As a result, we show that this leads to more than 10x reduction in runtime and memory use when compared to previous techniques, as recently reported by Mishchenko et aL and Lin et al. This speedup allows us to apply this paper to new areas in the FPGA CAD flow previously not possible. Specifically, we introduce a new method to solve the logic-synthesis elimination problem found in FBDD, a recently reported BDD synthesis engine with an order-of-magnitude speedup over SIS. Our new elimination algorithm results in an overall speedup of 6x in FBDD with no impact on circuit area.", "paper_title": "Scalable synthesis and clustering techniques using decision diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000253840500002"}
