First, a new dynamic sliding surface is developed by incorporating the information of the estimates of disturbances and their high-order derivatives. A CDSMC law is then designed for a general motion control system with both high-order matched and mismatched disturbances, which can attenuate the effects of disturbances from the system output. The proposed control method is finally applied for the airgap control of a MAGnetic LEViation (MAGLEV) suspension vehicle. Simulation results show that the proposed method exhibits promising control performance in the presence of high-order matched and mismatched disturbances.", "paper_title": "High-Order Mismatched Disturbance Compensation for Motion Control Systems Via a Continuous Dynamic Sliding-Mode Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600059"}
