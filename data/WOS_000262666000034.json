Our method uses hardware rasterization to produce primary pixels, and GPU-based BRDF importance sampling [CK07] to quickly generate reflected rays. We utilize a fast GPU ray tracer proposed by Carr et al. [CHCH06] to compute reflection hits. Our main contribution is an adaptive level-of-detail (LOD) control algorithm that greatly improves ray tracing performance during reflection shading. Specifically, we use the solid angle represented by each reflected ray to adaptively pick the level of termination in the BVH traversal step during ray tracing. This leads to 2 similar to 3x speedup over an unmodified implementation of [CHCH06]. Based on the same solid angle measure, we derive a texture filtering formula to reduce reflection aliasing artifacts, taking advantage of hardware MIP mapping. This extends the filtering algorithm presented in [CK07] from environment mapping to local scene reflection. Using our algorithm, we demonstrate interactive rendering rates for several scenes featuring dynamic lighting and material changes, spatially varying BRDF parameters, and rigid-body object movement.", "paper_title": "Interactive Glossy Reflections using GPU-based Ray Tracing with Adaptive LOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000262666000034"}
