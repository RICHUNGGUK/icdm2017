It describes PSpice implementation of the core power electronic circuits that depend on thyristor circuits to identify behaviors with load variations. It uses the developed simulation models to support and enhance power electronics education at the undergraduate level. These simulations successfully integrate the contents of the power electronic laboratory course. A study of the impact of these simulations on the results of the students showed that it helped them to master the course contents and to gain better grades. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
