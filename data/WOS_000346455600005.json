The electromagnetic URAT adopts electromagnetic linear motor (EMLM) as its drive mechanism. The three-dimensional simulation model of electromagnetic URAT is established. And the kinematics simulation and dynamics simulation of electromagnetic URAT is conducted. The displacement, speed and force of shift mechanical arm, throttle mechanical leg, brake mechanical leg and clutch mechanical leg are obtained. Using the finite element method (FEM), the structure and material of key components of electromagnetic URAT are checked. The automatic driving simulation of electromagnetic URAT is conducted. Experiments are performed using a Ford FOCUS car. Simulation and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed prototyping of electromagnetic URAT system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
