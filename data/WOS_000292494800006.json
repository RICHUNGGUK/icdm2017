By applying Dini derivative and introducing many real parameters, and estimating the upper bound of solutions of the system, a series of new and useful criteria on the existence and local exponential stability of almost periodic for general delayed neural networks without global Lipschitz activation functions have been derived. Those results obtained in this paper extend and generalize the corresponding results existing in the previous literature. Two examples and numerical simulations are given to illustrate our theory.
