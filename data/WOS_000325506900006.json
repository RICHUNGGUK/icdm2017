Firstly, we show a dynamic state transformation, under which the original system is transformed into a new system. Then, a state feedback controller with a dynamic gain is designed for the new system. It is shown that global finite-time stabilization in probability for a class of stochastic nonlinear system under linear growth condition can be guaranteed by appropriately choosing design parameters. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design scheme.", "paper_title": "GLOBAL FINITE-TIME STABILIZATION FOR A CLASS OF STOCHASTIC NONLINEAR SYSTEMS BY DYNAMIC STATE FEEDBACK", "paper_id": "WOS:000325506900006"}
