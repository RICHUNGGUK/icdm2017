Recently, this has become particularly important for the conceptual design of biorefineries. This work introduces a shortcut method for the synthesis and screening of integrated biorefineries. A structural representation (referred to as the chemical species/conversion operator) is introduced. It is used to track individual chemicals while allowing for the processing of multiple chemicals in processing technologies. The representation is used to embed potential configurations of interest. An optimization approach is developed to screen and determine optimum network configurations for various technology pathways using simple data. The solution to the optimization formulation provides a quick and effective method for screening and interconnecting the technological pathways and to distributing the flows over the network. Case studies are solved to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
