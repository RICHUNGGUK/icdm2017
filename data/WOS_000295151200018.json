In order to improve the efficiency of alpha-resolution approach proposed for LF(X), firstly the concepts of alpha-lock resolution principle and deduction are introduced for lattice-valued propositional logic LP(X) based on LIA, along with its soundness and weak completeness theorems. Then all the results are extended into LF(X) by using Lifting Lemma. Finally an alpha-lock resolution automated reasoning algorithm in LF(X) is proposed for the implementation purpose. This work provides a theoretical foundation for more efficient resolution-based automated reasoning algorithm in lattice-valued logic LF(X). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
