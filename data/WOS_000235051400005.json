The consequences of reticulation of the phenomena and of the systematic use of the power conjugated variables on the formulation of the thermodynamic properties, the reaction kinetics and the energy and mass transport are shown. A classical example of chemical reaction is chosen to illustrate this approach: the equilibrated reaction of hydrogen and iodine in hydrogen iodide.", "paper_title": "Bond graph modelling for chemical reactors", "paper_id": "WOS:000235051400005"}
