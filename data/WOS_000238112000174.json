The method is based on an estimate of the discrete Borel measure for the characteristic function of an alpha-stable random vector. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can identify independent components and the basis vectors of mixing matrix in the so-called under-determined case of more sources than mixtures.", "paper_title": "Identification of independent components based on borel measure for under-determined mixtures", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000174"}
