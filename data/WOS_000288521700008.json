The HIL equipment consists of an industrial PC and a commercial I/O board for jet engine simulation as the controlled process and an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) as the fuel controller. The controlled process consisting of actuator, physical process and sensors is fully simulated in HIL simulation. However, the high resolution signals of some components in the HIL simulation cause the real-time simulation to become difficult due to the need of small time-steps. As a result, the disparity between the jet engine model sampling rate and these high resolution signals requires a multi-rate simulation. In this study, a multi step size simulation is developed using multiple processors. These processors are designed to synchronize the status of the engine model with the control system as well as to convert the raw data of the I/O boards to actual input and output signals in real-time. These features make the HIL equipment more effective and flexible. The HIL environment is proved to be an efficient tool to develop various control functions and to validate the software and hardware of the engine fuel control system. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
