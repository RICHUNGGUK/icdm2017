Although it has many significant advantages, survivability still plays an important role in the performance optimization of cloud-integrated WOBAN, because the network component failure will cause huge data loss. Meanwhile, users need ubiquitous broadband access for cloud services which can be provided by cloud-integrated WOBAN. Hence, this paper proposes an approach for the planning of survivable cloud-integrated WOBAN to support ubiquitous urban area cloud-integrated wireless-optical broadband access. By Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model and heuristic solution, the proposed approach aims at the maximal coverage under the survivability constraints on the connection of wireless routers. When a distribution fiber is broken, each ONU can transmit data to its backup ONU using wireless routers via the node-disjoint wireless paths with the constraints of transmission delay. Simulation results show the network coverage of user ends for different numbers of ONUs and wireless routers, and illustrate the relationship between network coverage and cost represented by the number wireless routers. At the same time, this approach demonstrates itself about the feasibility to the real urban area cloud-integrated wireless-optical broadband access. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
