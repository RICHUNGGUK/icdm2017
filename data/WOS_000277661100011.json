In order to maintain the system's high reliability, it is crucial to identify and replace the faulty processors through testing, a process known as fault diagnosis. The minimum size of a largest connected component in such a networked system is typically used as a measure for fault tolerance of the system. For this measure, the conditional diagnosability of the system in terms of an alternating group network is important, which is studied in the present paper under a comparison model, with some precise and useful bounds of tolerance derived.
