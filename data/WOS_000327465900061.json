With our system, we have conducted tests on a number of pilot deployments. The largest of them, with 3000 concurrent viewers, consistently showed that our system saves more than 90% of traffic towards the source of the stream while providing the same quality of user experience of a CDN. Another result is that our solution was able to reduce the load on the bottlenecks in the network by an average of 91.6%.", "paper_title": "On HTTP Live Streaming in Large Enterprises", "paper_id": "WOS:000327465900061"}
