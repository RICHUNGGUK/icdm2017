The acoustoelastic effect based method, the piezoelectric active sensing method, and the piezoelectric impedance method are the three commonly used to monitor bolted connections. The basic principle and the applications of these three methods are discussed in detail in this paper. In addition, this paper presents a comparison of these methods and discusses their suitability for in situ or real-time bolt connection monitoring.", "paper_title": "Review of Bolted Connection Monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000328756400001"}
