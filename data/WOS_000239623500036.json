Function S-rough set (function singular rough set) has law characteristic and the law has heredity characteristic. Using function S-rough set, this paper advances the recognition of financial risk law and gives its recognition model and an application example. Function S-rough set is defined by R-function equivalence class [u], u(i) is an element of [u] is a function (or a law). Function S-rough set is the general form of S-rough set (singular rough set) and S-rough set is the special case of function S-rough set. The results of this paper have lots of important applications.", "paper_title": "Function S-rough sets and recognition of financial risk laws", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500036"}
