We cover the case of a completely distributive lattice (which is, in a certain sense, the most general one) and study the corresponding category of uniform lattice-valued frames. In particular, we show that this is a complete and cocomplete category that extends in a nice manner the category of uniform frames, widely studied in the literature. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
