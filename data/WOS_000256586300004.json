A Pattern-Oriented Web Engineering Methodology (POWEM) for deploying patterns as means for assuring the quality of Web Applications is presented. POWEM consists of a sequence of steps including setting goals, identifying stakeholder types, following a suitable development process model, identifying relevant quality attributes, and acquiring, selecting and applying suitable patterns. The feasibility issues involved in each step are examined. The use of patterns during macro- and micro-architecture design of a Web Application is illustrated. Finally, some directions for future research, including extensions to POWEM, are outlined.", "paper_title": "A situational methodology for addressing the pragmatic quality of Web Applications by integration of patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000256586300004"}
