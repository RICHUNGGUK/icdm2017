Generalizing and strengthening the criticism of those arguments that have been made by mathematical logicians, it is proved that all possible variants of the argument must lead to a vicious circle or to inconsistency or to unsoundness ( acceptance of a false statement). This defeats Lucas, who assumes his consistency and Penrose, who assumes his soundness. As Godel has remarked, the existence of a robot, whom we will call Luke, equivalent to the human mind as far as mathematical capacities go, is not excluded by his incompleteness theorem.", "paper_title": "On Godel's theorem and mechanism: Inconsistency or unsoundness is unavoidable in any attempt to 'out-Godel' the mechanist", "paper_id": "WOS:000252979700010"}
