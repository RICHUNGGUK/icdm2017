Firstly, the novel operations of simplified neutrosophic sets (SNSs) and relational properties are developed. Then some outranking relations for simplified neutrosophic number (SNNs) are defined, based on ELECTRE, and the properties within the outranking relations are further discussed in detail. Additionally, based on the outranking relations of SNNs, a ranking approach is developed in order to solve MCDM problems. Finally, two practical examples are provided to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Moreover, a comparison analysis based on the same example is also conducted.
