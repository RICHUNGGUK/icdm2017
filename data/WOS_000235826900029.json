Let P(z(1),..., z(k)) be a Presburger relation over the nonnegative integers. We show that the following problem is decidable: Given: R-1,R-..., R-k and a Presburger relation P. Question: Are there nonnegative integer values for y,x(1),..., x(n) such that for these values, (R-1,..., R-k) satisfies P? C We also give some applications to decision problems concerning counter machines. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
