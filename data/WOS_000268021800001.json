Such NCSs consist of a nonlinear controlled plant, a tracked plant, sensors, a controller, and an actuator. A Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is employed to represent the nonlinear controlled plant in the NCSs, and a tracked plant is described by a linear stable reference model. In transmission, both network-induced delay and packet losses are considered. By the parallel distributed compensation technique, a novel tracking model of the nonlinear NCSs is first established. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, a control design method that guarantees the prescribed H-infinity tracking performance of the nonlinear NCSs is developed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of our result.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy H-infinity Tracking Control for Nonlinear Networked Control Systems in T-S Fuzzy Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000268021800001"}
