On the basis of a review of the scholarly, governmental, and professional literatures and websites, the fields of public librarianship and community informatics were compared along two dimensions: (1) institutional histories, including perspectives on emergent information and communications technologies and engagement in the public policy process; and (2) academic affiliations and major theoretical approaches, including significant research initiatives and findings of relevance to public access computing services. The purpose of this comparison is to contribute to and expand upon our knowledge of the differences and similarities between these two communities and how best to use this information to inform future research and practice. The focus of this analysis is on the Canadian context, and the comparison between both communities along the dimensions of political engagement and dominant epistemological orientations distinguishes it from previous research in the field.", "paper_title": "Public Access Computing in Canada: A Comparative Policy Analysis of Canada's Community Informatics and Public Library Communities", "paper_id": "WOS:000266055200001"}
