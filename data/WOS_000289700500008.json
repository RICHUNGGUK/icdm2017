The focus is on the consequences of committing to the implementation of a reporting and analysis system for IT-supported sustainability. This commitment involves several actor networks, both internal and external to the municipality. The study shows that, to implement successfully a sustainability initiative, a thorough understanding of organizational routines and standards is required to enrol the affected stakeholders. Information systems can play a central role as tools for improving sustainability indicators and routines, thereby constituting important change actants. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
