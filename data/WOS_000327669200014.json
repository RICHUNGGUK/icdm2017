A third-order fiter is adopted to reduce quantization noise and VCO nonlinearity. Even-order harmonics of VCO are significantly reduced by the proposed dual-VCO-quantizer-loop structure. The prototype with 10 MHz bandwidth and 400 MHz clock rate is designed using a 0.18 mu m RF CMOS process. Simulation results show that the signal-to-noise ratio and signal-to-noise distortion ratio (SNDR) are 76.9 and 76 dB, respectively, consuming 37 mA at 1.8 V. The key module of the ADC, which is a 4-bit VCO-based quantizer, can convert the voltage signal into a frequency signal and quantize the corresponding frequency to thermometer codes at 400 MS/s.", "paper_title": "VCO-BASED CONTINUOUS-TIME SIGMA DELTA ADC BASED ON A DUAL-VCO-QUANTIZER-LOOP STRUCTURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000327669200014"}
