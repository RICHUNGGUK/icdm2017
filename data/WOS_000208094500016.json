The first general Zagreb index of G is defined as M-1(alpha)(G) = Sigma(v epsilon V(G)) d(v)(alpha), where d(v) is the degree of v. If G has n vertices and n + 1 edges, then it is called a bicyclic graph. In this paper, for arbitrary n >= 5, we characterize all bicyclic graphs on n vertices with the first three smallest and largest values of the first general Zagreb index when alpha > 1, with the largest and the first three smallest values of the first general Zagreb index when alpha < 0, and with the smallest and the first three largest values of the first general Zagreb index when 0 < alpha < 1; for every sufficiently large n, we characterize all bicyclic graphs on n vertices with the second and third smallest values of the first general Zagreb index when 0 < alpha < 1, and with the second and third largest values of the first general Zagreb index when alpha < 0.", "paper_title": "BICYCLIC GRAPHS WITH THE FIRST THREE SMALLEST AND LARGEST VALUES OF THE FIRST GENERAL ZAGREB INDEX", "paper_id": "WOS:000208094500016"}
