Firstly, two human perception customs are introduced, which have important relations to shape retrieval. Secondly, these two customs are properly modeled by morphological operations. Finally, the proposed PMMS is applied to improve the retrieval performances of a popular shape matching method named Inner-Distance Shape Contexts (IDSC), and then the Locally Constrained Diffusion Process (LCDP) method is exploited to further enhance the retrieval performance. This combination achieves a retrieval rate of 98.56% on MPEG-7 dataset. We also conduct the experiments on Swedish Leaf dataset, the ETH-80 dataset and the Natural Silhouette dataset. The experimental results obtained from four datasets demonstrate clearly the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
