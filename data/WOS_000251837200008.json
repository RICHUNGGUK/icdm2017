Currently, there are some EML proposals devoted to provide a computational base, enabling the software processing and execution of educational units' models. In this context,flexibility is a key requirement in order to support alternatives and changes. This paper presents a Perspective-oriented Educational Modeling Language (PoEML) that simplifies and facilitates the modeling of alternatives and the performance of changes. The key point of the proposal is the separation of the modeling in several concerns that can be managed almost independently. As a result, changes at each concern can be performed without affecting to other concerns, or affecting in controlled ways.", "paper_title": "Supporting the modeling of flexible educational units PoEML: A separation of concerns approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000251837200008"}
