A wide range of research has exploited context dependency, i.e. the relations between context(s) and the outcome, to achieve significant, quantified, performance gains for a variety of applications and services. These works typically have to deal with the challenges of multiple context sources leading to a sparse training dataset, and the challenges of energy hungry context sensors. Often, they address these challenges in an application specific and ad-hoc manner. We liberate mobile application designers and researchers from these burdens by providing a methodical approach to these challenges. In particular, we 1) define and measure the context-dependency of three principal types of mobile usage (visited websites, phone calls, and app usage) in an application agnostic yet practical manner, providing insight into the performance of potential application. 2) Address the challenge of data sparseness when dealing with multiple context sources in a systematic manner. 3) Present SmartContext to address the energy challenge by automatically selecting among context sources while ensuring a minimum accuracy for each estimation. Our analysis and findings are based on one year of usage and context traces collected in real-life settings from 24 iPhone users. We present findings regarding the context dependency of three types of mobile usage from 24 users, yet our methodology and the lessons we learn can be readily extended to other types of usage as well as system resources. Our findings guide the development of context aware systems, and highlight the challenges and expectations regarding the context dependency of mobile usage.", "paper_title": "Practical Context Awareness: Measuring and Utilizing the Context Dependency of Mobile Usage", "paper_id": "WOS:000359264300013"}
