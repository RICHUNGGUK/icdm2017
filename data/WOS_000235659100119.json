Because of the physical isolation to each other and independent decision on the classifying and specification mechanisms, the repositories form a distributed and heterogeneous system, hindering the reusability of component resource. Due to the infeasibility of integrating all the repositories physically, it is necessary to use a collaborative way to integrate such repositories and form a logically uniform architecture with consistent user interface and retrieval mechanism, to improve the reuse of software components. In this paper we propose an architecture of integrated system based on intelligent agent, and make use of ASM in its architecture design, which can be validated formally. This architecture implements the required fundamental functionality.", "paper_title": "Using abstract state machine in architecture design of distributed software component repository", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100119"}
