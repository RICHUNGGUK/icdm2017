Traditional topology optimization techniques identify physically closer nodes to connect as overlay neighbors, but could significantly shrink the search scope. Recent efforts have been made to address the mismatch problem without sacrificing the search scope, but they either need time synchronization among peers or have a low convergent speed. In this paper, we propose a scalable bipartite overlay (SBO) scheme to optimize the overlay topology by identifying and replacing the mismatched connections. In SBO, we employ an efficient strategy for distributing optimization tasks in peers with different colors. We conducted comprehensive simulations to evaluate this design. The results show that SBO achieves approximately 85 percent of reduction on traffic cost and about 60 percent of reduction on query response time. Our comparisons with previous approaches to address the topology mismatch problem have shown that SBO can achieve a fast convergent speed, without the need of time synchronization among peers.", "paper_title": "Building a scalable bipartite P2P overlay network", "paper_id": "WOS:000248314700010"}
