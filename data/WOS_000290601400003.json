The purpose of this study is to develop a 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic approach for assessing the intention level of service adoption. In doing so, a theoretical framework for service adoption analysis is proposed. Under this framework; a 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic approach is then proposed for assessing the intention level of service adoption using potential adopters' expectation and perception. In this method, a linguistic aggregation operator is defined to calculate the deviation degree between expectation and perception and to map the computation result to a linguistic value. The overall intention level of service adoption is obtained by aggregating the deviation degrees. Additionally, a case is used to illustrate the potential application of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "ASSESSING THE INTENTION LEVEL OF SERVICE ADOPTION: A 2-TUPLE FUZZY LINGUISTIC APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601400003"}
