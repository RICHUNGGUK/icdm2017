A short statistical summary, as well as tile-by-tile and cycle-by-cycle graphical representation of clusters density, quality scores and nucleotide frequencies allow easy identification of various technical problems including defective tiles, mistakes in sample/library preparations and abnormalities in the frequencies of appearance of sequenced genomic reads. PIQA is written in the R statistical programming language and is compatible with bustard, fastq and scarf Illumina G1 Genome Analyzer data formats.", "paper_title": "PIQA: pipeline for Illumina G1 genome analyzer data quality assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000269607700025"}
