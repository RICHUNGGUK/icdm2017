Core scientists are those who have the top total scores as measured by the number of their publications and citations received. We find that even though they may not apply for a large number of patents themselves, the scientific knowledge of the core scientists may have a positive effect in stimulating patent applications by their collaborators.", "paper_title": "Core scientists and innovation in Japanese electronics companies", "paper_id": "WOS:000239960700004"}
