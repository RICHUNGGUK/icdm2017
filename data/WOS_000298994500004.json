However, latent topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which have been successfully used to discover individual activities, do not discover group activities. In this paper we propose a method to discover group activities along with individual activities. We use a two layer latent structure where a latent variable is used to discover correlation of individual activities as a group activity using multinomial distribution. Each individual activity is in turn represented as a distribution over local visual features. We use a Gibbs sampling-based algorithm to jointly infer the individual and group activities. Our method can summarize not only the individual activities but also the common group activities in a video. We demonstrate the strength of our method by discovering activities and the salient correlation amongst them in real life videos of crowded public places.", "paper_title": "Latent topic model-based group activity discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000298994500004"}
