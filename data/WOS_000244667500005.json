We use a high-resolution shock-capturing scheme with approximate Riemann solver to solve the partial differential equations of the Lighthill - Whitham theory. These schemes are very efficient, robust and moreover well adapted to simulations of traffic flows. We develop a theory of dynamic routing including a procedure for traffic flow assignment at junctions which reproduces the correct propagation of irregularities and ensures at the same time conservation of the number of vehicles.", "paper_title": "Simulating vehicular traffic in a network using dynamic routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000244667500005"}
