In particular, for each recursive non-null ordinal alpha, there exist some Sigma(0)(alpha)-complete and some mcomplete omega-languages accepted by Buchi 1-counter automata. And the supremum of the set of Borel ranks of context free omega-languages is an ordinal gamma(1)(2) that is strictly greater than the first non-recursive ordinal omega(CK)(1). We then extend this result, proving that the Wadge hierarchy of context free omega-languages, or even of omega-languages accepted by Buchi 1-counter automata, is the same as the Wadge hierarchy of omega-languages accepted by Turing machines with a Buchi or a Muller acceptance condition.", "paper_title": "Borel ranks and Wadge degrees of context free omega-languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000242137000006"}
