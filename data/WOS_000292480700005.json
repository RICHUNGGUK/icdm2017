Kirchberger proved that, for a finite subset X of R-d such that each point in X is painted with one of two colors, if every d+2 or fewer points in X can be separated along the colors, then all the points in X can be separated along the colors. In this paper, we show a more colorful theorem.", "paper_title": "On Partitioning Colored Points", "paper_id": "WOS:000292480700005"}
