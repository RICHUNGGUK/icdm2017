The out-of-order nature and the uncontrolled replication of information on the internet have deprived these information resources of their copyright protection. DRM is. an important means to protect the copyright of information resources, and encryption technology is the core of DRM. This paper has analyzed the principle and the main technology used by DRM in encrypting information resources; it has also conducted experiments on the programming techniques used on encrypting information resources in DRM.", "paper_title": "Encryption and program realization of information resources in DRM", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624300025"}
