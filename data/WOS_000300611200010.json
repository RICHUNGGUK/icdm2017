In this article, the travel time of a link is assumed to be spatially correlated only to the neighboring links within a local 'impact area.' Based on this assumption, the spatially dependent reliable shortest path problem (SD-RSPP) is formulated as a multicriteria shortest path-finding problem. The dominant conditions for the SD-RSPP are established in this article. A new multicriteria A* algorithm is proposed to solve the SD-RSPP in an equivalent two-level hierarchical network. A case study using real-world data shows that link travel times are, indeed, only strongly correlated within the local impact areas; and the proposed limited spatial dependence assumption can well approximate path travel time variance when the size of the impact area is sufficiently large. Computational results demonstrate that the size of the impact area would have a significant impact on both accuracy and computational performance of the proposed solution algorithm.", "paper_title": "Reliable shortest path finding in stochastic networks with spatial correlated link travel times", "paper_id": "WOS:000300611200010"}
