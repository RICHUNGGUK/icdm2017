When writing a Mizar formalization, a significant amount of the user's time typically goes into browsing the Mizar Mathematical Library (MML) for the already-proved results he needs. Here a few techniques to reduce this time are illustrated.", "paper_title": "Custom Automations in Mizar", "paper_id": "WOS:000313368400004"}
