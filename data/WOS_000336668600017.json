The sensors find coverage holes within their Voronoi polygons and then move in an appropriate direction to minimize them. Novel edge-based and vertex-based strategies are introduced, and their performances are compared with existing techniques. The proposed movement strategies are based on the distances of each sensor and the points inside its Voronoi polygon from the edges or vertices of the polygon. Simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed deployment algorithms and their superiority to the techniques reported in the literature.", "paper_title": "Distributed Deployment Algorithms for Improved Coverage in a Network of Wireless Mobile Sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600017"}
