This work adopted an experimental design for collecting data from three tasks locating points, planning routes, and searching polygons each emphasizing a different aspect of way-finding Study results show that gender, the CNS interface the participant used, and a combination of the two predict a person's operational performance and satisfaction with a CNS This study's results provide a better understanding of whether manufacturers should develop interfaces that fit a CNS's small display based on gender.
