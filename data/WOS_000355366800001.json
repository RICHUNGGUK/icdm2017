The dynamic gain of an FBFN can be approximated by finding the maximum of norm values of the locally linearized systems or by solving a non-smooth optimal control problem. From the proposed gain calculation techniques, a novel adaptive multilevel fuzzy controller (AMLFC) with a maximum output scaling factor is presented. To guarantee the system stability, a stability condition is derived, which only requires that the output scaling factor of the AMLFC be bounded. Therefore, this paper provides a systematic and simple design practice for controlling nonlinear systems by using an AMLFC. The AMLFC is simulated in a tower crane control system. Simulation results show that AMLFC is not only robust but also provides improved transient performances compared with the robust adaptive fuzzy controller. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
