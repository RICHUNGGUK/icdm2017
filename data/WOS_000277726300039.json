Wang, Liu, Fan, and Feng (in press) proposed an approach to overcome the limitations of the existing studies and simplify the computational procedures based on the LR deviation degree of fuzzy number. However, there were some problems with the ranking method. In this paper, we want to indicate these problems of Z.-X. Wang's method and then propose a revised method which can avoid these problems for ranking fuzzy numbers. Since the revised method is based on the Z.-X. Wang's method, it is easy to rank fuzzy numbers in a way similar to the original method. The method is illustrated by numerical examples and compared with other methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
