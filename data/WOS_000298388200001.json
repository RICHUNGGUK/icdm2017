The semi-streaming model forbids random access to the input graph and restricts the memory to O(n.polylog n) bits where n denotes the number of the vertices of the input graph. We obtain an approximation ratio of 5.58 while the previously best algorithm achieves a ratio of 5.82.", "paper_title": "Weighted Matching in the Semi-Streaming Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000298388200001"}
