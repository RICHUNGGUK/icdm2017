Manufacturing resource (MR) modelling approaches have been used to support VC formation. Considering that the shared issues in VCMSs are not just about a machine, but some function parts of a machine rather. Resource element (RE) methodologies are used to define the similar and exclusive capabilities of MRs, such as machines and machining centres. In this article, MR modelling approaches are reviewed and RE approach is discussed in detail. Furthermore, some instances are analysed to illustrate the transformation of RE with dynamic manufacturing environments. Results of the analyses show that RE methodology can represent the multifunctional resource closely, reduce the complexity of manufacturing system and improve the agility and flexibility of manufacturing systems. Finally, a function-clustering-degree concept representing the trade-off between the quantity and granularity of VCs is introduced to evaluate the reconfiguration performance of manufacturing systems for supporting VC formation.", "paper_title": "Modelling approach and behaviour analysis of manufacturing resources in virtual cellular manufacturing systems using resource element concept", "paper_id": "WOS:000299881400007"}
