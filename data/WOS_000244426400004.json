An approach to solving this problem has been found in the context of rough set theory and methods. Rough set theory introduced by Zdzislaw Pawlak during the early 1980s provides the foundation for the construction of classifiers, relative to what are known as temporal pattern tables. Temporal patterns can be treated as features that make it possible to approximate complex concepts. This article introduces some rough set tools for perception modeling that are developed for a system for modeling networks of classifiers. Such networks make it possible to identify behavioral patterns of objects changing over time. They are constructed using an ontology of concepts delivered by experts that engage in approximate reasoning about concepts embedded in such an ontology. We also present a method that we call a method for on-line elimination of non-relevant parts (ENP). This method was developed for on-line elimination of complex object parts that are irrelevant for identifying a given behavioral pattern. The article includes results of experiments that have been performed on data from a vehicular traffic simulator and on medical data obtained from Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in the Department of Pediatrics, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University. The contribution of this article is the introduction of a network of classifiers that make it possible to identify the behavioral patterns of objects that change over time.", "paper_title": "Rough set approach to behavioral pattern identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000244426400004"}
