Targeting an alternative analog solution in 0.13-mu m CMOS technology, this paper proposes an approach to improve cardiac delay predictions in every cardiac period in order to assist the CRT device to provide real-time optimal heartbeats. The primary analog SNN architecture is proposed and its implementation is studied to fulfill the requirement of very low energy consumption. By using the Hebbian learning and reinforcement learning algorithms, the intended adaptive CRT device works with different functional modes. The simulations of both learning algorithms have been carried out, and they were shown to demonstrate the global functionalities. To improve the realism of the system, we introduce various heart behavior models (with constant/variable heart rates) that allow pathologic simulations with/without noise on the signals of the input sensors. The simulations of the global system (pacemaker models coupled with heart models) have been investigated and used to validate the analog spiking neural network implementation.", "paper_title": "Implementation Study of an Analog Spiking Neural Network for Assisting Cardiac Delay Prediction in a Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Device", "paper_id": "WOS:000291355700003"}
