To solve these problems, schemes are analyzed that combine high resolving power in the areas of small perturbations and monotony in areas of strong discontinuities. Problems are studied with consideration of chemical kinetics, which address the processes of transition from combustion to detonation. Parallel algorithms of the analyzed difference models are built for the purpose of calculations on graphic processors using the CUDA technology. The proposed algorithms and programs allow for 41.66 times faster acceleration on four graphic accelerators M 2090 than the CPU. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
