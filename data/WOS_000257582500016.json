The literature is replete with prescriptive integer programming models for various versions of wavelength-division multiplexing network design problems, but in no case they consider the real situation of solving them taking into account their inherent vagueness. In this paper, this vagueness is assumed and handled by means of fuzzy sets based methodologies. In particular, two fuzzy integer linear programming models are proposed to be used as auxiliary models for solving the former problem. As an original way to effectively solve these models obtaining cost-effective network designs, we use three metaheuristic procedures that are compared among them.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy optimization models for the design of WDM networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000257582500016"}
