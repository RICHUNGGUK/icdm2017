However, gathering illuminations from these representative VPLs, especially computing the visibility, is still a tedious and time-consuming task. In this paper, we propose a new matrix sampling-and-recovery scheme to efficiently gather illuminations by only sampling a small number of visibilities between representative VPLs and surface points. Our approach is based on the observation that the lighting matrix used in many-lights rendering is of low-rank, so that it is possible to sparsely sample a small number of entries, and then numerically complete the entire matrix. We propose a three-step algorithm to explore this observation. First, we design a new VPL clustering algorithm to slice the rows and group the columns of the full lighting matrix into a number of reduced matrices, which are sampled and recovered individually. Second, we propose a novel prediction method that predicts visibility of matrix entries from sparsely and randomly sampled entries. Finally, we adapt the matrix separation technique to recover the entire reduced matrix and compute final shadings. Experimental results show that our method heavily reduces the required visibility sampling in the final gathering and achieves 3-7 times speedup compared with the state-of-the-art methods on test scenes.", "paper_title": "A Matrix Sampling-and-Recovery Approach for Many-Lights Rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000363671200047"}
