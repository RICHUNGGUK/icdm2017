In addition, no studies have reported on the feasibility and scalability of adapting the IEEE 802.11 EDCA scheme in such networks. This paper presents a new QoS provisioning model called Dynamic Hop Service Differentiation (DHSD), which performs dynamic class selection based on estimation of each service class (AC) in 802.11e based ad hoc networks. This model is designed for Soft QoS provisioning. Performance evaluation is performed by simulation using OPNET. It is demonstrated that this QoS model outperforms existing service models in wireless ad hoc environments.", "paper_title": "QoS model for improving end-to-end service in 802.11e-based wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600031"}
