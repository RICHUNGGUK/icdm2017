However, it is unclear what the meaning of Named Entity is, and yet there is a general belief that Named Entity Recognition is a solved task. In this paper we analyze the evolution of the field from a theoretical and practical point of view. We argue that the task is actually far from solved and show the consequences for the development and evaluation of tools. We discuss topics for further research with the goal of bringing the task back to the research scenario. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
