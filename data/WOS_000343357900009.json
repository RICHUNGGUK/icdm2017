The intelligent features are achieved by means of a Neuro-Fuzzy system which has the ability to learn from samples, reason and adapt itself to changes in the environment or in user preferences. In particular, a modified version of the well known ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) scheme is used, which allows the development of very efficient implementations. The architecture proposed here is based on two soft-core microprocessors: one microprocessor is dedicated to the learning and adaptive procedures, whereas the other is dedicated to the online response. This second microprocessor is endowed with 4 efficient ad hoc hardware modules intended to accelerate the neuro-fuzzy algorithms. The implementation has been carried out on a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA and obtained results show that a very high performance system is achieved. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
