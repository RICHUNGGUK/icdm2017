VMs have inherited trust problems, e.g. sellers may advertise a perfect deal but doesn't deliver the promised service or product at the end. In view of this, we propose a five-sense feedback oriented reputation mechanism (supported by 3D technology and VR) particularly for VMs. The user study confirms that users prefer VMs with our reputation mechanism over those with traditional ones. In our reputation mechanism, five-sense feedback is objective and buyers can use it directly in their reputation evaluation of target sellers. However, for the scenarios where buyers only provide subjective ratings, we apply the approach of subjectivity alignment for reputation computation (SARC), where ratings provided by one buyer can then be aligned (converted) for another buyer according to the two buyers' subjectivity. Evaluation results indicate that SARC can more accurately model sellers' reputation than the state-of-the-art approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
