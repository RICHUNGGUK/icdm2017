Our method introduces a neighborhood projection optimized with a relaxation factor. The neighborhood projection enforces inextensibility by modifying particle positions with a Jacobi-style iteration, leading to conservation of linear and angular quasi momenta. The relaxation factor is estimated according to the corrections and constraints, and is used to scale the corrections while keeping convergence to a smaller number of iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method increases the simulation efficiency, and stably handles inextensible cloth even in overconstrained situations. In addition to the simulation of hanging cloth and draping cloth, the simulated umbrella demonstrates the characters of our method for this type of objects.", "paper_title": "Optimizing neighborhood projection with relaxation factor for inextensible cloth simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000333167500006"}
