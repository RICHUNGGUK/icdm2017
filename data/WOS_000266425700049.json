How to find the salient edges in natural images is not an easy work. This paper proposes a simple method for salient edge detection which preserves the edges with more salient points on the boundaries and cancels the less salient ones or noise edges in natural images. According to the Gestalt Principles of past experience and entirety, we should not detect the whole edges in natural images. Only salient ones can be an advantageous tool for the following step just like object tracking, image segmentation or contour detection. Salient edges can also enhance the efficiency of computing and save the space of storage. The experiments show the promising results.", "paper_title": "Salient Edge Detection in Natural Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000266425700049"}
