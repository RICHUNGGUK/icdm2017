The model uses the stress generated by each self-motile particle for long-range interactions and includes short-range steric effects between particles. The time-step computational cost is O(N logN + M), with N the total number of mesh points, and M the number of swimmers. This fast method enables us to efficiently simulate many thousands of interacting self-propelling particles in three dimensions and with background flows. We show examples of collective behavior in suspensions of \"pusher\" and \"puller\" micro-swimmers. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
