The main advantage of this method have two points: (1) the interpolation function has a simple and explicit mathematical representation with some parameters alpha, beta, mu and nu; (2) the shape of the interpolating surface can be modified by using the parameters for the unchanged interpolating data. Moreover, a local shape control method is employed to control the shape of surfaces.", "paper_title": "A new bivariate interpolation by rational triangular patch", "paper_id": "WOS:000315700300004"}
