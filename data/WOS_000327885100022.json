The flow pattern and distribution of the reagents inside the reactor were analyzed through tracer response curves obtained by numerical simulation. The predominant mechanism of momentum and mass transfer for macro-mixing is convection for the mean and eddy flows. Based on the assumption that the tracer is distributed in the vessel by convection and diffusion, the dynamic distribution of the tracer concentration inside the stirred batch reactor was calculated by solving the Reynolds-averaged conservation equations and the Realizable kappa-epsilon turbulence model. The mean and tracer flow was considered as incompressible, isothermal and single phase under turbulent conditions. To optimize the injection point of reagents in the stirrer batch reactor, several simulated tracer concentration curves were obtained from monitoring points located at different radial and axial positions.
