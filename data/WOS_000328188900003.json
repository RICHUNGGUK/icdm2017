Therefore, it is important to consider different discipline tool effects on the helicopter rotor blade design process. In this article, a model of multidisciplinary simulation integration (MSI) is established and used to solve the problem of process integration and resources share of different discipline tools in the rotor blade design process. First, the numerical process of rotor blade design is analysed and a flow framework model of two-level flows and a group of nodes is proposed to integrate different discipline tools in the rotor blade design process to act as an integration mechanism. Then, some key enabling technologies of MSI are discussed by analysing integration relations of different discipline tools. Integrated work model of different type of discipline tools is given to realise the proposed flow framework. In the end, the model of MSI is realised based on Visual C++ 6.0, OpenGL and SQL SERVER database. Examples show that the proposed flow framework and the established model are satisfied for improving design efficiency and sharing simulation resources in the rotor blade design process.", "paper_title": "Model of multidisciplinary simulation integration in helicopter rotor blade design process", "paper_id": "WOS:000328188900003"}
