The material handling equipment (MHE) selection problem generally includes evaluation of finite number of alternatives which should be ranked against different qualitative or quantitative criteria or sub-criteria. Accordingly, such a problem can be considered as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. Thus, in this article, the voting approach is first used to weight criteria and sub-criteria, by introducing the assessment grades such as very low importance, low importance, moderate importance, high importance and very high importance. The synthetic value of judgements method is then adopted to convert the assessments stated as linguistics variables (by all experts) for each alternative with respect to each sub-criterion into a single fuzzy weight. Next, fuzzy weighted average is applied to aggregate the single fuzzy weights of each alternative related to sub-criteria under each criterion. Finally, the fuzzy vlsekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno resenje approach is used to select the optimal MHE. Also, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a case study is considered and the results are compared with fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution method.", "paper_title": "A new hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria decision making model for solving the material handling equipment selection problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000351166900009"}
