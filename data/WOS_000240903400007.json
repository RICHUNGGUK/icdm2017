In order to get a better process allocation on distributed environments, several load balancing algorithms have been proposed. Generally, these algorithms consider as the information policy's load index the length of the CPU's process waiting queue. This paper modifies the Server-Initiated Lowest algorithm by using a load index based on the resource occupation. Using this load index the Server-Initiated Lowest algorithm is compared to the Stable symmetrically initiated, which nowadays is defined as the best choice. The comparisons are made by using simulations. The simulations showed that the modified Server-Initiated Lowest algorithm had better results than the Symmetrically Initiated one.", "paper_title": "Comparative study of the server-initiated lowest algorithm using a load balancing index based on the process behavior for heterogeneous environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000240903400007"}
