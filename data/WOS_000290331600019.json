The library provides a class hierarchy to seamlessly bind together annotations of genomic elements to sequences and to algorithm results; it allows to evaluate the effect of mutations/variations in terms of both element position shifts and of algorithm results, limiting recalculation to the minimum. Particular care has been posed to keep memory and time overhead into acceptable limits.", "paper_title": "GeCo++: a C++ library for genomic features computation and annotation in the presence of variants", "paper_id": "WOS:000290331600019"}
