Thus, it is difficult to generate truly structure-aware summaries because the information structure to guide summarization is unclear. In this paper, we present a novel framework to generate guided summaries for product reviews. The guided summary has an explicitly defined structure which comes from the important aspects of products. The proposed framework attempts to maximize expected aspect satisfaction during summary generation. The importance of an aspect to a generated summary is modeled using Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Empirical experimental results on consumer reviews of cars show the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Guided Structure-Aware Review Summarization", "paper_id": "WOS:000292681200012"}
