In this paper, we study optimal scheduling in buffered WDM interconnects with limited range wavelength conversion capability. We formalize the problem of maximizing network throughput and minimizing total delay as a problem of finding an optimal matching in a weighted bipartite graph. We then give a simple algorithm, called the Scan and Swap Algorithm, that finds the optimal matching in O(kB) time, where k is the number of wavelengths per fiber and B is the buffer length, as compared to directly adopting other existing algorithms that need at least O(k(2)N(2) + k(2)BN) time, where N is the number of input fibers.", "paper_title": "Optimal scheduling in buffered WDM interconnects with limited range wavelength conversion capability", "paper_id": "WOS:000233304800007"}
