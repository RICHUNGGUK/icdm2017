We show that for networks with maximum degree greater than 5 the problem is P-Complete, simulating a monotone Boolean circuit. Then, we show that the problem for networks with no vertex with degree greater than 4 is in NC, giving a fast parallel algorithm. Finally, we apply the result to the study of related problems.
