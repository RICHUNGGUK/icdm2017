Proper analysis of the simulation data is a crucial part of biophysical and bioinformatics studies. Sequence alignment problem can be also formulated in terms of Boltzmann distribution. Therefore tools for efficient analysis of canonical ensemble data become extremely valuable. T-Pile package, presented here provides a user-friendly implementation of most important algorithms such as multilhistogram analysis and reweighting technique. The package can be used in studies of virtually any system governed by Boltzmann distribution.", "paper_title": "T-Pile - a package for thermodynamic calculations for biomolecules", "paper_id": "WOS:000249248300020"}
