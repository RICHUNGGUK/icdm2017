The prevalence is 10-15% of normal population, and 18-30% of contact lenses users. The break-up time (BUT) is a clinical test used for the diagnosis of this disease. In this work, we perform an analysis of parameters for a global and a local automatic computation of the BUT measure, based on criteria of specificity and sensitivity. We have tested our methodology on a dataset composed of 18 videos annotated by 4 different experts. The local analysis preserves the results of the global approach providing useful additional information about the break-up tear zone. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
