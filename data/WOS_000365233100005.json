The D2D communication paradigm has been largely exploited in non-cellular technologies such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi but it has not yet been fully incorporated into existing cellular networks. In this regard, a new proposal focusing on the integration of D2D communication into LTE-A has been recently approved by the 3GPP standardization community as discussed in this paper. In cellular networks, D2D communication introduces several critical issues, such as interference management and decisions on whether devices should communicate directly or not. In this survey, we provide a thorough overview of the state of the art focusing on D2D communication, especially within 3GPP LTE/LTE-A. First, we provide in-depth classification of papers looking at D2D from several perspectives. Then, papers addressing all major problems and areas related to D2D are presented and approaches proposed in the papers are compared according to selected criteria. On the basis of the surveyed papers, we highlight areas not satisfactorily addressed so far and outline major challenges for future work regarding efficient integration of D2D in cellular networks.", "paper_title": "In-Band Device-to-Device Communication in OFDMA Cellular Networks: A Survey and Challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000365233100005"}
