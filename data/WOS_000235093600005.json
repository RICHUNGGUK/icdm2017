The algorithm divides the B-spline control points into those associated and those unassociated with the geometric constraints. Through preserving the signal information associated with the constraint control points, the geometric constraints can be automatically preserved after wavelet transformation. This paper also briefly investigates two types of the detail feature propagation technique in wavelet-based multiresolution CAD system. One is detail feature motion. The other is detail feature repetition. Finally, a comprehensive example is presented to illustrate the effects of the combination of those techniques. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
