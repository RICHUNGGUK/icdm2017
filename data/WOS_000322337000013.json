Second-generation sequencing technologies allow us to assay these systems and the small RNAs that play a key role with unprecedented depth. However, scientists need access to tools that can condense, analyse and display the resulting data. Here, we present viRome, a package for R that takes aligned sequence data and produces a range of essential plots and reports.", "paper_title": "viRome: an R package for the visualization and analysis of viral small RNA sequence datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000322337000013"}
