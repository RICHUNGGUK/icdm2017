Digitally assisted analog circuits can exploit digital circuits' high density and low energy per computation to enable a new generation of interface electronics based on minimal-precision, low-complexity analog building blocks.", "paper_title": "Digitally assisted analog circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000236796200006"}
