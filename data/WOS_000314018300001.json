Such an attack is called primary user emulation (PUE) attack. TV towers and wireless microphones are two main types of primary users in white space. Existing work on PUE attack detection only focused on the first category. For the latter category, primary users are mobile and their transmission power is low. These properties introduce great challenges on PUE detection and existing methods are not applicable. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect the emulation attack of wireless microphones. We exploit the relationship between RF signals and acoustic information to verify the existence of wireless microphones. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through real-world implementation. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves both false positive rate and false negative rate lower than 0.1 even in a noisy environment.", "paper_title": "Hearing Is Believing: Detecting Wireless Microphone Emulation Attacks in White Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000314018300001"}
