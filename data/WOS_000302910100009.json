Comput. Phys. 1999; 148:322340], where filtering is done after the transformation. The main objective of the present study is to elaborate on the problems mentioned by Jordan with the conventional approach, and its consequences for the overall accuracy. The paper also provides remedies to the problems associated with the conventional approach. The present method treats the Leonard term in physical space rather than in computational space. Some practical difficulties associated with the alternate approach are also considered. Main advantages with the present conventional approach are: first an existing Reynolds averaged NavierStokes code can easily be extended for LES and second a wide range of existing advanced subgrid stress model can be used without any modifications. Filtering in physical space introduces a commutation error between filtering and differentiation due to non-uniform meshes. The commutation filters in generalized coordinates are presented. LESs of four standard test cases are carried out to validate the present methodology. The four standard test cases are: (i) a lid-driven cavity at Reynolds number (Re) of 12 000, (ii) a pipe flow at a friction Reynolds number Ret of 360, (iii) a backward facing step at Re = 5100, and (iv) an axisymmetric confined dump combustor at Re = 11000. The results are validated against the reference data (direct numerical simulation or experiments). The mean velocity profiles and the turbulence intensities compared satisfactorily with the reference data.
