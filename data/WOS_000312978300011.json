By means of detecting the cyclic prefix (CP) configuration in the time domain, it is possible to reduce both the inter symbolic interference (ISI) and the inter carrier interference (ICI) prior to the detection of dedicated synchronization signals (SS) involved in cell search procedure. Thus, the SS detection is efficiently performed in the frequency domain while the implementation complexity is reduced, since the proposed architecture minimizes the necessity of matched filters. Results show that cell search procedure is successfully accomplished while keeping the cell search time in the range of 3-5 radio frames. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
