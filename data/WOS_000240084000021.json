In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework for weight estimation and dissemination which considers decisive node properties in determining a node's suitability for becoming clusterheads and employs adaptive cluster radius and dynamic network constraints as a weight dissemination criterion. It is observed that the proposed algorithm is suitable for scalable ad hoc networks and is adaptable for any cluster formation decisions based on weighted or cost metric approaches. We present a cluster formation and maintenance algorithm that forms well distributed clusters and performs adaptive control to increase the cluster life time so as to optimize routing efficiency. The simulation results corroborate that this protocol is the best suited scheme for adaptive stable clustering and control overhead reduction in large scale mobile ad hoc networks.", "paper_title": "Adaptive weighted clustering for large scale mobile ad hoc networking systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240084000021"}
