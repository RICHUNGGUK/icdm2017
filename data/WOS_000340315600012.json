As case studies, we present the ID-based versions of the Unified Model protocol, UMP-ID, Blake-Wilson et al. (1997)'s protocol, BJM-ID, and Krawczyk (2005)'s HMQV protocol, HMQV-ID. We describe the calculations required to be modified in existing proofs. We conclude with a comparative security and efficiency of the three proposed ID-based protocols (relative to other similar published protocols) and demonstrate that our proposed ID-based protocols are computationally efficient.
