Practical approaches to address this issue are based on service replication at multiple locations and on allocation mechanisms to dispatch requests in such a way that the QoS perceived by the user is improved. In this paper we compare user perceived QoS performance of three Dynamic Request Placement techniques. One technique randomly allocates Web requests while the other two techniques implements a market-based mechanism for QoS negotiation and request allocation. The analysis is conducted via simulation with SIDE using a Behavioral Model of Web traffic to simulate accurate traffic conditions and determine the limitations or validity of these techniques.", "paper_title": "Simulation analysis of multiagent-based Dynamic Request Placement techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000237210900002"}
