The performance limit of codes with finite block length under a compound channel is studied through error bounds and simulation. Although the theorem promises uniform convergence of the probability of error as the block length approaches infinity, with short block lengths the performance can differ considerably for individual channels. Simulation results show that universal performance can be a practical goal as the block lengths become large.", "paper_title": "A study on universal codes with finite block lengths", "paper_id": "WOS:000249025100006"}
