Decision-making system is the most important part of the robot soccer system. As the environment is dynamic and complex, one of the reinforcement learning (RL) method named FNN-RL is employed in learning the decision-making strategy. The FNN-RL system consists of the fuzzy neural network (FNN) and RL. RL is used for structure identification and parameters tuning of FNN. On the other hand. the curse of dimensionality problem of RL can be solved by the function approximation characteristics of FNN. Furthermore, the residual algorithm is used to calculate the gradient of the FNN-RL method in order to guarantee the convergence and rapidity of learning. The complex decision-making task is divided into multiple learning subtasks that include dynamic role assignment, action selection, and action implementation. They constitute a hierarchical learning system. We apply the proposed FNN-RL method to the soccer agents who attempt to learn each subtask at the various layers. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the simulation and the real experiments. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
