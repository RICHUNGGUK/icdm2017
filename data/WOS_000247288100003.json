This series also reflects the performance or Quality of Service of a web cache. It has long-memory properties but is not self-similar and does not have a heavy-tailed distribution. However, the long-memory and autocorrelation structure of NAR are preserved through aggregation, that is the aggregated series has similar statistical properties to the original one. We call this property aggregation similarity. Aggregation similarity is a very useful property, which makes management of large data sets easier and speeds up the asymptotic properties of time series.", "paper_title": "WWW traffic measure and its properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000247288100003"}
