We show that their Out-of-phase autocorrelation values are upper bounded by the maximum between q - p + 1 and 5. We also construct a family of generalized M-ary related-prime sequence, and show that the maximum correlation of the proposed Sequence family is upper bounded by p + q - 1.", "paper_title": "Generalized M-Ary Related-Prime Sequences with Low Correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164800034"}
