Buchi and Landweber (1969) proved that the Church synthesis problem is decidable. We investigate a parameterized version of the Church synthesis problem. In this extended version a formula B and a finite-state operator F might contain as a parameter a unary predicate P. A large class of predicates P is exhibited such that the Church problem with the parameter P is decidable. Our proofs use composition method and game theoretical techniques. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
