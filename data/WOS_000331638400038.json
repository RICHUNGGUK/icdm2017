Motivated by the fact that the real traffic series exhibits periodicities at the cycle of 6, 12, and 24 h, as well as 1 week, we isolate most of mentioned above features for each cell and integrate all the wavelet multiresolution sublayers into two parts for consideration of alleviating the accumulated error. On seasonal characters, multiplicative seasonal ARIMA model is to predict the seasonal part, and echo state networks are to deal with the smooth part because of its prominent approximation capabilities and convenience. Experimental results on real traffic dataset show that proposed method performs well on the prediction accuracy.", "paper_title": "A novel hybridization of echo state networks and multiplicative seasonal ARIMA model for mobile communication traffic series forecasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000331638400038"}
