In this paper, a dynamic multi-uEAC array is proposed based on the analysis of the uEAC unit mathematical model. By constructing a multi-uEAC array, the limitations of single uEAC unit on nonlinear mapping can be overcome. In order to obtain an optimal multi-uEAC array structure, a comprehensive optimization strategy based on particle swarm optimizer (PSO) is developed to optimize multi-uEAC array structure matrix and connection matrix simultaneously. Two simulation examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "Optimization of Multi-Micro Extended Analog Computer Array and its Applications to Data Mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000341546400008"}
