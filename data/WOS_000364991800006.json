Methods: For 57 benign and 31 malignant tumors, 18 SWE features were extracted from regions of interest (ROI), including the tumor and peritumoral areas. In the ROI, a histogram in each color channel was described using moments such as the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Moreover, three color channels were combined as a vector to evaluate tissue elasticity. The SWE features were then combined in a logistic regression classifier for breast tumor classification. Results: The performance of the CAD system achieved an accuracy of 81%. Combining the CAD system with a BI-RADS assessment obtained an Az improvement from 0.77 to 0.89 (p-value <0.05). Conclusions: The combination of the proposed CAD system based on SWE features and the BI-RADS assessment would provide a promising diagnostic suggestion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
