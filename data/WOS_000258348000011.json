Searching out similar CAD models of products is a key to facilitating design reuse. This paper proposes a method for retrieving CAD models of mechanical parts by freehand sketches. Users can draw three 2D outline sketches and a skeleton sketch to express their query intent. The 2D outline sketches describe the geometrical information of models and the skeleton sketch contains the topological information. A relevance feedback mechanism is introduced to combine the two similarity degrees measured by 2D outlines or skeleton into a unified one. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
