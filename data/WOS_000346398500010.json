The merits of the proposed method lie firstly in the fact that the measured input and output variables and their past values are chosen as the state variables that avoid the need of state observers. Secondly, by using the formulation of a new state space variable, the resulting PFC control incorporates both the state and output feedback, which further improve closed-loop process responses over previous methods. The performance and robustness of the control system are discussed. A typical example of inverse-response process is given to compare the proposed controller and the previous. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
