Each time a new vertex appears, it chooses exactly one of the existing vertices and attaches to it. The probability that the new vertex chooses vertex x is proportional to w(deg(x)), a weight function of the actual degree of x. The weight function w : N -> R+ is the parameter of the model. In [4] and [11] the authors derive the asymptotic degree distribution for a model that is equivalent to the special case, when the weight function is linear. The proof therein strongly relies on the linear choice of w. Using well-established results from the theory of general branching processes we give the asymptotical degree distribution for a wide range of weight functions. Moreover, we provide the asymptotic distribution of the tree itself as seen from a randomly selected vertex. The latter approach gives greater insight to the limiting structure of the tree. Our proof is robust and we believe that the method may be used to answer several other questions related to the model. It relies on the fact that considering the evolution of the random tree in contintious time, the process may be viewed as a general branching process, this way classical results can be applied.", "paper_title": "Random trees and general branching processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000248816600004"}
