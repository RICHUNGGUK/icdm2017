The micro-structural modelling of concrete under fire conditions is derived from a mechanical and thermodynamic consistent theory and it is strictly related to a self-consistent, carefully extracted set of experimental data, in order to make a correct validation and calibration of the numerical F.E. procedures and codes. Even if appearing as a first but successful example, it is shown that a procedure accounting for coupled material and geometric nonlinearities is able to attain valuable and realistic numerical results concerning spalling process in concrete.
