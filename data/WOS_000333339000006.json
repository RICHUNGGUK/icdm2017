When a collection of possible shapes is available, the specification of a shape prior using kernel density estimation is a natural technique. Unfortunately, energy functionals arising from kernel density estimation are of a form that makes them impossible to directly minimize using efficient optimization algorithms such as graph cuts. Our main contribution is to show how one may recast the energy functional into a form that is minimizable iteratively and efficiently using graph cuts.", "paper_title": "Iterative Graph Cuts for Image Segmentation with a Nonlinear Statistical Shape Prior", "paper_id": "WOS:000333339000006"}
