We investigate for the eight most important potential properties of fuzzy implications, which ones should be taken into consideration to measure the similarity, and thereafter choose a suitable fuzzy implication which satisfies these potential properties. Simple examples are given to illustrate the application of the chosen fuzzy implication in a partition algorithm used for multi-criteria decision making.", "paper_title": "The role a fuzzy implication plays in a multi-criteria decision algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000309964000008"}
