We explore relevant statistical challenges to modeling and inference in real-time gene expression data from single-shock experiments, with special attention on potential confounding between treatment and cell cycle variation. We propose a semi-wavelet non-linear dynamic regression model to infer modulation in gene expression due to treatment shocks in the presence of cell cycle variation. A case study is performed with public data. Results are compared ignoring cell cycle. Estimation and inference are performed by a Bayesian approach.", "paper_title": "Real-time gene expression: Statistical challenges in design and inference", "paper_id": "WOS:000258164000005"}
