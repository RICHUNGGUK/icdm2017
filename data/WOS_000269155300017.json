ABVCap assigns each node multiple 5-tuple virtual coordinates. Subsequently, we introduce a protocol, ABVCap routing, to route packets based on the ABVCap virtual coordinate system. ABVCap routing guarantees packet delivery without the computation and storage of the global topological features. Finally, we demonstrate an approach, ABVCap maintenance, to reconstruct an ABVCap virtual coordinate system in a network with node failures. Simulations show ABVCap routing ensures moderate routing path length, as compared to virtual-coordinate-based routing, GLIDER, Hop ID, GLDR, and VCap.", "paper_title": "Virtual-Coordinate-Based Delivery-Guaranteed Routing Protocol in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000269155300017"}
