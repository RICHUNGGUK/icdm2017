At each iteration, the procedure inserts a connected component of the required edges and performs a local postoptimization. Computational results on a set of benchmark instances with up to 350 vertices show that the proposed procedure is competitive with the classical Frederickson procedure. Its use is recommended when a high-quality solution is needed in a short amount of time (e.g., in laser plotter applications). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
