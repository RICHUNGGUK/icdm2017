LSTOP encourages nodes' cooperation by rewarding nodes for their forwarding service according to their cost. It incurs a low overhead of O(n(2)) in the worst case and only O(n) on the average. We show the truthfulness of LSTOP and present the result of an extensive simulation study to show that LSTOP approaches optimal (cost) routing and achieves significant better network performance compared to ad hoc-VCG.", "paper_title": "A light-weight scalable truthful routing protocol in MANETs with selfish nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000266357400011"}
