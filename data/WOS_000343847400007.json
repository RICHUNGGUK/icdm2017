A dynamic condensation is proposed in order to eliminate Degrees Of Freedom not directly measurable like rotations. Before the condensation, the Craig-Bampton method can be optionally used to reduce the model (decrease of both computational and measurement times). Regularization based on the Tikhonov method and a double inversion of the operator is performed. After a numerical study of the accuracy of each step for different excitations, an experimental validation finally proved that it was both possible to locate accurately a shaker over a wide range of frequency and to estimate the amplitude of the injected force. Both dynamic condensation and Craig-Bampton reduction were used. Even if it induces some imprecision, the Craig-Bampton reduction was found to be a fundamental step to reduce both computational cost and the measurement effort which were the main problems to address in such an approach.
