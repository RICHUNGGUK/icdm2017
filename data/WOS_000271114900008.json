The optimization of virtual supply network plays an important role in MTCMOS low-power design. Existing low-power works are mainly on gate level, without any optimization on physical design level, which can lead to a large amount of virtual supply networks. Merging the objective of virtual networks minimization into physical design, this paper presents (1) a low-power-driven physical design flow; (2) a novel low-power placement to simultaneously place standard cells and sleep transistors; and (3) the sleep transistor relocation technique to further reduce the virtual supply networks. Experimental results are promising for both achieving up to 28.15% savings for virtual supply networks and well controlling the increase of signal nets. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
