The Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) model of the HFV is firstly obtained and smoothly transformed into a polytopic form by the Tensor-Product (TP) model transformation method. After that, a dynamic decoupling control method is derived by minimizing the H-infinity norm of a virtual system, which is composed by the controlled system and the no coupling reference model. The necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the controller is derived based on Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Next, the decoupling controller for the polytopic LPV model of HFV is designed. And the simulation results show that the proposed method has perfect performance in terms of dynamic decoupling.", "paper_title": "Dynamic decoupling tracking control for the polytopic LPV model of hypersonic vehicle", "paper_id": "WOS:000359801900004"}
