The 512-second long EEG data (recorded with 64 electrodes) are first decomposed into 64 components by independent component analysis (ICA) for each participant. Then, the spatial maps showing dipolar brain activity are selected in terms of the residual dipole variance through a single dipole model in brain imaging, and clustered into a pre-defined number (estimated by the minimum description length) of clusters. Subsequently, the temporal courses of the EEG theta and alpha oscillations of each component for each cluster are produced and correlated with the temporal courses of tonal and rhythmic features of the music. Using this approach, we found that the extracted temporal courses of the theta and alpha oscillations along central and occipital area of scalp in two of the selected clusters significantly correlated with the musical features representing progressions in the rhythmic content of the stimulus. We suggest that this demonstrates that with the proposed approach, we have managed to discover what kinds of brain responses were elicited when a participant was listening continuously to the long piece of naturalistic music.", "paper_title": "Linking Brain Responses to Naturalistic Music Through Analysis of Ongoing EEG and Stimulus Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000324763600010"}
