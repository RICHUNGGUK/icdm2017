The result is a conceptual model of geographic entities, the spatial functions operating on them, and a special-purpose exploratory interface that lets users search combinations of georeferenced objects directly on a map. Such modifications help the general framework provide ranked extraction of relevant objects and their combinations, custom ranking functions, and cost-based access to location-based services.", "paper_title": "A Framework for Integrating, Exploring, and Searching Location-Based Web Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000296233700005"}
