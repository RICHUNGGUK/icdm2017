Several distortion mechanisms are excited and compensated using only magnitude measurements of the output signal components. The information extracted in this way is used to parameterize the model. The validity of the suggested approach is confirmed by comparing the measured and the predicted transmitter's response, when driven by broad-band input signals. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals.
