Availability indicates that a system continuously provides a useful service at any given time. Failure detection and recovery methods are supported for developing application of availability. Requirement on availability may vary with applications and in addition may change over time. For applications to be independent of the change of availability requirement there should be a flexible and extensible architecture for supporting availability management. This paper presents an availability management framework (AMF), which supports the flexible management of availability for large distributed systems using object-oriented framework technologies. We focus on the AMF's flexibility in order to accommodate changing availability requirements which vary with each application. In addition, this paper describes the result of application of the framework to support availability of RFID systems.", "paper_title": "An Object-Oriented Framework Approach to Flexible Availability Management for Developing Distributed Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000268197700004"}
