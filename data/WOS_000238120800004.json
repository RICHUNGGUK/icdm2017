In this paper we therefore assess other loss process characteristics of finite capacity Markov-modulated M/M/1-type buffers. Combining a probability generating functions approach with matrix techniques, we derive an expression for the joint probability generating function of the time and the number of accepted packets - packets that are not lost - between packet losses. We then illustrate our approach by means of some numerical examples.", "paper_title": "On the packet loss process at a network node", "paper_id": "WOS:000238120800004"}
