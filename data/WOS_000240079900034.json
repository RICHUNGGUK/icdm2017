We wish to construct a new hash function H that is collision resistant if at least one of H-1 or H-2 is collision resistant. Concatenating the output of H-1 and H-2 clearly works, but at the cost of doubling the hash output size. We ask whether a better construction exists, namely, can we hedge our bets without doubling the size of the output? We take a step towards answering this question in the negative - we show that any secure construction that evaluates each hash function once cannot output fewer bits than simply concatenating the given functions.", "paper_title": "On the impossibility of efficiently combining collision resistant hash functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079900034"}
