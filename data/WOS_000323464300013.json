The scheme is specifically designed for flows in fluid-embedded body interaction as well as curved regions. As the scheme utilizes the 4th order pure stream function form of the N-S equations, the entire flow field can be described in terms of only one equation and thus avoids the difficulties associated with pressure field and nonphysical vorticity boundary conditions. We carry out a spectral analysis as well as von Neumann stability analysis of this scheme and also provide an algorithm for the flow computation. We use the scheme to simulate the time development of 20 viscous flows of varied physical complexities in different geometrical settings: Taylor-Green decaying vortices, constricted channel, flow past rotating and in-line oscillating circular cylinders, and flow past an elliptic cylinder and symmetric aerofoils with various angles of attack. The results obtained are compared with experimental and numerical results available in the literature. Excellent match is obtained in all cases, establishing the efficiency and the accuracy of the proposed scheme. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
