The latter controls the number of Fourier coefficients to be included, and it also determines how the Fourier estimator responds to market microstructure noise. By examining the finite sample properties of the Fourier estimator, an easy-to-implement procedure is developed for the optimal cutting frequency which minimizes the mean squared error in the presence of the microstructure noise, along with a modified Whittle likelihood approach for the estimation of the signal-to-noise ratio.
