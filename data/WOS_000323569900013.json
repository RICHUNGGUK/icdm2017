By the proposed control circuit based on digital control using the field programmable gate array (FPGA), the total harmonic distortion (THD) and power factor (PF) of the proposed LED driver are significantly improved as compared with the traditional LED drivers. The proposed AC LED driver is capacitorless and inductorless in the main power stage, thereby causing the integrated circuit design to be easy to achieve and the life of the LED driver to be enhanced. In this paper, the basic operating principle of the LED driver is described in detail, along with some experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LED driver.", "paper_title": "Controllable and Dimmable AC LED Driver Based on FPGA to Achieve High PF and Low THD", "paper_id": "WOS:000323569900013"}
