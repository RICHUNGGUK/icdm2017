We first prove a global null controllability result of an associated linearized integrodifferential equation by establishing a suitable observability estimate for adjoint system with appropriate assumptions on the coefficients. Then this result is successfully used with some estimates for parabolic equation in L-k spaces together with classical fixed point theorem, to prove the null controllability of the nonlinear model.", "paper_title": "NULL CONTROLLABILITY OF A NONLINEAR DIFFUSION SYSTEM IN REACTOR DYNAMICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000285771400006"}
