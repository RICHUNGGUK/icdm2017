In this paper, we outline how DOPs effectively capture and express digital object typing information and finally assist in the development of unified web-based DL services such as adaptive cataloguing, batch digital object ingestion and automatic digital content conversions. In contrast, conventional DL services require custom implementations for each different type of material.", "paper_title": "Digital object prototypes: An effective realization of digital object types", "paper_id": "WOS:000241101500011"}
