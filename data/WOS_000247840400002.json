These schemes iteratively adjust transmit powers of individual network transmitters with respect to mutually caused interference in the shared bands. Their most attractive feature is that they find network-wide acceptable trade-offs to diverse signal-to-noise and interference (SINR) requirements and efficiently use techniques of stochastic approximation and time-averaging to guarantee a robust performance in random channels. Advantageously, both proposed algorithms do not assume any particular modulation, coding, QoS measure definition or network architecture, which assures their high applicability in the industry and research. Moreover, the broad definition and non-linear nature of these schemes mathematically generalize and thus encompass as a special case many widely deployed power control schemes such as e.g. those for achieving fixed SINR targets or using game-theoretic utility maximization. Simulations are provided to illustrate our approach and its better performance compared to standard algorithms.", "paper_title": "Optimum practical design of distributed and asynchronous power control for wireless networks with shared bands", "paper_id": "WOS:000247840400002"}
