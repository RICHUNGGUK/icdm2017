By making use of the scheme of average dwell time and under the condition that the activation time ratio between controllable subsystems and uncontrollable ones is not less than a specified constant, the state feedback controllers are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) such that the resulting closed-loop system is exponentially stable for all admissible uncertainties and has a weighted guaranteed cost upper bound. As an example, the controller design for an AV-8A Harrier VTOL aircraft illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Guaranteed cost control for a class of uncertain switched delay systems: An average dwell-time method", "paper_id": "WOS:000243367800005"}
