In the current study, we developed ICE code selection tools to support the coding of activity and participation data recorded in domiciliary mental health care reports. Methods: We first developed a search system to facilitate the selection of ICE codes by tracking back through codes' conceptual trees using a directory tool. We performed a morphological analysis on the training data set to correlate nouns with the ICE codes and obtained an analysis corpus to which numerical scores representing the frequencies of associated ICE codes for each noun were assigned. Based on the obtained corpus we developed a full-text search tool, which could simplify ICE coding relative to that performed using the directory tool. We then evaluated the usefulness of the former tool on the test data set. Results: Using the full-text search tool, correct ICE codes were recorded in the first candidate list for only 54.2% of sentences. However, correct ICF codes appeared on the combined candidate lists for 90.1% of sentences and on the top three candidate lists for 71.7%. In a specific case (General Tasks and Demands), 100% of the correct codes were included on the combined candidate lists. Conclusion: We developed selection tools that effectively supported ICE coding, although it was impossible to fully automate ICE coding. This indicated that ICE codes could more effectively be applied to mental health care.", "paper_title": "Development of ICF Code Selection Tools for Mental Health Care", "paper_id": "WOS:000289011300007"}
