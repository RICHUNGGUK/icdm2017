Evolutionary design of circuit (EDC) combined with data mining is a promising way to solve the problem. To improve EDC in the aspects of efficiency, scalability and capability of optimization, a novel technique is developed. It features an adaptive multiobjective genetic algorithm and interactions between EDC and data mining. The proposed method is validated by the experiments on arithmetic circuits, showing many exciting results especially some novel knowledge discovered from the EDC data.", "paper_title": "CBR-based knowledge discovery on results of evolutionary design of logic circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200096"}
