The proposed research model developed herein was tested via a survey of 167 employees in China and Singapore. The results of this study reveal, first, that NWRC intention is significantly predictive of NWRC behavior, NWRC attitudes and subjective norms are significant predictors of behavioral intentions, and that the perceived benefits of NWRC are related positively to NWRC attitudes. Secondly, in comparison with each research model with or without habitual behavior under different levels of control, the results of this study demonstrated that habits occupy a critical position between NWRC intentions and behavior. Finally, employees are more likely to engage in NWRC even when subjected to strict control measures, owing to their habitual behavior. Some measures to reduce NWRC behavior are also proposed based on the findings of this study.", "paper_title": "WHY EMPLOYEES DO NON-WORK-RELATED COMPUTING IN THE WORKPLACE", "paper_id": "WOS:000277311400016"}
