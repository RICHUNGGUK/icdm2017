A new DV-Hop algorithm based on shuffled frog leaping algorithm ( Shuffled Frog Leaping DV-Hop Algorithm, SFLADV-Hop) is proposed in this paper. Based on traditional DV-Hop algorithm, the new algorithm used distance of nodes and position information of anchor nodes to establish objective optimization function and realize the estimation of unknown node coordinate in the final stage of DV-Hop algorithm. The simulation results showed that compared with the traditional DV-Hop algorithm, based on not increasing the sensor node hardware overhead, the improved algorithm can effectively reduce the positioning error.", "paper_title": "An Improved DV-Hop Algorithm Based on Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000366998400003"}
