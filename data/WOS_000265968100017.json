After studying the cryptographic properties of these block matrices, the theoretical aspects of this scheme are analyzed, concluding that common ciphertext attacks are not applicable to this cryptosystem. Moreover, our proposal is compared with the Diffie-Hellman scheme achieving satisfactory results. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
