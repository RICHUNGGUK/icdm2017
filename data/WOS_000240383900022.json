They are an essential tool in computer science. A close look at flow feature definitions reveals that they can be seen as point predicates that tell if a specific feature exists at a certain point. Besides the information about features, scientists and engineers like to know the overall behavior of all streamlines in the flow, typically in the connection with the important features in their application domain. We call this a structure definition for the flow. A successful example for a structure definition is flow topology. In this paper, we present streamline predicates as functions that tell the user about the connection between streamlines and features selected by the user. This means answers to questions like: Which streamlines flow through a given vortex, separation bubble, or shock wave? It can be shown that streamline predicates may refine flow topology so that it also reveals questions about vortices in 3D.", "paper_title": "Streamline predicates", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383900022"}
