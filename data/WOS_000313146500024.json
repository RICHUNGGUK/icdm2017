The neural network considered in this paper employs the activation functions which are discontinuous monotone increasing and (possibly) unbounded. Under a new sufficient condition, we prove that the neural network has a unique almost periodic solution, which is globally exponentially stable. Moreover, the obtained conclusion is applied to prove the existence and stability of periodic solution (or equilibrium point) for delayed neural networks with periodic coefficients (or constant coefficients). We also give some illustrative numerical examples to show the effectiveness of our results.", "paper_title": "Global exponential stability of almost periodic solution of delayed neural networks with discontinuous activations", "paper_id": "WOS:000313146500024"}
