Our objective is to maximize the number of optical connection-requests that can be established for a given number of wavelengths. A mathematical formulation for Max-RWA was presented. In this article, we implement and compare the performance of two random search algorithms namely: the genetic algorithm and the tabu search algorithm. Using these metaheuristics we solved approximately the wavelength assignment problem for Max-RWA while we computed its routing by a deterministic method which is the backtracking. Therefore we conducted many extensive experiments under different circumstances. Diagrams and representative numerical examples indicate the accuracy of our algorithms.", "paper_title": "Evaluation performance of genetic algorithm and tabu search algorithm for solving the Max-RWA problem in all-optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000363033600015"}
