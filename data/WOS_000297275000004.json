Using the support vector machine (SVM) approach, we constructed a model for predicting ligand-protein interaction based only on the primary sequence of proteins and the structural features of small molecules. The model, trained by using 15 000 ligand-protein interactions between 626 proteins and over 10 000 active compounds, was successfully used in discovering nine novel active compounds for four pharmacologically important targets (i.e., GPR40, SIRT1, p38, and GSK-3 beta). To our knowledge, this is the first example of a successful sequence-based virtual screening campaign, demonstrating that our approach has the potential to discover, with a single model, active ligands for any protein.", "paper_title": "Computational Screening for Active Compounds Targeting Protein Sequences: Methodology and Experimental Validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000297275000004"}
