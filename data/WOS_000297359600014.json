To have a broader picture on relevant routing protocols together, variants of AODV-based backup routing protocols are formulated by corresponding algorithms, and also each of them are simulated to obtain the necessary performance metrics for comparisons in terms of packet delivery ratio, average latency delay, and the normalized routing load. Then to make the process of data salvation more efficiently in case of link failure, we explore the possibility of combining the AODV backup routing strategy and on-demand node-disjoint multipath routing protocols. This article proposes an improved approach named DPNR (Dual Paths Node-disjoint Routing) for data salvation, a routing protocol that maintains the only two shortest backup paths in the source and destination nodes. The DPNR scheme can alleviate the redundancy-frames overhead during the process of data salvation by the neighboring intermediate nodes. Our simulation results have demonstrated that DPNR scheme delivers good data delivery performance while restricting the impacts of transmission collision and channel contention. The mathematical rationale for our proposed approach is stated as well.", "paper_title": "Dual paths node-disjoint routing for data salvation in mobile ad hoc", "paper_id": "WOS:000297359600014"}
