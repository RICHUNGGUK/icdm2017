We prove the stability, of our signatures under Gromov-Hausdorff perturbations of the spaces. We also extend these results to metric spaces equipped with measures. Our signatures are well-suited for the study of unstructured point cloud data, which we illustrate through an application in shape classification.", "paper_title": "Gromov-Hausdorff Stable Signatures for Shapes using Persistence", "paper_id": "WOS:000268597500015"}
