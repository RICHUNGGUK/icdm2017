Cyclic codes have been studied for many years, but their weight distributions are known only for a few cases. In this paper, let F-r be an extension of a finite field F-q and r = q(m), we determine the weight distributions of the cyclic codes C = {c(a, b) : a, b is an element of F-r}, c(a, b) = (Tr-r/q(ag(1)(0) + bg(2)(0)), ... , Tr-r/q(ag(1)(n-1) + bg(2)(n-1))), g(1), g(2) is an element of F-r, in the following two cases: 1) ord(g(1)) = n, n vertical bar r - 1 and g(2) = 1 and 2) ord(g(1)) = n, g(2) = g(1)(2), ord(g(2)) = n/2, m = 2, and 2(r - 1)/n vertical bar(q + 1).", "paper_title": "Weight Distributions of Two Classes of Cyclic Codes With Respect to Two Distinct Order Elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000330282600021"}
