The TRPA1 channel is expressed in the inner ear and in nociceptive neurons. It is involved in hearing as well as in the perception of pungent and irritant chemicals. The ankyrin repeat domain has special mechanical properties, which allows it to function as a soft spring that can be extended over a large range while maintaining structural integrity. A calcium-binding site has been experimentally identified within the ankyrin repeats. We built a model of the N-terminal 17 ankyrin repeat structure, including the calcium-binding EF-hand. In our simulations we find the calcium-bound state to be rigid as compared to the calcium-free state. While the end-to-end distance can change by almost 50% in the apo form, these fluctuations are strongly reduced by calcium binding. This increase in stiffness that constraints the end-to-end distance in the holo form is predicted to affect the force acting on the gate of the TRPA1 channel, thereby changing its open probability. Simulations of the transmembrane domain of TRPA1 show that residue N855, which has been associated with familial episodic pain syndrome, forms a strong link between the S4-S5 connecting helix and S1, thereby creating a direct force link between the N-terminus and the gate. The N855S mutation weakens this interaction, thereby reducing the communication between the N-terminus and the transmembrane part of TRPA1.", "paper_title": "Regulation of the transient receptor potential channel TRPA1 by its N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000326193200009"}
