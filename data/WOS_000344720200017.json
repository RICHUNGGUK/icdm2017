Our video retrieval method is based on a bag of keypoints (local visual features) and the exponential IDF estimates the keypoint importance weights more accurately than the original IDF. The exponential IDF is capable of suppressing the keypoints from frequently occurring background objects in videos, and we found that this effect is essential for achieving improved search accuracy in CBVR. Our proposed method is especially designed to tackle instance video search, one of the CBVR tasks, and we demonstrate its effectiveness in significantly enhancing the instance search accuracy using the TRECVID2012 video retrieval dataset.", "paper_title": "BM25 With Exponential IDF for Instance Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000344720200017"}
