We show the latter to be term equivalent to the variety of right-handed skew Boolean algebras. Both operations are then studied within the broader context of skew lattices with an eye towards achieving greater insight into their joint algebraic behavior. A decision procedure is given to determine whether an equation in both operations holds for all sets of partial functions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
