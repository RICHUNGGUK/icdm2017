This k-tree-based graph process can be viewed as an idealized model that captures some characteristics of the preferential attachment and copying mechanisms that existing evolving graph processes fail to model due to technical obstacles. The result also serves as a further cautionary note reinforcing the point of view that a power law degree distribution should not be regarded as the only important characteristic of a complex network, as has been previously argued [D.
