Due to the enormousness of the target service area, relay equipment play an important role in such networks, and the installation and maintenance cost of the network is directly proportional to the cost of the relay equipment. To minimize the network operational cost, all optimization framework which computes the minimum number of relay stations and their corresponding placements and channel assignments in the network is desired. Because the problem is NP-hard, we propose an efficient optimization algorithm based on a modified version of Bender's decomposition to iteratively compute converging bounds to the problem solution. Our numerical results show that by using a few relay stations in a rural community, broadband Internet access call be established in a cost effective manner. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
