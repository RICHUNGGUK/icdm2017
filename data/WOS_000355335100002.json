The model assumes fluid flow to be single phase and compaction to be strictly vertical. On each time step, we use splitting by physical processes to discretize the model equations on a quadrilateral mesh. The movement of the mesh is governed by the laws of the mass and momentum conservation of the sediments, and the fluid flow is resolved using the mixed finite element method on a resulting mesh. Development of geological pinchouts during the simulation is supported. The results of a numerical simulation are presented to verify the implementation of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Modeling fluid flow and compaction in sedimentary basins using mixed finite elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000355335100002"}
