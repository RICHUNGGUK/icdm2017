A complete NoC design contains exploration on both hardware and software architectures. The hardware architecture includes the selection of Processing Elements (PEs) with multiple types and their topology. The software architecture contains allocating tasks to PEs, scheduling of tasks and their communications. To find the best hardware design for the target tasks, both hardware and software architectures need to be considered simultaneously. Previous works on NoC design have concentrated on solving only one or two design parameters at a time. In this paper, we propose a hardware-software co-synthesis algorithm for a heterogeneous NoC architecture. The design goal is to minimize energy consumption while meeting the real-time requirements commonly seen in embedded applications. The proposed algorithm is based on Simulated-Annealing (SA). To compare the solution quality and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, we also implement the branch-and-bound and iterative algorithm to solve the hardware-software co-synthesis problem of a heterogeneous NoC. With the given synthetic task sets, the experimental results show that the proposed SA-based algorithm achieves near-optimal solution in a reasonable time, while the branch-and-bound algorithm takes a very long time to find the optimal solution, and the iterative algorithm fails to achieve good solution quality. When applying the co-synthesis algorithms to a real-world application with PE library that has little variation in PE performance and energy consumption, the iterative algorithm achieves solution quality comparable to that of the proposed SA-based algorithm.
