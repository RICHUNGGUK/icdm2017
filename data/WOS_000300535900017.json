For example, some multimedia streaming applications prefer a smooth sending rate on a time scale of tens of seconds, however, a UDP flow maintaining such a long smoothness time scale is naturally not TCP friendly by the current definition. In this paper, we propose an innovative method to relatively compare the degrees of TCP friendliness of different traffic control protocols, and use it to define a new class of TCP friendliness definitions, called stochastic TCP friendliness (STF). STF greatly expands the design space of TCP-friendly traffic control protocols, while still effectively maintaining the desired fairness of the Internet. To demonstrate the expanded design space, we also develop a new congestion control protocol, called TCP-friendly CBR-Like Rate Control (TFCBR), for multimedia streaming applications which do not require a high sending rate but prefer a smooth sending rate on a time scale of tens of seconds. TFCBR is stochastically TCP friendly, however, it is not TCP friendly by the current definition. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
