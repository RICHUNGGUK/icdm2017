Based on the Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement policy in CCN, the closed-form expression of the miss-probability is first derived by considering the sequence of arriving requests under single cache scenario, and then extended to linear and binary tree topologies. Consequently, the virtual round trip time (VRTT) is determined to be influenced by cache capacity and link bandwidth. The simulation results show that the proposed miss-probability model accords with realistic CCN network conditions, being much better than the existing model.", "paper_title": "Modeling of miss-probability in content-centric networking", "paper_id": "WOS:000358136300015"}
