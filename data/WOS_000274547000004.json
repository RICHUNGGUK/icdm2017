These algorithms can be seen as variants of Merriman, Bence, and Osher's threshold dynamics [25]. The new algorithms proposed here preserve the computational efficiency of the original threshold dynamics algorithm. However, unlike threshold dynamics, the new algorithms also allow attaining high accuracy on uniform grids, without adaptive refinement. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
