For each supply-demand point pair, the transportation time is an independent random variable. Preference of each route is attached. Our model has two criteria, namely: minimize the transportation time target subject to a chance constraint and maximize the minimal preference among the used routes. Since usually a transportation pattern optimizing two objectives simultaneously does not exist, we define non-domination in this setting and propose an efficient algorithm to find some non-dominated transportation patterns. We then show the time complexity of the proposed algorithm. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate how our algorithm works.", "paper_title": "CHANCE CONSTRAINED BOTTLENECK TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM WITH PREFERENCE OF ROUTES", "paper_id": "WOS:000312568700009"}
