Two algorithms are presented to jointly consider interference suppression and power allocation (PA) based on the minimization of the symbol error rate (SER) criterion. A stochastic gradient (SG) algorithm is developed on the basis of the minimum-SER (MSER) criterion to jointly update the parameter vectors that allocate the power levels among the relay sensors subject to a total power constraint and the linear receiver. In addition, a conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm is developed on the basis of the SER criterion. A centralized algorithm is designed at the fusion center. Destination nodes transmit the quantized information of the PA vector to the relay nodes through a limited-feedback channel. The complexity and convergence analysis of the proposed algorithms are carried out. Simulation results show that the proposed two adaptive algorithms significantly outperform the other previously reported algorithms.", "paper_title": "Joint adaptive power allocation and interference suppression algorithms based on theMSER criterion for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000343904600012"}
