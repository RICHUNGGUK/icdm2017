Specifically, we prove that every s-state 2NFA has a poly(s)-state 2DFA that agrees with it on all inputs of length <= s if and only if NL subset of L/poly, and every s-state 2NFA has a poly(s)-state 2DFA that agrees with it on all inputs of length <= 2(s) if and only if NLL subset of LL/polylog. Here, 2DFAs and 2NFAs are the deterministic and nondeterministic 2FAs, NL and L/poly are the standard classes of languages recognizable in logarithmic space by nondeterministic TMs and by deterministic TMs with access to polynomially long advice, and NLL and LL/polylog are the corresponding complexity classes for space O(log log n) and advice length poly(log n). Our arguments strengthen and extend an old theorem by Berman and Lingas and can be used to obtain variants of the above statements for other modes of computation or other combinations of bounds for the input length, the space usage, and the length of advice.", "paper_title": "Two-Way Automata Versus Logarithmic Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000338504700009"}
