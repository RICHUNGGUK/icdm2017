Proper preparation, response and recovery are required in order to cope with and survive large-scale disasters; unfortunately however, the institutions responsible for delivering emergency response services form a heterogeneous set that often under-performs due to lack of proper interoperation and collaboration. New innovative, holistic and integrated models, representing all essential aspects of the disaster events and response team participants are necessary to successfully meet these new challenges. Based on previous research and applications, this paper argues that the necessary artefacts can be built using an interdisciplinary, industry-based paradigm enabled by advances in the Interoperability, Collaborative Networks and Enterprise Architecture disciplines. This combined approach aims to provide a sound platform for efficient disaster response delivered by agile and synergic task force teams. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
