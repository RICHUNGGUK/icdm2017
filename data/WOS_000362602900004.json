The advantages and disadvantages of both are discussed, and we combine them into a hybrid algorithm. The hybrid method uses results from AGA as the starting values for SART. We demonstrate that this leads to improved reconstruction results: less noise than SART and better reconstruction of shapes than AGA. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
