The circuit consists of an on-chip threshold-voltage-monitoring circuit, a current-source circuit, a body-biasing control circuit, and the delay cells of the VCO. Because variations in low-voltage VCO frequency are mainly determined by that of the current in delay cells. a current-compensation technique was adopted by using an on-chip threshold-voltage-monitoring circuit and body-biasing circuit techniques. Monte Carlo SPICE simulations demonstrated that variations in the oscillation frequency by using the proposed techniques were able to be suppressed about 65% at a I-V supply voltage, compared to frequencies with and without the techniques.", "paper_title": "Low-Voltage Process-Compensated VCO with On-Chip Process Monitoring and Body-Biasing Circuit Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000273190700015"}
