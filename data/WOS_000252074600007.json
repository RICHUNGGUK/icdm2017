Most interesting activities and their products are a result of creativity. The main goal of our approach is to explore new creative ways of editing and producing videos, using evolutionary algorithms. A creative evolutionary system makes use of evolutionary computation operators and properties and is designed to aid our own creative processes, and to generate results to problems that traditionally required creative people to solve. Our system is able to generate new videos or to help a user in doing so. New video sequences are combined and selected, based on their characteristics represented as video annotations, either by defining criteria or by interactively performing selections in the evolving population of video clips, in forms that can reflect editing styles. With evolving video, the clips can be explored through emergent narratives and aesthetics in ways that may reveal or inspire creativity in digital art. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
