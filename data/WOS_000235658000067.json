High flexibility and scalability are crucial for a Grid monitoring system. This paper introduces the architecture and some implementation details of a Mobile Agent-based Grid Monitoring System (MAGMS). In this system, MA with its monitoring tasks is designed to be encapsulated in SOAP conforming to the OGSA standards, and then be transported to wherever there is consumption of services and executed. MAGMS is a novel infrastructure for its flexibility, scalability and fine-well QoS guarantee.", "paper_title": "MAGMS: Mobile Agent-based Grid Monitoring System", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000067"}
