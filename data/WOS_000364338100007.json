However, the rapid increase in scale, dynamicity, heterogeneity, and diversity of cloud resources necessitates having expert knowledge about programming complex orchestration operations (for example, selection, deployment, monitoring, and runtime control) on those resources to achieve the desired quality of service. This article provides an overview of the key cloud resource types and resource orchestration operations, with special focus on research issues involved in programming those operations.", "paper_title": "Cloud Resource Orchestration Programming Overview, Issues, and Directions", "paper_id": "WOS:000364338100007"}
