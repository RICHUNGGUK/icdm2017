A naive approach is a two-step procedure that first estimates two densities separately and then computes their difference. However, such a two-step procedure does not necessarily work well because the first step is performed without regard to the second step and thus a small error in the first stage can cause a big error in the second stage. Recently, a single-shot method called the least-squares density-difference (LSDD) estimator has been proposed. LSDD directly estimates the density difference without separately estimating two densities, and it was demonstrated to outperform the two-step approach. In this paper, we propose a variation of LSDD called the constrained least-squares density-difference (CLSDD) estimator, and theoretically prove that CLSDD improves the accuracy of density difference estimation for correctly specified parametric models. The usefulness of the proposed method is also demonstrated experimentally.", "paper_title": "Constrained Least-Squares Density-Difference Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784400015"}
