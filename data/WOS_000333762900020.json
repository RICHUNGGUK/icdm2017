An accurate and stable reconstruction method is presented to solve the associated inverse problem. The approach consists of two main steps: (1) At low frequency, a multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is used to obtain the locations of inclusions, which serve as an initial guess for reconstructions at higher frequencies. (2) A continuation method based on multiple frequency data is then applied to recover the shapes of inclusions accurately. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.", "paper_title": "Numerical Reconstruction of Electromagnetic Inclusions in Three Dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000333762900020"}
