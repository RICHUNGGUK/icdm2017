Due to the limited power supplies of wireless sensor nodes, the existing centralized approaches, which do not consider energy efficiency, cannot be directly applied to the distributed sensor environment. In this paper, we investigate how to process reverse skyline queries energy efficiently in wireless sensor networks. Initially, we theoretically analyzed the properties of reverse skyline query and proposed a skyband-based approach to tackle the problem of reverse skyline query answering over wireless sensor networks. Then, an energy-efficient approach is proposed to minimize the communication cost among sensor nodes of evaluating range reverse skyline query. Moreover, optimization mechanisms to improve the performance of multiple reverse skylines are also discussed. Extensive experiments on both real-world data and synthetic data have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approaches with various experimental settings.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Reverse Skyline Query Processing over Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000304202000008"}
