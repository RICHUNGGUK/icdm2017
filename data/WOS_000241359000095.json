A set of independent indexes was constructed for each top level domain of the EuroGOV collection. Each index contains information extracted from the document, like URL, title, keywords, detected named entities or HTML headers. These indexes are queried to obtain partial document rankings, which are combined with various relative weights to test the value of each index. The final aim is to identify which index (or combination of them) is more relevant for a retrieval task, avoiding the construction of a full-text index.", "paper_title": "MIRACLE at WebCLEF 2005: Combining Web specific and linguistic information", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000095"}
