Usually, there are different client classes with different SLOs. In this paper, we extend a technique that enforces the fulfilment of the SLOs using admission control. The admission control of new user sessions is based on a response-time model. The technique proposed in this paper dynamically adapts the model to changes in workload characteristics and system configuration, so that the system can work autonomically, without human intervention. The technique requires no knowledge about the internals of the system: thus, it is easy to use and can be applied to many systems. Its utility is demonstrated by a set of experiments on a system that implements the TPC-App benchmark. The experiments show that the model adaptation works correctly in very different situations that include large and small changes in response times, increasing and decreasing response times, and different patterns of workload injection. In all this scenarios, the technique updates the model progressively until it adjusts to the new situation and in intermediate situations the model never experiences abnormal behaviour that could lead to a failure in the admission control component.
