Multiorder neurons are an evolutionary extension of the use of higher-order neurons in clustering. Higher-order neurons parametrically model complex neuron shapes by replacing the classic synaptic weight by higher-order tensors. The multiorder neuron goes one step further and eliminates two problems associated with higher-order neurons. First, it uses evolutionary algorithms to select the best neuron order for a given problem. Second, it obtains more information about the underlying data distribution by identifying the correct order for a given cluster of patterns. Empirically we observed that when the correlation of clusters found with ground truth information is used in measuring clustering accuracy, the proposed evolutionary multiorder neurons method can be shown to outperform other related clustering methods. The simulation results from the Iris, Wine, and Glass data sets show significant improvement when compared to the results obtained using self-organizing maps and higher-order neurons. The letter also proposes an intuitive model by which multiorder neurons can be grown, thereby determining the number of clusters in data.", "paper_title": "Multiorder neurons for evolutionary higher-order clustering and growth", "paper_id": "WOS:000250751900011"}
