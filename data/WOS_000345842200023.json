The LC ILFD was implemented in the TSMC 0.18 mu m 1P6M CMOS process and it was stressed at the supply voltage of 2.3 V for 5 h. The dual-resonance ILFD has dual-band locking ranges and it uses series-peaking injection MOSFET. The over-voltage RF stress reduces both the high-frequency and low-frequency band locking ranges. The ILFD current consumption can decrease or increase with stress time, and this depends upon the stress condition. The phase noise in the injection-locked state can decrease with stress time.", "paper_title": "Over-voltage stressed dual-resonance injection-locked frequency divider with series-peaking injection device", "paper_id": "WOS:000345842200023"}
