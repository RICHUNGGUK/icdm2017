We present a stability analysis for a TCP/RaQ system that leads to a sufficient condition for the system to be stable. The performance of RaQ is evaluated by simulations and the results demonstrate that RaQ AQM is stable and robust under various scenarios including cases involving non-TCP traffic types (UDP and HTTP) and a case involves a multiple bottleneck topology. Its superiority over other AQMs is also demonstrated. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
