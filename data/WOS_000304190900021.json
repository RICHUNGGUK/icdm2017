We prove that no such word can be generated by a morphism, except if k = 1. On the other hand, for every k >= 2, there exist length-k-overlap-free binary infinite words which are not length-(k-1) -overlap-free. As an application, we prove that, for every non-negative integer n, there exist infinitely many length-k-overlap-free binary infinite partial words with n holes.", "paper_title": "Length-k-overlap-free Binary Infinite Words", "paper_id": "WOS:000304190900021"}
