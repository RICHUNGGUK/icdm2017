However, there is scarcely any protocol to consider them at the same time. In this paper, we propose a flow-balanced routing (FBR) protocol for multi-hop clustered wireless sensor networks that attempts to achieve both power efficiency and coverage preservation. The proposed protocol consists of four algorithms, one each for network clustering, multi-hop backbone construction, flow-balanced transmission, and rerouting. The proposed clustering algorithm groups several sensors into one cluster on the basis of overlapping degrees of sensors. The backbone construction algorithm constructs a novel multi-level backbone, which is not necessarily a tree, using the cluster heads and the sink. Furthermore, the flow-balanced routing algorithm assigns the transferred data over multiple paths from the sensors to the sink in order to equalize the power consumption of sensors. Lastly, the rerouting algorithm reconstructs the network topology only in a place where a head drops out from the backbone due to the head running out of its energy. Two metrics called the network lifetime and the coverage lifetime are used to evaluate the performance of FBR protocol in comparison with previous ones. The simulation results show that FBR yields both much longer lifetime and better coverage preservation than previous protocols. For example, FBR yields more than twice network lifetime and better coverage preservation than a previous efficient protocol, called the coverage-preserving clustering protocol (CPCP)[18], when the first sensor dies and the network coverage is kept at 100%, respectively.
