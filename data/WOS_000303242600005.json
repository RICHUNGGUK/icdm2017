The 3D DCT/IDCT transform is particularly suited for embedded systems needing the low-complexity implementation of both video encoder and decoder, such as mobile terminals with video-communication capabilities. This paper addresses the problem of real-time and low-power 3D DCT/IDCT processing by presenting a context-aware fast transform algorithm and a family of VLSI architectures characterized by different levels of parallelism. Implemented in submicron CMOS technology, the proposed hardware macrocells support the real-time processing of main video formats (up to high definition ones with an input rate of tens of Mpixels/s) with different trade-offs between circuit complexity, power consumption and computational throughput. Voltage scaling and adaptive clock-gating strategies are applied to reduce the power consumption versus the state of the art.", "paper_title": "Real-time and low-power processing of 3D direct/inverse discrete cosine transform for low-complexity video codec", "paper_id": "WOS:000303242600005"}
