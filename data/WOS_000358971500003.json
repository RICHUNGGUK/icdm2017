We use radar intensity imagery and an iceberg tracking algorithm to produce half-hourly current maps within an imaged portion of Jokulsarlon, a proglacial lagoon in southeastern Iceland. Over our 43.5-h observation period, the lagoon has clockwise circulation with current speeds of order 3-8 cm/s and occasional strong glacier outflows of up to similar to 15 cm/s. The currents driven by the glacial outflows appear to be dominantly inertial. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
