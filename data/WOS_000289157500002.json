There have been many attempts at solving CARP using heuristic and meta-heuristic approaches, including evolutionary algorithms. However, almost all such attempts formulate CARP as a single-objective problem although it usually has more than one objective, especially considering its real-world applications. This paper studies multiobjective CARP (MO-CARP). A new memetic algorithm (MA) called decomposition-based MA with extended neighborhood search (D-MAENS) is proposed. The new algorithm combines the advanced features from both the MAENS approach for single-objective CARP and multiobjective evolutionary optimization. Our experimental studies have shown that such combination outperforms significantly an off-the-shelf multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, namely nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II, and the state-of-the-art multiobjective algorithm for MO-CARP (LMOGA). Our work has also shown that a specifically designed multiobjective algorithm by combining its single-objective version and multiobjective features may lead to competitive multiobjective algorithms for multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems.", "paper_title": "Decomposition-Based Memetic Algorithm for Multiobjective Capacitated Arc Routing Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000289157500002"}
