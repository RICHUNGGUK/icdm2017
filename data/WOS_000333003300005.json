Their strength and stability can hence affect structural safety. This paper treats the response of reinforced concrete pile in saturated sand to a buried explosion. Fully coupled computer simulation techniques are used together with five different material models. Influence of reinforcement on pile response is investigated and important safety parameters of horizontal deformations and tensile stresses in the pile are evaluated. Results indicate that adequate longitudinal reinforcement and proper detailing of transverse reinforcement can reduce pile damage. Present findings can serve as a benchmark reference for future analysis and design. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
