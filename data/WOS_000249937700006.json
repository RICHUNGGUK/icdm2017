The Human heart is an irregular 3D object and thus difficult to reproduce. Basic data was taken from Visible Human Dataset (VHD), National Library of Medicine. The heart area was cut out of the original cross-sections and different tissues segmented. All the slices also had to be aligned to assure precise overlapping of the structures. A 3D computer heart model with the resolution of I mm was designed. The heart model was dedicated to simulations of heat transfer during heart surgery however, it is applicable also to other medical simulations.
