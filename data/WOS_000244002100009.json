Previous research has largely been conducted on developing shortest path algorithms in GIS. The conventional approach is to adopt the arc-node network model, which allows Only users with expert knowledge to generate measurements such as optimal paths from a map. However, the generation and maintenance of a centreline network are difficult Mid tedious because these are not natural on-ground features but imaginary lines on a map. To remedy the Situation, a revolutionary approach has been suggested that path-finding method is independent of extra arc-node data creations by end-users. By using the cell-decomposition method borrowed from motion planning of a robot, general map users may obtain an optimal path by just identifying familiarized symbols/outlines from a digital topographic map without resorting to generating all extra set of centrelines.", "paper_title": "Exact cell decomposition on base map features for optimal path finding", "paper_id": "WOS:000244002100009"}
