In this paper, we propose a virtual node based ring-like storage system architecture and data placement scheme for delay-sensitive ubiquitous applications. For improving the fault-tolerant ability of the storage service, we design a data replication approach based on a quorum-fault-tolerant state machine protocol. Moreover, we investigate a three-layered messaging protocol based on the heartbeat mechanism to detect the node failure and maintain the ring topology. The theoretic analysis and experiment results demonstrate the feasibility and high operation efficiency of our ubiquitous storage scheme.", "paper_title": "An efficient and scalable ubiquitous storage scheme for delay-sensitive IT applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000306436200005"}
