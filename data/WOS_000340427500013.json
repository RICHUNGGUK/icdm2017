However, this task is challenging because: 1) shape and size variations of the nuclei, 2) overlapping nuclear clumps, and 3) multiple z-stack images with out-of-focus regions. In this paper, we have proposed a novel automatic detection algorithm to robustly quantify myonuclei in isolated single skeletal muscle fibers. The original z-stack images are first converted into one all-in-focus image using multi-focus image fusion. A sufficient number of ellipse fitting hypotheses are then generated from the myonuclei contour segments using heteroscedastic errors-in-variables (HEIV) regression. A set of representative training samples and a set of discriminative features are selected by a two-stage sparse model. The selected samples with representative features are utilized to train a classifier to select the best candidates. A modified inner geodesic distance based mean-shift clustering algorithm is used to produce the final nuclei detection results. The proposed method was extensively tested using 42 sets of z-stack images containing over 1,500 myonuclei. The method demonstrates excellent results that are better than current state-of-the-art approaches.", "paper_title": "Automatic Myonuclear Detection in Isolated Single Muscle Fibers Using Robust Ellipse Fitting and Sparse Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000340427500013"}
