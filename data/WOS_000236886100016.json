To achieve this intention, we first describe formal definitions of the notions of security for IBE, and then present the relations among OW, IND, SS and NM in IBE, along with rigorous proofs. With the aim of comprehensiveness, notions of security for IBE in the context of encryption of multiple messages and/or to multiple receivers are finally presented. All of these results are proposed with the consideration of the particular attack in IBE, namely the adaptive chosen identity attack.", "paper_title": "Relations among notions of security for identity based encryption schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000236886100016"}
