As a result, the convergence of classical iterative methods, such as generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) would be substantially slowed down. The main purpose of this article is to show that the two-step preconditioner can greatly accelerate the convergence of the iterative method, such as GMRES. Numerical simulations show that this two-step preconditioned GMRES iterative method has a faster convergence speed than those methods when the preconditioner is used alone.
