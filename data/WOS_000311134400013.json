By using a fourth-order accurate scheme to approximate the exact solution at the first time level, it is shown through the energy method that these difference schemes have fourth-order accuracy in space and second-order accuracy in time with respect to H-1- and L-infinity-norms. A class of Richardson extrapolation algorithms based on three time-grid parameters are presented to obtain approximate solution of fourth-order accuracy in both time and space in L-infinity-norm. Numerical experiments are performed to support our theoretical results and test the accuracy and efficiency of our algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
