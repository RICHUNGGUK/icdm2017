In this paper this strategy is called Sent-But-Sure (SBS) because it avoids losses in any intermediate node. The SBS strategy combines a routing and wavelength assignment scheme with simple contention resolution mechanisms. As a result, new burst/packet allocation attempts in an intermediate node only contend with bursts/packets in transit coming from a single input link. Moreover, bursts/packets in transit always have priority over bursts/packets whose transmission has not been scheduled yet. These two main features of the SBS strategy allow us to develop an analytical model based on a two-priority M/G/1 queueing model to characterize the network performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
