The system consists of two parts: the calculation of the displacement between two consecutive frames using a correlation based corner tracker and background generation method ViBE (Visual Background Extractor). The paper discusses details of the used hardware modules, resource utilization, computing performance and power dissipation. The solution was evaluated on sequences recorded with a static and moving camera. The system was successfully tested on a hardware platform with an FPGA device. It allows to process a 720 x 576 pixels and 50 frames per second video stream in real-time.", "paper_title": "Real-time Implementation of Foreground Object Detection From a Moving Camera Using the ViBE Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000345948100022"}
