The algorithm is inspired by the classical splitting method and can be applied to general static simulation models. We provide examples from rare-event probability estimation, counting, and sampling, demonstrating that the proposed method can outperform existing Markov chain sampling methods in terms of convergence speed and accuracy.", "paper_title": "Efficient Monte Carlo simulation via the generalized splitting method", "paper_id": "WOS:000297543400001"}
