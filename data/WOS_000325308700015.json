The design of DHA-256 builds upon the design of SHA-256, but introduces additional strengthening features such as optimizing the message expansion and step function against local collision attacks. Previously, DHA-256 was analyzed by J. Zhong and X. Lai, who presented a preimage attack on 35 steps of the compression function with complexity 2(239.6). In addition, the IAIK Krypto Group provided evidence that there exists a 9-step local collision for the DHA-256 compression function with probability higher than previously predicted. In this paper, we analyze DHA-256 in the context of higher order differential attacks. In particular, we provide a practical distinguisher for 42 out of 64 steps and give an example of a colliding quartet to validate our results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
