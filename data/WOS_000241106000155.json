To confirm the feasibility of this new approach, we first extract features concerning question sentences and answer words from question answer pairs (QA pair), then we conduct experiments based on these features, using Maximum Entropy Model (MEM) as a Machine Learning (ML) technique. The first experiment conducted on the class-TIME-YEAR achieves 81.24% in precision and 78.48% in recall. The second experiment expanded to two other classes-OBJ_SUBSTANCE and LOC_CONTINENT also shows good performance.", "paper_title": "A maximum entropy model based answer extraction for Chinese question answering", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000155"}
