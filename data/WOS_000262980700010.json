It views the variation of the gap between two consequent vehicles as a Markov process whose stationary distribution corresponds to the observed gap distribution. This new model provides a microscopic simulation explanation for the governing interaction forces (potentials) between the queuing vehicles, which cannot be directly measurable for traffic flow applications. the agreement between empirical observations and simulation results suggests the soundness of this new approach.", "paper_title": "A MARKOV-PROCESS INSPIRED CA MODEL OF HIGHWAY TRAFFIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000262980700010"}
