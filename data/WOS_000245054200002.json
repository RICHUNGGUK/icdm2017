These relations can be generated from two given well-founded orderings, on the function symbols and on the type constructors. The obtained orderings on terms are well founded, monotonic, stable under substitution and include beta-reductions. They can be used to prove the strong normalization property of higher-order calculi in which constants can be defined by higher-order rewrite rules using first-order pattern matching. For example, the polymorphic version of Godel's recursor for the natural numbers is easily oriented. And indeed, our ordering is polymorphic, in the sense that a single comparison allows to prove the termination property of all monomorphic instances of a polymorphic rewrite rule. Many nontrivial examples are given that exemplify the expressive power of these orderings. All have been checked by our implementation. This article is an extended and improved version of Jouannaud and Rubio [1999]. Polymorphic algebras have been made more expressive than in our previous framework. The intuitive notion of a polymorphic higher-order ordering has now been made precise. The higher-order recursive path ordering itself has been made much more powerful by replacing the congruence on types used there by an ordering on types satisfying some abstract properties. Besides, using a restriction of Dershowitz's recursive path ordering for comparing types, we can integrate both orderings into a single one operating uniformly on both terms and types.", "paper_title": "Polymorphic higher-order recursive path orderings", "paper_id": "WOS:000245054200002"}
