The critical value of this assessment is the recording of online indices of the reader's behavior that can be interpreted in terms of strategies. The study uses materials of a standardized paper-and-pencil reading literacy test called CompLEC (Llorens et al., 2011) and a technology called Read&Answer (Vidal-Abarca et al., 2011) that presents texts and questions with a masking procedure that allows the recording of reading time and readers' actions to develop a computer-based version called e-CompLEC. We found that reliability and validity of the two versions are largely equivalent, and that e-CompLEC provides self-regulation and reading behavior indices predictive of performance. The study also shows how self-regulation is an important component of reading literacy processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
