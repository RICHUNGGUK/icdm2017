In this paper, we study the problem of power assignment in order that its induced communication graph meets the following properties: (1) it is an energy-t-spanner which is energy efficient; (2) it is k-fault resistant which can withstand up to k - 1 node failures where k >= 1; (3) the interference is minimal. We propose algorithms to address this problem. Both the theoretic analysis and the simulations in the paper prove that our algorithms can induce a k-fault resistant energy spanner and furthermore the interference is minimized. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to study the power assignment problem simultaneously considering spanner properties, the fault tolerance, and the interference reduction.", "paper_title": "Interference-Aware Fault-Tolerant Energy Spanner in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000312852300001"}
