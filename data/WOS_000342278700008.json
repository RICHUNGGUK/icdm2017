The LWN transformation means that each organization involved in the agreement converts its agreement-level model to detailed one. The soundness of the interorganizational LWNs is introduced and analyzed. The transformation rules of LWNs are presented. The detailed model of each organization can be investigated based on its agreement-level model and the transformation rules. The concepts and techniques proposed in this paper are illustrated with an example of online shopping in electronic commerce.", "paper_title": "Transformation of Logical Workflow Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000342278700008"}
