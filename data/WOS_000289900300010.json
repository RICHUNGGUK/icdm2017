In this paper, we propose a new kind of behavioral pattern, named Target-based Association Rules (TARs). TARs aim to discover the correlation among a set of targets monitored by a wireless sensor network at a border area. The major application of the Target-based Rules is to predict the location (target) of a missed reported event. Different data preparation mechanisms for accumulating the data needed for extracting TARs have been proposed. We refer to these mechanisms as Al-Node, Schedule-Buffer, and Fused-Schedule-Buffer. Several experiment studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the three proposed data preparation mechanisms. Results show that the Fused-Schedule-Buffer scheme outperforms the selected schemes in terms of energy consumption.", "paper_title": "Target Association Rules: A New Behavioral Patterns for Point of Coverage Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000289900300010"}
