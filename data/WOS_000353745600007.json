The choices of bases for these measurements as well as the structure of the entanglements specify a quantum algorithm. As scalable and reliable quantum computers have not been implemented yet, quantum computation simulators are the only widely available tools to design and test quantum algorithms. However, simulating the quantum computations on a standard classical computer in most cases requires exponential memory and time. In this paper, a general direct simulator for 1WQC, called OWQS, is presented. Some techniques such as qubit elimination, pattern reordering and implicit simulation of actions are used to considerably reduce the time and memory needed for the simulations Moreover, our simulator is adjusted to simulate the measurement patterns with a generalized flow without calculating the measurement probabilities which is called extended one-way quantum computation simulator (EOWQS). Experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed simulators and that OWQS and EOWQS are faster as compared with the well-known quantum circuit simulators, i.e., QuIDDPro and libquantum for simulating 1WQC model.
