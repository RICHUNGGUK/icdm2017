The ability to discover these links \"on the go\" requires that ontology matching techniques achieve good precision and recall within acceptable execution times. In this paper, we add similarity-based and mediator-based ontology matching methods to the Agreementmaker ontology matching system, which aim to efficiently discover high precision subclass mappings between LOD ontologies. Similarity-based matching methods discover subclass mappings by extrapolating them from a set of high quality equivalence mappings and from the interpretation of compound concept names. Mediator-based matching methods discover subclass mappings by comparing polysemic lexical annotations of ontology concepts and by considering external web ontologies. Experiments show that when compared with a leading LOD approach, Agreementmaker achieves considerably higher precision and F-measure, at the cost of a slight decrease in recall.", "paper_title": "Building linked ontologies with high precision using subclass mapping discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000322271600002"}
