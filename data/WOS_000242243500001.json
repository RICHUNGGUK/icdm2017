We present an O(n(2)log(2)n) expected-time algorithm for this problem, improving substantially the previous O(n(5))-time solution. The algorithm translates the alpha-connected two-center problem into a distance problem between two circular hulls.", "paper_title": "A near-quadratic algorithm for the alpha-connected two-center problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000242243500001"}
