We describe problems that are impossible to solve using classical resources but that become feasible with the help of quantum mechanics. We also give examples where the use of quantum information significantly reduces the need for communication. The main focus of the survey is on communication complexity but we also address other distributed tasks.", "paper_title": "CAN QUANTUM MECHANICS HELP DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING?", "paper_id": "WOS:000278194600010"}
