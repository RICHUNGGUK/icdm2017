Correct, quantitative assessment of these parameters, which could be changed in a course of many severe diseases of the heart (e.g. coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, heart failure), is a key factor for the right diagnose and further therapy. Up to date, in clinical daily practice, most of these information is collected by transthoracic two dimensional echocardiography. Assessment of these parameters is difficult and depends on observer experience. However, quantification method of the contractility assessment based on strain and strain analysis are available, these methods still are grounded on 2D analysis. Real time 3D echocardiography gives physicians opportunity for real quantitative analysis of the left ventricle contractility and synchronicity. In this work we present a method for estimating heart motion from 4D (3D+time) echocardiographic images.", "paper_title": "Generation of dynamic heart model based on 4D echocardiographic images", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900043"}
