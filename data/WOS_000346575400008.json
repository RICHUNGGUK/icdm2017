Designers continue to aim for rich user experiences with a variety of products, but have neglected self-service (interactive) kiosks. Hence, this paper, after giving a brief overview of the positive psychology literature, demonstrates the dimensions of positive user experiences with self-service kiosks through an empirical study conducted on coffee vending machines and automated tellers.", "paper_title": "Eliciting positive user experiences with self-service kiosks: pursuing possibilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000346575400008"}
