Their studies motivated by the fact that a network can be a major performance bottleneck in parallel processors; such as multiprocessors system-on-chip (Mp-SoCs), multicomputers and cluster computers. This paper proposes a new analytical model to predict message latency in 2-dimensional wormhole-switched mesh with a routing scheme suggested by Linder and Harden [1], as an instance of a fault-tolerant routing widely used in literature to achieve high adaptivity. Furthermore, the validity of the proposed model is demonstrated by comparing analytical results to those conducted through simulation experiments of the actual system and show a good degree of accuracy with as many as 10% nodes faulty.", "paper_title": "Performance modeling of a fully adaptive and fault-tolerant wormhole switching strategy in 2-D mesh", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900013"}
