Reversible logic has zero power dissipation; therefore, nowadays, researchers attend to it in order to optimize the internal power consumption. On the other hand, fault tolerance is a solution for error detection in digital systems. In many systems, fault tolerance is achieved by parity checking. This article proposes a new parity-preserving reversible full adder circuit. For many years, researchers assumed that the quantum cost (QC) of the parity-preserving reversible full adder is 11. In this article we offered a new parity-preserving reversible full adder circuit with a QC of only 9. In addition, the proposed parity-preserving reversible full adder has optimum number of constant inputs and garbage outputs. A novel parity-preserving reversible 4: 2 compressor circuit is also proposed using the proposed parity-preserving reversible full adder. This article would be a great initiation for building more complex parity-preserving reversible circuits. All the scales are in the nanometric area, and their fundamental parts are no bigger than a few nanometers.", "paper_title": "Design of a New Parity Preserving Reversible Full Adder", "paper_id": "WOS:000350769900007"}
