However, the technical trend of data center design poses new challenges for efficient and scalable multicast routing. First, the densely connected networks make traditional receiver-driven multicast routing protocols inefficient in multicast tree formation. Second, it is quite difficult for the low-end switches widely used in data centers to hold the routing entries of massive multicast groups. In this paper, we propose ESM, an efficient and scalable multicast routing scheme for data center networks. ESM addresses the challenges above by exploiting the feature of modern data center networks. Based on the regular topology of data centers, ESM uses a source-to-receiver expansion approach to build efficient multicast trees, excluding many unnecessary intermediate switches used in receiver-driven multicast routing. For scalable multicast routing, ESM combines both in-packet Bloom Filters and in-switch entries to make the tradeoff between the number of multicast groups supported and the additional bandwidth overhead. Simulations show that ESM saves 40%similar to 50% network traffic and doubles the application throughputs compared to receiver-driven multicast routing, and the combination routing scheme significantly reduces the number of in-switch entries required. We implement ESM on a Linux platform. The experimental results further demonstrate that ESM can well support online tree building for large-scale groups with churns, and the overhead of the combination forwarding engine is light-weighted.", "paper_title": "ESM: Efficient and Scalable Data Center Multicast Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000305583700024"}
