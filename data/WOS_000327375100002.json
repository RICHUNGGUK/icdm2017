This case study is aimed at employability and job post improvement. For this purpose, we have created a process that is flexible both to the student pattern (and to the job pattern. The developed process is adaptable both to the student (via the incorporation of an adaptable system with an LMS system) and to the job model (via an adaptable system to the knowledge management). The evaluation was qualitative and measured the process (feasibility to apply adaptive systems) and the efficiency of the method (applicability and employability). The functionality of the specific developed tools allowed us to grade the degree of adaptability in the training process, to dynamically vary the training plan from the student's actions and to identify the resources that best met the job needs.", "paper_title": "Teaching Innova Project: the Incorporation of Adaptable Outcomes in Order to Grade Training Adaptability", "paper_id": "WOS:000327375100002"}
