Our interest is in a class of armchair carbon nanotubes, called cyclic polypyrenes and their resonance graphs. The resonance graph reflects the structure of perfect matchings (t.i. Kekule structures) of a carbon nanotube. We show the connection of the resonance graph of a cyclic polypyrene to Lucas cubes; these are graphs with a vertex set of all binary strings of a given length without consecutive l's and 1 in the first and the last bit, where two vertices are adjacent if their strings differ in exactly one bit. The main result of this paper is that the resonance graph of a cyclic polypyrene is an amalgam of two Lucas cubes together with a box P-3(n) and one isolated vertex. The direct corollary of this result is the number of Kekule structures of a cyclic polypyrene.", "paper_title": "Resonance Graphs of Armchair Nanotubes Cyclic Polypyrenes and Amalgams of Lucas Cubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000328007000007"}
