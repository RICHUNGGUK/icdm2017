However, it is difficult to find a function to evaluate robots' bids when each robot gives more than one bid price to reflect its different abilities. We propose a method to fuse these prices and to decide which robot is the successful bidder using a BP neural network. The experiment result shows that the method is effective.", "paper_title": "Multi-robot task allocation using CNP combines with neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000326889800009"}
