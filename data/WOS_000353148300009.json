Our method is able to generate a geo-location prediction for an image globally. In this respect, it contrasts with other existing approaches, specifically with those that generate predictions restricted to specific cities, landmarks, or an otherwise pre-defined set of locations. The essence and the main novelty of our ranking-based method is that for a given query image a geo-location is recommended based on the evidence collected from images that are not only geographically close to this geo-location, but also have sufficient visual similarity to the query image within the considered image collection. Our method is evaluated experimentally on a public dataset of 8.8 million geo-tagged images from Flickr, released by the MediaEval 2013 evaluation benchmark. Experiments show that the proposed method delivers a substantial performance improvement compared to the existing related approaches, particularly for queries with high numbers of neighbors. In addition, a detailed analysis of the method's performance reveals the impact of different visual feature extraction and image matching strategies, as well as the densities and types of images found at different locations, on the prediction accuracy.", "paper_title": "Global-Scale Location Prediction for Social Images Using Geo-Visual Ranking", "paper_id": "WOS:000353148300009"}
