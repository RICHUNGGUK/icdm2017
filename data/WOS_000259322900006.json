The k-Facility Location problem further requires that the number of opened facilities is at most k, where k is a parameter given in the instance of the problem. We consider the Facility Location problems satisfying that for every demand the ratio of the longest distance to facilities and the shortest distance to facilities is at most omega, where omega is a predefined constant. Using the local search approach with scaling technique and error control technique, for any arbitrarily small constant epsilon > 0, we give a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the omega-constrained Facility Location problem with approximation ratio 1 + root omega+ 1 + epsilon, which significantly improves the previous best known ratio (omega + 1)/alpha for some 1 <= alpha <= 2; and a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the omega-constrained k-Facility Location problem with approximation ratio omega + 1 + epsilon. On the aspect of approximation hardness, we prove that unless NP subset of DTIME(n(O(log log n))), the omega-constrained Facility Location problem cannot be approximated within 1 + ln root omega-1, which slightly improves the previous best known hardness result L.243 + 0.316 In(w - 1). The experimental results on the standard test instances of Facility Location problem show that our algorithm also has good performance in practice.", "paper_title": "On constrained facility location problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000259322900006"}
