The DTRFS additionally allows for the isolation of faults causing dynamic residuals and the isolation of multiple subsequently occurring faults. Due to the flexibility of the DTRFS, multiplicative as well as additive faults can be handled. The approach is applied to an electrohydraulic servo axis with a duplex valve system. Experimental results at the testbed underline the effectiveness and applicability of the approach and show the enhanced performance compared to static fuzzy systems and state automata.
