Test case prioritization rearranges test cases to improve the effectiveness of testing. Code coverage has been widely used as criteria in test case prioritization. However, the simple way may not reveal some bugs, such that the fault detection rate decreases. In this paper, we use the ordered sequences of program entities to improve the effectiveness of test case prioritization. The execution frequency profiles of test cases are collected and transformed into the ordered sequences. We propose several novel similarity-based test case prioritization techniques based on the edit distances of ordered sequences. An empirical study of five open source programs was conducted. The experimental results show that our techniques can significantly increase the fault detection rate and be effective in detecting faults in loops. Moreover, our techniques are more cost-effective than the existing techniques.", "paper_title": "Similarity-based test case prioritization using ordered sequences of program entities", "paper_id": "WOS:000334917700010"}
