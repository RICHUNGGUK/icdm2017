A technique is presented for determining the most accurate error estimation. This technique enables one to address industrial-size problems while keeping computing costs reasonable. Design/methodology/approach - The concept of error in constitutive relation is used to assess the quality of the finite element solution. The key issue is the construction of admissible fields. The objective is to show that it is possible to build admissible fields using a new method. These fields are obtained by using a high-quality construction over a limited zone while the construction is less refined and less expensive elsewhere. Findings - Numerical tests are presented in order to illustrate a very satisfying presented methodology. It shows clearly how to take advantage of the method to treat large examples. They clearly show the interest of this new method to treat large examples. Originality/value - The paper demonstrates clearly that verification of large finite element problem must have dedicated methods in order to be applicable.", "paper_title": "A simple estimator for stress errors dedicated to large elastic finite element simulations Locally reinforced stress construction", "paper_id": "WOS:000289390600005"}
