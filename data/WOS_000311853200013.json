First, this paper presents a kind of uncertain process, known as the uncertain alternating renewal process, whose alternating interarrival times are uncertain variables. Then, it proves an uncertain alternating renewal theorem on the limit value of average working rate. Finally, an application of the alternating renewal theorem is discussed.", "paper_title": "Uncertain Alternating Renewal Process and Its Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000311853200013"}
