We first derive the asymptotics of the fault probability for the independent-request model and then extend this derivation to a general dependent-request model, where our result shows that under some weak assumptions the fault probability is asymptotically invariant with regard to dependence in the page request process. In a previous study, a similar result was derived by applying a Poisson embedding technique, where a continuous-time proof was given through some assumptions based on a continuous-time modeling. The Poisson embedding, however, is just a technique used for the proof and the problem is essentially on a discrete-time basis; thus, it is preferable to make assumptions, if any, directly in the discrete-time setting. We consider a general dependent-request model and give a direct discrete-time proof under different assumptions. A key to the proof is that the numbers of requests for respective pages represent conditionally negatively associated random variables.
