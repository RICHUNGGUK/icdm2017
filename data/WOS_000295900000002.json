Therefore, durability evaluation has been required to ensure the long term serviceability of structures located in chloride exposed environments. Recently, probability-based durability analysis and design have proven to be reliable for the service-life predictions of concrete structures. This approach has been successfully applied to durability estimation and design of concrete structures. However, currently it is difficult to find an appropriate method engineers can use to solve these probability-based diffusion problems. In this paper, computer software has been developed to facilitate probability-based durability analysis and design. This software predict the chloride diffusion using the Monte Carlo simulation method based on Fick's second law, and provides durability analysis and design solutions. A graphic user interface (GUI) is adapted for intuitive and easy use. The developed software is very useful not only for prediction of the service life but for the durability design of the concrete structures exposed to chloride environments.", "paper_title": "Probability-based durability design software for concrete structures subjected to chloride exposed environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000295900000002"}
