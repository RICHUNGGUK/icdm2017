It derives exact, closed-form expressions for both the phase cumulative distribution function and its inverse. In addition, empirical first- and second-order statistics obtained from measurements conducted in a body-area network scenario were used to fit the phase probability density function, the phase cumulative distribution function, and the phase crossing rate expressions. Remarkably, the unlikely shapes of the phase statistics, as predicted by the theoretical formulations, are actually encountered in practice.", "paper_title": "Nakagami-m Phase Model: Further Results and Validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000209697000015"}
