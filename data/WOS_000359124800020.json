Previous works have shown that IEEE 802.11-compliant devices are the major sources of interference in the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical band. In order to overcome the coexistence problem, IEEE 802.15.4-compliant devices should monitor the communication channel and access the channel when it is not in use. In this study, the impact of IEEE 802.11 traffic on IEEE 802.15.4 communication is analyzed and a novel predictive channel access scheme, PRESCIENT (PREdictive channel access SCheme for IEee 802.15.4-compliaNT devices), is proposed. The performance evaluation of the proposed scheme is performed using real-world radio frequency signal strength measurements. The results show that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance improvement in terms of channel access under IEEE 802.11 interference.", "paper_title": "PRESCIENT: A predictive channel access scheme for IEEE 802.15.4-compliant devices considering IEEE 802.11 coexistence", "paper_id": "WOS:000359124800020"}
