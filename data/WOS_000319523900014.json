With the growing and changing demands, there are many limitations faced by current Internet. A number of network testbeds are created for solving a set of specific problems in Internet. Traditionally, these testbeds are lacking of large scale network and flexibility. Therefore, it is necessary to design and implement a testbed which can support wide range of experiments and has the ability of programmable network. Besides, there has been a big change enabled by cloud computing in recent years. Although networking technologies have lagged behind the advances in server virtualization, the networking is still an importance component to interconnect among virtual machines. There are also measurement issues with growing number of virtual machines in the same host. Therefore, we also propose integrating management functions of virtual network in our testbed. In this paper, we design and create a Future Internet testbed in Taiwan over TWAREN Research Network. This testbed evolves into an environment for programmable network and cloud computing. This paper also presents several finished and ongoing experiments on the testbed for multiple aspects including topology discovery, multimedia streaming, and virtual network integration. We will continue to extend our testbed and propose innovative applications for the next generation Internet.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation of an Efficient and Programmable Future Internet Testbed in Taiwan", "paper_id": "WOS:000319523900014"}
