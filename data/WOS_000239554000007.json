The goal is to build a tool that is able to display statistical or mathematical problems and to correct the students' answers. The problems may include random data, so the solution cannot be previously known (if solved beforehand), and the student can reconsider the problem if necessary. The methodology proposed could be useful in many other courses with a mathematical basis, particularly in engineering studies, in which students make extensive use of problem solving to lessen the level of abstraction present in the classroom. Students from a number of universities are currently using the tool, within the framework of a project that aims to improve the quality of learning. The pedagogical implications are mentioned, since the tool can be effective with basic, intermediate and high level learning, particularly if the problems are carefully designed.
