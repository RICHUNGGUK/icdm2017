The free parameters of the model are the number of knots and their location. The free-knot placement, which is a NP-hard problem, is done using a global MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimation) within a simulated-annealing strategy. Experiments are conducted in a speech processing context on a 7000 syllables french corpus. We estimate the two challenging models for increasing values of the number of free parameters. We show that a B-spline model provides a slightly better improvement than the Spline model in terms of RMS error.", "paper_title": "Comparing B-spline and Spline models for FO modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500053"}
