Treating input parameters of performance function as credal variables defined on a continuous frame of real numbers, the suggested approach constructs a random set-type evidence for these parameters. The corresponding random set of the function output is obtained by extension principle of random set. Within the TBM framework, the random set of the function output in the credal state can be transformed to a pignistic state where it is represented by the pignistic cumulative distribution. As an approximation to the actual cumulative distribution, it can be used to estimate yield according to circuit response specifications. The advantage of the proposed method over Monte Carlo (MC) methods lies in its ability to implement just once simulation process to obtain an available approximate value of yield which has a deterministic estimation error. Given the same error, the new method needs less number of calculations than MC methods. A track circuit of high-speed railway and a numerical eight-dimensional quadratic function examples are included to demonstrate the efficiency of this technique.", "paper_title": "Approximating probability distribution of circuit performance function for parametric yield estimation using transferable belief model", "paper_id": "WOS:000329537800009"}
