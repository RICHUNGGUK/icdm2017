The proposed two-gain ILC rule has a rectifying action to iterative initial error and external disturbances. It guarantees a reduced bound of the ILC tracking error against the iteration-varying initial error and disturbances. For the iteration-invariant initial error and disturbances, the ILC tracking error can be driven to convergence, and a complete tracking to reference trajectory beyond the initial time point is even achieved as the control gain is specifically selected. An example is used to validate the proposed ILC method.", "paper_title": "Robust iterative learning control with rectifying action for nonlinear discrete time-delayed systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000339724400006"}
