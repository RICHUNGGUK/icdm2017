The study of this problem has been limited due to the nonconvexity of the underlying optimization problems that prohibits an efficient solution even in a centralized setting. By generalizing the randomization framework originally proposed for input queued switches to SINR rate-based interference model, we characterize the throughput-optimality conditions that enable efficient and distributed implementation. Using gossiping algorithm, we develop a distributed power allocation algorithm that satisfies the optimality conditions, thereby achieving (nearly) 100 percent throughput. We illustrate the performance of our power allocation solution through numerical simulation.", "paper_title": "Distributed Throughput Maximization in Wireless Networks via Random Power Allocation", "paper_id": "WOS:000300573200005"}
