We give lower bounds on the second higher weight and compute the second higher weights for optimal codes of length less than 24. We relate the joint weight enumerator with the higher weight enumerator and use this relationship to produce Gleason theorems. Graded rings of the higher weight enumerators are also determined.", "paper_title": "Higher weights for ternary and quaternary self-dual codes*", "paper_id": "WOS:000234209600007"}
