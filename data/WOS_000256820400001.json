We give a representation theorem of t-norms on this lattice for which the partial mappings are join-morphisms in terms of t-norms on the underlying lattice. In fuzzy logic, t-norms which satisfy the residuation principle play an important role. Using our representation theorem, we represent t-norms on L-I which satisfy the residuation principle and two border conditions in terms of t-norms on the underlying lattice. In the case that the underlying lattice of L-I is the unit interval, we obtain characterizations of continuous t-norms which are natural extensions of t-norms on the unit interval and which have join-morphisms as partial mappings or alternatively satisfy the residuation principle.
