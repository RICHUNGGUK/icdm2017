In a dialogue run, the strategies are the manners to achieve the agents' goals by selecting the best option between the different existent choices. There are not many works which define the strategies for dialogue between agents. In this paper a formal model for dialogue strategy is proposed. The proposed model is a decision making problem of selecting the type of the act and the compatible content to utter at each step of a dialogue. In a given dialogue step, the model can decide the appropriate act and content allowed by the dialogue protocol in order to satisfy the agents' goals. The strength of the decisions which define the best next move is computed by argumentation theory. The proposed model is illustrated through an example of Dutch auction.", "paper_title": "A new dialogue strategy in multi-agent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000341191800007"}
