Although these documents can be effectively searched and ranked by modern search engines, actionable knowledge need to be extracted and transformed in a structured form before being used in a decision process. In this paper we describe how the discovery of semantic information embedded in natural language documents can be viewed as an optimization problem aimed at assigning a sequence of labels (hidden states) to a set of interdependent variables (textual tokens). Dependencies among variables are efficiently modeled through Conditional Random Fields, an indirected graphical model able to represent the distribution of labels given a set of observations. The Markov property of these models prevent them to take into account long-range dependencies among variables, which are indeed relevant in Natural Language Processing. In order to overcome this limitation we propose an inference method based on Integer Programming formulation of the problem, where long distance dependencies are included through non-deterministic soft constraints.
