As opposed to the typical restoration problem, which considers a single optimal signal, the computation of the entire probability distribution necessitates integrating over the entire signal space. To achieve this, we apply path integration techniques. The problem is studied in one and two dimensions, and an accurate solution as well as an efficient approximation scheme are provided.", "paper_title": "A Probabilistic Approach to Pattern Matching in the Continuous Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000307522700001"}
