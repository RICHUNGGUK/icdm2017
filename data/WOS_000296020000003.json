Unfortunately, mainstream WSN collection protocols are generally designed to account for a single sink and, dually, WSN multicast protocols optimize communication from a single source. In this paper, we present MUSTER, a routing protocol expressly designed for many-to-many communication. First, we devise an analytical model to compute, in a centralized manner, the optimal solution to the problem of simultaneously routing from multiple sources to multiple sinks. Next, we illustrate heuristics approximating the optimal solution in a distributed setting, and their implementation in MUSTER. To increase network lifetime, MUSTER minimizes the number of nodes involved in many-to-many routing and balances their forwarding load. We evaluate MUSTER in emulation and in a real WSN testbed. Results indicate that our protocol builds near-optimal routing paths, doubles the WSN lifetime, and overall delivers to the user 2.5 times the amount of raw data w.r.t. mainstream protocols. Moreover, MUSTER is intrinsically amenable to in-network aggregation, pushing the improvements up to a 180 percent increase in lifetime and a four-time increase in data yield.", "paper_title": "MUSTER: Adaptive Energy-Aware Multisink Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000296020000003"}
