The consecutive particle images recorded at 2000 fps (frame per second) enabled us to observe the particle transport in detail, especially near the flat sand surface. Various modes of sand saltation were identified. The transverse motion of particles, often ignored in previous studies, was also visualized. In addition, instantaneous velocity fields of saltating particles were obtained using a particle tracking velocimetry (PTV), and statistical analysis of saltating particle trajectories was performed. The qualitative and quantitative results of the present study will be useful for understanding the basic physics of transport of saltating sand particles.", "paper_title": "Visualization of saltating sand particle movement near a flat ground surface", "paper_id": "WOS:000243606800017"}
