In this paper, we developed relaxed conditions for controller design using nonquadratic Lyapunov functions and delayed controllers and give a general framework for the use of such Lyapunov functions. The two controller design methods developed in this framework outperform and generalize current state-of-the-art methods. The proposed methods are extended to robust and H-infinity control and alpha-sample variation.", "paper_title": "Controller Design for TS Models Using Delayed Nonquadratic Lyapunov Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000350146900009"}
