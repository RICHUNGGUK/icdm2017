The response of three biosensors with different concentrations of Chlorpyrifos Oxon (CPO) and Chlorfenvinfos (CFV) was modeled by two ANNs, which were implemented on the dsPIC (R). The performance of the ANNs was good, the prediction ability was better than 0.986 when the obtained values were compared with those expected for a set of eight external test samples. which were not used for training. This implementation is proposed to develop low-cost analytical chemical specialized tools. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
