Although traditional document summarization techniques can summarize the content of the document groups one by one, there exists a great necessity to generate a summary of the differences among the document groups. In this article, we study a novel problem of summarizing the differences between document groups. A discriminative sentence selection method is proposed to extract the most discriminative sentences that represent the specific characteristics of each document group. Experiments and case studies on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "Comparative Document Summarization via Discriminative Sentence Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000316415700002"}
