The filter is based on improved controllable transconductors operating with the ultra-low supply voltage of 0.5 V. Simulation results using a triple-well 0.13 mu m CMOS technology verify the filter operation fulfilling all the requirements for the complex filtering stage in bluetooth or Zigbee receivers. The in-band group delay variation is 0.79 mu s for bluetooth and 0.46 mu s for Zigbee. The image rejection ratio is greater than 71 dB and the achieved in-band spurious free dynamic range is 42 dB.", "paper_title": "A 0.5 V tunable complex filter for Bluetooth and Zigbee using OTAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000332102200007"}
