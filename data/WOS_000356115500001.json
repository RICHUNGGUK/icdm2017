The results, based on data collected through a survey of 241 organizations, generally support Our research model. Institutional pressures and internal security needs assessment (ISNA) significantly explain the variation in organizational investment in ISCR. Specifically, coercive and normative pressures are found to have not only a direct impact but also an indirect impact through ISNA on organizational investment in ISCR. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
