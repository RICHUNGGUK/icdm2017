An intermediate situation occurs when the primary signal is imperfectly known, in which case we advocate the use of a linear quadratic detector. We show how this detector can be designed by maximizing its deflection, and, using moment-bound theory, we examine its robustness to the variations of the actual probability distribution of the inaccurately known primary signal.", "paper_title": "Linear-Quadratic Detectors for Spectrum Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000345551700002"}
