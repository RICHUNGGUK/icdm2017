The engine consists of capturing OpenGL command stream, scene graph reconstruction, data simplification, and compression and transmission. Without modifying the original source code, our system can extend 3D network games onto various platforms, using hierarchical geometry hashing, a client-server scene graph, and a simple NPR(Non-Photorealistic Rendering) technique to reduce the amount of transmission.", "paper_title": "A streaming engine for PC-based 3D network games onto heterogeneous mobile platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300094"}
