This interface specification gives support to standard Web-based geoprocessing. The data used in this research were collected using a focused crawler configured for finding OGC Web services. The research goals are (i) to provide a reality check of the availability of Web Processing Service servers, (ii) to provide quantitative data about the use of different features defined in the standard that are relevant for a scalable Geoprocessing Web (e.g. long-running processes, Web-accessible data outputs), and (iii) to test if the advances in the use of search engines and focused crawlers for finding Web services can be applied for finding geoscience processing systems. Research results show the feasibility of the discovery approach and provide data about the implementation of the Web Processing Service specification. These results also show extensive use of features related to scalability, except for those related to technical and semantic interoperability. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
