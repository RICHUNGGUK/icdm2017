In addition, there is a lack of related studies with a special focus on wired networking. This paper aims at analyzing the impact of wired access networks in data network for greening the Internet, and encouraging further research in this field by clearly presenting the significance and reasonability of this endeavor. For this work, we first introduce the background and motivation of green networking. Next, we survey the existing works and describe reasonability of our approach, and then we estimate the overall energy consumption of wired access networks by which the energy consumption of data network is driven, calculate CO2 emissions and economic costs from the energy consumption and explore savings potential of them. Going a step, we analyze the impact of energy consumption, economy, and environment from the use of wired access network equipment depending on IF traffic types. Finally, we present a new viewpoint on energy efficiency focusing on the quality-of-service with future works related to this issue. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
