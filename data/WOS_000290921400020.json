To detect the changes of disturbances, a fuzzy system is designed based on expert knowledge and experiences of a navigation engineer. In the EFH(infinity) estimator, the intensity bounds of disturbances affecting the measurements are updated using a heuristic combination of three change-detection indices. Performance of the proposed estimator is evaluated by Monte-Carlo simulations and field tests of three kinds of vehicles using a manufactured attitude-heading reference system (AHRS). In both simulations and real tests, the proposed estimator results in a superior performance compared to those of the recently developed and standard H(infinity) estimators. Design/methodology/approach - Design, implementation and real tests of the EFH(infinity) estimator are considered for an AHRS specialized for vehicular applications. In the AHRS, three-axis accelerometers (TAA) and three-axis magnetometers (TAM) may be affected by large disturbances due to non-gravitational accelerations and local magnetic fields. Therefore, the design parameters of EFH(infinity) estimator including the theoretic bound of disturbance intensity and the attenuation level are adaptively tuned using a fuzzy combination of three change-detection indices. Once a sensor is affected by an exogenous disturbance, the fuzzy system will increase the scale factor of the corresponding measurement disturbance to place more confidence on the data of the AHRS dynamics including measurements of gyros with respect to the data coming from the TAA and TAM. Findings - An intelligent fault detector is proposed for considering changes of disturbances to adjust the upper bounds of the estimator's disturbances and the length of data to update the fuzzy system inputs. The EFH(infinity) estimator is suitable to attenuate the effects of disturbances changes on accurate estimation of the attitude and heading angles, intelligently. Originality/value - The paper provides a fuzzy state estimator for adaptively adjusting the theoretic disturbance matrices according to the actual intensity of the disturbances affecting the AHRS dynamics and the measurement sensors.", "paper_title": "An enhanced fuzzy H(infinity) estimator applied to low-cost attitude-heading reference system", "paper_id": "WOS:000290921400020"}
