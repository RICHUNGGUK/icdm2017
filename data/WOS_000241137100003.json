We present a technology chain that starts out with a BPEL process and transforms it into a Petri net model. On the model we decide controllability of the process (the existence of a partner process, such that both can interact properly) and compute its operating guideline (a characterization of all properly interacting partner processes). A case study demonstrates the value of this technology chain.", "paper_title": "Analyzing interacting BPEL processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137100003"}
