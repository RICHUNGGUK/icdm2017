The output from the predict tion can provide useful information to improve the activities aimed at detecting and preventing safely and security problems. Location prediction is a special case of spatial data mining classification. Tor instance, in the public safety domain, it may be interesting to predict location(s) of crime hot spots. In, this study, we present a support vector machine (SVM)-based approach to predict the location as an alternative to existing modeling approaches. Support vector machine forms the new generation of machine-learning techniques used to find optimal separability between classes within datasets. We compare the performance of two types of SVMs techniques: two-class SVMs and one-class SVMs. We also compared SVM with a neural network-based approach and spatial auto-regression-based approach. Experiments on two different spatial datasets demonstrate that the former approach performs slightly better and the latter one gives reasonable results. Furthermore, in this study, toe provide a general framework to customize the spatial data classification task for other spatial domains that have datasets similar to the analyzed crime datasets.", "paper_title": "Effectiveness of support vector machine for crime hot-spots prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000256188700003"}
