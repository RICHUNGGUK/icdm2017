The theoretical framework relies on Bayesian estimation via combinatorial optimization (simulated annealing). The segmentation is obtained by classifying the pixels into different pixel classes. These classes are represented by multi-variate Gaussian distributions. Thus, the only hypothesis about the nature of the features is that an additive Gaussian noise model is suitable to describe the feature distribution belonging to a given class. Here, we use the perceptually uniform CIE-L*u*v* color values as color features and a set of Gabor filters as texture features. Gaussian parameters are either computed using a training data set or estimated from the input image. We also propose a parameter estimation method using the EM algorithm. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the performance of our method on both synthetic and natural color images. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
