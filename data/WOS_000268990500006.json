Large differences of CMI response of healthy humans in comparison with Ca, AMI, Sch patients were found. CMI response to antigens displays transferred information about cells under immune surveillance. LDV disturbs the oxidative energy production system. We assume that CMI response to LDV antigen monitors pathological states of mitochondrial energy production which results in disturbances of electromagnetic activity of living cells.", "paper_title": "MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000268990500006"}
