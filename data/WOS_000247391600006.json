Some characterization theorems of these generalized fuzzy filters are derived. In particular, we prove that an interval valued fuzzy set F in R-0-algebras is an interval valued (is an element of, is an element of boolean OR q)-fuzzy Boolean filter if and only if it is an interval valued (is an element of, is an element of boolean OR q)-fuzzy implicative filter.", "paper_title": "Generalized fuzzy filters of R-0-algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000247391600006"}
