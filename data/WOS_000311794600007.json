It is found that efficient spectrum utilization and fine bit-rate granularity are essential to achieve cost and energy efficiency. Additionally, the break-even cost of flexible orthogonal frequency division multiplexing transponders is examined under different settings. The break-even cost of a flexible transponder corresponds to the cost value for which the total cost of the network is equal to that of the related single-line-rate network. The impact of the traffic load, the additional cost required for flex-grid optical cross connects, the cost of spectrum, as well as the cost of fixed-grid transponders is examined.", "paper_title": "Quantifying Spectrum, Cost, and Energy Efficiency in Fixed-Grid and Flex-Grid Networks [Invited]", "paper_id": "WOS:000311794600007"}
