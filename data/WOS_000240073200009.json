We have implemented ROAR in the ns-2 simulator over the IEEE 802.11 a physical layer. From our simulation studies conducted using various network topologies and realistic radio propagation model, we find that ROAR increases AODV's packet delivery ratio and end-to-end throughput several orders of magnitude, in particular for hop count based routes. Therefore, ROAR provides a simple add-on that allows routing protocols to reap the benefits of diversity without relying on physical layer approaches.", "paper_title": "ROAR: A multi-rate opportunistic AODV routing protocol for wireless Ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240073200009"}
