In contrast to existing particle representations, the proposed concept does not require a separate processing of fluid and boundary particles. On one hand, this results in a simplified solver implementation with improved efficiency. On the other hand, the unified fluid and boundary representation adds flexibility to IISPH which enables versatile effects. In particular, particles can now dynamically interchange their role between fluid and boundary which we therefore refer to as liquid boundary. The paper mainly focuses on the description of the unified representation and on the application of the concept to visual effects such as solidification and liquefaction. To support the realization of these effects, the concept of unified fluid and liquid boundary particles is extended to a third particle type, so-called candidate particles that are used in a transition phase between fluid and liquid boundaries.
