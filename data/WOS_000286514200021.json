It is known that the average minimum distance of codes in these ensembles grows linearly with the code length. We show that these codes can correct a linearly growing number of errors under simple iterative decoding algorithms. In particular, we show that this property extends to codes constructed by parallel concatenation of Hamming codes and other codes with small minimum distance. Previously known results that proved this property for graph codes relied on graph expansion and required the choice of local codes with large distance relative to their length.", "paper_title": "On the Number of Errors Correctable with Codes on Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000286514200021"}
