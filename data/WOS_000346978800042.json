The study develops 2-tuple linguistic Maclaurin symmetric mean (2TLMSM) operator by improving Maclaurin symmetric mean (MSM) operator. The paper studies its properties and discusses its special cases. For the situations where the input arguments have different importance, the 2-tuple linguistic weighted Maclaurin symmetric mean (2TLWMSM) operator is defined based on the procedure which is developed for comprehensive evaluation problems under the 2-tuple linguistic environments. Finally, a practical example for evaluating the financial management performance is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Approaches to comprehensive evaluation with 2-tuple linguistic information", "paper_id": "WOS:000346978800042"}
