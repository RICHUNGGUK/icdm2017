In particular, we consider a KdVBBM-type equation. Explicit and implicitexplicit RungeKutta-type methods are used for time discretizations. The fully discrete schemes are validated by direct comparisons to analytic solutions. Invariants' conservation properties are also studied. Main applications include important nonlinear phenomena such as dispersive shock wave formation, solitary waves, and their various interactions.
