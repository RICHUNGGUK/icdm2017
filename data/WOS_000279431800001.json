They conjectured that orthostacks could be unfolded using cuts that lie in a plane orthogonal to a coordinate axis and containing a vertex of the orthostack. We prove the existence of a vertex unfolding using only such cuts.", "paper_title": "GRID VERTEX-UNFOLDING ORTHOSTACKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000279431800001"}
