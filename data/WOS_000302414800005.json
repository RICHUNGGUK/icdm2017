Traditionally, the observations consist of pairs of numeric values. However, in many real-life problems, the independent or explanatory variable can be observed precisely (for instance, the time) and the dependent or response variable is usually described by approximate values, such as \"about 300\" pound or \"approximately $500\", instead of exact values, due to sources of uncertainty that may affect the response. In this paper, we present a new technique to obtain fuzzy regression models that consider triangular fuzzy numbers in the response variable. The procedure solves linear and non-linear problems and is easy to compute in practice and may be applied in different contexts. The usefulness of the proposed method is illustrated using simulated and real-life examples.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy regression model based on distances and random variables with crisp input and fuzzy output data: a case study in biomass production", "paper_id": "WOS:000302414800005"}
