The MINIMUM BREAKPOINT LINEARIZATION Problem aims at constructing a total order from this partial knowledge, such that the breakpoint distance to a reference genome is minimized. In this paper, we first expose a flaw in two algorithms formerly known for this problem [6,4]. We then present a new modeling for this problem, and use it to design three approximation algorithms, with ratios resp. O(log(k) log log(k)), O(log(2)(vertical bar X vertical bar)) and m(2) + 4m - 4, where k is the optimal breakpoint distance we look for, vertical bar X vertical bar is upper bounded by the number of pairs of genes for which the partial order is in contradiction with the reference genome, and m is the number of genetic maps used to create the input partial order.
