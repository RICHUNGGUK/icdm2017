A Bayesian analysis of a new model for such data is presented. The model is based on a radial projection onto the circle of a particular bivariate normal distribution. Inference about the parameters of the model is based on samples from the corresponding joint posterior density, which are obtained using a Metropolis-within-Gibbs scheme after the introduction of suitable latent variables. The procedure is illustrated using both simulated data sets and a real data set previously analyzed in the literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
