It is also a known fact that fuzzy logic modeling is a powerful tool in representing nonlinear systems. Therefore, inverse fuzzy model can be used as a controller for controlling nonlinear plants. In this context, firstly, a new fuzzy model based inverse controller design methodology is presented in this study. The design methodology introduced here is based on a recursive optimization procedure that searches for an optimal inverse model control signal at every sampling time. Since the task of optimization should be accomplished in between two sampling periods the use of a fast optimization algorithm becomes essential. For this reason, Big Bang-Big Crunch (BB-BC) optimization algorithm is used due to its low computational time and high global convergence properties. Even though, inverse model controllers may produce perfect control while operating in an open loop fashion, this open loop control would not be sufficient in the case of modeling mismatches or disturbances that might occur over the system. In order to overcome this problem, secondly, an on-line adaptation mechanism via BB-BC optimization algorithm is introduced in addition to BB-BC optimization based fuzzy model inverse controller. The adaptation mechanism is used to update the related parameters of the model while minimizing the absolute value of the instantaneous error between the system and model outputs. In this manner, the system output is somehow fed back, the overall control form can be considered as a closed-loop system. The new fuzzy model based inverse control scheme with the new online adaptation mechanism has been implemented and tested on the two real time processes; namely, heat transfer and pH processes and very satisfactory results has been reported.
