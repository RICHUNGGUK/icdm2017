In the normalized partial distortion search algorithm, the partial distortion is calculated by regularly selecting a certain number of pixels from every sub-macro block for early termination. The proposed method calculates the partial distortion by successively accumulating the distortion of each partial sub-macro block. In addition to increasing the probability of the rejection of invalid motion vectors without additional computations, the proposed method has a markedly lower computational complexity than conventional algorithms, but slightly poorer objective quality of motion compensated images.", "paper_title": "SUCCESSIVE ACCUMULATING PARTIAL DISTORTION SEARCH ALGORITHM FOR MOTION ESTIMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000277576500029"}
