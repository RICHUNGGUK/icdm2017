Most of the well-known models of small world networks are stochastic. The randomness makes it more difficult to gain a visual understanding of how networks are shaped, and how different vertices relate to each other. In this paper, we present and study a method for constructing deterministic small worlds using the line graph operator. This operator introduces cliques at every vertex of the original graph, which may imply larger clustering coefficients. On the other hand, this operator can increase the diameter at most by one and assure the small world property. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
