It is difficult to generate overlap grid and the connectivity information between adjacent blocks, especially when interpolation is required for non-coincident overlap grids. In this study, an interface flux reconstruction (IFR) method is proposed for numerical simulation using high order finite difference scheme with multi-block structured grids. In this method the neighboring blocks share a common face, and the fluxes on each block are matched to set the boundary conditions for each interior block. Therefore this method has the promise of allowing discontinuous grids on either side of an interior block interface. The proposed method is proven to be stable for 7-point central DRP scheme coupled with 4-point and 5-point boundary closure schemes, as well as the 4th order compact scheme coupled with 3rd order boundary closure scheme. Four problems are numerically solved with the developed code to validate the interface flux reconstruction method in this study. The IFR method coupled with the 4th order DRP scheme or compact scheme is validated to be 4th order accuracy with one and two dimensional waves propagation problems. Two dimensional pulse propagation in mean flow is computed with wavy mesh to demonstrate the ability of the proposed method for non-uniform grid. To demonstrate the ability of the proposed method for complex geometry, sound scattering by two cylinders is simulated and the numerical results are compared with the analytical data. It is shown that the numerical results agree well with the analytical data. Finally the IFR method is applied to simulate viscous flow pass a cylinder at Reynolds number 150 to show its capability for viscous problem. The computed pressure coefficient on the cylinder surface, the frequency of vortex shedding, the lift and drag coefficients are presented. The numerical results are compared with the data of other researchers, and a good agreement is obtained. The validations imply that the proposed IFR method is accurate and effective for inviscid and viscous problems with complex geometry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
