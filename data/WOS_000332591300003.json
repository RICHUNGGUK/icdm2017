The FGBB is effective to reduce variability and Power consumption in a system-on-chip (SoC). Since FGBB needs a number of BBGs, the BBG is preferred to be implemented in cell-based design procedure. In the cell-based design, it is inefficient to provide an extra supply voltage for BBGs. We invented a BBG with switched capacitor configuration and it enables BBG to operate with wide range of the supply voltage from 0.6 V to 1.2 V. We fabricated the BBG in a 65 nm CMOS process to control 0.1 mm(2) of core circuit with the area overhead of 1.4% for the BBG.", "paper_title": "A Body Bias Generator with Low Supply Voltage for Within-Die Variability Compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000332591300003"}
