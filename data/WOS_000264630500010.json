One critical local approximation technique is employed to weigh the edges in the graph constructed from data points. This approximation technique is based on an implicit assumption that the data are distributed evenly. However, this assumption is not valid in most cases, so the approximation is not accurate in these cases. To solve this challenging problem, we propose a volume-based heat-diffusion model (VHDM). In VHDM, the volume is theoretically justified by handling the input data that are unevenly distributed on an unknown manifold. We also propose a novel volume-based heat-diffusion classifier (VHDC) based on VHDM. One of the advantages of VHDC is that the computational complexity is linear on the number of edges given a constructed graph. Moreover, we give an analysis on the stability of VHDC with respect to its three free parameters, and we demonstrate the connection between VHDC and some other classifiers. Experiments show that VHDC performs better than Parzen window approach, K nearest neighbor, and the HDC without volumes in prediction accuracy and outperforms some recently proposed transductive-learning algorithms. The enhanced performance of VHDC shows the validity of introducing the volume. The experiments also confirm the stability of VHDC with respect to its three free parameters.", "paper_title": "A Volume-Based Heat-Diffusion Classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000264630500010"}
