However, efficient and low-cost methods for gathering information in large-scale roads are lacking. Consequently, wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies that are low cost, low power, and self-configuring are a key function in ITS. The potential application scenarios and design requirements of WSN for urban transportation (WSN-UT) are proposed in this work. A customized network topology is designed to meet the special requirements, and WSN-UT is specifically tailored for UT applications. WSN-UT enables users to obtain traffic and road information directly from the local WSN within its wireless scope instead of the remote ITS data center. WSN-UT can be configured according to different scenario requirements. A three-level subsystem and a configuration and service subsystem constitute the WSN-UT network frame, and the service/interface and protocol algorithms for every subsystem level are designed for WSN-UT.", "paper_title": "A Novel Wireless Sensor Network Frame for Urban Transportation", "paper_id": "WOS:000373098800013"}
