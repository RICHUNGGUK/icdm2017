Information enhancement mainly includes the following topics: data cleaning, data preparation and transformation, missing values imputation, feature and instance selection, feature construction, treatment of noisy and inconsistent data, data integration, data collection and housing, information enhancement, web data availability, web data capture and representation, and the others. It is impossible to outline all the research topics in a single paper. In this study, we discuss the information enhancement for data mining with existing missing data imputation techniques. We first review the current research on imputing missing values, and then experimentally evaluate the techniques and demonstrate the efficiency of missing data imputation techniques to enhance information in the process of pattern discovery from datasets with missing values.
