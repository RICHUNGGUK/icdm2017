Conventional methods used to counter visual blurring include spectacles and contact lenses. In this paper, we introduce an image preprocessing method that is designed to counteract the visual blurring caused by the aberration of the eye. In this method, the presented images are preprocessed by performing personalised compensation according to the ocular aberration of the computer user. In order to overcome the mismatch between the aberration used to generate the precompensation and the actual aberrations at the time of viewing, dynamic ocular aberrations are derived from the resizing of the initial aberration data measured by the wavefront analyzer. The dynamic ocular aberrations are used to update the image precompensation in real time. Results of human subject experiment show that the image recognition accuracy was significantly increased after the dynamic precompensation was applied. Subjective impressions from the participants confirmed the effectiveness of the method.", "paper_title": "Personalised and dynamic image precompensation for computer users with ocular aberrations", "paper_id": "WOS:000340299600004"}
