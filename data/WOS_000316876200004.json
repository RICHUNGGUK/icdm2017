Using a modified quad-tree, we segmented an image into areas with similar levels of saliency; each of these segments was then used to control the brush strokes during rendering. We could also simulate real oil painting steps based on saliency information. Our method runs in a reasonable fine and produces results that are visually appealing and competitive with previous techniques.", "paper_title": "A multi-level depiction method for painterly rendering based on visual perception cue", "paper_id": "WOS:000316876200004"}
