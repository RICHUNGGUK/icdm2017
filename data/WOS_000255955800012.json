Beacon-less routing algorithms have recently been proposed to reduce the control overheads due to these messages. However, existing beacon-less algorithms have not considered realistic physical layers. Therefore, those algorithms cannot work properly in realistic scenarios. In this paper we present a new beaconless routing protocol called BOSS. Its design is based on the conclusions of our open-field experiments using Tmote-sky sensors. BOSS is adapted to error-prone networks and incorporates a new mechanism to reduce collisions and duplicate messages produced during the selection of the next forwarder node. We compare BOSS with Beacon-Less Routing (BLR) and Contention-Based Forwarding (CBF) algorithms through extensive simulations. The results show that our scheme is able to achieve almost perfect packet delivery ratio (like BLR) while having a low bandwidth consumption (even lower than CBF). Additionally, we carried out an empirical evaluation in a real testbed that shows the correctness of our simulation results.", "paper_title": "Beacon-less Geographic Routing in real Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000255955800012"}
