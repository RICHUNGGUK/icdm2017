Specifically, we show that for every integer l and an arbitrarily small constant epsilon > 0, unless NP = RP, no polynomial time algorithm can distinguish whether there is an intersection of two halfspaces that correctly classifies a given set of labeled points in R-n, or whether any function of l halfspaces can correctly classify at most 1/2 + epsilon fraction of the points.
