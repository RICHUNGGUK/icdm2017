One problem With Such networks is that node i of Cluster i has no intercluster link. This slight asymmetry complicates a number of algorithms and hinders both theoretical investigations and practical pursuits, Such as building parallel node-disjoint paths for fault tolerance. We introduce biswapped networks that are fully symmetric and have Cluster connectivity very similar to swapped/OTIS networks. We derive basic topological parameters, present a simple distributed shortest-path routing algorithm, and point to a number of other interesting properties under investigation for biswapped networks.
