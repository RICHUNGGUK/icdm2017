Users are not usually able to find a sought after image or provide an example of what they want. One of several possible methods that might be used to solve this problem involves reasoning about user queries through the assessment of several samples. In this article we propose a method by which user queries are retrieved based on the pairwise comparison of sample alternatives. Pairwise comparison was originally designed for the ranking of alternatives. In our method we rank criteria according to their importance for the user and then use this information to retrieve relevant records from the database. The method was implemented in Matlab and tested on the Microsoft Research Cambridge Image Database.", "paper_title": "Multimedia information retrieval based on pairwise comparison and its application to visual search", "paper_id": "WOS:000305805300006"}
