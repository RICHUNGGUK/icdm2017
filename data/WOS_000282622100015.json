That is, we combine the NA-tree with the Chord system to solve the overlapping problem which the P2PR-tree can not deal with. From our simulation results, we show that the number of visited peers in our approach is less than that in the P2PR-tree.", "paper_title": "Spatial Exact Match Query in P2P Systems Using an NA-Tree Structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000282622100015"}
