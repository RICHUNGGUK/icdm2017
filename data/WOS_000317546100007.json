Their capabilities, like representation, inference and learning, if used effectively, can greatly help to build intelligent systems that are able to act accordingly in different problem domains. Bayesian networks are one of the most widely used class of these models. Some of the inference and learning tasks in Bayesian networks involve complex optimization problems that require the use of meta-heuristic algorithms. Evolutionary algorithms, as successful problem solvers, are promising candidates for this purpose. This paper reviews the application of evolutionary algorithms for solving some NP-hard optimization tasks in Bayesian network inference and learning. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
