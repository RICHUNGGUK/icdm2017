This dataset consists of traffic matrices built using full IGP routing information, sampled Netflow data and BGP routing information of the GEANT network, one per 15 minutes interval for several months. Potential benefits of publicly available traffic matrices comprise improving our understanding of real traffic matrices, their dynamics, and to make possible the benchmarking of intradomain traffic engineering methods.", "paper_title": "Providing public intradomain traffic matrices to the research community", "paper_id": "WOS:000235070100012"}
