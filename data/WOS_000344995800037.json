In particular, continuous time-based power system simulation and discrete event-based simulation of information and communication technology (ICT) networks are critical for investigating future smart grids. This paper presents the novel cosimulation environment INtegrated coSimulation of Power and ICT systems for Real-time Evaluation (INSPIRE) of power and ICT systems using the high-level architecture (HLA) (IEEE Std. 1516-2010). By applying the HLA standard, the environment is extendable to other simulation domains and a variety of functionalities and models, like thermal load models and additional third-party tools. Moreover, the HLA enables computational performance by distributed execution of each simulator on its own hardware and, thus, the applicability to realistic large-scale scenarios. INSPIRE has been designed under consideration of industrial standards [IEC 61850, object linking and embedding (OLE) for process control (OPC), and the common information model (CIM) (IEC 61968/61970)] in order to enhance interoperability, and to develop and validate solutions close to practice. The simulation results underline the interdependencies of power and ICT systems, and the necessity of an integrated analysis.", "paper_title": "Analyzing Cyber-Physical Energy Systems: The INSPIRE Cosimulation of Power and ICT Systems Using HLA", "paper_id": "WOS:000344995800037"}
