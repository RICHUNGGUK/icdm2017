By investigating the character values of corresponding relative difference sets, we obtain some nonexistence results of GPBAs. In particular, we show that no GPBA (2, 2, p(n)) of any type z exists for n = 1 and any odd prime p, or for any n and any odd prime p not equivalent to 1 (mod 8). For the case p = 2, there exists a GPBA(2,2,2(n)) of type z = (z(1), z(2), z(3)) if and only if z not equal (0, 0, 0) and n = 0, 2, 4, or z not equal (0,0,0) with z(3) = 0 and 0 <= n <= 5, with z(3) = 1 and 0 <= n <= 3.", "paper_title": "Nonexistence of a kind of generalized perfect binary array", "paper_id": "WOS:000241183000026"}
