The hERG channel is an important antitarget in drug development since cardiotoxic risks remain as a major cause of attrition. A ligand-based pharmacophore model collection was developed and theoretically validated. The seven most complementary and suitable models were used for virtual screening of in-house and commercially available compound libraries. From the hit lists, 50 compounds were selected for experimental validation through bioactivity assessment using patch clamp techniques. Twenty compounds inhibited hERG channels expressed in HEK 293 cells with IC50 values ranging from 0.13 to 2.77 mu M, attesting to the suitability of the models as cardiotoxicity prediction tools in a preclinical stage.", "paper_title": "Experimentally Validated hERG Pharmacophore Models as Cardiotoxicity Prediction Tools", "paper_id": "WOS:000343849600025"}
