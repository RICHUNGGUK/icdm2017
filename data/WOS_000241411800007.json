Numerous techniques have been developed to facilitate route reuse, including caching, overhearing, using partial routes, and replying to route discovery with cached routes. We term such reuses natural reuse, as they are passive techniques and do not cause any detour in routing data packets. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic P2P Source Routing (DPSR) protocol which imposes additional reuse of routes by exploiting the synergy between mobile ad hoc networks and peer-to-peer overlay networks. By imposing reuse of a route to a faraway common destination node among a set of nearby source nodes using localized communication, DPSR limits the number of the source routes that each node has to discover to O(logN), in contrast to the maximum of N source routes per node in DSR, where N is the number of nodes in the network. Our detailed simulations show that DPSR reduces the routing overhead significantly from imposed route reuse when many nodes communicate with one or a few other nodes. Obtaining the maximum benefit from imposed route reuse, however, requires sustaining traffic patterns beyond the capacity of current ad hoc networks. We conjecture that the full potential of DPSR will manifest as the capacity of ad hoc networks increases in the future from advances in physical layer technologies.", "paper_title": "Imposed route reuse in ad hoc network routing protocols using structured peer-to-peer overlay routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241411800007"}
