Advantages of Stack Filters are their generality and the existence of efficient optimization algorithms under mean absolute error (Wendt et al. in IEEE Trans. Acoust. Speech Signal Process. 34:898-910, 1986). In this paper we describe our recent efforts to use the class of Stack Filters for classification problems. This leads to a novel class of continuous domain classifiers which we call Ordered Hypothesis Machines (OHM). We develop convex optimization based learning algorithms for Ordered Hypothesis Machines and highlight their relationship to Support Vector Machines and Nearest Neighbor classifiers. We report on the performance on synthetic and real-world datasets including an application to change detection in remote sensing imagery. We conclude that OHM provides a novel way to reduce the number of exemplars used in Nearest Neighbor classifiers and achieves competitive performance to the more computationally expensive K-Nearest Neighbor method.", "paper_title": "Ordered Hypothesis Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000302346100003"}
