Such imbalances usually decrease the performance of the parallel solution. Thus, in this study, a workload distribution framework for such methods at heterogeneous computing environment is presented. The main idea behind this framework is to iteratively adjust the shapes of substructures so that the imbalance in their condensation times is minimized. Both generated and actual structural models were solved to illustrate the applicability and the efficiency of this approach. In these examples, a PC cluster having eight different computers was used.", "paper_title": "Workload Distribution Framework for the Parallel Solution of Large Structural Models on Heterogeneous PC Clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000274524100003"}
