We introduce the problem of ordering the contigs of two partially assembled genomes so as to maximize the similarity (measured in terms of genome rearrangements) between the assembled genomes. We give a linear-time algorithm for the BLOCK ORDERING PROBLEM (BOP): Given two signed permutations (genomes) that are been broken into blocks (contigs), order and orient each set of blocks, in such a way that the number of cycles in the breakpoint graph of the resulting permutations is maximized. We illustrate our algorithm on a set of 90 markers from the human and mouse chromosomes X and show how the size of the contigs and the rearrangement distance between the two genomes affects the accuracy of the predicted assemblies.
