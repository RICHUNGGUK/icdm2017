We view an image (in either the spatial domain or the wavelet domain) as a collection of vectors in a high-dimensional space. We then fit a piece-wise linear model (i.e., a union of affine subspaces) to the vectors at each downisampling scale. We call this a multiscale hybrid linear model for the image. The model can be effectively estimated via a new algebraic method known as generalized principal component analysis (GPCA). The hybrid and hierarchical structure of this model allows us to effectively extract and exploit multimodal correlations among the imagery data at different scales. It conceptually and computationally remedies limitations of many existing image representation methods that are based on either a fixed linear transformation (e.g., DCT, wavelets), or an adaptive uni-modal linear transformation (e.g., PCA), or a multimodal model that uses only cluster means (e.g., VQ). We will justify both quantitatively and experimentally why and how such a simple multiscale hybrid model is able to reduce simultaneously the model complexity and computational cost. Despite a small overhead of the model, our careful and extensive experimental results show that this new model gives more compact representations for a wide variety of natural images under a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios than many existing methods, including wavelets. We also briefly address how the same (hybrid linear) modeling paradigm can be extended to be potentially useful for other applications, such as image segmentation.", "paper_title": "Multiscale hybrid linear models for lossy image representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242362900004"}
