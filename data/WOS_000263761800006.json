The numerical stability of Galerkin models is shown to depend on the choice of inner product for the projection. For the linearized Euler equations, a symmetry transformation leads to a stable formulation for the inner product. Boundary conditions for compressible flow that preserve stability of the reduced order model are constructed. Preservation of stability for the discrete implementation of the Galerkin projection is made possible using a piecewise-smooth finite element basis. Stability of the reduced order model using this approach is demonstrated on several model problems, where a suitable approximation basis is generated using proper orthogonal decomposition of a transient computational fluid dynamics simulation.
