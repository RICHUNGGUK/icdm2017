Unfortunately, existing privacy-preserving techniques for LBS have several limitations, such as requiring a fully-trusted third party, offering limited privacy guarantees and incurring high communication overhead. In this paper, we propose a user-defined privacy grid system called dynamic grid system (DGS); the first holistic system that fulfills four essential requirements for privacy-preserving snapshot and continuous LBS. (1) The system only requires a semi-trusted third party, responsible for carrying out simple matching operations correctly. This semi-trusted third party does not have any information about a user's location. (2) Secure snapshot and continuous location privacy is guaranteed under our defined adversary models. (3) The communication cost for the user does not depend on the user's desired privacy level, it only depends on the number of relevant points of interest in the vicinity of the user. (4) Although we only focus on range and k-nearest-neighbor queries in this work, our system can be easily extended to support other spatial queries without changing the algorithms run by the semi-trusted third party and the database server, provided the required search area of a spatial query can be abstracted into spatial regions. Experimental results show that our DGS is more efficient than the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving technique for continuous LBS.", "paper_title": "User-Defined Privacy Grid System for Continuous Location-Based Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000360744700014"}
