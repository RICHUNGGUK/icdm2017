This paper enhances the formal framework SCA-ASM for modeling and validating distributed self-adaptive service-oriented applications. We explain how modeling an SCA-ASM component able to monitor and react to environmental changes (context-awareness) and to internal changes (self-awareness), and present the operators for expressing and coordinating self-adaptive behaviors in a distributed setting. We also support techniques for validating adaptation scenarios, and getting feedback of the correctness of the adaptation logic as implemented by the managing SCA-ASM components over the managed ones. As a proof-of-concepts, we use self-adaptive SCA-ASMs for modeling and validating a decentralized traffic monitoring system.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Validating Self-adaptive Service-oriented Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000363658600002"}
