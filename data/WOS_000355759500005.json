The diacritics are important to clarify the sense and meaning of words. Lack of these markings may lead to ambiguity even for the natives. Often the natives successfully disambiguate the meaning through the context; however, many Arabic applications, such as machine translation, text-to-speech, and information retrieval, are vulnerable due to lack of diacritics. The process of automatically restoring diacritical marks is called diacritization or diacritic restoration. In this paper we discuss the properties of the Arabic language and the issues that are related to the lack of the diacritical marking. It will be followed by a survey of the recent algorithms that were developed to solve the diacritization problem. We also look into the future trend for researchers working in this area.", "paper_title": "A survey of automatic Arabic diacritization techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000355759500005"}
