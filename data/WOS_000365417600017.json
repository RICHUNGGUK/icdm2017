This transformation moreover preserves w-completeness. It is applicable to semantics at least as coarse as impossible futures semantics. As an application, ground- and w-complete axiomatizations are derived for weak failures, completed trace and trace semantics. We then present a finite, sound, ground-complete axiomatization for the concrete impossible futures preorder, which implies a finite, sound, ground-complete axiomatization for the weak impossible futures preorder. In contrast, we prove that no finite, sound axiomatization for BCCS modulo concrete and weak impossible futures equivalence is ground-complete. If the alphabet of actions is infinite, then the aforementioned ground-complete axiomatizations are shown to be w-complete. If the alphabet is finite, we prove that the inequational theories of BCCS modulo the concrete and weak impossible futures preorder lack such a finite basis.", "paper_title": "ON THE AXIOMATIZABILITY OF IMPOSSIBLE FUTURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000365417600017"}
