Model-driven development (MDD) approaches (e.g., Model-Integrated Computing and Model-Driven Architecture) emphasize the use of models at all stages of system development. Decomposing problems using MDD approaches may result in a separation of the artifacts in a way that impedes comprehension. For example, a single concern (such as deployment of a distributed system) may crosscut different orthogonal activities (such as component specification, interaction, packaging and planning). To keep track of all entities associated with a component, and to ensure that the constraints for the system as a whole are not violated, a purely model-driven approach imposes extra effort, thereby negating some of the benefits of MDD. This paper provides three contributions to the study of applying aspect-oriented techniques to address the crosscutting challenges of model-driven component-based distributed systems development. First, we identify the sources of crosscutting concerns that typically arise in model-driven development of component-based systems. Second, we describe how aspect-oriented model weaving helps modularize these crosscutting concerns using model transformations. Third, we describe how we have applied model weaving using a toot called the Constraint-Specification Aspect Weaver (C-SAW) in the context of the Platform-Independent Component Modeling Language (PICML), which is a domain-specific modeling language for developing component-based systems. A case study of a joint-emergency response system is presented to express the challenges in modeling a typical distributed system. Our experience shows that model weaving is an effective and scalable technique for dealing with crosscutting aspects of component-based systems development.", "paper_title": "Weaving deployment aspects into domain-specific models", "paper_id": "WOS:000239223000005"}
