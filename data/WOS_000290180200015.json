While Trident collects provenance in its native provenance model, the third provenance challenge was an opportunity to build support for the Open Provenance Model into Trident. There are several possible approaches to harmonize our native model with OPM, and such choices are also available to other existing provenance and workflow systems working towards OPM compatibility. We identify and analyze the relative merits of these approaches in an effort to inform practitioners planning to support OPM in their existing provenance/workflow systems. Further, we describe our experience with using the integration approach we choose to interoperate with other teams as part of the challenge. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
