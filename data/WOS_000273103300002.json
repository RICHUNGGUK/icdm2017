In order to overcome such drawbacks, this paper presents an adaptive total variation method based on a new edge indicator, named difference curvature, which can effectively distinguish between edges and ramps. With adaptive regularization and fidelity terms, the new model has the following properties: at object edges, the regularization term is approximate to the TV norm in order to preserve the edges, and the weight of the fidelity term is large in order to preserve details; in flat and ramp regions, the regularization term is approximate to the L2 norm in order to avoid the staircase effect, and the weight of the fidelity term is small in order to strongly remove the noise. Comparative results on both synthetic and natural images demonstrate that the new method can avoid the staircase effect and better preserve fine details. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
