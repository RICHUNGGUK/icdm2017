The program is based on an algorithm that calculates the 3D box counting of the entire volume of the brain, and also of its 3D skeletonization. The validity and accuracy of the software has been confirmed using solids with well-known 3DFD values. The usefulness of the program developed is demonstrated by its successful characterization of several neurodegenerative diseases. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
