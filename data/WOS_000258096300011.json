However, moving mesh approaches still have their advantages when the physical problem requires special treatment or accurate representation of the interface. This is, for example, the case in complex fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems when state-of-the-art boundary layer meshing is essential. This paper explores two enhancements of fixed-grid methods that allow the improved Solution Of Such complex FSI problems. The two enhancements are a straightforward approach based on local adaptivity and a hybrid method that combines ideas from fixed-grid methods and arbitrary Lagrangean-Eulerian formulations. Although both enhancements could be used with most available fixed-grid approaches they are given here against the background of a recently developed extended finite element method (XFEM)/Lagrange multiplier (LM) (Comp. Meth. Appl. Mech. Eng. 2007. DOI: 10.1016/j.cma.2007.07.002) fixed-grid method. It is shown that the hybrid scheme perfectly fits into the presented XFEM/LM framework in a consistent way.
