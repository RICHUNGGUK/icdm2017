Traditionally, to perform system calibration, one needs to measure a number of robot poses using an external measuring device. However, this process is often time-consuming, expensive and difficult for robot on-line calibration. In this paper, a methodical way of calibration of parallel robots is introduced. This method is performable only by measuring joint variable vector and positioning differences relative to a constant position in some sets of configurations that the desired positions in each set are fixed, but the moving platform orientations are different. In this method, measurements are relative, so it can be performed by using a simple measurement device. Simulations and experimental studies on a Hexaglide parallel robot built in the Sharif University of Technology reveal the convenience and effectiveness of the proposed robot calibration method for parallel robots.
