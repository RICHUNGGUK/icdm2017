Specifically, given (1) a count-constraint C, expressed using XPath and the aggregate function count and (2) a DTD D, the problem of generating an XML document that satisfies both C and D is studied. Classes of count-constraints and DTDs for which the satisfiability problem is polynomial are identified. For these classes it is shown that a satisfying document can be generated efficiently in terms of the input and the output.", "paper_title": "Count-constraints for generating XML", "paper_id": "WOS:000239450400014"}
