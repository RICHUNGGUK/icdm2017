The buyer starts each period by informing each supplier of the order size for the period and the reservation quantity for all future periods within a planning horizon. The order size for the current period is finalized according to the amount previously reserved, although this amount can be increased or decreased by a predetermined percentage of the reservation amount. In this paper, a linear programming model including several key features of a quantity flexibility contract is developed from the buyer's perspective. A rolling-horizon implementation strategy is suggested for efficient implementation of the contract. Computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can be used to determine a cost effective solution for the buyer in a reasonable amount of time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
