After recalling some basic results about set-valued stochastic processes, we shall secondly prove that the Aumann type set-valued Lebesgue integral of a set-valued stochastic process above is a set-valued stochastic process. Finally we shall give the representation theorem, and prove an important inequality of the Aumann type set-valued Lebesgue integrals of set-valued stochastic processes with respect to t, which are useful to study set-valued stochastic differential inclusions with applications in finance.", "paper_title": "Aumann Type Set-valued Lebesgue Integral and Representation Theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000267342100009"}
