To solve the clustering objective function, which could not be handled by the gradient method as the traditional clustering method fuzzy c-means does, a newly developed excellent global search method, which is the gravitational search algorithm (GSA), is employed. Then, the GSA-based hyperplane clustering algorithm (GSHPC) is proposed and illuminated. GSHPC is used to partition the fuzzy space and identify premise parameters of the T-S fuzzy model, and orthogonal least squares is exploited to identify the consequent parameters. Comparative experiments are designed to verify the validity of the proposed clustering algorithm and the T-S fuzzy model identification method, and the results show that the new method is effective in describing a complicated nonlinear system with significantly high accuracies compared with approaches in the literature.", "paper_title": "T-S Fuzzy Model Identification With a Gravitational Search-Based Hyperplane Clustering Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000302536800008"}
