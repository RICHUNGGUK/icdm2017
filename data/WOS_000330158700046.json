Using this analytical framework, we propose a new feature selection algorithm, PLS-based local-RFE (LRFE-PLS). In order to compare the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, we also present PLS-based Global-RFE which takes all categories into consideration simultaneously. The advantage, of the proposed algorithms lies in the fact that PLS-based feature ranking can quickly delete irrelevant features and RFE can concurrently remove some redundant features. As a result, the selected feature subset is more compact. In this paper the proposed algorithms are compared to some state-of-the-art methods using multiple datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are competitive and work effectively for high-dimensional multi-category data. Statistical tests of significance show that LRFE-PLS algorithm has better performance. The proposed algorithms can be effectively applied not only to microarray data analysis but also to image recognition and financial data analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
