This work develops the compact implementation of a system for detecting changes in traffic in real time with OpenFlow on a NetFPGA 1G (4 x 1G) platform. The system can monitor network traffic at a line rate of up to 4 Gbps with the required detection accuracy needed with limited memory on-board. The system utilizes a one-pass method to determine when the flow exceeds a predefined threshold. Based on the flow IDs identified, actions are issued immediately to switches to respond properly according to the OpenFlow protocol. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
