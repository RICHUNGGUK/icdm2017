At first original data points are partitioned by unsupervised self-organizing map network (SOM). Then from the above clustering results, some labelled points nearer to each clustering center are chosen to train supervised generalization regression neural network model (GRNN). Then utilizing the decided GRNN model, we reclassify these original data points and gain new clustering results. At last from new clustering results, we choose some labelled points nearer to new clustering center to train and classify again, and so repeat until clustering center no longer changes. Experimental results for Iris data, Wine data and remote sensing data verify the validity of our method.", "paper_title": "A fully automated pattern classification method of combining self-organizing map with generalization regression neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100015"}
