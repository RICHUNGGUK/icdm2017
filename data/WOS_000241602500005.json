Non-rigid registration plays an important role for the analysis of these datasets. In this paper we will show some of the work of our group using non-rigid registration techniques for the detection of temporal changes such as growth in brain MR images. We will also show how non-rigid registration can be used to analyze the motion of the heart from cardiac MR images.", "paper_title": "Quantification of growth and motion using non-rigid registration", "paper_id": "WOS:000241602500005"}
