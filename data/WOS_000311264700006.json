Generally, to improve user experience and save costs as much as possible, a lot of internet applications always focus on how to achieve appropriate image recompression. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to efficiently customize image recompression according to a variety of applications. First of all, we evaluate the input image's compression level and predict an initial compression level which is very close to the final output of our system using a prior learnt from massive images. Then, we iteratively recompress the input image to different levels and measure the perceptual similarity between the input image and the new result by a block-based coding quality method. According to the output of the quality assessment method, we can update the target compression level, or switch to the subjective evaluation, or return the final recompression result in our system pipeline control. We organize subjective evaluations based on different applications and obtain corresponding assessment report. At last, based on the assessment report, we set up a series of appropriate parameters for customizing image recompression. Moreover, our new framework has been successfully applied to many commercial applications, such as web portals, e-commerce, online game, and so on.", "paper_title": "A Customized Framework to Recompress Massive Internet Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000311264700006"}
