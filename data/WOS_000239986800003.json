When the trans-membrane voltage induced by an external electric field exceeds a certain threshold (normally 0.2-1 V), a rearrangement of the molecular structure of the membrane occurs, leading to pore formation in the membrane and a considerable increase in the cell membrane permeability to ions, molecules and even macromolecules. This phenomenon is, potentially, the basis for many in vivo applications such as electrochemotherapy and gene therapy, but still lacks a comprehensive theoretical basis. This article reviews the state of current electroporation theories and briefly considers current and potential applications in biology and medicine.", "paper_title": "Membrane electroporation theories: a review", "paper_id": "WOS:000239986800003"}
