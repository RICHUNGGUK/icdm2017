As this can demand vast computational resources, especially in terms of processing power, jModelTest2 implements three parallel algorithms for model selection: (1) a multithreaded implementation for shared memory architectures; (2) a message-passing implementation for distributed memory architectures, such as clusters; and (3) a hybrid shared/distributed memory implementation for clusters of multicore nodes, combining the workload distribution across cluster nodes with a multithreaded model optimization within each node. The main limitation of the shared and distributed versions is the workload imbalance that generally appears when using more than 32 cores, a direct consequence of the heterogeneity in the computational cost of the evaluated models. The hybrid shared/distributed memory version overcomes this issue reducing the workload imbalance through a thread-based decomposition of the most costly model optimization tasks. The performance evaluation of this HPC application on a 40-core shared memory system and on a 528-core cluster has shown high scalability, with speedups of the multithreaded version of up to 32, and up to 257 for the hybrid shared/distributed memory implementation. This can represent a reduction in the execution time of some analyses from 4 days down to barely 20 minutes.
