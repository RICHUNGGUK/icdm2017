The innovation of this methodology is based on the hybridization of an artificial intelligence methodology that combines fuzzy approaches with well known pattern recognition techniques. To illustrate the potentiality of VisualBlock-FIR, a non-linear fuel cell simulator that has been proposed in the literature is employed. This simulator includes a set of five fault scenarios with some of the most frequent faults in fuel cell systems. The fault detection and identification results obtained for these scenarios are presented in this paper. It is remarkable that the proposed methodology compares favorably to the model-based methodology based on computing residuals while detecting and identifying all the proposed faults much more rapidly. Moreover, the robustness of the hybrid fault diagnosis methodology is also studied, showing good behavior even with a level of noise of 20 dB. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
