The proposed model combines the descriptions of the diffuse plastic failure in the beam-column followed by the creation or plastic hinges due to the failure or collapse of the concrete and or the re-bars A modified multi-scale analysis is performed in order to identify the parameters for stress-resultant-based macro model, which is used to described the behavior of the Timoshenko beam element The micro-scale is described by using the multi-fiber elements with embedded strain discontinuities in mode I, which would typically be triggered by bending failure mode. A special attention is paid to the influence of the axial force on the bending moment - rotation response, especially for the columns behavior computation", "paper_title": "Stress resultant model for ultimate load design of reinforced-concrete frames: combined axial force and bending moment", "paper_id": "WOS:000280429600003"}
