This paper hence proposes an image retrieval system which uses the colors, areas, and perimeters of objects in an image as the features of the image. The system is insensitive to the shift and rotation variations of objects in images, as well as to the scale and noise variations of images. The experimental results show that this system is capable of recognizing different images very well.", "paper_title": "An image retrieval system based on the color, areas, and perimeters of objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000235950100005"}
