The adoption of new coding tools in PDec, such as Advanced Motion Vector Prediction (AMVP), increases the VLSI hardware realization overhead and memory bandwidth requirement, especially for 8K UHDTV application. We propose four techniques for these challenges. Firstly, this work unifies MV and BS parameter decoders for line buffer memory sharing. Secondly, to support high throughput, we propose the top-level CU-adaptive pipeline scheme by trading off between implementation complexity and performance. Thirdly, PDec process engine with optimizations is adopted for 43.2k area reduction. Finally, PU-based coding scheme is proposed for 30% DRAM bandwidth reduction. In 90 nm process, our design costs 93.3k logic gates with 23.0 kB line buffer. The proposed architecture can support real-time decoding for 7680x4320@60fps application at 249 MHz in the worst case.", "paper_title": "Unified Parameter Decoder Architecture for H.265/HEVC Motion Vector and Boundary Strength Decoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466800002"}
