The method uses the second order derivative of the surface, which can handle inherent problems that Newton-Raphson and Halley methods have such as instability caused by inappropriate initial conditions and tangential intersection. Case examples are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
