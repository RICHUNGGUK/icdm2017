The central concept is per-Base Alignment Quality, which accurately measures the probability of a read base being wrongly aligned. The effectiveness of BAQ has been positively confirmed on large datasets by the 1000 Genomes Project analysis subgroup.", "paper_title": "Improving SNP discovery by base alignment quality", "paper_id": "WOS:000289301600018"}
