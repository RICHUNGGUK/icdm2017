The extended generalized least-correlation (EGLC) method has been proposed for the EIV models identification in the case where the input and output measurements are corrupted by white noises. To obtain more stable and accurate estimates, we introduce the prefilter and the extended vectors. It is expected that the proposed EGLC method can give more stable and more accurate estimates because the regression vector is more correlated with the filtered and the extended regression vector. The results of a simulated example indicate that the proposed algorithm provides good estimates.", "paper_title": "IDENTIFICATION OF ERRORS-IN-VARIABLES MODELS VIA EXTENDED GENERALIZED LEAST-CORRELATION METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000287124500010"}
