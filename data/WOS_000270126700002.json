Iliopoulos, M.S. Rahman, Faster index for property matching. Information Processing Letters 105 (2008) 218-223], Iliopoulos and Rahman proposed a data structure called IDS-PIP for solving the property indexing pattern matching problem. IDS-PIP can be constructed in O(n) time, where it is the length of the text. Then, based on ID-PIP, each query takes O(mlog vertical bar Sigma vertical bar + K) time, where m is the length the pattern, Sigma is the alphabet, and K is the output size. They assume that all intervals in property pi are disjoint. If the intervals in property pi are not disjoint, then they create an equivalent set of disjoint intervals pi' to replace pi. However, property pi' is not equivalent to property pi at all. In this erratum, we propose a way for finding correct property pi' and modify IDS-PIP slightly. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
