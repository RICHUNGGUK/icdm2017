We present a novel multilayered vehicular data cloud platform by using cloud computing and IoT technologies. Two innovative vehicular data cloud services, an intelligent parking cloud service and a vehicular data mining cloud service, for vehicle warranty analysis in the IoT environment are also presented. Two modified data mining models for the vehicular data mining cloud service, a Naive Bayes model and a Logistic Regression model, are presented in detail. Challenges and directions for future work are also provided.", "paper_title": "Developing Vehicular Data Cloud Services in the IoT Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800073"}
