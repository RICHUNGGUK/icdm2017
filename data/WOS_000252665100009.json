Kaddah's result shows that Lachlan's theorem, stating that the infima of two c.e. degrees in the c.e. degrees and in the Delta(0)(2) degrees coincide, cannot be generalized to the d.c.e. degrees. In this article, we apply Kaddah's idea to show that there are two d.c.e. degrees c, d such that c cups d to 0', and caps d to 0 in the d.c.e. degrees, but not in the Delta(0)(2) degrees. As a consequence, the diamond embedding 10, c, d, 0') is different from the one first constructed by Downey in 1989 in [5]. To obtain this, we will construct c.e. degrees a, b, d.c.e. degrees c > a, d > b and a non-zero omega-c.e. degree e <= c, d such that (i) a, b form a minimal pair, (ii) a isolates c, and (iii) b isolates d. From this, we can have that c, d form it minimal pair in the d.c.e. degrees, and Kaddah's result follows immediately. In Our construction, we apply Kaddah's original idea to make e below both c and d. Our construction allows us to separate the minimal pair argument (a boolean AND b = 0), the splitting of 0' (c boolean OR d = 0), and the non-minimal pair of c, d (in the Delta(0)(2) degrees), into several parts, to avoid direct conflicts that could be involved if only c, d and e are constructed. We also point out that our construction allows its to make a, b above (and hence c, d) high.", "paper_title": "Isolation, infima and diamond embeddings", "paper_id": "WOS:000252665100009"}
