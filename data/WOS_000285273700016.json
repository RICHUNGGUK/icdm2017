The delay factor is assumed to be time-varying and belongs to a given interval, which means that the lower and upper bounds of the interval time-varying delays are available. Furthermore, the derivative of the time-varying delay function can be larger than one. Based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a new sufficient condition for the solvability of this problem is presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). When these LMIs are feasible, an expression of a desired H-infinity filter is given. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed techniques.", "paper_title": "ROBUST H-infinity FILTERING FOR NONLINEAR SYSTEMS WITH INTERVAL TIME-VARYING DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000285273700016"}
