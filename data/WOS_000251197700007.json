Previously, we developed Acmi (Automatic Crystallographic Map Interpreter), an algorithm that uses a probabilistic model to infer an accurate protein backbone layout. Here, we use a sampling method known as particle filtering to produce a set of all-atom protein models. We use the output of Acmi to guide the particle filters sampling, producing an accurate, physically feasible set of structures. Results: We test our algorithm on 10 poor-quality experimental density maps. We show that particle filtering produces accurate all-atom models, resulting in fewer chains, lower sidechain RMS error and reduced R factor, compared to simply placing the best-matching sidechains on Acmi's trace. We show that our approach produces a more accurate model than three leading methods Textal, Resolve and ARP/wARP-in terms of main chain completeness, sidechain identification and crystallographic R factor.", "paper_title": "Creating protein models from electron-density maps using particle-filtering methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000251197700007"}
