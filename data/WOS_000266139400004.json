More concretely, we describe and implement an algorithm which computes such a dimension by running it in the symbolic computation package MAPLE. Finally, we also show a computational study related to this implementation, regarding both the computing time and the memory used.", "paper_title": "Algorithm to compute the maximal abelian dimension of Lie algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000266139400004"}
