The PPS involves numerous packet switches that operate independently and in parallel. The typical PPS dispatch algorithm applies a round-robin method (RR). The class of PPS is characterized by deploying parallel center-stage switches that enable all memory buffers run more slowly than the external line rate. A novel SW packet switching method for PPS, called SW-PPS, is developed. The SW-PPS operates in a pipeline fashion to ensure overall switching. The performance of the RR-PPS and SW-PPS is evaluated for a torus topology. Under identical Bernoulli, the SW-PPS provided considerably outperformed RR-PPS. Furthermore, this investigation proposes a mathematical analytical model for RR-PPS and SW-PPS.", "paper_title": "Performance evaluation of the parallel packet switch with a sliding window scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100118"}
