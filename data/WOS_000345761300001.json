The main focus is on adjusting the mass matrix. Two well known discretization methods, described in FEM textbooks since the late 1960s, lead to diagonally lumped and consistent mass matrices, respectively. Those models are sufficient to cover many engineering applications but for some problems they fall short. The gap can be filled with a more general approach that relies on the use of templates. These are algebraic forms that carry free parameters. Templates have the virtue of producing a set of mass matrices that satisfy certain a priori constraint conditions such as symmetry, nonnegativity, invariance and momentum conservation. In particular, the diagonally lumped and consistent versions can be obtained as instances. Availability of free parameters, however, allows the mass matrix to be customized to special needs, such as high precision vibration frequencies or minimally dispersive wave propagation. An attractive feature of templates for FEM programming is that only one element implementation as module with free parameters is needed, and need not be recoded when the application problem class changes. The paper provides a general overview of the topic, and illustrates it with one-dimensional structural elements: bars and beams.", "paper_title": "Mass Matrix Templates: General Description and 1D Examples", "paper_id": "WOS:000345761300001"}
