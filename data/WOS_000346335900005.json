In the security analysis, by applying the method of the entropy theory, we contrast our scheme to another two strategies, the Ping-pong protocol and the protocol using two particles of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair as detection particles. The comparison results show that if the eavesdropper obtains the same amount of information, the presented quantum protocol strategy will have a larger detection probability than the other two. At last, the security of the proposed protocol is discussed. The analysis results indicate that the protocol in this paper is more secure.
