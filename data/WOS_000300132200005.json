It is essential that the network continues to operate, even if some of its nodes fail. It is also important that the network is able to support the mission for a minimum specified period of time. Hence, the design of a sensor network should not only provide some guarantees that all data from the sensor nodes are gathered at the base station, even in the presence of some faults, but should also allow the network to remain functional for a specified duration. This paper considers a two-tier, hierarchical sensor network architecture, where some relay nodes, provisioned with higher power and other capabilities, are used as cluster heads. Given a distribution of sensor nodes in a sensor network, finding the locations to place a minimum number of relay nodes such that, each sensor node is covered by at least one relay node, is known to be a computationally difficult problem. In addition, for successful and reliable data communication, the relay nodes network needs to be connected, as well as resilient to node failures. In this paper, a novel integrated Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation is proposed, which, unlike existing techniques, not only finds a suitable placement strategy for the relay nodes, but also assigns the sensor nodes to the clusters and determines a load-balanced routing scheme. Therefore, in addition to the desired levels of fault tolerance for both the sensor nodes and the relay nodes, the proposed approach also meets specified performance guarantees with respect to network lifetime by limiting the maximum energy consumption of the relay nodes.
