Since the DLL has dual DCC circuit, with the combinations of two DCC circuits, the DLL can correct +12.9% and -6.13% duty error under 2% at 333 MHz with 1.6 V. The DLL operates up to 1.67 GHz with 1.8 V and 1.78 GHz with 2.0 V supply voltage, and its peak-to-peak jitter at 1.4 GHz with 1.8 V is 29 ps. The power dissipations are 4.2 mW (5 mW) at 100 MHz and 19.8 mW (29.5 mW) at 1 GHz with 1.5 V (1.8 V) supply voltage with the help of the update gear circuit from the previous work. And the DLL is fabricated with 54-nm DRAM CMOS technology. The active area of the DLL is 0.11 mm(2).", "paper_title": "A 3.57 Gb/s/pin Low Jitter All-Digital DLL With Dual DCC Circuit for GDDR3 DRAM in 54-nm CMOS Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000293712500017"}
