Two principles that minimize the total coordination cost and isolate the design tasks not good at are presented in this study to support the cross-organizational assignment. Then a quantitative formulation of the two principles is given. And a method of design decomposition based on the genetic algorithm is discussed. A case study of a gasoline engine is used to illustrate the method.", "paper_title": "Design Decomposition for Cross-organizational Assignment of Design Tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000279230900002"}
