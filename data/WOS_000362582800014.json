Recently, lots of aggregation techniques have been proposed for fusing IFNs. However, they only deal with a limited number of IFNs that take the form of discrete information. In this paper, we will first apply the definite integral to give the notion of definite integration for IFNs and investigate a lot of novel integral operators and, then, utilize these integral operators to get some new aggregation operators that can aggregate the IFNs spreading all over an area, which means that each point in a 2-D plane is an IFN that we want to aggregate. The new techniques can help us to deal with more complicated intuitionistic fuzzy information.", "paper_title": "Definite Integrals of Atanassov's Intuitionistic Fuzzy Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000362582800014"}
