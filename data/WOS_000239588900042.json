Within such communication supportive approaches, the importance of the analysis of multiparty conversation has increasingly been recognized. In accordance with these orientations, this article outlines a three-party conversation corpus built by the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, and introduces three preliminary analyses of it that will contribute to the development of Conversational Informatics: The characteristics of turn-taking procedure in three-person conversation; assessment sequential patterns that appeared in the data; and shared knowledge and interpersonal relationships between participants observable from the assessment sequences in triadic conversation.", "paper_title": "Detection of assessment patterns in ordinary triadic conversation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239588900042"}
