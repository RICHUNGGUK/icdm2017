Data summarizations (e.g., data bubbles) have been proposed to compress large databases into representative points suitable for subsequent hierarchical cluster analysis. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the quality measure (data summarization index) of incremental data bubbles. When updating databases, we show which factors could affect the mean and standard deviation of data summarization index or not. Based on these statements, a fully dynamic scheme to maintain data bubbles incrementally is proposed. An extensive experimental evaluation confirms our statements and shows that the fully dynamic incremental data bubbles are effective in preserving the quality of the data summarization for hierarchical clustering.", "paper_title": "Dynamic incremental data summarization for hierarchical clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000239658700035"}
