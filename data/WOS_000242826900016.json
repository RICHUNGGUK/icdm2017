Our approach is called polarization multiplexing and it has a significant impact in appearance modeling where the image as a function of illumination direction is needed. Multiple unknown light sources can illuminate the scene simultaneously, and the individual contributions to the overall surface reflectance are estimated. Polarization multiplexing relies on the relationship between the light source direction and the intensity modulation. Inverting this transformation enables the individual intensity contributions to be estimated. In addition to polarization multiplexing, we show that phase histograms from the intensity modulations can be used to estimate scene properties including the number of light sources.", "paper_title": "Polarization multiplexing and demultiplexing for appearance-based modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000242826900016"}
