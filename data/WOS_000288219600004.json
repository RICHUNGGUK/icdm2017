Open covers are used to approximate the topology of the phase space in a finite way, and the dynamical system is represented by means of a combinatorial multivalued map. We formulate notions of transitivity and mixing in the finite resolution setting in a computable and consistent way. Moreover, we formulate equivalent conditions for these properties in terms of graphs, and provide effective algorithms for their verification. As an application we show that the H,non attractor is mixing at all resolutions coarser than 10(-5).", "paper_title": "Finite Resolution Dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000288219600004"}
