If p = 2, for most classes of connected regular graphs with some further form of symmetry, it was shown by Dankelmann et al. (Des. Codes Cryptogr. 2012) that the hull is either {0} or has minimum weight at least 2k-2. Here we show that if the graph is strongly regular with parameter set (n, k, lambda, mu), then, unless k is even and mu is odd, the binary hull is non-trivial, of minimum weight generally greater than 2k - 2, and we construct words of low weight in the hull; if k is even and mu is odd, we show that the binary hull is zero. Further, if a graph is the line graph of a k-regular graph, k a parts per thousand yen 3, that has an a\"\"-cycle for some a\"\" a parts per thousand yen 3, the binary hull is shown to be non-trivial with minimum weight at most 2a\"\"(k-2). Properties of the p-ary hulls are also established.", "paper_title": "Hulls of codes from incidence matrices of connected regular graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000329240200005"}
