The activation functions are monotone nondecreasing with known lower and upper bounds. Novel stability criteria are derived by employing new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the integral inequality. The developed stability criteria have delay dependencies and the results are characterized by linear matrix inequalities. New and less conservative solutions to the global stability problem are provided in terms of feasibility testing. Numerical examples are finally given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "New Delay-Dependent Stability Criteria for Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delay Using Delay-Decomposition Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000337906300012"}
