A generic face mesh is deformed and the texture image is computed using image-based modeling technique. The deformed mesh is then convolved with a kernel function to generate a convolution surface, and wrinkles are generated by modulating the surface with a designed profile function. The pre-computed texture is mapped onto the convolution surface to enhance the realism. Experimental results show that our method can generate wrinkles with different patterns by regulating some parameters of the profile function.", "paper_title": "Face modeling and wrinkle simulation using convolution surface", "paper_id": "WOS:000239560700025"}
