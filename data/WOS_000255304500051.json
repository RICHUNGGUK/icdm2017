Both algorithms work in the grand-canonical ensemble and can have a winding number larger than zero. However, they retain a lot of intrinsic degrees of freedom which can be used to optimize the algorithm. We let us guide by the rigorous statements on the globally optimal form of Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations in order to devise a locally optimal formulation of the worm algorithm while incorporating ideas from the directed loop algorithm. We provide numerical examples for the soft-core Bose-Hubbard model and various spin-S models. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
