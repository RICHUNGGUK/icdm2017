Especially, in Korea, the penetration rate of mobile service is almost 90%; therefore, there is not enough room for a new customer. Furthermore, today's new services have been influenced by more factors in decision making before launching. It has been the main issue for decision makers whether a new service will be successful or not. However, a few methods have been introduced to evaluate the feasibility of a new service. And very few papers have introduced to the evaluatation of comparative advantages among competitive services, but such methods mainly depend on subjective opinion of experts. The proposed model considers the multidimensional factors influencing telecom service evaluation based on the ANP's advantages, which helps service providers in a telecom field to select a new service with the view of their strategies. Also, the BSC perspectives are adapted in the model to generate evaluation measures. Additionally, a new video phone service in Korea is evaluated based on a proposed model.
