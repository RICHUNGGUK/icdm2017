TABLogic allows us to write specifications functionally linking system variables from different temporal contexts. We present examples to show the motivation for this logic especially in the context of high level modeling of complex real time systems. We formally define TAB Logic, formulate the problem of verification on a simulation trace and present efficient algorithms to check TAB assertions, both offline and online. We present results of application of TAB Logic for Instruction Semantics and Bus Transaction Verification of a bus integrated pipelined processor core implementation. We also employ TAB Logic to validate the Interrupt mode behavior of the processor core implementation. Further, we show the utility of TAB Logic in fault detection. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of TAB Logic in the domain of simulation based verification of analog circuits like Operational Amplifiers and DC-DC Converters. We finally discuss the limitations of TAB logic and conclude.", "paper_title": "Simulation-Based Verification using Temporally Attributed Boolean Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000259971400009"}
