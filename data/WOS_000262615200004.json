One, possible approach for solving this bias problem is the bias-compensation based method such (is the bias-compensated least-squares (BCLS) method. In this paper, a new bias-compensation based method is proposed for identification of noisy input-output system, The proposed method is based on compensation of asymptotic bias on the instrumental variables type (W-type.) estimates by making use of noise variances estimates. In order to obtain the noise variances estimates, an overdetermined system of equations is introduced, and the noise variances estimation algorithm is derived by solving this overdetermined system of equations. From the combination of the parameter estimation algorithm and the noise variances estimation algorithm, the proposed bias-compensated instrumental variables type (BCIV-type) method can be established. The results of a simulated example indicate that the proposed algorithm provides good estimates.", "paper_title": "IDENTIFICATION OF ERRORS-IN-VARIABLES MODEL VIA BIAS-COMPENSATED INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES TYPE METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000262615200004"}
