As this exploration is a complex and time consuming task, in this paper we present DSE strategies to select optimization sequences to both improve the performance of each function and reduce the exploration time. The DSE is based on a clustering approach which groups functions with similarities and then explore the reduced search space provided by the optimizations previously suggested for the functions in each group. The identification of similarities between functions uses a data mining method which is applied to a symbolic code representation of the source code. The DSE process uses the reduced set identified by clustering in two ways: as the design space or as the initial configuration. In both ways, the adoption of a pre-selection based on clustering allows the use of simple and fast DSE algorithms. Our experiments for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach address the exploration of compiler optimization sequences considering 49 compilation passes and targeting a Xilinx MicroBlaze processor, and were performed aiming performance improvements for 41 functions. Experimental results reveal that the use of our new clustering-based DSE approach achieved a significant reduction on the total exploration time of the search space (18 x over a Genetic Algorithm approach for DSE) at the same time that important performance speedups (43% over the baseline) were obtained by the optimized codes.", "paper_title": "Exploration of Compiler Optimization Sequences Using Clustering-Based Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000341937800008"}
