The moving mesh strategy is based on the approach proposed by Li et al. (J. Comput. Phys. 2001; 170:562-588) to separate the mesh-moving and partial differential equation evolution. The phase-field equations are discretized by a finite volume method in space, and the mesh-moving part is realized by solving the conventional Euler-Lagrange equations with the standard gradient-based monitors. The algorithm is computationally efficient and has been successfully used in numerical simulations.
