However, there is a lack of tools for shared services management (SSM) to apply SOA. This paper proposes an ontological map for SSM to apply SOA. This mapping approach, based on the well-known Zachman framework of information architecture, specifies the ontological perspective of SOA for SSM. The ontological map semantically links all aspects of SOA for SSM. Through a case study, a design artifact of computerized ontological map of SOA demonstrates the usability of the artifact for SSM.
