In this paper, we present three signaling and routing protocols for establishing QoS (e.g., bandwidth) guaranteed connections for IP traffic in iCAR. In particular, we discuss how to establish a relaying route between an MH (Mobile Host) and a BTS (Base Transceiver Station) in a nearby cell via ARS's (Ad hoc Relaying Stations), and evaluate the performance of the protocols in terms of request rejection rate and signaling overhead through both analysis and Simulations.", "paper_title": "Signaling and Routing Protocols for iCAR", "paper_id": "WOS:000262909400002"}
