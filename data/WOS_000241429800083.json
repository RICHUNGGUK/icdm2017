Several solutions exist which allow content providers to offer video, audio, and graphics to as many devices as possible by using scalable coding techniques. In addition, content providers also need a scalable presentation format to be able to create a presentation once and distribute it to all possible target devices. This paper introduces a scalable presentation format combining MPEG-21 technology with the User Interface Markup Language. The introduced presentation format is based on assigning types to MPEG-21 Digital Items and can be used to create a presentation once, whereupon several device-specific versions can be extracted. The reuse of resource and presentation information together with the use of a device-independent presentation language are hereby the key parameters in the development of the scalable presentation format.", "paper_title": "A scalable presentation format for multichannel publishing based on MPEG-21 digital items", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800083"}
