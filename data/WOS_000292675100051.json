However, experimental studies of polycrystalline NiTi surfaces tend to indicate that Ti atoms are always abundantly available at the surface. This theoretical study indicates that whether Ti atoms are dominantly available at the surface depends on the surface index. On NiTi(001) in the B2 phase, the surface can be Ti or Ni terminated, with equal probability, while on NiTi(110) in the B2 phase and NiTi(010) in the B19' phase, Ti atoms are favored to be present at the surface.
