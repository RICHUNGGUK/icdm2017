The artificial momentum forcing term applied at certain points in the flow and inside the body of any shape allows the imposition of no-slip velocity condition to account for the body of complex boundary. Development of an interpolation scheme that can accurately lead to no-slip velocity condition along the IB is essential since Cartesian grid lines generally do not coincide with the IB. The results simulated from the proposed IB method agree well with other numerical and experimental results for several chosen benchmark problems. The accuracy and fidelity of the IB flow solver to predict flows with irregular IBs are therefore demonstrated.
