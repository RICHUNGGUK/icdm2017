As a matter of fact, this is a non-trivial problem in knowledge representation. Starting from the previous work, we introduce the notion of tactile maps for robots, and we propose an architecture that addresses all the various phases which allow us to implement tactile-based representation and robot control. The proposed architecture is validated using simulations, which are aimed at assessing the robustness and the performance of the chosen control strategy with respect to the accuracy of the robot skin representation as well as to the force feedback needed to implement tactile-based contact tasks.
