Many methods have been proposed for the design of such filters. Many of them first design a linear phase filter whose length is twice as long, and then factorize the filter to obtain the minimum phase. Although these methods theoretically guarantee its optimality, it is difficult to control the ratio of ripples between different bands. In the conventional lowpass filter design, for example, when different weights are given for its passband and stopband, one needs to iteratively design the filter by trial and error to achieve the ratio of the weights exactly. To address this problem, we modifies well-known Parks-McClellan algorithm and make it possible to directly control the ripple ratios. The method iteratively solves a set of linear equations with controlling the ratio of ripples. Using this method, the equiripple solutions are obtained quickly.", "paper_title": "Design of equiripple minimum phase FIR filters with ripple ratio control", "paper_id": "WOS:000236290000015"}
