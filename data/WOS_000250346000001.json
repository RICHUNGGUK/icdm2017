It needs establishing standards and protocols for data exchange between different enterprise systems. Nevertheless, since there is no methodology for collecting data, exchanged information is generally incomplete. Business process modelling aims at specifying object flows and processes inside enterprise levels and among networked enterprises. Enterprise-control systems aim at driving and scheduling the manufacturing resources based on information coming from the whole enterprise. However, the increased complexity of these models does not help to ensure coherent relationships between its components. In the current paper, the author will analyse how enterprise applications, models and standards used at different levels of the enterprise could be classified to come to a framework of many interoperability types.", "paper_title": "Towards a classification framework for interoperability of enterprise applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000250346000001"}
