This paper addresses two different systems for the detection of melanomas in dermoscopy images. The first system uses global methods to classify skin lesions, whereas the second system uses local features and the bag-of-features classifier. This paper aims at determining the best system for skin lesion classification. The other objective is to compare the role of color and texture features in lesion classification and determine which set of features is more discriminative. It is concluded that color features outperform texture features when used alone and that both methods achieve very good results, i.e., Sensitivity = 96% and Specificity = 80% for global methods against Sensitivity = 100% and Specificity = 75% for local methods. The classification results were obtained on a data set of 176 dermoscopy images from Hospital Pedro Hispano, Matosinhos.", "paper_title": "Two Systems for the Detection of Melanomas in Dermoscopy Images Using Texture and Color Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000341567800030"}
