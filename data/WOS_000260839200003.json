TCCS was prospectively acquired within 2 h prior to routine cerebral angiography in 100 consecutive patients (54M:46F, median age 50 years). Angiographic MCA vasospasm was classified as mild (< 25% of vessel caliber reduction), moderate (25-50%), or severe (> 50%). A Learning Vector Quantization neural network classified MCA spasm based on TCCS peak-systolic, mean, and end-diastolic velocity data. During a four-class discrimination task, accurate classification by the network ranged from 64.9% to 72.3%, depending on the number of neurons in the Kohonen layer. Accurate classification of vasospasm ranged from 79.6% to 87.6%, with an accuracy of 84.7% to 92.1% for the detection of moderate-to-severe vasospasm. An artificial neural network may increase the accuracy of TCCS in diagnosis of MCA spasm.", "paper_title": "Learning Vector Quantization Neural Networks Improve Accuracy of Transcranial Color-coded Duplex Sonography in Detection of Middle Cerebral Artery Spasm-Preliminary Report", "paper_id": "WOS:000260839200003"}
