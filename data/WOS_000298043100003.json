The level set method is clearly advantageous for image objects with a complex topology and fragmented appearance. Our method integrates discriminative classification models and distance transforms with the level set method to avoid local minima and better snap to true object boundaries. The level set function approximates a transformed version of pixelwise posterior probabilities of being part of a target object. The evolution of its zero level set is driven by three force terms, region force, edge field force, and curvature force. These forces are based on a probabilistic classifier and an unsigned distance transform of salient edges. We further propose a technique that improves the performance of both the probabilistic classifier and the level set method over multiple passes. It makes the final object segmentation less sensitive to user interactions. Experiments and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Interactive Image Segmentation Based on Level Sets of Probabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000298043100003"}
