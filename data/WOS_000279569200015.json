A fluid simulation is used to model an atmospheric pressure radio frequency helium discharge with a small nitrogen impurity Sensitivity derivatives are computed for the peak electron density with respect to physical inputs to the simulation. These derivatives are verified using several different methods to compute sensitivity derivatives It is then demonstrated how sensitivity derivatives can be used within a design cycle to change these physical Inputs so as to Increase the peak electron density It is also shown how sensitivity analysis can be used in conjunction with experimental data to obtain better estimates for rate and transport parameters. Finally, it is described how sensitivity analysis could be used to compute an upper bound on the uncertainty for results from a simulation (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Using sensitivity derivatives for design and parameter estimation in an atmospheric plasma discharge simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000279569200015"}
