The deformation behaviors of the rockfills and the soil-structure interfaces were modeled with the Duncan-Chang model and Desai's thin-layer elements, respectively. The seepage flow process was characterized with a newly-developed parabolic variational inequality formulation of the Signorini's condition. The deformation-dependent permeability of the rockfills was characterized by a calibrated Kozeny-Carman model that considered the influence of confining pressure on porosity. The proposed model was applied to capture the seepage flow and deformation behaviors of the Shuibuya CFR dam in China. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
