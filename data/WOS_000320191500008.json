A nonlinear integral-type sliding manifold is first presented that incorporates a virtual nominal control to achieve prescribed specifications of the perturbed system, and an adaptive sliding mode controller is constructed to automatically compensate for external disturbances and unknown time-invariant faults. It is shown that the proposed controller has the capability to guarantee that the resulting closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. Control design methodology is then extended to tackle with the unknown time-varying actuator faults. It is proved that any given level of gain attenuation from external disturbance/parametric estimation error to system output is achieved with the developed control law. The closed-loop performance of the new control solution derived here is evaluated extensively through numerical simulations in which the flexible spacecraft attitude control under both the external disturbances and actuator faults are considered.", "paper_title": "Adaptive fault tolerant control using integral sliding mode strategy with application to flexible spacecraft", "paper_id": "WOS:000320191500008"}
