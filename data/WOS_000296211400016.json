Gutman et al. [Extremal energy trees, MATCH Commun. Math. Compel. Chem. 59 (2008), 315-320] conjectured that the fourth maximal energy tree should be P-n(2, 6, n - 9), which is the tree consisting of three internal disjoint pendent paths starting from the unique vertex of degree 3, the length of the paths are 2, G and n - 9, respectively. Li and Li, Shan and Shao showed that the fourth maximal tree must be one of the two trees, P-n(2, 6, n - 9) and T-n(2, 2|2, 2), and these two trees are incomparable in the so-called quasi-order, where T-n(2, 2|2,2) denotes the tree of order n obtained by attaching two pendent paths of length 2 to each end vertex of the path Pn-8, respectively. In this paper, by utilizing the Coulson integral formula and some knowledge of real analysis, especially by employing certain combinatorial techniques, we show that the energy of P-n(2, 6, n - 9) is greater than that of T-n(2, 2|2, 2), and therefore completely confirm this conjecture.", "paper_title": "Complete Solution to a Conjecture on the Fourth Maximal Energy Tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000296211400016"}
