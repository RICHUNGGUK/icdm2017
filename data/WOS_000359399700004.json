Following the same general steps of the proof there, we make essential improvement on our previous theorem by recalculating a key inequality. Our result shows that the Marcinkiewicz integral, with a bounded radial function in its kernel, is still bounded on the Triebel-Lizorkin space.", "paper_title": "Boundedness of Marcinkiewicz integral with rough kernel on Triebel-Lizorkin spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000359399700004"}
