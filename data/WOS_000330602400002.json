In this method, G ''+Psi G'+Phi G = 0 together with F (phi) = Sigma(U)(f=-U) s(f) (G'/G)(f) is implemented, where s(f) (f = 0, +/- 1, +/- 2, . . . , +/- U), Psi and Phi are constants. In addition, the obtained analytical solutions are illustrated in three different families including solitons and periodic solurions. Further, it is vital mentioning that, for a special case, some of our solutions are in good contract with those gained by other authors.", "paper_title": "The improved (G '/G)-expansion method to the (2+1)-dimensional breaking soliton equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000330602400002"}
