We determine the equilibrium points of the considered equation and then study their local stability. Also we study the boundedness and the permanence of the solutions. Finally we investigate the global asymptotically stable of the equilibrium points.", "paper_title": "Dynamics of some Rational Difference Equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000348558900004"}
