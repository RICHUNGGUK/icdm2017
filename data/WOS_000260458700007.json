In the meantime, these objective functions and constraints may contain some uncertain parameters. In addition, there may have multiple followers involved in a bilevel decision problem. These followers may share their individual decision variables with each other but keep individual objectives in reacting any of the leader's decisions, which is a common situation in real bilevel decision activities. This study deals with all above three issues, fuzzy parameters, multi-objectives, and multi-followers in a partial cooperative situation, at the same time. After a set of models for describing different cases of the fuzzy multi-objective multi-follower bilevel programming with partial cooperation (FMMBP-PC) problem, this paper develops an approximation branch-and-bound algorithm to solve this problem.", "paper_title": "An algorithm for fuzzy multi-objective multi-follower partial cooperative bilevel programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000260458700007"}
