Our objective is to synthesise complete systems, which analyse electrical brain signals and directly transform them into pointer movements, almost from scratch, the only input provided by us in the process being the set of visual stimuli to be used to generate recognisable brain activity. Experimental results with our GP approach are very promising and compare favourably with those produced by support vector machines.", "paper_title": "A genetic programming approach to the evolution of brain-computer interfaces for 2-D mouse-pointer control", "paper_id": "WOS:000304402000005"}
