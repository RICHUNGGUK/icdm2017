Perceptual image hashing is useful in image databases, watermarking, and authentication. In this paper, we decouple image hashing into feature extraction (intermediate hash) followed by data clustering (final hash). For any perceptually significant feature extractor, we propose a polynomial-time heuristic clustering algorithm that automatically determines the final hash length needed to satisfy a specified distortion. We prove that the decision version of our clustering problem is NP complete. Based on the proposed algorithm, we develop two variations to facilitate perceptual robustness versus fragility tradeoffs. We validate the perceptual significance of our hash by testing under Stirmark attacks. Finally, we develop randomized clustering algorithms for the purposes of secure image hashing.", "paper_title": "A clustering based approach to perceptual image hashing", "paper_id": "WOS:000246106400008"}
