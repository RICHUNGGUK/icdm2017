A new distributed control plane is developed for this architecture that enables intercommunication among the ONUs, as well as signaling and scheduling procedures that operate in a distributed manner. To cope with the unpredictable users' behavior and bandwidth demands, which shift both in time and place in such a networking environment, supported by the devised control plane, a distributed and efficient network resource allocation and sharing strategy is developed allowing for efficient dynamic allocation and sharing of overall downstream, upstream, and LAN network resources by adaptively adjusting them to the offered load. Performance results concerning link throughput and delay are presented, validating that the proposed methodology can meet the capacity requirements of the dynamic and highly fluctuant traffic pattern of the emerging multimedia applications and services. Specifically, the simulation results clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed shared wavelength strategy as the downstream/upstream network throughput is almost equal to the ideal theoretical throughput.
