NPB, Alq(3), KCl, ITO, MoO(3), Al and LiF are N,N'-bis-(1-naphthl)-diphenyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4,4'-diamine, tris (8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum, potassium chloride, indium-tin oxide, molybdenum trioxide, aluminum and lithium fluoride, respectively. When bare AI is used as a cathode, both luminance and efficiency are improved by the insertion of KCl inside Alq(3) (anode/NPB/Alq(3)/KCl/Alq(3)/Al), compared to a control device (anode/NPB/Alq(3)/Al). This is attributed to trap sites induced by KCl layer, which give a better recombination in the devices. However, if the cathode is LiF/AI, the performance of control device (anode/NPB/Alq3/LiF/Al) is superior to that of devices with KCl inside Alq(3) (anode/NPB/Alq(3)/KCl/Alq(3)/LiF/Al), which is attributed that the probability of electron injection from cathode is decreased.
