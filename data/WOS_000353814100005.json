It has been shown recently that MMBM may be expressed as the limit of a parameterized family of Markov-modulated fluid models. We prove that the weak convergence also holds for systems with two reflecting boundaries, one at zero and one at , and that the stationary distributions of the approximating fluid models converge to the stationary distribution of the two-sided reflected MMBM. In so doing, we obtain a new representation for the stationary distribution. It is factorised into a vector determined by the phase behaviour when the fluid is either at the level 0 or the level , and a matrix expression characteristic of the process when the fluid is in the open interval (0, b).", "paper_title": "Fluid approach to two-sided reflected Markov-modulated Brownian motion", "paper_id": "WOS:000353814100005"}
