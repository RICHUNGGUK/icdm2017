The available stylization filters, however, are usually created manually by artists, resulting in a narrow set of choices. Moreover, it can be difficult for the user to select a desired filter, since the filters' names often do not convey their functions. We investigate an approach to photo filtering in which the user provides one or more keywords, and the desired style is defined by the set of images returned by searching the web for those keywords. Our method clusters the returned images, allows the user to select a cluster, then stylizes the user's photos by transferring vignetting, color, and local contrast from that cluster. This approach vastly expands the range of available styles, and gives each filter a meaningful name by default. We demonstrate that our method is able to robustly transfer a wide range of styles from image collections to users' photos.", "paper_title": "AutoStyle: Automatic Style Transfer from Image Collections to Users' Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000340598800003"}
