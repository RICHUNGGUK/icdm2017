Thus, any function in the subspace V-0 of a multiresolution analysis can be recovered from its samples at the shifted integers {a + n}(n is an element of z) by means of a sampling formula, whenever a certain condition on the Zak transform of the scaling function is satisfied. In this paper it is proved that a natural condition, which involves again the Zak transform of the scaling function, allow us to recover any function in V-0 from its samples at the sequences {a+2n}(n is an element of z) and {b+2n}(n is an element of z) by using an appropriate sampling expansion.", "paper_title": "Regular sampling in wavelet subspaces involving two sequences of sampling points", "paper_id": "WOS:000244874800001"}
