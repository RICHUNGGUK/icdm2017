The method yields tighter wavelet-domain bounds of the system matrix, thus leading to improved convergence speeds. It is directly applicable to non-redundant wavelet bases, and we also adapt it for cases of redundant frames. It turns out that the simplest and most intuitive setting for the step sizes that ignores subband aliasing is often satisfactory in practice. We show that our methods can be used to advantage with reweighted least squares penalty functions as well as L1 penalties. We emphasize that the algorithms presented here are suitable for performing inverse filtering on very large datasets, including 3D data, since inversions are applied only to diagonal matrices and fast transforms are used to achieve all matrix-vector products.", "paper_title": "Improved Bounds for Subband-Adaptive Iterative Shrinkage/Thresholding Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000318016600010"}
