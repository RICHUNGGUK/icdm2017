In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for minimizing parallel to AXB - C parallel to where parallel to.parallel to is the Frobenius norm, A is an element of R(mxn), B is an element of R(nxs), C is an element of R(mxs) and X is an element of R(nxn) is mirrorsymmetric with a specified central submatrix [x(ij)](r <= i, j <= n-r). Our algorithm produces a suitable X such that AX B = C in finitely many steps, if such an X exists. We show that the algorithm is stable any case, and we give results of numerical experiments that support this claim.", "paper_title": "Numerical solutions of AXB = C for mirrorsymmetric matrix X under a specified submatrix constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000281844100003"}
