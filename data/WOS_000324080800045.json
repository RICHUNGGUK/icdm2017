As part of a 25-week program, student volunteers were randomly assigned to either a teacher-led classroom or a classroom in which students interacted with ALEKS while teachers were present. Student's math performance, conduct, involvement, and assistance was needed to complete tasks were investigated to determine overall impact of the two programs. Students assigned to the ALEKS classrooms performed at the same level as students taught by expert teachers on the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP), which is given annually to all Tennessee students. Furthermore, student's conduct and involvement remained at the same levels in both conditions. However, students in the ALEKS after-school classrooms required significantly less assistance in mathematics from teachers to complete their daily work. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
