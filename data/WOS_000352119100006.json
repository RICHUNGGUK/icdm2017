These typical non-Gaussian statistics are commonly described by generalized Gaussian density (GGD) or alpha-stable distribution. However, each of the two models has its own deficiency to capture the variety and complexity of real world scenes. Considering the statistical properties of GGD and alpha-stable distributions respectively, in this paper we propose a hybrid statistical model of natural image's wavelet coefficients which is better in describing the leptokurtosis and heavy tails simultaneously. Based on a clever fusion of GGD and alpha-stable functions, we establish the optimal parametric hybrid model, and a close-formed Kullback-Leibler divergence of the hybrid model is derived for evaluating model accuracy. Experiment results and comparative studies demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model is closer to the true distribution of natural image's wavelet coefficients than the single modeling using GGD or alpha-stable, while is beneficial for applications such as image comparison.
