In this paper, we employ this property to construct a new multiscale decomposition method, by which an image can be decomposed into a sequence of detail images and a base image, and the initial image can be perfectly reconstructed by adding up these decomposed images. This decomposition method is applied to multisensor image fusion. The source images are first decomposed into the detail images and the base image. Then, these images are combined according to the given fusion rules. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed by adding up the fused detail images and base image. Compared with conventional methods based on multiscale decomposition, experimental results over multifocus images, visible and infrared images, and medical images demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of visual inspection and objective measures.", "paper_title": "P-M equation based multiscale decomposition and its application to image fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000330839400013"}
