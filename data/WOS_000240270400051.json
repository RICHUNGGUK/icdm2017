Specifically, in this paper we have proved that the Mean-Value Theorem can play an important role to improve Question Answering. We have studied the way in which this theorem can be applied in order to produce a maximum data reduction without precision loss. In the experiments, we achieve a 90% data reduction without significant data loss.", "paper_title": "Passage filtering for open-domain Question Answering", "paper_id": "WOS:000240270400051"}
