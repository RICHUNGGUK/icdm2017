The problem of service discovery has attracted great research interest in the last years, particularly for ad hoc networks. Recently, the IETF has proposed the use of the DNS protocol for service discovery. For ad hoc networks, the IETF works in two proposals of distributed DNS, Multicast DNS and LLMNR, that can both be used for service discovery. In this paper we describe and compare through simulation the performance of service discovery based in these two proposals of distributed DNS. We also propose four simple improvements that reduce the traffic generated, and so the power consumption, especially of the most limited, battery powered, devices. We present simulation results that show the impact of our improvements in a typical scenario.", "paper_title": "DNS-Based service discovery in ad hoc networks: Evaluation and improvements", "paper_id": "WOS:000241592200010"}
