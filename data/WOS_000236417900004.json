Without restrictions on the initial data we proved local solutions in t. The present paper is dedicated to study a unilateral problem for Lit with no restriction on the initial configuration u(0) and the initial velocity u(1) has a bounded gradient. We succeed to prove that the solution of the unilateral problem has a solution for all t epsilon [0,T], T a positive arbitrary number.", "paper_title": "Vibrations of elastic strings: Unilateral problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000236417900004"}
