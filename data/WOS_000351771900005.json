However, achieving CEAI properties such as multitenancy, cloud-level scalability, and environmental heterogeneity is nontrivial for enterprise applications originally built under the assumption of centralized management. A concrete implementation of the cloud service bus approach, called JTangCSB, addresses the challenge of handling these properties and demonstrates its feasibility in practice.", "paper_title": "JTangCSB A Cloud Service Bus for Cloud and Enterprise Application Integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000351771900005"}
