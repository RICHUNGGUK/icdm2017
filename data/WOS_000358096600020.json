Any framework developed for evaluating the resilience of steel structures in a multi-hazard context should incorporate tools that are capable of probabilistic structural analyses under fire and seismic loads. With a newly added thermal module, the OpenSees software has the capacity to perform structural analysis for the effects of cascading seismic and fire events. This paper presents modifications to the current source code that enable post-earthquake fire analysis for steel structures, and the enhancement to adapt reliability analysis in the thermal module.
