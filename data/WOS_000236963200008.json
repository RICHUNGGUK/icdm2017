Although SDG models are efficient in simulating the plant, they have some weaknesses, which are discussed here in relation to typical process industry examples. Ways to tackle these problems are suggested, and the view is taken that a state-based formalism is needed, to take account of the discrete components in the system, their connection together, and their behaviour over time. A strong representation for operations and actions is also needed, to make the models appropriate for modelling batch processes. A research prototype for HAZOP studies on batch plants (CHECKOP) is also presented, as an illustration of the suggested approach to modelling.", "paper_title": "State-based modelling in hazard identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000236963200008"}
