In recent years, the DNA sequences design has been one of the most practical and important research topics in DNA computing. However, DNA sequences design should simultaneously satisfy various combinational and thermodynamic constraints, which has been proved to be NP-hard problem. In the paper, a dynamic membrane evolutionary algorithm (DMEA) is proposed to solve the DNA sequences design. The method combines the fusion and division rules of P systems with active membranes and ADE/PSO search strategy. The results of simulation experiments show that the proposed algorithm is valid and outperforms other evolutionary algorithms.", "paper_title": "A Dynamic Membrane Evolutionary Algorithm for Solving DNA Sequences Design with Minimum Free Energy", "paper_id": "WOS:000328719100015"}
