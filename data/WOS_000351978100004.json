Optimal performance can be obtained when the distance metric is matched to the characteristics of data. Existing works on distance-metric learning typically learn a global linear transform from training samples, and the effectiveness is limited to data, which are well-separated by linear decision boundaries. To address this problem, we propose a locally adaptive weighted distance-metric learning method to deal with the non-linearity of the data. The metric are learned based on local leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) risks in each dimension, so that the local variations in feature component discriminability are taken into account. Experiments on both public datasets and hyper-spectral imagery classification demonstrate that the classification accuracy of the proposed method shows about 2-10% improvements over other competitive methods.
