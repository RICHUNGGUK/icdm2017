Our evolution PDE consists of an adaptive force which is derived from the L-2 gradient of the fidelity term of the Chan-Vese functional, and a regularized force which is the Sobolev gradient of the contour length. For a two-phase piecewise constant image, we prove that the adaptive force has exactly opposite sign in the interior and exterior of objects, and the zero-level set of the evolution function can match with the boundary between objects and background in a single iteration if the initial function is suitably chosen as a sign-changing and bounded function. The proposed model has the advantages of flexible initialization and very fast segmentation process (so re-initialization is not necessary). The proposed model has been applied to both synthetic and real images with promising results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
