Unfortunately, existing methods for energy metering in multicores fail to provide accurate energy estimates for each task when several tasks run simultaneously. This article makes a case for accurate Per-Task Energy Metering (PTEM) based on tracking the resource utilization and occupancy of each task. Different hardware implementations with different trade-offs between energy prediction accuracy and hardware-implementation complexity are proposed. Our evaluation shows that the energy consumed in a multicore by each task can be accurately measured. For a 32-core, 2-way, simultaneous multithreaded core setup, PTEM reduces the average accuracy error from more than 12% when our hardware support is not used to less than 4% when it is used. The maximum observed error for any task in the workload we used reduces from 58% down to 9% when our hardware support is used.", "paper_title": "Hardware Support for Accurate Per-Task Energy Metering in Multicore Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000330509300013"}
