The system, the Joint search with ImaGe, Speech, And Word Plus (JIGSAW), takes full advantage of the multimodal input and natural user interactions of mobile devices. It is designed for users who already have pictures in their minds but have no precise descriptions or names to address them. By describing it using speech and then refining the recognized query by interactively composing a visual query using exemplary images, the user can easily find the desired images through a few natural multimodal interactions with his/her mobile device. Compared with our previous work JIGSAW, the algorithm has been significantly improved in three aspects: 1) segmentation-based image representation is adopted to remove the artificial block partitions; 2) relative position checking replaces the fixed position penalty; and 3) inverted index is constructed instead of brute force matching. The proposed JIGSAW + is able to achieve 5% gain in terms of search performance and is ten times faster.", "paper_title": "Interactive Multimodal Visual Search on Mobile Device", "paper_id": "WOS:000316410900011"}
