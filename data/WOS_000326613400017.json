After introducing the virtualization layer, there exist two schedulers: One in the hypervisor and the other inside the Guest Operating System (GOS). To fully understand the virtualized system and identify the possible reasons for performance problems incurred by the virtualization technology, it is very important for the system administrators and engineers to know the scheduling behavior of the hypervisor, in addition to understanding the scheduler inside the GOS. In this paper, we develop a virtualization scheduling analyzer, called VSA, to analyze the trace data of the Xen virtual machine monitor. With VSA, one can easily obtain the scheduling data associated with virtual processors (i.e., VCPUs) and physical processors (i.e., PCPUs), and further conduct the scheduling analysis for a group of interacting VCPUs running in the same domain.
