In a first step, the unsteady flow field is computed via a large-eddy simulation (LES) and in a second step, the acoustic field is determined by solving the acoustic perturbation equations (APE). The mean flow field is compared to experimental findings followed by an investigation of the turbulent structures which are visualized by lambda(2) contours. The analysis of the acoustic field shows that at the main wing trailing edge acoustic pressure fluctuations of approximately 5 kHz are generated. Correlations between the noise sources and the acoustic pressure identify the slat-gap region to be responsible for the mixture of broadband and tonal noise between 1 and 3 kHz. The decay of the pressure spectrum is found to be approximately f(-2) which is in agreement with the literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
