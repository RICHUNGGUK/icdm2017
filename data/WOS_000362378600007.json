By making a number of observations regarding the tag reading performance, we build a model to depict how various parameters affect the reading performance. Through our model, we have designed very efficient algorithms to maximize the time-efficiency and energy-efficiency by adjusting the reader's power and moving speed. Our experiments show that our algorithms can reduce the total scanning time by 50 percent and the total energy consumption by 83 percent compared to the prior solutions.", "paper_title": "Exploring the Gap between Ideal and Reality: An Experimental Study on Continuous Scanning with Mobile Reader in RFID Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000362378600007"}
