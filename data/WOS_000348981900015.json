All properties have been obtained using the B3LYP functional and 6-31++G(d, p) basis set. The planar structures have been obtained for all optimized trans configurations. The energy difference between trans and cis configurations for considered derivatives was found to be between 64.2-73.1 kJ/mole. It has been obtained that the p-aminodiazo-benzene (ADAB) has the difference in the dipole moments between trans and cis forms higher than for trans and cis azobenzene.", "paper_title": "Density functional theory calculations on azobenzene derivatives: a comparative study of functional group effect", "paper_id": "WOS:000348981900015"}
