The Spiral Rule automaton is a hexagonal ternary-state two-dimensional cellular automaton - a finite-state machine imitation of an activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion system. The activator is self-inhibited in certain concentrations. The inhibitor dissociates in the absence of the activator. The Spiral Rule cellular automaton has rich spatio-temporal dynamics of traveling (glider) and stationary (eater) patterns. When a glider brushes an eater the eater may slightly change its configuration, which is updated once more every next hit. We encode binary strings in the states of eaters and sequences of gliders. We study what types of binary compositions of binary strings are implementable by sequences of gliders brushing an eater. The models developed will be used in future laboratory designs of reaction-diffusion chemical computers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
