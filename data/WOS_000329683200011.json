In such knowledge bases a common structure of the stored information is crucial for providing efficient and precise search facilities. However, the task of refining, extending and homogenizing knowledge and its structure is very complex. In this article we present two paradigms for the simplification of this task by providing guidance mechanisms to the user. Both paradigms aim at combining the power of automated extraction algorithms with the semantic awareness of human users to accomplish this refinement task. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
