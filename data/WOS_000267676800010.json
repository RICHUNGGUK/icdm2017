Generally, the exact computation of the efficient frontier is intractable and there may exist an exponential number of extreme non-dominated objective vectors. Hence, it is better to employ an approximate method to compute solutions within reasonable time. Therefore, we propose a hybrid meta heuristic algorithm (memetic algorithm hybridized with simulated annealing MAISA) to develop an efficient approach for solving this problem. In order to show the efficiency of the proposed MA/SA some problems have been generated and solved by both the MA/SA and an exact method. it is perceived from this evaluation that the proposed MA/SA outputs are very close to the exact solutions. It is shown that when the number of arcs and nodes exceed 30 (large problems) the MA/SA model will be more preferred because of its strongly shorter computational time in comparison with exact methods.
