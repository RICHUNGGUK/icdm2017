A combined sf-mode as, for example, (sf Lambda <= k) restricts the valid derivations such that both properties have to be satisfied. If erasing rules are allowed, then except for the (sf Lambda <= 1)-, (sf Lambda = 1)-, and (sf Lambda t)-modes, it is shown that the family of recursively enumerable languages is characterized. The former two exceptions characterize the family of linear context-free languages, while the latter mode describes the family of context-free languages. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
