The algorithm can generate two types of descriptors, one which is compliant with the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules, including complex stereochemistry structures such as fullerenes, and a computationally efficient one based on our previous definition of a directed acyclic graph that is augmented to a chiral molecular graph. The performance of the algorithm in terms of speed as a canonicalizer as well as in modeling and predicting bioactivity is evaluated, showing an overall better performance than other molecular descriptors, which is particularly relevant in modeling stereoselective biochemical reactions.
