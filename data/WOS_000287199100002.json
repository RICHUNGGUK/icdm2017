The situation is less clear if there is no bound on the arities. In this case the answer depends also on how the constraints are represented in the input. We study this question for the truth table representation of constraints. We introduce a new hypergraph measure adaptive width and show that CSP with truth tables is polynomial-time solvable if restricted to a class of hypergraphs with bounded adaptive width. Conversely, assuming a conjecture on the complexity of binary CSP, there is no other polynomial-time solvable case. Finally, we present a class of hypergraphs with bounded adaptive width and unbounded fractional hypertree width.", "paper_title": "Tractable Structures for Constraint Satisfaction with Truth Tables", "paper_id": "WOS:000287199100002"}
