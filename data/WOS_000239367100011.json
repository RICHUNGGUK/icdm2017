Our goal in this paper is to develop the first placement algorithm for large-scale floating-gate-based FPAAs with a focus on the minimization of the parasitic effects on interconnects under various device-related constraints. Our FPAA clustering algorithm first groups analog components into a set of clusters so that the total number of routing switches used is minimized and all IO paths are balanced in terms of routing switches used. Our FPAA placement algorithm then maps each cluster to a computational analog block (CAB) of the target FPAA while focusing on routing switch usage and balance again. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Placement for large-scale floating-gate field-programable analog arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000239367100011"}
