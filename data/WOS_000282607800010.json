In order to simplify the control of EV, a new system is proposed by Guilin Tao, which changes the traditional configuration and control strategy of direct-wheel-driven EV. In this system two permanent-magnet-brushless dc motors (PMBDCMs) are connected directly in serial, in order to cut down the differential algorithm thoroughly in velocity control strategy. This structure can realize the differential automatically when the EV runs on the smooth road at low speed. But this structure considers the characters of the motor only, which is an ideal system. EV is a complex electromechanical system, and its work condition is also complex. The variation of the external condition and the work condition of operation can affect the operation of motor, so the state of the EV will change. In this paper, according to the change of the work condition and road condition, combined with the dynamics of EV, this problem was well studied. The neural network PID control mode was used in this paper, and by means of the Matlab/Simulink and the experimental verification, it reveals that this method can enhance the safety and stability of this system.
