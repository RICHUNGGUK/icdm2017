By using critical point theory, some criteria are obtained to guarantee that the impulsive problem has at least one solution, two solutions and infinitely many solutions when the parameter lies in different intervals. The results obtained are also valid and new for a problem discussed in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
