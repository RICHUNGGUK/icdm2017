Our method is based on a nonasymptotic variational characterization of f-divergences, which allows the problem of estimating divergences to be tackled via convex empirical risk optimization. The resulting estimators are simple to implement, requiring only the solution of standard convex programs. We present an analysis of consistency and convergence for these estimators. Given conditions only on the ratios of densities, we show that our estimators can achieve optimal minimax rates for the likelihood ratio and the divergence functionals in certain regimes. We derive an efficient optimization algorithm for computing our estimates, and illustrate their convergence behavior and practical viability by simulations.", "paper_title": "Estimating Divergence Functionals and the Likelihood Ratio by Convex Risk Minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000283449000036"}
