In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), virtual backbones can also play a critical role, and would increase the efficiency of routing and data transport. However, the virtual backbone construction for CRNs is more challenging than for traditional wireless networks due to opportunistic spectrum access. Moreover, when no common control channel is available to exchange the control information, this problem is even more difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for constructing virtual backbones in CRNs, without relying on a common control channel. Our approach first utilizes the geographical information to let the nodes of a CRN self-organize into cells. Next, the nodes in each cell form into clusters, and a virtual backbone is established over the cluster heads. The virtual backbone is then applied to carry out the end-to-end data transmission. The proposed virtual backbone construction approach requires only limited exchange of control messages. It is efficient and highly adaptable under the opportunistic spectrum access. We analyze the capacity between an active node and a passive node in a single area. Our approach is testified through evaluation of the cost, and also through comparison with other models.", "paper_title": "Efficient Virtual Backbone Construction without a Common Control Channel in Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000347015800011"}
