Because of advantages of the contourlet transform in dealing with the two or higher dimensions singularity or the image salient features, such as line, curve, edge and etc., each of the accurately registered images is decomposed into a low frequency subband image and a sets of high frequency subband images with various multiscale, multidirectional local salient features. By using different fusion rules for the low frequency subband image and high frequency subband images, respectively, the fused coefficients are obtained. Then, the fused image is generated by the inverse contourlet transform. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional wavelet packet transform based image fusion method.", "paper_title": "A contourlet transform based fusion algorithm for nighttime driving image", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000057"}
