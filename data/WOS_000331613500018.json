Currently, the major challenges in activity recognition include the reliability of prediction of each classifier as they differ according to smart homes characteristics. Smart homes indicate variation in terms of performed activities, deployed sensors, environment settings, and inhabitants' characteristics. It is not possible that one classifier always performs better than all the other classifiers for every possible situation. This observation has motivated towards combining multiple classifiers to take advantage of their complementary performance for high accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, a method for activity recognition is proposed by optimizing the output of multiple classifiers with Genetic Algorithm (GA). Our proposed method combines the measurement level output of different classifiers for each activity class to make up the ensemble. For the evaluation of the proposed method, experiments are performed on three real datasets from CASAS smart home. The results show that our method systematically outperforms single classifier and traditional multiclass models. The significant improvement is achieved from 0.82 to 0.90 in the F-measures of recognized activities as compare to existing methods.", "paper_title": "A Genetic Algorithm-based Classifier Ensemble Optimization for Activity Recognition in Smart Homes", "paper_id": "WOS:000331613500018"}
