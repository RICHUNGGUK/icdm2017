The algorithm uses source routing based on the functionalities provided by the Cognitive Packet Network (CPN), running autonomously at each input node the network based on smart packets which gather relevant information throughout network using reinforcement learning at each of the intermediate nodes. Measurements on an experimental test-bed that uses EARP are presented and they indicate that it offer reduction in power consumption, as compared to a purely QoS driven approach, and a respects the requested QoS level.
