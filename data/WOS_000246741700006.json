Control theory provides a theoretical foundation for self-adaptive software. In this paper, we propose the use of the supervisory control theory of discrete event dynamic systems (DEDS) to provide a rigorous foundation for designing software for reactive systems. This paper focuses in particular on design of software with an attractivity requirement. It studies this problem using the polynomial dynamic system (PDS) model of DEDS. A necessary and sufficient condition for software existence and two algorithms for such software design are presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
