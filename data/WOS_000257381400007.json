The aim of our work is to define media objects for document description suited to images and videos, integrating a user-centered definition of importance for similarity matching. The importance is defined according to criteria and hypotheses, which have been experimentally validated. This leads to a definition of a weighting scheme for media objects (based on objects size, position, and scene homogeneity), which has also been validated with users in a second experiment. This model allows for meaningful similarity matching between document pairs and between users' queries and documents.", "paper_title": "Media objects for user-centered similarity matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000257381400007"}
