A number of feature extraction methods have been proposed to extract linear and nonlinear, and time and frequency features of wrist pulse signal. These features are heterogeneous in nature and are likely to contain complementary information, which highlights the need for the integration of heterogeneous features for pulse classification and diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel effective method to classify the wrist pulse blood flow signals by using the multiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithm to combine multiple types of features. In the proposed method, seven types of features are first extracted from the wrist pulse blood flow signals using the state-of-the-art pulse feature extraction methods, and are then fed to an efficient MKL method, SimpleMKL, to combine heterogeneous features for more effective classification. Experimental results show that the proposed method is promising in integrating multiple types of pulse features to further enhance the classification performance.", "paper_title": "Combination of Heterogeneous Features for Wrist Pulse Blood Flow Signal Diagnosis via Multiple Kernel Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000305979500009"}
