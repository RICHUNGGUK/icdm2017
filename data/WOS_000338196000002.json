We propose a simple modification to the original system that enforces the tree constraint without requiring any modification to the parser training procedure. Experiments on multiple languages show that the method on average achieves 72% of the error reduction possible and consistently outperforms the standard heuristic in current use.", "paper_title": "Arc-Eager Parsing with the Tree Constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000338196000002"}
