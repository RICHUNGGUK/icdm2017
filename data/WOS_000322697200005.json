In the homeostatic adaptation model, higher-level dynamics internally self-organized from sensorimotor dynamics are associated with desired behaviors. These dynamics are regenerated when drastic changes occur, which might break the internal dynamics. Due to the weak link between desired behavior and internal homeostasis in the original homeostatic adaptation model, adaptivity is limited. In this paper, we improve on the homeostatic adaptation model to create a stronger link between desired behavior and internal homeostasis by introducing a metabolic causation in a plasticity mechanism and show that it becomes more adaptive. Our results show that our model has three different time scales in the adaptive behaviors, which are discussed with our cognition and mental imagery.", "paper_title": "Extended homeostatic adaptation model with metabolic causation in plasticity mechanismtoward constructing a dynamic neural network model for mental imagery", "paper_id": "WOS:000322697200005"}
