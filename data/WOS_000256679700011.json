This fundamentally limits the scale of recovered geometry to the resolution of the input image and does not adequately model surfaces with subpixel geometric structures. In this paper, we propose a method for recovering the subpixel surface geometry by studying the relationship between the subpixel geometry and the reflectance properties of a surface. We first describe a generalized physically based reflectance model that relates the distribution of surface normals inside each pixel area to its reflectance function. The distribution of surface normals can be computed from the reflectance functions recorded in photometric stereo images. A convexity measure of the subpixel geometric structure is also recovered at each pixel through an analysis of brightness attenuation due to shadowing. Then, we use the recovered distribution of surface normals and the surface convexity to infer subpixel geometric structures on a surface of homogeneous material by spatially arranging the normals among pixels at a higher resolution than that of the input image. We optimize the arrangement of normals by using a combination of belief propagation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based on a minimum-description-length criterion on 3D textons over the surface. Experiments demonstrate the validity of our approach and show superior geometric resolution for the recovered surfaces.", "paper_title": "Subpixel photometric stereo", "paper_id": "WOS:000256679700011"}
