This coefficient measures the reliability of a questionnaire's answers. Many analytical tests have been developed over the years which gave birth to very complicated formulas [2,4,6-9]. A simulation approach to the solution of this problem takes advantage of the computational power in order to give exact results for the distribution of the null hypothesis regarding this coefficient.
