Since JIT modeling derives a local model from past samples similar to a query sample, it is crucial to appropriately define the similarity between samples. In this work, a new similarity measure based on the weighted Euclidean distance is proposed in order to cope with nonlinearity and to enhance estimation accuracy of LW-PLS. The proposed method can adaptively determine the similarity according to the strength of the nonlinearity between each input variable and an output variable around a query sample. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical examples and a case study of a real cracked gasoline fractionator of an ethylene production process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
