The system uses the fixed-queue-ratio-with-thresholds (FQR-T) control, which we proposed as a way for one service system to help another in face of an unexpected overload. Under FQR-T, customers are served by their own service pool until a threshold is exceeded. Then, one-way sharing is activated with customers from one class allowed to be served in both pools. The control aims to keep the two queues at a pre-specified fixed ratio. We supported the fluid approximation by establishing a functional weak law of large numbers involving a stochastic averaging principle. In this paper we develop a refined diffusion approximation for the same model based on a many-server heavy-traffic functional central limit theorem.", "paper_title": "Diffusion approximation for an overloaded X model via a stochastic averaging principle", "paper_id": "WOS:000333344000002"}
