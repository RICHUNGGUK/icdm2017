Though it was initially intended as a set of challenges to be tackled as a game, the users experimented with the system far beyond this and discovered several novel forms of self-replicators. When searching for a system with certain properties such as self-replication, making the system accessible to the public through a Web site is an unusual but effective way of making scientific discoveries, credit for which must go to the users themselves for their tireless experimentation and innovation.", "paper_title": "The Organic Builder: A Public Experiment in Artificial Chemistries and Self-Replication", "paper_id": "WOS:000262417700003"}
