We prove that in the presence of a finite alphabet with at least two actions, the (in)equational theory of BCCSP modulo simulation preorder or equivalence does not have a finite basis. In contrast, in the presence of an alphabet that is infinite or a singleton, the equational theory for simulation equivalence does have a finite basis.", "paper_title": "On finite alphabets and infinite bases III: Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240256100028"}
