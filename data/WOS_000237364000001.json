The lower wall is flat and the upper wall is sinusoidally modulated. The modulation amplitude is assumed to be small. Thus, a regular perturbation expansion of the flow field coupled to a variable-step finite-difference scheme is used to solve the problem. Convergence and accuracy assessment against earlier experimental results indicate that there is a significant range of validity of the perturbation approach. The influences of wall geometry, inertia and viscoelasticity oil the flow kinematics and stresses are investigated systematically. In particular, the interplay between the flow and fluid parameters effects oil the conditions for the onset of backflow, number of vortices, their size and location is revealed. The distance between the flow separation and reattachment locations identifies the vortex size. Non-monotonic dependence of the vortex size oil elasticity is reported. The critical conditions for the onset of negative elasticity effects on vortex size are identified. The critical Reynolds number for the onset of backflow initially decreases then levels off or even increases as elasticity increases. For highly elastic fluid and large enough Reynolds number, more than one vortex appear near the lower wall.
