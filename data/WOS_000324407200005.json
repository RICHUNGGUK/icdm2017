In this approach, the two lowest levels of each Lambda-type flux qubit serve as the logical states and a higher-energy intermediate level is used as the gate manipulation. This proposal does not require equal device parameters for the two flux qubits that is extremely difficult to achieve experimentally. In addition, neither a second-order detuning nor auxiliary qubits are required in this scheme. Moreover, there is no need to change the Rabi frequencies to satisfy the adiabatic passage. Therefore, the operation time can be shortened to 20-30 ns, which is faster by one order of magnitude compared to the schemes employing the second-order detuning technique.", "paper_title": "REALIZATION OF FAST QUANTUM INFORMATION TRANSFER AND ENTANGLEMENT WITH SUPERCONDUCTING FLUX QUBITS COUPLED TO A RESONATOR", "paper_id": "WOS:000324407200005"}
