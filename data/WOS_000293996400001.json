With the help of computer algebra system MATHEMATICA. the first 13 quasi-Lyapunov constants are deduced. As a result, sufficient and necessary conditions in order to have a center are obtained. The result that there exist 13 small amplitude limit cycles created from the three order nilpotent critical point is also proved. Henceforth we give a lower hound of cyclicity of three-order nilpotent critical point for septic Lyapunov systems. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
