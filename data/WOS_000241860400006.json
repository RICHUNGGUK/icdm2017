These applications support the modeling, execution, and monitoring of B2B interactions, as well as the management and publishing of content data, value-added services, and so on. The integration of these different technologies raises new problems that may occur during the process execution on the Web. Exceptional situations may be caused by the improper user navigation through Web pages, by system failures that interrupt the B2B interaction, or by events semantically related to the business process. We present a classification of exceptions, the capturing and notification mechanisms, and the recovery policies that may be applied on the business process in order to solve the exception. We also show how the proposed approach can be applied to WebML, a high-level modeling language for Web applications, and compare it with existing standards.", "paper_title": "Exception management within Web applications implementing business processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241860400006"}
