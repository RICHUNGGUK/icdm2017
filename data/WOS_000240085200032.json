Consistent data is the data common for every possible repair. In this paper, first we give a general constraint model for XML, which can express functional dependencies, keys and multivalued dependencies. Next we provide a repair framework for inconsistent XML document with three basic update operations: node insertion, node deletion and value modification. Following this approach, we introduce the concept of repair for inconsistent XML document, discuss the chase process to generate repairs, and prove some important properties of the chase process. Finally we give a method to obtain the greatest lower bound of all possible repairs, which is sufficient for consistent data.", "paper_title": "Repairing inconsistent XML documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085200032"}
