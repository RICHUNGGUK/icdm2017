Given a Kripkean view on the semantics of SDL in terms of directed graphs where arrows -> represent the accessibility relation between worlds, reactive models add two elements: arrows -> are labelled as 'active' or 'inactive', and double arrows a dagger connect arrows, e.g. (x(1) -> x(2)) a dagger (x(3) -> x(4)). The idea is that passing through x(1) -> x(2) activates a switch represented by a dagger that inverts the label of x(3) -> x(4) and hence activates respectively deactivates this arrow. This allows to introduce two modalities: a- is the usual KD-modality of SDL and operates on the Kripkean graph where all labels and double arrows are ignored, while <remove> takes them into account. We demonstrate that RSDL1 allows for an intuitive interpretation of 'ought'. The logic can handle contrary-to-duty cases such as several instantiations of the Chisholm set in a paradox-free way by means of using double arrows and annotations to block and give access to ideal worlds.", "paper_title": "Reactive standard deontic logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000350247700004"}
