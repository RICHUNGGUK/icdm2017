The principle of this exploration relies on the reconstruction of ancestral genomes at each internal node of a gene-order-based phylogenetic tree. This tool allows the selection of internal nodes to visualize the rearrangements between the inferred chromosome of this node and its direct descendant on the tree.", "paper_title": "Phylogenetic exploration of bacterial genomic rearrangements", "paper_id": "WOS:000246773300021"}
