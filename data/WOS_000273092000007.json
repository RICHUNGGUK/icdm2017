In this paper, we investigate the interaction between the inter-die and intra-die variations on SRAM read and write failures. To improve the robustness of the SRAM cell, we propose a closed-loop compensation scheme using on-chip monitors that directly sense the global read stability and writability of the cell. Simulations based on 45-nm partially depleted silicon-on-insulator technology demonstrate the viability and the effectiveness of the scheme in SRAM yield enhancement.", "paper_title": "Self-Repairing SRAM Using On-Chip Detection and Compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000273092000007"}
