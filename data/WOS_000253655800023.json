Its resulting adder architecture is simple and applicable for all n values. Based on 180-nm CMOS technology, the HCS-based modulo 2(n)-1 adder demonstrates its superiority in Area-Time (AT) performance over existing solutions.", "paper_title": "Area-time efficient modulo 2(n)-1 adder design using hybrid carry selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000253655800023"}
