By modifying a simple matching dissimilarity measure for categorical objects, a heuristic approach was developed in [4], [12] which allows the use of the k- modes paradigm to obtain a cluster with strong intrasimilarity and to efficiently cluster large categorical data sets. The main aim of this paper is to rigorously derive the updating formula of the k- modes clustering algorithm with the new dissimilarity measure and the convergence of the algorithm under the optimization framework.", "paper_title": "On the impact of dissimilarity measure in k-modes clustering algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000243420500012"}
