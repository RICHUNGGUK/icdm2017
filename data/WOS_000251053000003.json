Instead, an open set of structure servers - each one providing abstractions and semantics relevant to a specific data-organization domain - are employed by an open set of client applications. Nonetheless, the lack of an engineering framework guiding the development and deployment process of structure servers has a part in their limited exploitation. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of structure servers from an engineering approach, and we propose a software methodology and a set of potential tools in order to direct their development. In addition, we present how this methodology is supported by the Callimachus CB-OHS, emphasizing on the tools enabling rapid prototyping of new structure servers.", "paper_title": "An engineering perspective on structural computing: Developing structure services for the web", "paper_id": "WOS:000251053000003"}
