These devices can also behave as logic circuits. In this paper, the IMPLY logic gate, a memristor-based logic circuit, is described. In this memristive logic family, each memristor is used as an input, output, computational logic element, and latch in different stages of the computing process. The logical state is determined by the resistance of the memristor. This logic family can be integrated within a memristor-based crossbar, commonly used for memory. In this paper, a methodology for designing this logic family is proposed. The design methodology is based on a general design flow, suitable for all deterministic memristive logic families, and includes some additional design constraints to support the IMPLY logic family. An IMPLY 8-bit full adder based on this design methodology is presented as a case study.", "paper_title": "Memristor-Based Material Implication (IMPLY) Logic: Design Principles and Methodologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000343014100002"}
