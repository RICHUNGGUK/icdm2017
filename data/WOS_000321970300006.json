In this paper, we propose SAFE, a source deduplication framework for efficient cloud backup and restore operations. SAFE consists of three salient features, (1) Hybrid Deduplication, combining the global file-level and local chunk-level deduplication to achieve an optimal tradeoff between the deduplication efficiency and overhead to achieve a short backup time; (2) Semantic-aware Elimination, exploiting file semantics to narrow the search space for the redundant data in hybrid deduplication process to reduce the deduplication overhead; and (3) Unmodified Data Removal, removing the files and data chunks that are kept intact from data transmission for some restore operations. Through extensive experiments driven by real-world datasets, the SAFE framework is shown to maintain a much higher deduplication efficiency/overhead ratio than existing solutions, shortening the backup time by an average of 38.7 %, and reduce the restore time by a ratio of up to 9.7 : 1.", "paper_title": "SAFE: A Source Deduplication Framework for Efficient Cloud Backup Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000321970300006"}
