The dynamic response to three different loading conditions is analysed through a non-dimensional approach, which permits the identification of the essential non-dimensional parameters governing the dynamic behaviour. Two simplified procedures are then proposed, founded on the sound definition of two coefficients, the Equivalent Amplification Factor and the Equivalent Synchronization Factor, which allow the evaluation of the vibration serviceability without requiring numerical analyses. Final applications confirm the efficiency of the proposed methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
