This artefact is called '' back-to-front interference '', '' bleeding '' or '' showthrough ''. The direct binarization of documents with such interference yields unreadable documents. The literature presents several algorithms for suitably removing such artefact. This paper presents a quantitative method to assess algorithms to remove back-to-front interference.", "paper_title": "Detailing a quantitative method for assessing algorithms to remove back-to-front interference in documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000254398800008"}
