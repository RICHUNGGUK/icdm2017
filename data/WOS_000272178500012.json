This techniques has been implemented in order to economically and accurately compute outputs and their gradients, as they are calculated several times due to the changes of the parameters in an optimization process. The tools developed here are combined with mathematical programming algorithms and multiobjective strategies to form a robust and reliable optimization procedure to achieve better performance on structural designs. Some simple academic applications have been considered for the validation of all proposed methodologies. Further studies will addressed more complex problems.", "paper_title": "Structural analysis and optimization in the framework of reduced-basis method", "paper_id": "WOS:000272178500012"}
