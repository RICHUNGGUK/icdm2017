Beside finding mathematical models for the walking process, suitable mechanical designs and control methods must be found. This paper presents concepts for the latter two points. As biological walking makes use of the elastic properties of e.g. tendons and muscles, a joint design using a pneumatic rotational spring with adjustable stiffness is proposed. Equations to model the spring's dynamics as well as the supporting sensor systems and electronics are presented. For controlling the robot a behaviour-based approach is suggested.", "paper_title": "Actuation system and control concept for a running biped", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137700010"}
