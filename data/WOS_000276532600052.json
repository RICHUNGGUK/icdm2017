Because the existing method to construct concept maps only considers the association rules that questions are not correctly answered, it will miss some information about questions that are correctly answered by the learners. Moreover, the existing method also has the drawback that it will build unnecessary relationships or lose some relationships between concepts in the constructed concept maps. In this paper, we present a new method to automatically construct concept maps based on data mining techniques for adaptive learning systems. The proposed method can overcome the drawbacks of the existing method. It provides us a useful way to automatically construct concept maps in adaptive learning systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
