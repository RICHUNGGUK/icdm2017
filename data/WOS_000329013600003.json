The algebraic structure emerged thereby is studied. A comparison with classical rough sets with respect to the algebraic properties has been made. A many-valued propositional logic for such entities is proposed. Representation theorems in the style of Obtulowicz have been established. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
