The goal of an abduction problem is to find a 'solution', i.e., an explanation for some observed symptoms. Usually, many solutions exist, and one is often interested in minimal ones only. Previous definitions of 'solutions' to an abduction problem tacitly made an open-world assumption. However, as far as minimality is concerned, this assumption may not always lead to the desired behaviour. To overcome this problem, we propose a new definition of solutions based on a closed-world approach. Moreover, we also introduce a new variant of minimality where only a part of the hypotheses is subject to minimization. Athorough complexity analysis reveals the close relationship between these two new notions as well as the differences compared with previous notions of solutions.", "paper_title": "The complexity of handling minimal solutions in logic-based abduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000355952200013"}
