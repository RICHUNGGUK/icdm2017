A knowledge approach to incrementally model expert design processes is implemented. The knowledge is acquired in the context of its use, which substantially supports the KA process. The knowledge is captured which human designers utilize in order to specify dimensional tolerances on shafts and mating holes in order to meet desired classes of fit as set by relevant engineering standards in order to demonstrate the presented approach. The developed dimensional tolerancing knowledge management system would help mechanical designers become more effective in the time-consuming tolerancing process of their designs in the future.
