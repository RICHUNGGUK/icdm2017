Further insight can be gained through the use of these tools by encouraging the exploration of the design space. Visualization is one technique which makes it easier for an engineer to understand the designs identified by an optimization tool. There are many visualization techniques but most are for individual process designs or for understanding the behavior a design space when a single design objective is considered. Most design problems, however, are multi-objective. This paper presents a multi-objective visualization method and applies it to the industrially relevant design of pressure swing adsorption systems.
