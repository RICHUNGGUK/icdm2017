We compare the results of fusing three groups of features, three spatial scales, and four different mutual information measures to select features. We also showed improved results by fusion of LBP features with different radii and spatial scales, and the selection of features using mutual information. As measures of mutual information we use minimum redundancy and maximal relevance (mRMR), normalized mutual information feature selection (NMIFS), conditional mutual information feature selection (CMIFS), and conditional mutual information maximization (CMIM). We tested the results on four databases: FERET and UND, under controlled conditions, the LFW database under unconstrained scenarios, and AR for occlusions. It is shown that selection of features together with fusion of LBP features significantly improved gender classification accuracy compared to previously published results. We also show a significant reduction in processing time because of the feature selection, which makes real-time applications of gender classification feasible.", "paper_title": "Gender Classification Based on Fusion of Different Spatial Scale Features Selected by Mutual Information From Histogram of LBP, Intensity, and Shape", "paper_id": "WOS:000318597400006"}
