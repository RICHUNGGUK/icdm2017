However, unlike the growing corpus of knowledge about formal aspects of Euler and Venn diagrams, there has been no formalisation of linear diagrams. To fill this knowledge gap, we present and formalise Point and Line (PaL) diagrams, an extension of simple linear diagrams containing points, thus providing a formal foundation for an effective visual language. We prove that PaL diagrams are exactly as expressive as monadic first-order logic with equality, gaining, as a corollary, an equivalence with the Euler diagram extension called spider diagrams. The method of proof provides translations between PaL diagrams and sentences of monadic first-order logic. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
