Such a process usually requires constructing a valid mesh embedding satisfying a set of positional constraints, which is known to be a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel algorithm for computing a foldover-free piecewise linear mapping with exact positional constraints. The algorithm begins with an unconstrained planar embedding, followed by iterative constrained mesh transformations. At the heart of the algorithm are radial basis function (RBF)-based warping and the longest edge bisection (LEB)-based refinement. A delicate integration of the RBF-based warping and the LEB-based refinement provides a provably foldover-free, smooth constrained mesh warping, which can handle a large number of constraints and output a visually pleasing mapping result without extra smoothing optimization. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Foldover-Free Mesh Warping for Constrained Texture Mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000351755700007"}
