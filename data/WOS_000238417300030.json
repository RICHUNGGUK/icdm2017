Text categorization is according to training set which is assigned class label to decide a new document which is not assigned class label belongs to some kind of document. Until now, kNN algorithm has still some issues to need to study further. Such as: improvement of decision rule; selection of k value; selection of dimensions (i.e. feature set selection); problems of multiclass text categorization; the algorithm's executive efficiency (time and space) etc. In this paper, we mainly focus on improvement of decision rule and dimension selection. We design an adaptive fuzzy kNN text classifier. Here the adaptive indicate the adaptive of dimension selection. The experiment results show that our algorithm is effective and feasible.", "paper_title": "An adaptive fuzzy kNN text classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300030"}
