With the coding scheme, one redundant packet can be used to ensure the error-correction of multiple source packets. Thus, the proposed scheme can increase the code rate. Moreover, the proposed coding scheme has also advantages of decoding complexity, reducing undetectable errors (by the proposed low-complexity decoder) and flexibility (applicable to channels with and without feedback). Theoretical analysis under the proposed low-complexity decoding algorithm is given to maximize the code rate by optimizing the number of source packets. Finally, we give numerical results to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme in terms of code rates compared to the traditional packet combining without coding or ARQ (automatic repeat-request) techniques.", "paper_title": "Packet combining based on cross-packet coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000317246800003"}
