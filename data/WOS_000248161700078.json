These materials form the binding for a four-year undergraduate degree program leading to a Bachelor's degree in Computational Physics. Also described will be the status of the conversion of these materials into electronic formats that may be used for online education and as electronic textbooks. The online materials are to be part of a proposed national repository of university-offered, undergraduate courses and modules in computational science gathered from various pioneering programs throughout the country.
