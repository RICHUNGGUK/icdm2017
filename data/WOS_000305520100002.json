The first method is based on the use of linear error correcting codes together with highly nonlinear S-boxes. Given a [u, m, t + 1] linear code where u = n-d-1, d > m, we show that it is possible to construct (n, m, t, d) resilient S-boxes which have currently best known nonlinearity. Our second construction provides highly nonlinear (n, m, t, d) resilient S-boxes which do not have linear structure, then an improved version of this construction is given.", "paper_title": "Construction of highly nonlinear resilient S-boxes with given degree", "paper_id": "WOS:000305520100002"}
