The bit error rate (BER) analysis with quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), gamma-gamma channel model and pointing error has been demonstrated for SISO and cooperative system. The performance improvement with different combining techniques in cooperative system for different channel environments has been shown in the paper. Markov models for reliability analysis of FSO systems in SISO and cooperative communication have been developed. We have obtained significant increase in availability and mean time between failures with cooperative communication over SISO model.", "paper_title": "Bit error rate and reliability analysis of cooperative communication in free-space optical systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000339802600009"}
