In this study, perfectly matched discrete layers (PMDLs) are employed to represent the radiation of energy rigorously. A time-domain formulation for a soil structure interaction is given using the layers. To represent a layered half-space effectively and accurately, a method to determine PMDL parameters for the half-space is proposed. It is demonstrated that the proposed PMDL system can be applied successfully to problems of nonlinear soil structure interaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
