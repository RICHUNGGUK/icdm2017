In another paper the authors obtained results on one of these indices for bundles of rank 3. Here we extend these results in the case where C has classical Clifford index 3. In particular we prove Mercat's conjecture for bundles of rank 3 for g <= 8 and g >= 13 when C has classical Clifford index 3. We obtain complete results in the case of genus 7.
