It combines decomposition techniques with the generation of both columns and valid inequalities and relies on strong bounds to guide the search in the branch-and-bound tree. In this paper, we present how to improve the performance of a branch-price-and-cut method by using the primal-dual interior point algorithm. We discuss in detail how to deal with the challenges of using the interior point algorithm with the core components of the branch-price-and-cut method. The effort to overcome the difficulties pays off in a number of advantageous features offered by the new approach. We present the computational results of solving well-known instances of the vehicle routing problem with time windows, a challenging integer programming problem. The results indicate that the proposed approach delivers the best overall performance when compared with a similar branch-price-and-cut method which is based on the simplex algorithm.
