Specifically, we study diverse routing, where two paths without sharing any SRLG have to be found between each pair of source-destination nodes, and its applications in dynamic shared protection as well. For the NP-complete diverse routing problem, a heuristic method is proposed, which steadily outperforms an existing algorithm within the first few iterations. When more iterations of calculations are allowed, we demonstrate that the two different algorithms perform nearly the same. This interesting observation helps to achieve some insight into how to further improve the performance of the heuristics in the future.", "paper_title": "Heuristics for diverse routing in wavelength-routed networks with shared risk link groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000234752600003"}
