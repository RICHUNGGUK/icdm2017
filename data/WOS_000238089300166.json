The algorithm embeds a watermark into the 3D motion by perturbing the middle frequency coefficients. During watermark extraction, the detected signal is smoothed to get an approximation of original signal by noise eliminating to obtain the watermark noise, which is amplified to extract watermark. Experimental results shows that the algorithm for 3D motion is resilient to many attacks such as Gaussian White Noise, resampling, smoothing, cropping, enhancement, attenuation and rearranging.", "paper_title": "A blind watermarking algorithm for animation used in digital heritage", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300166"}
