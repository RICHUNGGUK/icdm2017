Nevertheless, the extant literature has provided little insight into technology adoption of wireless pay-per-use services. Our study examined this adoption by combining marketing and IS perspectives through an empirical survey of 222 young-adult SMS users. It was hypothesized that perceived value would be a key multidimensional determinant of behavioral intentions. The paper therefore discusses a broadened conceptualization of technology adoption in which value tradeoffs (i.e., price, social, emotional and quality) are critical drivers in the adoption decision.
