Due to the difficulty in exploring conserved motifs on a large-scale sequence data involved with various signals, a new method, MDDLogo, is developed. MDDLogo applies maximal dependence decomposition (MDD) to cluster a group of aligned signal sequences into subgroups containing statistically significant motifs. In order to extract motifs that contain a conserved biochemical property of amino acids in protein sequences, the set of 20 amino acids is further categorized according to their physicochemical properties, e. g. hydrophobicity, charge or molecular size. MDDLogo has been demonstrated to accurately identify the kinase-specific substrate motifs in 1221 human phosphorylation sites associated with seven well-known kinase families from Phospho. ELM. Moreover, in a set of plant phosphorylation data-lacking kinase information, MDDLogo has been applied to help in the investigation of substrate motifs of potential kinases and in the improvement of the identification of plant phosphorylation sites with various substrate specificities. In this study, MDDLogo is comparable with another well-known motif discover tool, Motif-X.", "paper_title": "Exploiting maximal dependence decomposition to identify conserved motifs from a group of aligned signal sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000291752600056"}
