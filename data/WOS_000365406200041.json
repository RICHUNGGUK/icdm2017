The number of EVs is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. However, uncoordinated charging of these vehicles can put a severe stress on the power grid. The problem of charge scheduling of EVs is an important and challenging problem and has seen significant research activity in the last few years. This review covers the recent works done in the area of scheduling algorithms for charging EVs in smart grid. The works are first classified into two broad classes of unidirectional versus bidirectional charging, and then, each class is further classified based on whether the scheduling is centralized or distributed and whether any mobility aspects are considered or not. It then reviews the key results in this field following the classification proposed. Some interesting research challenges that can be addressed are also identified.", "paper_title": "A Review of Charge Scheduling of Electric Vehicles in Smart Grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000365406200041"}
