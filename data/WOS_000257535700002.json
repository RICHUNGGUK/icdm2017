It is critical therefore, to select the appropriate type of flexibility for a given manufacturing system, and to design effective strategies for using this flexibility in a way to improve the system performance. This study focuses on full routing flexibility which includes not only alternative machines for operations but also alternative sequences of operations for producing the same work piece. Upon completion of an operation, an on-line dispatching decision called part routing is required to choose one of the alternatives as the next step. This study introduces three new approaches, including a fuzzy logic approach, for dynamic part routing. The fuzzy part routing system adapts itself to the characteristics of a given flexible manufacturing system (FMS) installation by setting the key parameters of the membership functions as well as its Takagi-Sugeno type rule base, in such a way to capture the bottlenecks in the environment. Thus, the model does not require a search or training for the parameter set. The proposed approaches are tested against several crisp and fuzzy routing algorithms taken from the literature, by means of extensive simulation experiments in hypothetical FMS environments under variable system configurations. The results show that the proposed fuzzy approach remains robust across different system configurations and flexibility levels, and performs favourably compared to the other algorithms. The results also reveal important characteristic behaviour regarding routing flexibility. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
