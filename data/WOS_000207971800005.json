We start by reviewing the possible applications that can be used in VANETs, namely, safety and user applications, and by identifying their requirements. Then, we classify the solutions proposed in the literature according to their location in the open system interconnection reference model and their relationship to safety or user applications. We analyze their advantages and shortcomings and provide our suggestions for a better approach. We also describe the different methods used to simulate and evaluate the proposed solutions. Finally, we conclude with suggestions for a general architecture that can form the basis for a practical VANET.", "paper_title": "VEHICLE AD HOC NETWORKS: APPLICATIONS AND RELATED TECHNICAL ISSUES", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971800005"}
