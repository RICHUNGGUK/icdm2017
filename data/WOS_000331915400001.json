We show that MaxLIN2-AA[k] has a kernel with at most 0 (k(2)logk) variables and can be solved in time 2(0(klogk))(nm)(0(1)). This solves an open problem of Mahajan et al. (2006). The problem Max-gamma-LIN2-AA[k,r] is the same as MAxLIN2-AA[k] with two differences: each equation has at most r variables and r is the second parameter. We prove that MAx-r-LIN2-AA[k, r] has a kernel with at most (2k - 1)r variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
