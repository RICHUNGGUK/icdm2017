More precisely, this study considers a random walk model and combines it with a nonparametric model by using Bayesian model averaging. The integrated stock market instability index (iSMII) and its p-value are derived as a posterior expectation of the two models. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) is utilized as a nonparametric model.", "paper_title": "Intelligent stock market instability index: Application to the Korean stock market", "paper_id": "WOS:000357612200011"}
