However, the test methods regarding those newly developed subthreshold SRAM designs have not yet been fully discussed. In this paper, we first categorize the subthreshold SRAM designs into three types, study the faulty behavior of open defects and address decoders faults on each type of designs, and then identify the faults which may not be covered by a traditional SRAM test method. We will also discuss the impact of open defects and threshold-voltage mismatch on sense amplifiers under subthreshold operations. A discussion about the temperature at test is also provided.", "paper_title": "Fault Models and Test Methods for Subthreshold SRAMs", "paper_id": "WOS:000314391600005"}
