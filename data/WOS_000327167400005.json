Because of the dynamic nature of environment, broadcasting in cognitive radio ad hoc networks is a great challenge. Cognitive radio network technology has been well studied for more than a decade as a new way to improve the spectral efficiency of wireless networks and numerous precious works have been proposed. However, very few existing works consider how to broadcast messages in cognitive radio networks that operate in multichannel environments and none of these provides a full broadcast mechanism. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a broadcasting mechanism for multichannel cognitive radio ad hoc networks. Then, we analyze the mechanism regarding the speed of message dissemination, number of transmissions, fraction of the users that receive the broadcast message and so forth.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Message Broadcasting in Multichannel Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327167400005"}
