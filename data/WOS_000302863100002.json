In many application domains (e.g., biology), the frequent subsequences confined by the predefined gap requirements are more meaningful than the general sequential patterns. In this article, we propose two algorithms, Gap-BIDE for mining closed gap-constrained subsequences from a set of input sequences, and Gap-Connect for mining repetitive gap-constrained subsequences from a single input sequence. Inspired by some state-of-the-art closed or constrained sequential pattern mining algorithms, the Gap-BIDE algorithm adopts an efficient approach to finding the complete set of closed sequential patterns with gap constraints, while the Gap-Connect algorithm efficiently mines an approximate set of long patterns by connecting short patterns. We also present several methods for feature selection from the set of gap-constrained patterns for the purpose of classification and clustering. Our extensive performance study shows that our approaches are very efficient in mining frequent subsequences with gap constraints, and the gap-constrained pattern based classification/clustering approaches can achieve high-quality results.", "paper_title": "Efficient Mining of Gap-Constrained Subsequences and Its Various Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000302863100002"}
