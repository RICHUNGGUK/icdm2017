The ordering policy for the parts is the (S, Q) inventory policy. We extended the previous results to the network, where processing times at each node follow a two-phase Coxian distribution. The proposed network was modeled as a multi-class closed queueing network with a synchronization station. To make the analysis of the network computationally tractable, we developed a two-phase approximation method. In the first phase of the method, the proposed network was analyzed with the previous algorithm based on a product-form approximation. In the second phase, a sub-network was again analyzed with the procedure of a product-form approximation method such that the state space of the sub-network was reduced. In the analysis of a sub-network, a recursive method was also used to solve balance equations by exploiting the special structure of the Markov chain. The new algorithm provided a good estimation of the performance measures of interest. In addition to being accurate, the new algorithm is simple and converges rapidly. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
