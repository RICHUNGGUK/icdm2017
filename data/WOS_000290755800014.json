The robust and rotationally invariant features are extracted from QWT and RQWF decomposed sub-bands of banknote image. Three different sets of databases are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the recognition rate from 78.79% to 91.22% on (16000 images) database D1, form 74.08% to 94.62% on (20000 images) database D2 and from 76.44% to 88.78% on (10000 images) database D3.
