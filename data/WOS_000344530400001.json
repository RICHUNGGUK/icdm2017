These transformations reduce the executions of critical instructions and spatial/temporal vulnerabilities of different instructions with respect to different processor components. The goal is to lower the application's susceptibility toward failures. Compared to performance-optimized compilation, our method incurs 60% lower application failures, averaged over various fault injection scenarios and fault rates.", "paper_title": "Reliability-Driven Software Transformations for Unreliable Hardware", "paper_id": "WOS:000344530400001"}
