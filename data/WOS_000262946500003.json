Efficient QoS management is critical for computational grid to meet heterogeneity and dynamics of resources and users' requirements. There are different QoS metrics at different layers of computational grid. To improve perceived QoS by end users over computational grid, QoS supports can be addressed in different layers, including application layer, collective layer, fabric layer and so Forth. The paper tackles cross-layer grid QoS optimization as optimization decomposition, each layer corresponds to a decomposed subproblem. The proposed policy produces an optimal set of grid resources, service compositions and user's payments at the fabric layer, collective layer and application layer respectively to maximize global grid QoS. The cross-layer optimization problem decomposes into three subproblems: grid resource allocation problem, service composing and user satisfaction degree maximization problem, all of which interact through the optimal variables for capacities of grid resources and service demand. In order to coordinate the subproblems, cross-layer QoS feedback mechanism is established to ensure different layer interactions. The simulations are conducted to validate the efficiency of the proposed policy. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
