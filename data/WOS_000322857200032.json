It uses the image contrast characteristics of the lumen and bifurcation of the carotid artery in relation to other tissues and structures for their identification. The relevant ultrasound data regarding the artery presented in the input image is identified using morphologic operators and processed by an anisotropic diffusion filter for speckle noise removal. The information obtained is then used to define two initial contours, one corresponding to the lumen and the other one regarding the bifurcation boundaries, for the application of the Chan-Vese level set segmentation model. A set of longitudinal ultrasound B-mode grayscale images of the common carotid artery was acquired using a GE Healthcare Vivid-e ultrasound system. The results reveal that the new algorithm is effective and robust, and that its main advantage relies on the automatic identification of the carotid lumen, which overcomes the known limitations of the traditional algorithms.
