To overcome the premature convergence of particle swarm optimization (PSO), the evolution direction of each particle is redirected dynamically by adjusting the two sensitive parameters of PSO in the evolution process. Moreover, a new strategy is proposed to handle the various constraints of HS problem in this paper. The results solved by this proposed strategy can strictly satisfy the constraints of HS problem. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of proposed ISAPSO algorithm is validated by a test system containing four hydro plants and an equivalent thermal plant. The results demonstrate that the proposed ISAPSO can get a better solution in both robustness and accuracy while compared with the other methods reported in this literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
