The use of techniques for automating the generation of software test cases is very important as it can reduce the time and cost of this process. The newest methods for automatic generation of tests use metaheuristic search techniques, i.e. Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search. However there ire other metaheuristic techniques that can be used to generate automatically test cases. In this paper it is presented a new method based on Scatter Search that allows automatic generation of test cases to obtain branch coverage in software testing.", "paper_title": "A scatter search approach for automated branch coverage in software testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000256254300002"}
