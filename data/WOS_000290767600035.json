We propose the prioritized gate selection and the curvature prediction to improve the connectivity and geometry compression performance, respectively. Furthermore, based on the bit plane coding, we develop a progressive transmission method, which improves the qualities of intermediate meshes as well as that of the fully reconstructed mesh, and extend it to the view-dependent transmission method. Experiments on various 3D mesh models show that the proposed algorithm provides significantly better compression performance than the conventional algorithms, while supporting progressive reconstruction efficiently.", "paper_title": "R-D optimized progressive compression of 3D meshes using prioritized gate selection and curvature prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000290767600035"}
