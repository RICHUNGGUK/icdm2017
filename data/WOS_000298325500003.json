We formulate the construction of complex-phase-order representations at different structural scales based on the scale-space theory. Linear and nonlinear deterministic approaches are explored, and a Bayesian theoretic approach is introduced for constructing representations in such a way that strong structure localization and noise resilience are achieved. Experiments illustrate its potential for constructing robust multiscale complex-phase-order representations with well-localized structures across all scales under high-noise situations. Illustrative examples of applications of the proposed approach is presented in the form of multimodal image registration and feature extraction.", "paper_title": "A Bayesian Theoretic Approach to Multiscale Complex-Phase-Order Representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000298325500003"}
