Unfortunately, 2DLDA needs to use large numbers of features to represent an image sample, causing storage requirements are heavy and also feature matching process is time-consuming. Against this problem, we discuss in this paper a new image representation scheme called Enhanced 2DLDA (E-2DLDA) for face recognition. The main strategy adopted in our method is that two image projections are applied to an image sample jointly, so the dimensions of extracted feature matrix along both horizontal direction and vertical direction get compressed, and finally the total number of features can be reduced to a great extent. The experimental results on ORL database show that this method remarkably outperforms existing 2DLDA in terms of speed of feature matching and storage requirements of features.", "paper_title": "E-2DLDA: A new matrix-based image representation method for face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100026"}
