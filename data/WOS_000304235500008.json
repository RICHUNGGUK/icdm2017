By analyzing the relationship between the pixels in face images and features extracted from them, the pixels that contain a large amount of discriminative information are selected, while the pixels with less discriminative information are discarded. The experimental results obtained with various face databases show that the proposed pixel selection method results in improved recognition performance, especially in the presence of illumination or facial expression variations. Additionally, the proposed method greatly reduces the memory size and computational load in the face recognition process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
