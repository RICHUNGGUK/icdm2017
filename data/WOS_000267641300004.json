Special procedures have to be taken during the product development process to comply with recent green directives. Product structure is recognized as a critical factor that provides effective means for reducing environmental impact in product end-of-life. However, most previous studies failed to leverage the vast latitude at the design stage due to the assumption of a fixed product structure. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a CAD-based approach, that allows automatic variation of 3D product structure by means of changing the combination of parts, selecting the assembly method, and rearranging the assembly sequence. A computing scheme uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) techniques to produce an optimal product structure from the design alternatives generated by the approach. This corresponds to lower assembly/disassembly costs, while complying with specified recycling and recovering rates. The scheme also chooses a smaller set of parts that needs to be disassembled and determines an economical disassembly process. Implemented in a commercial CAD system, the test results demonstrated the effectiveness of this scheme in green product design in a cost-effective manner. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
