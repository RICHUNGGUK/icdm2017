In this short paper, a stemming strategy for a diachronic corpus of Mexican Spanish is briefly described, which partially faces up to these problems. Success rates of the method are contrasted to those of a Porter stemmer.", "paper_title": "Towards the automatic lemmatization of 16th century Mexican Spanish: A stemming scheme for the CHEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000236109700012"}
