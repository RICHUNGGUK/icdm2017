However, the usual software testing techniques are not designed to address some important features of SQL. We present a set of practical guidelines for designing white-box tests cases that reasonably exercise the way in which an SQL query processes the stored data. These guidelines are illustrated using an example.", "paper_title": "A practical guide to SQL white-box testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000238720900005"}
