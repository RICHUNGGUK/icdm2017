These adverse impacts can be reduced by using the first or second generation of FACTS devices. In this paper, these adverse impacts can be reduced optimally by using one of the modern optimization techniques, i.e., particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO algorithm). By using this algorithm, the optimal size of the static VAr compensator (FACTS devices) in a 30 bus IEEE test system is determined. At first, the load flow equations of the 30 bus IEEE test system is defined in the MATLAB software by means of dynamic programming method, and the number of SVCs will be determined by using the system sensitivity function (power losses and the sum of buses voltage drop square); then, the optimal sizes of the FACTS devices is obtained by means of PSO algorithm.", "paper_title": "A PSO-DP Based Method to Determination of the Optimal Number, Location, and Size of FACTS Devices in Power Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000332062300017"}
