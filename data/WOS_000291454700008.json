Identity management is critical to various organizational practices ranging from customer relationship management to crime investigation. The task of searching for a specific identity is difficult because disparate identity information may exist due to the issues related to unintentional errors and intentional deception. In this paper we propose a hierarchical Naive Bayes model that improves existing identity matching techniques in terms of searching effectiveness. Experiments show that our proposed model performs significantly better than the exact-match based matching technique. With 50% training instances labeled, the proposed semi-supervised learning achieves a performance comparable to the fully supervised record comparison algorithm. The semi-supervised learning greatly reduces the efforts of manually labeling training instances without significant performance degradation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
