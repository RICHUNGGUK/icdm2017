Automated detection of ruminant-derived bonemeal in animal feed is tested as part of an on-going research into development of automated, reliable fast and cost-effective quality control systems. HSI cubes contain spectral reflectance in both spatial dimensions and spectral bands. Support vector machines are used for classification of data in various domains. Selecting a subset of the spectral bands speeds processing and increases accuracy by reducing over-fitting. We developed two methods utilizing divergence values for selecting spectral band sets, 1) evolutionary search method and 2) divergence-based recursive feature elimination approach.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary refinement approaches for band selection of hyperspectral images with applications to automatic monitoring of animal feed quality", "paper_id": "WOS:000329498200003"}
