Theoretical analysis indicates that different production costs will post impact on the choice of production modes by manufacturers when consumers have different valuations of the products. Furthermore, system performance in cooperative game is apparently better than that in non-cooperative game. The cooperative pricing strategy coordinated by Rubinstein bargaining can realize the pareto optimization of supply chain system profits and member profits under different production modes, with a 33.3% increase in system profits from that in non-cooperative game. The numerical examples further validate the validity of this coordinated pricing strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
