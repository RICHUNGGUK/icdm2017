The detecting nodes are those for detecting intruders crossing a belt-shaped area of interest. On detecting intruders, they send intruding event notifications to one of the sink nodes with the help of the forwarding nodes to relay the notifications. We prove the optimality of ONSA, analyse its time complexity, perform simulations for it, and compare the simulation results with those of a related algorithm to show ONSA's advantages.", "paper_title": "Optimising sink-connected barrier coverage in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000364789400004"}
