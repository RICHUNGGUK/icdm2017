This paper attempts to explore the emotional, aesthetic, and ergonomic conceptions into the fashion technology model to examine the impact of the consuming public acceptance. The work extends the literature on brand attachment, need for uniqueness theory, fashion theory, TAM, and innovation diffusion theory. Through empirical study, this proposed model is tested with a structural equation modeling approach. Results indicate that brand attachment is a stronger antecedent of ergonomic and aesthetic facets, and aesthetic facet is the vital determinant to acceptance intention. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use had no direct impact but still positively correlate to acceptance intention. This study also finds that different groups of technological innovation will vary in their conceptions of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "Exploring the emotional, aesthetic, and ergonomic facets of innovative product on fashion technology acceptance model", "paper_id": "WOS:000268197600002"}
