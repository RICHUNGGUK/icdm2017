To analyze non-binary LDPC codes defined over both the general linear group GL(m, F-2) and the finite field F-2m, we investigate non-binary LDPC codes defined over GL(m(3), F-2m4). We propose a method to lower the error floors for non-binary LDPC codes. In this analysis, we see that the non-binary LDPC codes constructed by our proposed method defined over general linear group have the same decoding performance in the error floors as those defined over finite field. The non-binary LDPC codes defined over general linear group have more choices of the labels on the edges which satisfy the condition for the optimization.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Error Floors for Non-binary LDPC Codes over General Linear Group through q-Ary Memoryless Symmetric Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000313146100004"}
