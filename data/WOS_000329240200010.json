The permutation automorphism group of a quaternary linear code of length n is defined as . In this paper, the order of the permutation automorphism group of a family of quaternary linear Hadamard codes is established. Moreover, these groups are completely characterized by computing the orbits of the action of on and by giving the generators of the group. Since the dual of a Hadamard code is an extended 1-perfect code in the quaternary sense, the permutation automorphism group of these codes is also computed.", "paper_title": "Characterization of the automorphism group of quaternary linear Hadamard codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000329240200010"}
