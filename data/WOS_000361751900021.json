We consider the one-to-many negotiation approach as a flexible method for procuring multiple different services by a buyer agent. We address the problem of coordinating the bidding strategy amongst multiple concurrent negotiations and propose novel dynamic negotiation strategies. The proposed strategies consider the behaviors of the opponents of the current negotiation encounter in managing the local reservation values of the common negotiation issues (attributes) of different services. Most previous works consider the problem of negotiation over a single object characterized by one or more issues. We extend our previous work and investigate a more complex situation where a buyer agent negotiates over multiple distinct services given that each service has multiple negotiation issues and multiple possible providers. The experimental results show evidence for the effectiveness and robustness of our dynamic negotiation strategies under various negotiation environments.", "paper_title": "Coordinating the Bidding Strategy in Multiissue Multiobject Negotiation With Single and Multiple Providers", "paper_id": "WOS:000361751900021"}
