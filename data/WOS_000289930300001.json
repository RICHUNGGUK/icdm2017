In this paper, instead of considering asymptotic aspects of this problem, we are interested in reducing the cost of multiplication for matrices of small size, say up to 30. Following the previous work of Probert & Fischer, Smith, and Mezzarobba, in a similar vein, we base our approach on the previous algorithms for small matrices, due to Strassen, Winograd, Pan, Laderman, and others and show how to exploit these standard algorithms in an improved way. We illustrate the use of our results by generating multiplication codes over various rings, such as integers, polynomials, differential operators and linear recurrence operators.
