Equations of mass fraction with modified form, which is derived from conservative equations of mass, are employed here to capture the interface. By introducing mass fraction into Euler equations system, as well as other conservative coefficients, a quasi-conservative numerical model is created. Numerical examples show that the mass fraction model performs well not only in multi-component fluids modeled by simple stiffened gas equation of state (EOS) but also in that modeled by complex Mie-Gruneisen EOS. Moreover, the mass fraction model is applied to Riemann problem with piecewise EOS; the expression of which depends on density. It is found that the mass fraction model can well adapt to the analytic change in piecewise EOS and produce accuracy solutions with fewer unknown quantities, and the model can be easily extended to m-component fluid mixture by using only m+4 equations with no additional conditions.
