Recent proposals for robust and efficient transmission suggest joint design of coding and routing strategies. This paper introduces a general framework to analyze time diversity in packet-based communications. An algorithm for designing an efficient distribution of information in multiple packets that takes into account for both losses and delays is presented. Simulation results show in which cases time diversity may have a positive impact on various applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
