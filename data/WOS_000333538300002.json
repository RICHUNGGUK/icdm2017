It has a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm, and a variety of effective polynomial-time heuristics that, for many instances, can find the exact MWT. Linear programs (LPs) for MWT are well-studied, but previously no connection was known between any LP and any approximation algorithm or heuristic for MWT. Here we show the first such connections: For an LP formulation due to Dantzig, Hoffman, and Hu [Math. Programming, 31 (1985), pp. 1-14], (i) the integrality gap is constant, and (ii) given any instance, if the aforementioned heuristics find the MWT, then so does the LP.", "paper_title": "ON A LINEAR PROGRAM FOR MINIMUM-WEIGHT TRIANGULATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000333538300002"}
