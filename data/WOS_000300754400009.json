We propose a feature-based interpolation framework for the tensor fields from cardiac DT-MRI, by taking into account inherent relationships between tensor components. In this framework, the interpolation consists in representing a diffusion tensor in terms of two tensor features, eigenvalues and orientation, interpolating the Euler angles or the quaternion relative to tensor orientation and the logarithmically transformed eigenvalues, and reconstructing the tensor to be interpolated from the interpolated eigenvalues and tensor orientations. The results obtained with the aid of both synthetic and real cardiac DT-MRI data demonstrate that the feature-based schemes based on Euler angles or quaternions not only maintain the advantages of Log-Euclidean and Riemannian interpolation as for preserving the tensor's symmetric positive-definiteness and the monotonic determinant variation, but also preserve, at the same time, the monotonicity of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values, which is not the case with Euclidean, Cholesky and Log-Euclidean methods. As a result, both interpolation schemes remove the phenomenon of FA collapse, and consequently avoid introducing artificial fiber crossing, with the difference that the quaternion is independent of coordinate system while Euler angles have the property of being more suitable for sophisticated interpolations.
