By adopting this technique, our experimental results show that the receiver sensitivity at a bit error ratio of 1 x 10(-3) for a 2.98 Gb/s OFDM signal carried on a 60 GHz optical millimeter-wave after 50 km of standard single-mode fiber transmission is improved by about 0.6, 2.2, and 3.8 dB at launch powers of 0, 6, and 12 dBm, respectively.", "paper_title": "Reducing the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio With Companding Transform Coding in 60 GHz OFDM-ROF Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000302234100005"}
