However, up to 30% of patients are non-responders to therapy in terms of exercise capacity or left ventricular reverse remodelling. A number of controversies still remain surrounding patient selection, targeted lead implantation and optimisation of this important treatment. The development of biophysical models to predict the response to CRT represents a potential strategy to address these issues. In this article, we present how the personalisation of an electromechanical model of the myocardium can predict the acute haemodynamic changes associated with CRT. In order to introduce such an approach as a clinical application, we needed to design models that can be individualised from images and electrophysiological mapping of the left ventricle. In this paper the personalisation of the anatomy, the electrophysiology, the kinematics and the mechanics are described. The acute effects of pacing on pressure development were predicted with the in silico model for several pacing conditions on two patients, achieving good agreement with invasive haemodynamic measurements: the mean error on dP/dt(max) is 47.5 +/- 35 mm Hg s(-1), less than 5% error. These promising results demonstrate the potential of physiological models personalised from images and electrophysiology signals to improve patient selection and plan CRT. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
