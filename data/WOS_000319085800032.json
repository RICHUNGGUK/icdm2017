The salient object with a well-defined boundary can be automatically detected by our approach. Saliency density and edge response maximization is used as the quality function to direct the salient object discovery. The global optimal window containing a salient object is efficiently located through the proposed saliency density and edge response based branch-and-bound search. To extract the salient object with a well-defined boundary, the Grab Cut method is applied, initialized by the located window. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms tilt methods only using saliency or edge response and achieves a comparable performance with the best state-of-the-art method, while being without any threshold or multiple iterations of GrabCut.", "paper_title": "Saliency Density and Edge Response Based Salient Object Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000319085800032"}
