The attractive nature of this framework is that not only room temperature operations are feasible but also interaction between neighbors is central to information processing as opposed to creating interference. In this work, we explore spatially moving Landauer clocking scheme for MCA arrays (length of 8, 16, and 32 cells) and show the role and effectiveness of the clock in propagating logic signal from input to output without magnetic frustration. Simulation performed in object oriented micromagnetic framework suggests that the clocking field is sensitive to scaling, shape, and aspect ratio.", "paper_title": "Landauer Clocking for Magnetic Cellular Automata (MCA) Arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000288681400020"}
