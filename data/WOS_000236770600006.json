We analyze the stationary spatial distribution of a node moving according to the RWP model in a given convex area. For this, we give an explicit expression, which is in the form of a one-dimensional integral giving the density up to a normalization constant. This result is also generalized to the case where the waypoints have a nonuniform distribution. As a special case, we study a modified RWP model, where the waypoints are on the perimeter. The analytical results are illustrated through numerical examples. Moreover, the analytical results are applied to study certain performance aspects of ad hoc networks, namely, connectivity and traffic load distribution.", "paper_title": "Spatial node distribution of the random waypoint mobility model with applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000236770600006"}
