The location routing problem consists in selecting a set of depots to open and in building a set of routes from these depots, to serve a set of customers at minimum cost. In this variant a vehicle can perform more than a single route in the planning period. As a consequence, the routes have to be scheduled within the workdays of each vehicle. The problem arises typically when routes are constrained to have a short duration. It happens for example within the boundaries of small geographic areas or in the transportation of perishable goods. In this paper, we propose a skewed general variable neighborhood search based heuristic to solve it. The algorithm is tested extensively and we show that it is efficient and provides the proven optimal solution in a significant number of cases. Moreover, it clearly outperforms a multi-start VND based heuristic that uses the same neighborhood structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
