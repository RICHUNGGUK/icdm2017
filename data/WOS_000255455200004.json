Although appearing more or less informally in various AI settings, a computation-oriented investigation of the notion is still lacking, and this paper aims at filling the gap. After recalling the two definitions of definability, which are equivalent in standard propositional logic (while based on different intuitions), and defining a number of related notions, we give several characterization results, and many complexity results for definability. We also show close connections with hypothesis discriminability and with reasoning about action and change. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
