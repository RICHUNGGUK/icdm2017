Approximate, numerical solutions are obtained using the Galerkin method and chaos polynomials. The Chaos-Galerkin scheme is constructed by respecting the theoretical conditions for existence and uniqueness of the solution. Numerical results show fast convergence to the exact solution, at excellent accuracies. The developed Chaos-Galerkin scheme accurately approximates the complete cumulative distribution function of the displacement responses. The Chaos-Galerkin scheme developed herein is a theoretically sound and efficient method for the solution of stochastic problems in engineering. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
