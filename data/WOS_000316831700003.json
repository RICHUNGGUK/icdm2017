However, Multiagent Systems (MASs) are still not widely adopted in industry owing to the lack of a connection between MAS and software engineering. Since 2000, there is an effort to bridge this gap and to produce software engineering techniques for agent-based systems that guide the processes of design, development and maintenance. In Brazil, Agent-oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) was first investigated by the research group in the Software Engineering Laboratory (LES) at PUC-Rio, which after one decade of study in this area has built an AOSE community. This paper presents the history of AOSE at LES by discussing the sub-areas of MAS Software Engineering research and development that have been focus of the LES research group. We give examples of relevant results and present a subset of the extensive literature the group has produced during the last decade. We also report how we faced the challenges that emerged from our research by organizing and developing a research community at the intersection of software engineering, programming and MASs with a concern for scalability of solutions.
