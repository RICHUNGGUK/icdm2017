Ail evaluation procedure is illustrated to demonstrate that our procedure is all effective approach in a group decision-making process. In contrast with classic decision-making theory, this method applies fuzzy weighting to assess individual decision makers (DMs) which allows managers to consider the professional or experience of each DM in the decision-making procedure. In the example presented here, the final Solution is then obtained by identifying the best international distribution center for further evaluation and negotiation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
