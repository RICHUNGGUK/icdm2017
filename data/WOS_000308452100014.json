A language L is Church-Rosser congruential (belongs to CRCL), if there is a finite, confluent, and length-reducing semi-Thue system S such that L is a finite union of congruence classes modulo S. To date, it is still open whether every regular language is in CRCL. In this paper, we show that every star-free language is in CRCL. In fact, we prove a stronger statement: for every star-free language L there exists a finite, confluent, and subword-reducing semi-Thue system S such that the total number of congruence classes modulo S is finite and such that L is a union of congruence classes modulo S. The construction turns out to be effective. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Star-free languages are Church-Rosser congruential", "paper_id": "WOS:000308452100014"}
