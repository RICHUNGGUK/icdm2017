These data are distributed across different sources of information (social networks, blogs, databases, etc.) that may contain inconsistencies and their accuracy is uncertain. Paradoxically, this unprecedented availability of heterogeneous data has meant that users have more information available than they actually are able to process and understand to extract useful knowledge from it. Therefore, new tools that help users in their decision-making processes within the network (e.g. which friends to contact with or which products to consume) are needed. In this paper, we show how we have used a graph-based model to extract and model data and transform it in valuable knowledge to develop a persuasive social recommendation system(1).", "paper_title": "Towards Persuasive Social Recommendation: Knowledge Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000361222800004"}
