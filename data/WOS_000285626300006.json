On the other hand, recent studies have shown the feasibility of inferring, at genomic scales, the relative age of duplication events from the topology of gene family trees. This represents a promising alternative for large surveys requiring an automatic methodology to establish a timeline of duplication events and that are usually limited to the use of dS, which presents known limitations such as a fast saturation of the signal. However, both measures have never been compared in a common framework. Results: Topology-based placement of duplications on a relative time scale corresponding to periods between speciation events were found to be highly consistent, providing the same placement for 67-84% of a reliable set of gene pairs duplicated in a single event. For recent evolutionary periods, dS and topological measures showed a strong correlation. We conclude that the topology-based approach is more appropriate for assigning duplications to temporal scales when analyses need to include ancient events, and that the study of recent duplications may benefit from a combination of dS and topology information.", "paper_title": "Assigning duplication events to relative temporal scales in genome-wide studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000285626300006"}
