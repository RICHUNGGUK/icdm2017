Traditionally power and sample size calculations rely on either simulations or some recursive algorithm; neither is straightforward and computationally economic. In this paper we develop explicit formulas for minimal power and r-power of stepwise procedures as well as complete power of single-step procedures for exchangeable and non-exchangeable bivariate and trivariate test statistics. With the explicit power expressions, we were able to directly calculate the desired power, given sample size and correlation. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the relationship among power, sample size and correlation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
