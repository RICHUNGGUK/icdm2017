The examined pipe system is part of the one supplying the city of Milan, Italy and is managed by Metropolitana Milanese SpA (MM). The characteristics of such a system can be considered as intermediate between those of classical transmission mains and distribution systems because of its several branches. A Lagrangian model simulating pressure wave propagation is used to evaluate the pipe pressure wave speed - associated with a genetic algorithm - and to locate possible anomalies - associated with wavelet analysis. The results of the diagnosis of the pipe system are corroborated by repairs executed by MM in the area where possible anomalies have been pre-localized.", "paper_title": "Anomaly pre-localization in distribution-transmission mains by pump trip: preliminary field tests in the Milan pipe system", "paper_id": "WOS:000354700800005"}
