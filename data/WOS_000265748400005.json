Many procedures have been proposed to optimally select the grey value thresholds based on the tomogram data only (e.g., using the image histogram). In this paper, a projection distance minimization (PDM) method is presented that uses the tomographic projection data to determine optimal thresholds. These thresholds are computed by minimizing the distance between the forward projection of the segmented image and the measured projection data. An important contribution of the current paper is the efficient implementation of the forward projection method, which makes the use of the original projection data as a segmentation criterion feasible. Simulation experiments applied to various phantom images show that our proposed method obtains superior results compared to established histogram-based methods.", "paper_title": "Optimal Threshold Selection for Tomogram Segmentation by Projection Distance Minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000265748400005"}
