We focus on examples having just a few variables or a few constraints for which the quadratic problem can be formulated as a copositive-style problem, which itself can be recast in terms of linear, second-order-cone, and semidefinite optimization. A particular highlight is the role played by the geometry of the feasible set.", "paper_title": "A gentle, geometric introduction to copositive optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000354623300005"}
