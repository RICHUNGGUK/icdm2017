A proportional controller turns three independent linear integrals into this nonlinear model. To enhance the system performance, a Fuzzy algorithm independent coefficient has been implemented. In this study, Genetic Algorithm amends the controller by improving fuzzy membership functions. Finally, the control method tuned by standard tuning procedure and the optimized form of it are compared.", "paper_title": "Diabetic Control Using Genetic Fuzzy-PI Controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000338826200001"}
