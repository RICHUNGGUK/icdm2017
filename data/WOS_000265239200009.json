On the other hand cooperating array grammar systems [5] and array P systems [1] have been developed in the context of two-dimensional picture description. In this paper, motivated by the study of [4], these two systems are studied by linking them through the t-communication mode, thus bringing out the picture description power of these systems.", "paper_title": "Array P Systems and t-Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000265239200009"}
