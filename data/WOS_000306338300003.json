The first corresponds to a trend coefficient continuously differentiable with respect to parameter, and the second, to a discontinuous trend coefficient. It is shown that in the first case the maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimators are asymptotically normal with rate T (3/2), and in the second case these estimators have different limit distributions with rate T (2).", "paper_title": "On frequency estimation for a periodic ergodic diffusion process", "paper_id": "WOS:000306338300003"}
