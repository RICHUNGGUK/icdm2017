The considered models have heterogeneous servers and the number of elementary Web services can be very large. More precisely, we study two types of composite Web services. First, we investigate the performance of a single composite Web service execution instance. Second, this assumption is relaxed (i.e. multiple composite Web services execution instances are considered). These models allows to find trade-off between the accuracy of the bounds and the computation complexity.", "paper_title": "Stochastic bounds for composite Web services response times", "paper_id": "WOS:000311507200004"}
