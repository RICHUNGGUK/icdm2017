First, a new fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed to derive a delay-dependent stability condition for open-loop fuzzy systems. Then, a delay-dependent stabilization approach based on a nonparallel distributed compensation scheme is provided for closed-loop fuzzy systems. Both state feedback and observer-based control cases are considered. The proposed stability and stabilization conditions are represented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be solved efficiently by using existing LMI optimization techniques. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Delay-dependent stability analysis and stabilization for discrete-time fuzzy systems with state delay: A fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000239408100020"}
