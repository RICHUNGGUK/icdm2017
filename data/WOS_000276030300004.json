The methodology contributes to problem solving under the paradigm of knowledge discovery from data in which the pre-process, the automatic interpretation of results and the explicit production of knowledge play a role as important as the analysis itself. The data mining step is performed using clustering based on rules by states, which integrates the knowledge discovered separately at each step of the process into a single model of global operation of the phenomenon. This provides a more accurate model for the dynamics of the system than one obtained by analyzing the whole dataset with all the steps taken together. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
