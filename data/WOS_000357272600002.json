Strong and abundant dissipations are exhibited due to mesoscopic unsteady motion of individual grains, and evolution of underlying structures (e. g. force chains, vortex, etc.), which defines the key differences between granular materials and ordinary objects. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the major studies have been conducted in recent two decades. Design/methodology/approach - The main properties at individual scale are introduced, including the coordination number, pair-correlation function, force and mean stress distribution functions, and the dynamic correlation function. The relationship between meso-and macro-scales is analyzed, such as between contact force and stress, the elastic modulus, and bulk friction in granular flows. At macroscales, conventional engineering models (i. e. elasto-plastic and hypo-plastic ones) are introduced. In particular, the so-called granular hydrodynamics theory, derived from thermodynamics principles, is explained. Findings - On the basis of recent study the authors conducted, the multiscales (both spatial and temporal) in granular materials are first explained, and a multiscale framework is presented for the mechanics of granular materials. Originality/value - It would provide a paramount view on the multiscale studies of granular materials.", "paper_title": "Multiscale properties of dense granular materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000357272600002"}
