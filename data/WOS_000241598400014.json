We expose a normalized reconstruction of the IVUS images from radio frequency (RF) signals, and the use of these signals for classification. The reconstructed data is described in terms of texture based features and feeds an ECOC-Adaboost learning process. In the same manner, the RF signals are characterize using Autoregressive models, and classified with a similar learning process. A comparison is performed among these techniques and with DICOM based classification ones obtaining very promising results.", "paper_title": "In-vivo IVUS tissue classification: A comparison between RF signal analysis and reconstructed images", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400014"}
