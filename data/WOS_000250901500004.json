The incremental refinement works via an indirect communication process facilitated by a visual interface which adapts significantly to reflect user contributions. The interface visually guides users in an implicit manner via a 'what you click is what you mean' approach which assists semantic visualization of past interactions by highlighting relevant search terms in brighter colors. Users simply click on anything that seems relevant while being 'attracted' to the terms already clicked by other users. This elicits conceptual refinements and reduces the rating effort required by many collaborative systems. InOrder functions as a 'visual search WIKI', which represents search intent rather than search of formal articles. Since it takes less effort to click than type, the system increases search usability by reducing the interactive effort required to discover documents when search goals are unclear.", "paper_title": "InOrder: enhancing Google via stigmergic query refinement", "paper_id": "WOS:000250901500004"}
