In this paper, we attempt to address the challenging problem of automatic handwriting facsimile. We focus on Chinese calligraphic writings due to their rich variation in style, high artistic values and also the fact that they are among the most difficult candidates for the problem. We first analyze the structures and shapes of the constituent components, i.e., strokes and radicals, of characters in sample calligraphic writings by the same writer. To generate calligraphic writing in the style of the writer, we facsimile the individual character elements as well as the layout relationships used to compose the character, both in the writer's personal writing style. To test our algorithm, we compare our facsimileing results of Chinese calligraphic writings with the original writings. Our results are found to be acceptable for most cases, some of which are difficult to differentiate from the real ones.
