(Network 54(2) (2009), 75-81; 55 (2010), 360-367). For the complete graph K-n of order n6, they showed that rx3,(Kn)=3 for =1,2. Furthermore, they conjectured that for every positive integer , there exists a positive integer N such that rx3,(Kn)=3 for every integer nN. More generally, they conjectured that for every pair of positive integers k and with k3, there exists a positive integer N such that rxk,(Kn)=k for every integer nN. This article provides solutions to these conjectures. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
