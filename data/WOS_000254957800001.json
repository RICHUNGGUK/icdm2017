Here we extend this classical result to the case of a ring-linear code with exactly two nonzero homogeneous weights and sets of points in an associated projective ring geometry. We will introduce regular projective two-weight codes over finite Frobenius rings, we will show that such a code gives rise to a strongly regular graph, and we will give some constructions of two-weight codes using ring geometries. All these examples yield infinite families of strongly regular graphs with non-trivial parameters.", "paper_title": "Ring geometries, two-weight codes, and strongly regular graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000254957800001"}
