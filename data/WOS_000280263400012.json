Applying both sliding-window and clustering strategies, we use anomalously mapped read pairs provided by current short read aligners to localize genomic rearrangements and classify them according to their type, e. g. large insertions-deletions, inversions, duplications and balanced or unbalanced inter-chromosomal translocations. SVDetect outputs predicted structural variants in various file formats for appropriate graphical visualization.", "paper_title": "SVDetect: a tool to identify genomic structural variations from paired-end and mate-pair sequencing data", "paper_id": "WOS:000280263400012"}
