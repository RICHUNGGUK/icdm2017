The problem space and data set are divided into smaller pieces that are processed in parallel over the grid network and reassembled upon completion. Typically, resources are logged into a resource broker that is somewhat aware of all of the participants available on the grid. The resource broker scheme can be a bottleneck because of the amount of computational power and network bandwidth needed to maintain a fresh view of the grid. In this paper, we propose to place the load of managing the network resource discovery on to the network itself: inside of the routers. In the proposed protocol, the routers contain tables for resources similar to routing tables. These resource tables map IP addresses to the available computing resource values, which are provided through a scoring mechanism. Each resource provider is scored based on the attributes they provide such as the number of processors, processor frequency, amount of memory, hard drive space, and the network bandwidth. The resources are discovered on the grid by the protocol's discovery packets, which are encapsulated within the TCP/IP packets. The discovery packet visits the routers and look up in the resource tables until a satisfactory resource is found. The protocol is validated by simulations with five different deployment environments.", "paper_title": "Design and analysis of a distributed grid resource discovery protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000300666700005"}
