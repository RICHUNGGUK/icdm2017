The proposed algorithm is based on association analysis and adopts the antecedent ergodicity and the consequent pruning strategy to ensure the completeness of mined control rules and improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Moreover, the improved fuzzy support and the fuzzy consequent strength measurements are proposed to ensure the accuracy of mined control rules. The experimental results verify that the performance of our control rules generation algorithm is better and the fuzzy controller, whose control rules are obtained automatically by the proposed algorithm on the real field database of ball mill pulverizing system, has higher control quality. In addition, the proposed fuzzy controller has been put into practice and the field data verify the effectiveness of the fuzzy controller.", "paper_title": "AN ASSOCIATION-ANALYSIS-BASED FUZZY CONTROLLER FOR BALL MILL PULVERIZING SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000297957500003"}
