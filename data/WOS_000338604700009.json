Battery consumption constitutes a critical point in these systems since most are provided with a rechargeable battery. In this paper, by using discrete techniques based on the Ameva algorithm, an innovative approach for human activity recognition systems on mobile devices is presented. Furthermore, unlike other systems in current use, this proposal enables recognition of high granularity activities by using accelerometer sensors. Hence, the accuracy of activity recognition systems can be increased without sacrificing efficiency. A comparative is carried out between the proposed approach and an approach based on the well-known neural networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
