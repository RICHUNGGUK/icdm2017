The purpose of the RFSM is to generate predictions of water depth and flood extent using less computer resource than required by two-dimensional shallow water equation models (SWEMs). To be useful the RFSM must produce predictions that are comparable with those obtained from SWEMs. This paper reports a validation data available to the date on an urban flood, collected in January 2005 after a major event in the city of Carlisle, UK. This demonstrates an agreement between the proposed RFSM and measured data.", "paper_title": "Carlisle 2005 urban flood event simulation using cellular automata-based rapid flood spreading model", "paper_id": "WOS:000313009200003"}
