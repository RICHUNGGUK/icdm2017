This study proposes a license plate based strategy for checking the annual inspection status of motorcycles from images taken along the roadside and at designated inspection stations. Both a UMPC (Ultra Mobile Personal Computer) with a web camera and a desktop PC are used as hardware platforms. The license plate locations in images are identified by means of integrated horizontal and vertical projections that are scanned using a search window. Moreover, a character recovery method is exploited to enhance the success rate. Character recognition is achieved using both a hack propagation artificial neural network and feature matching. The identified license plate can then be compared with entries in a database to check the inspection status of the motorcycle. Experiments yield a recognition rate of 95.7% arid 93.9% based oil roadside and inspection station test images, respectively. It takes less than 1s on a UMPC (Celeron 900 MHz with 256 MB memory) arid about 293 Ins on a PC (Intel Pentium 43.0 GHz with 1 GB memory) to correctly recognize a license plate. Challenges associated with recognizing license plates from roadside and designated inspection stations images are also discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
