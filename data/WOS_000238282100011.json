New hierarchical fuzzy behavior-based control architecture of an autonomous mobile robot using the information extracted from its sensors in unknown environments is presented. After that, the paper focuses on the coordination and fusion of the elementary behaviors, which are achieved by means of fuzzy reasoning scheme. Simulation results illustrate the effective performance of the control architecture.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical fuzzy behavior-based control method for autonomous mobile robot navigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100011"}
