First, the Bayesian network is transformed into Petri net, the structural analysis approach of which is employed to analyze structural nature of the Bayesian network, ensuring correctness of the constructed Bayesian network structure. Then based on the above fact that the structure is correct, S-invariants of a Petri net is used to search for simple causal chains of the Bayesian network. Finally, the causal effect is defined and sensitivity analysis is made on the causal chains. The said method is applied to MDS causal chain analysis. Results show that the proposed method is direct viewing and practical. This method has some reference value for decision making in complex systems.
