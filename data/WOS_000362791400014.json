Rising electricity costs are forcing data center operators to either operate within an electricity budget or to reduce electricity use as much as possible while still maintaining service agreements. Energy-aware resource allocation is one technique a system administrator can employ to address both problems: optimizing the workload completion time (makespan) when given an energy budget, or to minimize energy consumption subject to service guarantees (such as adhering to deadlines). In this paper, we study the problem of energy-aware static resource allocation in an environment where a collection of independent (non-communicating) tasks (\"bag-of-tasks\") is assigned to a heterogeneous computing system. Computing systems often operate in environments where task execution times vary (e.g., due to cache misses or data dependent execution times). We model these execution times stochastically, using probability density functions. We want our resource allocations to be robust against these variations, where we define energy-robustness as the probability that the energy budget is not violated, and makespan-robustness as the probability a makespan deadline is not violated. We develop and analyze several heuristics for energy-aware resource allocation for both energy-constrained and deadline-constrained problems.", "paper_title": "Makespan and Energy Robust Stochastic Static Resource Allocation of a Bag-of-Tasks to a Heterogeneous Computing System", "paper_id": "WOS:000362791400014"}
