Effective depth-of-field of a sensor can be enhanced considerably without compromising the quality of the image by combining multi-focus images of a scene. This paper presents a block-based algorithm for multi-focus image fusion. In general, finding a suitable block-size is a problem in block-based methods. A large block is more likely to contain portions from both focused and defocused regions. This may lead to selection of considerable amount of defocused regions. On the other hand, small blocks do not vary much in relative contrast and hence difficult to choose from. Moreover, small blocks are more affected by mis-registration problems. In this work, we present a block-based algorithm which do not use a fixed block-size and rather makes use of a quad-tree structure to obtain an optimal subdivision of blocks. Though the algorithm starts with blocks, it ultimately identifies sharply focused regions in input images. The algorithm is simple, computationally efficient and gives good results. A new focus-measure called energy of morphologic gradients is introduced and is used in the algorithm. It is comparable with other focus measures viz.energy of gradients, variance, Tenengrad, energy of Laplacian and sum modified Laplacian. The algorithm is robust since it works with any of the above focus measures. It is also robust against pixel mis-registration. Performance of the algorithm has been evaluated by using two different quantitative measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
