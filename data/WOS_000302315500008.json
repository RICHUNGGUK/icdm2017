In this paper, we test and compare different methods from both groups as well as some methods which may be considered as hybrids of these two and/or some others. All the solvers tested are so-called general black box methods which, at least in theory, can be applied to solve almost all NSO problems. The test set includes a large number of unconstrained nonsmooth convex and nonconvex problems of different size. In particular, it includes piecewise linear and quadratic problems. The aim of this work is not to foreground some methods over the others but to get some insight on which method to select for certain types of problems.", "paper_title": "Comparing different nonsmooth minimization methods and software", "paper_id": "WOS:000302315500008"}
