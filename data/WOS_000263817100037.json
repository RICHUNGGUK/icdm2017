In this paper a distributed multi-agent architecture for a diesel engine and the knowledge sources that handle electricity generation is developed. Electronic devices and components used for data handling are described. The sensed data are presented in fuzzy logic and calculated in entropy values and depicted in a decision hierarchy. A comparative performance assessment of the proposed multi-agent based system with an existing system is presented and discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
