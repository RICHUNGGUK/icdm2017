A resource information service, which collects resource data and provides resource search functionality for locating desired resources, is a crucial component of the resource sharing system. In addition to resource discovery speed and cost (i.e., efficiency), the ability to accurately locate all satisfying resources (i.e., fidelity) is also an important metric for evaluating service quality. Previously, a number of resource information service systems have been proposed based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) that offer scalable key-based lookup functions. However, these systems either achieve high fidelity at low efficiency, or high efficiency at low fidelity. Moreover, some systems have limited flexibility by only providing exact-matching services or by describing a resource using a pre-defined list of attributes. This paper presents a resource information service that offers high efficiency and fidelity without restricting resource expressiveness, while also providing a similar-matching service. Extensive simulation and PlanetLab experimental results show that the proposed service outperforms other services in terms of efficiency, fidelity, and flexibility; it dramatically reduces overhead and yields significant enhancements in efficiency and fidelity.", "paper_title": "Combining Efficiency, Fidelity, and Flexibility in Resource Information Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000348053400005"}
