Intuitively, it is more desirable to diversify search results so that the top-ranked documents can cover different query subtopics, i.e., different pieces of relevant information. In this paper, we study the problem of search result diversification in an optimization framework whose objective is to maximize a coverage-based diversity function. We first define the diversity score of a set of search results through measuring the coverage of query subtopics in the result set, and then discuss how to use them to derive diversification methods. The key challenge here is how to define an appropriate coverage function given a query and a set of search results. To address this challenge, we propose and systematically study three different strategies to define coverage functions. They are based on summations, loss functions and evaluation measures respectively. Each of these coverage functions leads to a result diversification method. We show that the proposed coverage based diversification methods not only cover several state-of-the-art methods but also allows us to derive new ones. We compare these methods both analytically and empirically. Experiment results on two standard TREC collections show that all the methods are effective for diversification and the new methods can outperform existing ones.", "paper_title": "Coverage-based search result diversification", "paper_id": "WOS:000309340500002"}
