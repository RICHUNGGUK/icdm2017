We solve a set of differential and algebraic equations (DAE) in order to study the dynamic behavior of power systems. These power systems include thousands of generators, exciters, turbine-governors, loads, and other devices. The resultant large-scale DAEs are very difficult to handle and solve. Nevertheless, solution techniques are needed to not just guarantee accuracy but have computational efficiency. In this paper, we report on a novel tool that we developed to deal with time-domain simulation for dynamic analysis and operation of large-scale power systems. The tool has several major features related to transient stability analysis, contingency screening, and ranking. We mainly discuss the structure of this tool and the accuracy of the included dynamic models. Also, the paper proposes a new load model to overcome the low-voltage problem. The proposed technique provides a good performance and convergence when the terminal voltage is below some predefined value. Compared to the commercial tools, the developed tool is numerically well conditioned by introducing the ZIP model algorithm. This tool has been used to support and enhance power engineering education at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. In the case study, simulation results were validated through comparative simulations with the Power System Simulator for Engineering (PSS/E) and Transient Security Assessment Tool (TSAT).
