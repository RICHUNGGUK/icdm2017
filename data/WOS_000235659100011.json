We consider the generate-and-test and the frequent-pattern growth approaches. In XLogic-Miner, we propose an novel method to represent a frequent-pattern tree in an object-relational table and exploit a new join operator developed in the paper. The principal focus of this research is to demonstrate that association rule mining can be expressed in an extended datalog program and be able to mine XML data in a declarative way. We also consider some optimization and performance issues.", "paper_title": "Logic-based association rule mining in XML documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100011"}
