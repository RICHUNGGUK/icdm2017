The association's records are incomplete and dispersed, and gaps remain to be filled, but those we have illustrate the energy with which the new discipline and practice of information science was embraced by enthusiasts, practitioners, and scholars. The association's formation and early activities, its changing structure, membership, advocacy work, publications, conferences, and various electronic experiments are covered here. A thorough history of information science in Canada remains to be written.", "paper_title": "The Canadian Association for Information Science: A Look at Its Thirty-Five-Year History", "paper_id": "WOS:000262304700004"}
