Unlike the previous method, in which three circular motion sequences are needed with known motion, the new method computes the rotation angles and the projective reconstructions of the sequence and the images with circular constraint enforced, which is called a circular projective reconstruction, using a factorization-based method. It is then shown that the images of the circular points of each circular projective reconstruction can be readily obtained. Subsequently, the image of the absolute conic and the calibration matrix of the camera can be determined. Experiments on both synthetic and real image sequence are given, showing the accuracy and robustness of the new algorithm. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
