The spherical one-class classifier (SOCC) solves this problem by finding a hypersphere with minimum volume that contains the target data while keeping outlier samples outside. SOCC achieves satisfactory performance only when the target samples have the same distribution tendency in all orientations. Therefore, the performance of the SOCC is limited in the way that many superfluous outliers might be mistakenly enclosed. The authors propose to exploit target data structures obtained via unsupervised methods such as agglomerative hierarchical clustering and use them in calculating a set of hyperellipsoidal separating boundaries. This method is named the structured one-class classifier (TOCC). The optimization problem in TOCC can be formulated as a series of second-order cone programming problems that can be solved with acceptable efficiency by primal-dual interior-point methods. The experimental results on artificially generated data sets and benchmark data sets demonstrate the advantages of TOCC.", "paper_title": "Structured one-class classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000242690600010"}
