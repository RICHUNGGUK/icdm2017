At system level, a new single-loop, single-stage modulator is proposed. The modulator employs only one class-AB op-amp to realize a second-order noise shaping for voice-band applications. The modulator is designed in a 0.25 mu m standard CMOS process, and exhibits 86 dB dynamic range (DR) for a 4 kHz voice-bandwidth. The proposed modulator consumes 125 mu W from a 2.5 V supply.", "paper_title": "A low-power, second-order Delta/Sigma modulator using a single class-AB op-amp for voice-band applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000242343500014"}
