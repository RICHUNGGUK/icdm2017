It is shown that the model may exhibit a complex dynamic behavior. On the basis of this neuron model, we propose a novel neural network, which can be applied to hysteresis system modeling. We demonstrate the advantages of the network by experimental results.", "paper_title": "Hysteresis modeling based on the hysteretic chaotic neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000259483200015"}
