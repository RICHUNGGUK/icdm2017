In this paper, we provide a comparative study of the most well-known ontologies related to multimedia aspects. This comparative study has been done based on a framework proposed in this paper and called FRAMECOMMON. This framework takes into account process-oriented dimension, such as the methodological one, and outcome-oriented dimensions, like multimedia aspects, understandability, and evaluation criteria. Finally, we derive some conclusions concerning this one decade state-of-art in multimedia ontologies.", "paper_title": "The landscape of multimedia ontologies in the last decade", "paper_id": "WOS:000313965900005"}
