The interest-point-based methods do not perform well if the interest points cannot be selected very carefully. The performance of the discriminative-part-base methods is not stable if viewpoints change, because they select discriminative parts from the interest points. In addition, the discriminative-part-based methods often do not provide an incremental learning ability. To address these problems, we propose a novel method that consists of three phases. First, we use some sliding windows that are different in scale to retrieve a number of local parts from each model object and extract a feature vector for each local part retrieved. Next, we construct prototypes for the model objects by using the feature vectors obtained in the first phase. Each prototype represents a discriminative part of a model object. Then, we establish the correspondence between the local parts of a test object and those of the model objects. Finally, we compute the similarity between the test object and each model object, based on the correspondence established. The test object is recognized as the model object that has the highest similarity with the test object. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms or is comparable with the compared methods in terms of recognition rates on the COIL-100 dataset, Oxford buildings dataset and ETH-80 dataset, and recognizes all query images of the ZuBuD dataset. It is robust enough for distortion, occlusion, rotation, viewpoint and illumination change. In addition, we accelerate the recognition process using the C4.5 decision tree technique, and the proposed method has the ability to build prototypes incrementally. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
