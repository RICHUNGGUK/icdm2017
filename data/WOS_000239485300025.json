The chaotic sequences are created from a CNN with three cells and multilevel quantified to be the PN sequences for the spread spectrum communication systems (SSCS). And then better sequences are filtered out in terms of the equilibria points, self-correlation and mutual-correlation of the chaotic PN sequences. These PN sequences can provide more enhanced multiple access capacity and robustness to the noises than conventional m- and Gold sequences because of the sensitivity to the initial conditions of the chaotic sequences and the good dynamical performance of the CNN. The filter processing helps the SSCS to resist on the rake declination and the interference from other users. The experiment results show that the proposed chaotic PN sequences are much better than the conventional sequences for SSCS.", "paper_title": "A multilevel quantifying spread spectrum PN sequence based on chaos of cellular neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300025"}
