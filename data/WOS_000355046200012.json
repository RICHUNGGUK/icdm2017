Incremental forming methods, in particular driving, offer the opportunity for achieving this objective. However, these manual processes are very difficult to automate, as a result of their complexity and user interactivity. To resolve this problem, a knowledge-based approach is presented, which utilizes a special type of driving process. Initially, a neural network architecture is established which delivers manufacturing strategies allowing part production for simple component shapes. After providing a method for training data generation, training sessions are carried out. Strategies, computed by trained networks, are adopted for processing sheet blanks which are used for evaluating the framework. Finally, the developed procedure is generalized, and a concept is designed which allows a transfer, in order to facilitate the production of arbitrary individualized sheet metal parts.
