Modeling and Analysis of Real-time and Embedded systems (MARTE) UML profile through its repetitive structure modeling (RSM) package is well suited to model the inherent parallelism within these applications, a compact representation of parallel execution platforms and the distributive mapping of one on another. The execution of such a specification respects the whole set of constraints defined upon, while the quality of the scheduling is directly linked to the quality of the mapping of the multidimensional structures (data arrays or parallel loop nests) into time and space. We propose here a strategy to use a refactoring tool dedicated to this kind of application that allows to find good trade-offs in the usage of storage and computation resources and in parallelism (both task and data parallelism) exploitation. This strategy is illustrated on an industrial radar application. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
