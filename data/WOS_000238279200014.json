In this paper we propose a novel genetically inspired learning method for facial expression recognition (FER). Unlike current research on facial expression recognition that generally selects visually meaningful feature by hands, our learning method can discover the features automatically in a genetic programming-based approach that uses Gabor wavelet representation for primitive features and linear/nonlinear operators to synthesize new features. These new features are used to train a support vector machine classifier that is used for recognizing the facial expressions. The learned operator and classifier are used on unseen testing images. To make use of random nature of a genetic program, we design a multi-agent scheme to boost the performance. We compare the performance of our approach with several approaches in the literature and show that our approach can perform the task of facial expression recognition effectively.
