A simple agent-based model of a sexual population, based on the Penna model, is built in order to find out under which circumstances one language dominates other ones. This model considers that only young people learn foreign languages. The simulations show a first order phase transition of the ratio between the number of speakers of different languages with the mutation rate as control parameter.", "paper_title": "Phase transition in a sexual age-structured model of learning foreign languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000236621700009"}
