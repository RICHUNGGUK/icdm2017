In this paper we present a new representation of regression models in the so-called regression ROC (RROC) space. The basic idea is to represent overestimation against under-estimation. The curves are just drawn by adjusting a shift, a constant that is added (or subtracted) to the predictions, and plays a similar role as a threshold in classification. From here, we develop the notions of optimal operating condition, convexity, dominance, and explore several evaluation metrics that can be shown graphically, such as the area over the RROC curve (AOC). In particular, we show a novel and significant result: the AOC is equivalent to the error variance. We illustrate the application of RROC curves to resource estimation, namely the estimation of software project effort. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
