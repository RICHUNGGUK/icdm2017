We follow this case from the application of the work analysis methods, through the consolidation of information requirements, to the design of a novel interface that integrates the requirements. The findings confirm earlier assertions that task-based and work domain-based analysis frameworks identify unique and complementary requirements for effective information systems that are intended to support supervisory control of complex systems. It further provides the first industrial demonstration of ecological interface forms based on integrated task- and work domain-based work requirements.", "paper_title": "Integrating task- and work domain-based work analyses in ecological interface design: A process control case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000250590400004"}
