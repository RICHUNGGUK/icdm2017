In contrast to a fully automated technique, we present a manual, per-event approach that maintains user control during the sequence of processing. The SplitLab environment is intended to undertake the repetitive processing steps while enabling the user to focus on quality control and eventually the interpretation of the results. Pre-processing modules of SplitLab create a database of events and link the corresponding seismogram files. The seismogram viewer tool uses this database to perform the measurement interactively. Post-processing of the combined results of such a project includes a viewer and export option. Our emphasis lies in the application to teleseismic shear-wave splitting analysis, but our code can be extended easily for other purposes.
