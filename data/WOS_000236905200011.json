Our method is based on bisimulations, following the work of Sumii and Pierce [25,26] and our own [14]. Using our method we were able to prove equivalence in more complex examples than the ones of Gordon, Hankin and Lassen [7] and Gordon and Rees [8]. We can also write bisimulations in closed form in cases where similar bisimulation methods [26] require an inductive specification. To derive our bisimulations we follow the same technique as we did in [14], thus indicating the extensibility of this method.", "paper_title": "Bisimulations for untyped imperative objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000236905200011"}
