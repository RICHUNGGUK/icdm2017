In the proposed system, a special Feature Language is defined to translate user requirements, describe parameters of all parts, and describe their assembly relationship in a product. A product configurator and a configuration process are designed to drive 3D modeling software to create a vivid interactive VRML model automatically. A collaborative environment is introduced for customers and engineers to verify and discuss details of the product in real-time. In this way, customers have a tool to participate in product design directly together with designers, resulting in improved requirements capture and faster design response. Cooperative design of an instrumental cabinet is presented as an example that proves the feasibility of the system.", "paper_title": "Web based cooperative virtual product design environment shared by designers and customers", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800039"}
