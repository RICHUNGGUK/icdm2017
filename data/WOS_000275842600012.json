It is well known that for connected or disconnected graphs with n vertices and in edges, the inequality, M(2)/m >= M(1)/n does not always hold. Here we show that this relation holds for certain kinds of graphs.", "paper_title": "On Comparing Zagreb Indices of Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000275842600012"}
