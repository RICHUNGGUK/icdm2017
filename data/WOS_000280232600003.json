The proposed model supports the sleep and work interleaving schedule policy for sensor nodes, and it can also describe the process of multi-worm propagation in WSNs. In addition, a necessary condition for worms to spread in WSNs is derived, which may be useful in designing a secure WSN. Simulation results show that the process of worm propagation in WSNs is sensitive to the energy consumption of nodes and the sleep and work interleaving schedule policy for nodes. Therefore, this paper provides new insights for the dynamics of worm propagation in WSNs.", "paper_title": "EiSIRS: a formal model to analyze the dynamics of worm propagation in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280232600003"}
