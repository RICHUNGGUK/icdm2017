The optimization problem is formulated as a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear problem (MINLP) and solved by the MINLP solver LaGO. The algorithm generates a convex relaxation of the MINLP and applies a Branch and Cut algorithm to the relaxation. Numerical results for different demands for electric power and process steam are discussed and a sensitivity analysis is performed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
