Once these motions are considered satisfactory, they are stored in the robot's memory and played according to a high level behavioral strategy. Much time is spent in the development of the movements, and despite the significant progress made in humanoid soccer robots, the interfaces employed for the development of motions are still quite primitive. In order to accelerate development, an intuitive instruction method is desired. We propose the development of robot motions through physical interaction. In this paper we propose a \"teaching by touching\" approach; the human operator teaches a motion by directly touching the robot's body parts like a dance instructor. Teaching by directly touching is intuitive for instructors. However, the robot needs to interpret the instructor's intention since tactile communication can be ambiguous. This paper presents a method to learn the interpretation of the touch meaning and investigates, through experiments, a general (shared among different users) and intuitive touch manner.
