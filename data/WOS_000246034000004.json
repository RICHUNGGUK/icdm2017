First, during each refinement stage of our multilevel global placement framework, we replace cells based on the wirelength weighted by congestion level to reduce the routing demands of congested regions. Second, after the global placement stage, we allocate appropriate amounts of white space into different regions of the chip according to a congestion map by shifting cut lines in a top-down fashion and apply a detailed placer to legalize the placement and further reduce the half-perimeter wirelength while preserving the distribution,of white space. Experimental results show that our placement flow can achieve the best routability with the shortest routed wirelength among publicly available placement tools on IBM v2 benchmarks. Our placer obtains 100% successful routings on 16 IBM v2 benchmarks with shorter routed wirelengths by 3.1% to 24.5% compared to other placement tools. Moreover, our white, space allocation approach can significantly improve the routability of placements generated by other placement tools.", "paper_title": "Routability-driven placement and white space allocation", "paper_id": "WOS:000246034000004"}
