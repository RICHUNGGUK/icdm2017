However, there are still many security and privacy challenges impeding the wide adoption of cloud computing in this domain. In this paper, we present a novel architecture and its implementation for interorganizational data sharing, which provides a high level of security and privacy for patient data in semi-trusted cloud computing environments. This architecture features attribute-based encryption for selective access authorization and cryptographic secret sharing in order to disperse data across multiple clouds, reducing the adversarial capabilities of curious cloud providers. An implementation and evaluation by several experiments demonstrate the practical feasibility and good performance of our approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
