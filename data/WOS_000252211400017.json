The key features of our proposed architecture include reducing the number of condition branch operations by implementing content activity check, the table-derived operations, computation of boundary strength, and edge filtering operations into the edge filter unit and reducing the number of memory references by using configurable window-based architecture with noveil processing order to simultaneously process horizontal and vertical filtering. As a result, the memory performance of the proposed architecture is improved by 4 times when compared to software implementation. Moreover, the system performance significantly outperforms the previous designs as shown in the results section.", "paper_title": "Window architecture for deblocking filter in H.264/AVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000252211400017"}
