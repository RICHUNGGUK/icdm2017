This framework combines a variety of techniques to retrieve semantically related videos, based on a set of criteria which are specified automatically depending on the media's constraints. The combination of different content selection mechanisms can improve the quality of the retrieved scenes, because each technique's limitations are minimized by other techniques' strengths. We present an evaluation based on a number of experiments, which show that the retrieved results are better when all criteria are used at time.", "paper_title": "An enhanced content selection mechanism for personalization of video news programmes", "paper_id": "WOS:000286940600003"}
