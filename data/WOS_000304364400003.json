A crucial management task for the companies operating in the seaport is team-building: the problem of properly allocating the available personnel for serving the incoming ships. Teams have to be carefully arranged in order to meet several constraints, such as allocation of employees with appropriate skills, fair distribution of the working load, and turnover of the heavy/dangerous roles. This makes team-building a hard and expensive task requiring several hours of manual preparation per day. In this paper we present a system based on Answer Set Programming for the automatic generation of the teams of employees in the seaport of Gioia Tauro. The system is currently exploited in the Gioia Tauro seaport by ICO BLG, a company specialized in automobile logistics.", "paper_title": "Team-building with answer set programming in the Gioia-Tauro seaport", "paper_id": "WOS:000304364400003"}
