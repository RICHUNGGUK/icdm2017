A generic frame was developed in order to identify unknown parameters thanks to an iterative process using a meta-heuristic algorithm. It combines data obtained through structural monitoring, a mechanical model and an optimization algorithm. The quality of identification depends on the quality of the data set, on that of the mechanical model and on the algorithm efficiency. It is shown through several tests on two case studies how uncertainty or errors arising from various sources can impact the accuracy of predicted values. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
