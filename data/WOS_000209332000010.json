Despite being a multisignature, the proposed scheme's signature length is comparable to Shamir's IBS scheme. Also, only one/two extra increments of l-1 modular multiplications are added to the verification/signature time, whereby l represents the number of signers. This greatly reduced the computational load and communication costs compared to the previously proposed multisignature schemes. However, this study discovers security loopholes in the previous schemes. This study analyzes and highlights the loopholes' origins, and it proposes improvements to the original schemes, preserves the scheme's merits and enhances their security. The resultant protocol is thus suitable for wireless communications because it not only possesses security but also saves computation resources and communication bandwidth.", "paper_title": "Improving an efficient ID-based RSA multisignature", "paper_id": "WOS:000209332000010"}
