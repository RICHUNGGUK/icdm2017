These methods cover intra-domain and inter-domain TE, IP-based and MPLS-based TE. They are suitable for network optimisation, better routing of traffic for providing QoS, load balancing, protection and restoration in case of failure, etc. The toolbox is designed to be deployed as an on-line tool in an operational network, or used off-line as an optimisation tool or as a traffic engineering simulator.
