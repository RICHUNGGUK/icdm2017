The subnetworks and their connections can be regarded as the nodes and interactions of the networks, respectively, which form the networks of networks. In this new setting, the aim is to design pinning controllers on the chosen nodes of each subnetwork so as to reach synchronization behavior. Some synchronization criteria are established for reaching pinning control on networks of networks. Furthermore, the pinning scheme is designed, which shows that the nodes with very low degrees and large degrees are good candidates for applying pinning controllers. Then, the attack and robustness of the pinning scheme are discussed. Finally, a simulation example is presented to verify the theoretical analysis in this paper.", "paper_title": "Synchronization on Complex Networks of Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000344089300014"}
