We focus specifically on the research related to Wi-Fi Direct technology in order to provide better services for a wider range of Wi-Fl D2D applications. Although Wi-Fi Direct defines two power management schemes for providing energy efficiency in P2P devices, neither is sufficient for meeting the power efficiency and reliability requirements for various services. In order to alleviate this problem, the proposed scheme, which is referred to as Dynamically Synchronized Power Management (DSPM), proposes a method for synchronizing the active time slots with the data transmission intervals and adjusts the sleep and active cycles accordingly. Furthermore, transmission time slots are adjusted dynamically depending on the status of data transmission in order to further enhance the energy efficiency of D2D services while maintaining their service quality. Mathematical analysis and simulations are used to compare the proposed scheme with the existing power schemes for Wi-Fi Direct and analyze its effectiveness. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
