The behavior of the automaton is mainly determined by the support of the random variable that selects one of the sixteen possible Boolean rules, independently for each cell. A cell is said to stabilize if it will not change its state anymore after some time. We classify the one-dimensional random Boolean automata according to the positivity of their probability of stabilization. Here is an example of a consequence of our results: if the support contains at least 5 rules, then asymptotically as N -> infinity the probability of stabilization is positive, whereas there exist random Boolean cellular automata with 4 rules in their support for which this probability is 0.", "paper_title": "Stability in One-dimensional Random Boolean Cellular Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000280008000004"}
