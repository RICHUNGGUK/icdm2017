This paper presents a use-case based approach to self-diagnosis. Both a static and a dynamic model of a managed-system are distinguished with explicit functional, implementational, and operational knowledge of specific use-cases. This knowledge is used to define sensors to detect and localise anomalies at the same three levels, providing the input needed to perform informed diagnosis. The models presented can be used to automatically instrument existing distributed legacy systems.", "paper_title": "Multi-level model-based self-diagnosis of distributed object-oriented systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800007"}
