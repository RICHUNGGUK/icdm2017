In this paper, we survey those 3D/2D data registration methods that utilize 3D computer tomography or magnetic resonance images as the pre-interventional data and 2D X-ray projection images as the intra-interventional data. The 3D/2D registration methods are reviewed with respect to image modality, image,dimensionality, registration basis, geometric transformation, user interaction, optimization procedure, subject, and object of registration.
