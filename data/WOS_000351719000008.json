In this paper, to avoid the loose bounds of critical density, a bond percolation-based scheme is proposed to put the exposure-path problem into a 3D uniform lattice. Within this scheme, the tighter bonds of critical density for omnidirectional and directional sensor networks under random sensor deployment-a 3D Poisson process are derived. Extensive simulation results show that our scheme generates tighter bounds of critical density with no exposure path in 3D WSNs.", "paper_title": "Percolation Theory-Based Exposure-Path Prevention for 3D-Wireless Sensor Networks Coverage", "paper_id": "WOS:000351719000008"}
