TA enables to trace and page User Equipments (UEs). As UEs distribution and mobility patterns change over time, TA design may have to undergo revisions. For revising the TA design, the cells to be reconfigured typically have to be temporary torn down. Consequently, this will result in service interruption and \"cost\". There is always a trade-off between the performance in terms of the overall signaling overhead of the network and the reconfiguration cost. In this paper, we model this trade-off as a bi-objective optimization problem to which the solutions are characterized by Pareto-optimality. Solving the problem delivers a host of potential trade-offs among which the selection can be based on the preferences of a decision maker. An integer programming model has been developed and applied to the problem. Solving the integer programming model for various cost budget levels leads to an exact scheme for Pareto-optimization. In order to deliver Pareto-optimal solutions for large networks in one single run, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) embedded with Local Search (LS) is applied. Unlike many commonly adopted approaches in multi-objective optimization, our algorithm does not consider any weighted combination of the objectives. Comprehensive numerical results are presented in this study, using large-scale realistic or real-life network scenarios. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
