The intelligence emerges from a chaotic balance between individuality and sociality. The chaotic balances are a characteristic feature of the complex system. This paper investigates the chaotic dynamic characteristics in swarm intelligence. The swarm intelligent model namely the particle swarm ( PS) is represented as an iterated function system ( IFS). The dynamic trajectory of the particle is sensitive on the parameter values of IFS. The Lyapunov exponent and the correlation dimension are calculated and analyzed numerically for the dynamic system. Our research results illustrate that the performance of the swarm intelligent model depends on the sign of the maximum Lyapunov exponent. The particle swarm with a high maximum Lyapunov exponent usually achieves better performance, especially for multi-modal functions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
