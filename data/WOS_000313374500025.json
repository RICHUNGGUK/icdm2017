By the properties of nonsingular M-matrix and stochastic analysis techniques, we establish a set of novel,C-operator inequalities with finite modes and propose some sufficient criteria for ensuring the exponential p-stability of the equilibrium solution. The obtained results are new and improve the earlier publications. Two examples and simulations are given to demonstrate the efficiency of theoretical results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
