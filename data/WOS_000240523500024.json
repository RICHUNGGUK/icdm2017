A spotty byte error is defined as t-bit errors within a byte of length b-bit, where 1 <= t <= b, and denoted as t/b-error. This paper proposes a new error model of two spotty byte errors occurring simultaneously, i.e., t/b-error and t'/b-error, where t not equal t', called complex spotty byte errors. This paper presents two complex m-spotty byte error control codes, i.e., St/bEC-(S-t/b+S-t'/b)ED codes which correct all single t/b-errors and detect both t/b-errors and t'/b-errors simultaneously, and (S-t/b+S-t'/b)EC codes which correct both single t/b-errors and single t'/b-errors simultaneously. This paper also presents practical examples of the codes with parameter t' = 1, that is, St/bEC-(S-t/b+S)ED codes and (S-t/b+S) EC codes which require smaller check-bit length than the existing Single t/b-error Correcting and Double t/b-error Detecting (St/bEC-Dt/bED) codes and the Double t/b-error Correcting (Dt/bEC) codes, respectively.", "paper_title": "Complex m-spotty byte error control codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000240523500024"}
