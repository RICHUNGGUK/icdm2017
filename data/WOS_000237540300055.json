The system adopts the constellation model for resource management and combines the sharing and scheduling of both hardware and software license resources to address the ever-increasing demands of software resource sharing in Grid and for Service-oriented computing. The system's ability to sustain the software's legacy GUI helps reduce the complexity of system integration and enhance usability.", "paper_title": "Key techniques of software sharing for On Demand service-oriented computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300055"}
