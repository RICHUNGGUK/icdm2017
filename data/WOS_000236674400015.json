The increasing availability of parallel computers makes parallelizing some registration tasks an attractive option to increase speed. In this paper, two new deterministic, derivative-free, and intrinsically parallel optimization methods are adapted for image registration. DIviding RECTangles (DIRECT) is a global technique for linearly bounded problems, and multidirectional search (MDS) is a recent local method. The performance of DIRECT, MDS, and hybrid methods using a parallel implementation of Powell's method for local refinement, are compared. Experimental results demonstrate that DIRECT and MDS are robust, accurate, and substantially reduce computation time in parallel implementations.", "paper_title": "High-performance medical image registration using new optimization techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000236674400015"}
