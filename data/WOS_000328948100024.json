RNC possess the potential for flexible and adaptive matching of packet-level error resilience to both video content importance and variable wireless channel conditions. As the demand for massive multimedia delivery over fourth generation wireless cellular standards such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE)/LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) increases, novel video-aware transmission techniques are needed. In this paper, we investigate RNC as one such promising technique, building upon our recent work on RNC integration within the LTE/LTE-A Radio Access Network at the Multiple Access Control (MAC) layer (MAC-RNC). The paper argues that the proposed MAC-RNC solution provides fundamentally new set of opportunities for dynamic collaborative transmission, content awareness, resource allocation and unequal error protection (UEP) necessary for efficient wireless multimedia delivery in LTE/LTE-A.", "paper_title": "Random Network Coding for Multimedia Delivery Services in LTE/LTE-Advanced", "paper_id": "WOS:000328948100024"}
