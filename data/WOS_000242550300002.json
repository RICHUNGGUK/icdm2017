The main idea of the proposed method is to reformulate the classification problem as a mathematical programming problem, whose solution implies relevant feature selection and forms the classes of data. Encouraging computational results on two DNA microarray data mining problems are reported.", "paper_title": "An optimization-based approach for data classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000242550300002"}
