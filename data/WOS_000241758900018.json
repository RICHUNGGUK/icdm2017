To understand how these decisions are made, one must look directly at their neuronal substrates. We trained two monkeys on a go/no-go task which requires a saccade to a peripheral cue stimulus (go) or maintenance of fixation (no-go). We performed binary regressions on the activity of single neurons in the superior colliculus (SC), with the go/no-go decision as a predictor variable, and constructed a virtual decision function (VDF) designed to provide a good estimation of decision content and its timing in a single trial decision process. Post hoc analyses by VDF correctly predicted the monkey's choice in more than 80% of trials. These results suggest that monitoring of SC activity has sufficient capacity to predict go/no-go decisions on a trial-by-trial basis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
