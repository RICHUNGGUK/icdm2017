These are evaluated by the level of accuracy to be matched and read at the original location. Evaluation increases the need for a simulator to generate reads with their locations and errors, as with indel. In this paper, we propose a simulator, PSIM, that generating a set of artificial RNA segments(reads) with the expression level and errors based on a pattern-based SAM file. PSIM adopts the contour line transpose and interval section shuffle methods to generate a similar expression level. In addition, we show the similarity between a profile contour of synthesized data and a reference sequence.", "paper_title": "PSIM: pattern-based read simulator for RNA-seq analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000359864700024"}
