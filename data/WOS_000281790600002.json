BDF schemes are considered, and, as far as reasonable, explicit expressions for all occurring bounds are specified, exploiting prior work on the location of characteristic roots. The 2-step BDF scheme is considered in particular detail, and for problems of sectorial type, an asymptotic error expansion is derived based on damping properties of the scheme.", "paper_title": "On the stability and error structure of BDF schemes applied to linear parabolic evolution equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000281790600002"}
