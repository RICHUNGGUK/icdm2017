The proposed system simultaneously acquires the finger-vein and low-resolution fingerprint images and combines these two evidences using a novel score-level combination strategy. We examine the previously proposed finger-vein identification approaches and develop a new approach that illustrates it superiority over prior published efforts. The utility of low-resolution fingerprint images acquired from a webcam is examined to ascertain the matching performance from such images. We develop and investigate two new score-level combinations, i.e., holistic and nonlinear fusion, and comparatively evaluate them with more popular score-level fusion approaches to ascertain their effectiveness in the proposed system. The rigorous experimental results presented on the database of 6264 images from 156 subjects illustrate significant improvement in the performance, i.e., both from the authentication and recognition experiments.", "paper_title": "Human Identification Using Finger Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000302181800065"}
