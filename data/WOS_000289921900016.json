The proposed CAVLC decoder generates the length of coeff_token and total_zeros symbols with simple arithmetic operation. So, it can be implemented with reduced look-up table. And we propose multi-symbol run_before decoder which has enhanced throughput. It can decode more than 2.5 symbols in a cycle if there are run_before symbols to be decoded. The hardware cost is about 12K gates when synthesized at 125 MHz.", "paper_title": "A Novel Low-Cost High-Throughput CAVLC Decoder for H.264/AVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000289921900016"}
