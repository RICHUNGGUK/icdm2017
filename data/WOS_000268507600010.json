The existing technique of Anonymity-Preserving Data Collection partially solves this problem, but it assumes that the data do not contain any identifying information about the corresponding respondents. on the other hand, the existing technique of Privacy-Enhancing k-Anonymization can make the collected data anonymous by eliminating the identifying information. However, it assumes that each respondent submits her data through an unidentified communication channel. In this paper, we propose k-Anonymous Data Collection, which has the advantages of both Anonymity-Preserving Data Collection and Privacy-Enhancing k-Anonymization but does not rely on their assumptions described above. We give rigorous proofs for the correctness and privacy of our protocol, and experimental results for its efficiency. Furthermore, we extend our solution to the fully malicious model, in which a dishonest participant can deviate from the protocol and behave arbitrarily. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
