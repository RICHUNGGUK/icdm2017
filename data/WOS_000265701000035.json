We first analyze the features and the classification method used in real time speech/music classification algorithm in SMV, and then apply the SVM for enhanced speech/music classification. For evaluation of performance, we compare the proposed algorithm and the traditional algorithm of the SMV. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated under the various environments and shows better performance compared to the original method in the SMV.", "paper_title": "Speech/Music Classification Enhancement for 3GPP2 SMV Codec Based on Support Vector Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701000035"}
