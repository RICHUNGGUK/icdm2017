This note mainly focuses on a theoretical analysis of learning machine with negatively associated dependent input sequence. The explicit bound on the rate of uniform convergence of the empirical errors to their expected error based on negatively associated dependent input sequence is obtained by the inequality of Joag-dev and Proschan. The uniform convergence approach is used to estimate the convergence rate of the sample error of learning machine that minimize empirical risk with negatively associated dependent input sequence. In the end, we compare these bounds with previous results.", "paper_title": "The generalization performance of learning machine with NA dependent sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500082"}
