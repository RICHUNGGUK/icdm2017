The SYMARE database supports research exploring the relationship between the morphology of human outer ears and their acoustic filtering properties-a relationship that is viewed by many as holding the key to human spatial hearing and the future of 3D personal audio. The SYMARE database is comprised of acoustically measured head-related impulse responses for 61 listeners (48 male/13 female), multiple high-resolution surface mesh models (upper torso, head and ears) for these listeners obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, and the corresponding simulated HRIR data for these listeners generated using the Fast Multipole Boundary Element Method (FM-BEM). In this work, we compare acoustically measured HRIR data for 61 listeners with the listeners' corresponding simulated HRIR data generated using the FM-BEM.", "paper_title": "Creating the Sydney York Morphological and Acoustic Recordings of Ears Database", "paper_id": "WOS:000328948100004"}
