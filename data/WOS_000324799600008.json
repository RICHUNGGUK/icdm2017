However, a systematic finite sample analysis of manifold embedding algorithms largely eludes researchers. Here we present two algorithms that embed a general n-dimensional manifold into R-d (where d only depends on some key manifold properties such as its intrinsic dimension, volume and curvature) that guarantee to approximately preserve all interpoint geodesic distances.", "paper_title": "Distance Preserving Embeddings for General n-Dimensional Manifolds", "paper_id": "WOS:000324799600008"}
