Matthews introduced the notion of partial metric space in order to obtain a suitable mathematical tool for program verification (Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 728:183-197, 1994). He gave an application of this new structure to parallel computing by means of a partial metric version of the celebrated Banach fixed point theorem (Theor. Comput. Sci. 151:195-205, 1995). Later on, M. P. Schellekens introduced the theory of complexity (quasi-metric) spaces as a part of the development of a topological foundation for the asymptotic complexity analysis of programs and algorithms (Electron. Notes Theor. Comput. Sci. 1:211-232, 1995). The applicability of this theory to the asymptotic complexity analysis of Divide and Conquer algorithms was also illustrated by Schellekens. In particular, he gave a new proof, based on the use of the aforenamed Banach fixed point theorem, of the well-known fact that Mergesort algorithm has optimal asymptotic average running time of computing. In this paper, motivated by the utility of partial metrics in Computer Science, we discuss whether the Matthews fixed point theorem is a suitable tool to analyze the asymptotic complexity of algorithms in the spirit of Schellekens. Specifically, we show that a slight modification of the well-known Baire partial metric on the set of all words over an alphabet constitutes an appropriate tool to carry out the asymptotic complexity analysis of algorithms via fixed point methods without the need for assuming the convergence condition inherent to the definition of the complexity space in the Schellekens framework. Finally, in order to illustrate and to validate the developed theory we apply our results to analyze the asymptotic complexity of Quicksort, Mergesort and Largesort algorithms. Concretely we retrieve through our new approach the well-known facts that the running time of computing of Quicksort (worst case behaviour), Mergesort and Largesort (average case behaviour) are in the complexity classes O(n(2)), O(n log(2)(n)) and O(2(n - 1) - log(2)(n)), respectively.", "paper_title": "The Baire Partial Quasi-Metric Space: A Mathematical Tool for Asymptotic Complexity Analysis in Computer Science", "paper_id": "WOS:000299090700009"}
