Continuing a line of work by Honda (1993), Honda et al. (1998), and Gay & Vasconcelos (2010), among others, this paper presents GV, a linear functional language with session types, and a translation from GV into CP. The translation formalises for the first time a connection between a standard presentation of session types and linear logic, and shows how a modification to the standard presentation yields a language free from races and deadlock, where race and deadlock freedom follows from the correspondence to linear logic.", "paper_title": "Propositions as sessions", "paper_id": "WOS:000339550500007"}
