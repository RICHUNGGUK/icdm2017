Due to the lack of a third order harmonic compensation circuit, the current harmonics are high. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel structure of MCR and a genetic algorithm (GA) to determine the parameters which will result in minimum total harmonics. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes the structure and the working principle of the multi-valve controlled saturable reactor (MCSR). There are several sorts of magnetic valves in the iron cores of the MCSR. The saturation degree of each magnetic valve is different when the same direct component of the magnetic flux is generated in the iron core, therefore current harmonics of different phases emerging, i.e. the total harmonics can be reduced. The magnetization characteristics and the mathematical model of the current harmonics of the MCSR are presented by introducing three parameters. The optimal values of the parameters that result in the smallest total harmonic distortion in the output current are calculated by a GA. Findings - The simulation and experimental results are coincident with the theoretical analyses, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed method on harmonic suppression. Practical implications - The method proposed in this paper can successfully reduce the current harmonics of the conventional MCR, including but not limited to the ASC. A prototype MCSR (540 kVA/10 kV) has been designed and constructed. Originality/value - In this paper, a MCSR is proposed. The mathematical model of the MCSR for harmonic analysis is developed. The optimal parameters that result in the smallest THD in the output current are calculated. The mathematical model can be also used for the harmonic analysis of conventional MCRs.", "paper_title": "A multi-valve controlled saturable reactor and its harmonic optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000341713000020"}
