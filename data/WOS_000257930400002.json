It is a challenging task since for a specific action category, the 2D observations of different instances might be extremely different due to varying viewpoint and changes in speed. By assuming that the execution of an action can be approximated by dynamic linear combination of a set of basis shapes, a novel view invariant human action recognition method is proposed based on non-rigid matrix factorization and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We show that the low dimensional weight coefficients of basis shapes by measurement matrix non-rigid factorization contain the key information for action recognition regardless of the viewpoint changing. Based on the extracted discriminative features, the HMMs is used for temporal dynamic modeling and robust action classification. The proposed method is tested using real life sequences and promising performance is achieved.", "paper_title": "View invariant human action recognition based on factorization and HMMs", "paper_id": "WOS:000257930400002"}
