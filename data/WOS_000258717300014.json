This paper presents a simulation tool that could assist with such co-optimized designs. TrACS (Transceiver Architecture and Channel Simulator) is an RF/DSP co-simulator, capable of providing an application-specific system-level perspective to receiver design. The simulator is especially relevant in the context of energy-constrained wireless sensor node design, where the simulator's system perspective determines the compatibility of circuit topologies, modulation techniques and synchronization methods for various wireless scenarios. A few case studies are presented, which illustrate co-optimization of a ZigBEE receiver using TrACS.", "paper_title": "System co-optimization in wireless receiver design with TrACS", "paper_id": "WOS:000258717300014"}
