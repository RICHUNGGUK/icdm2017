The formulas and their implementation in hardware and software are explained and new shortband electrodes are described which generate a good homogeneous thoracic field. Examples of stroke volume and cardiac output curves underline the capabilities of the monitoring system \"Task Force (R) Monitor\". In several experiments, results are compared to thermodilution as well as to BioZ measurements: the new method excels in comparison with thermodilution and is comparable to the BioZ device. Compared to traditional electrodes, the new shorthand electrodes are shown to provide better reproducibility.
