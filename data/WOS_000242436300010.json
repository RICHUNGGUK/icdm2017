The resulting probabilistic models are optimised using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods; in particular, we introduce a modification to Wolff's algorithm to make it applicable to a segment classification model with an arbitrary duration prior. We apply this to a collection of pop songs, and show experimentally that the generated segmentations suffer much less from fragmentation than those produced by segmentation algorithms based on clustering, and are closer to an expert listener's annotations, as evaluated by two different performance measures.", "paper_title": "Using duration models to reduce fragmentation in audio segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242436300010"}
