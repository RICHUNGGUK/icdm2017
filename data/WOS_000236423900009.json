The UML meta-model is described as a combination of graphical notations, natural and formal languages. The semantics of UML elements is expressed by well-formedness rules in the UML metamodel. Their correctness is ensured by the proof of the B specifications. The approach is illustrated by a simple case study: the printing system.", "paper_title": "Verification of UML model elements using B", "paper_id": "WOS:000236423900009"}
