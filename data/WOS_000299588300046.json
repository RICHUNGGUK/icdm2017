The overall transfer function from digital PCM signals stored in a cellular phone to dummy head-recorded signals is modeled as a combination of a cellular phone transfer function (CPTF) and a cellular phone-to-listener transfer function (CPLTF). The CPTF represents the linear and nonlinear characteristics of a cellular phone and is modeled by the Volterra model. The CPLTF represents the effect of the path from a cellular phone to a dummy head and is measured. Listening tests show the effectiveness of the proposed method. An application scenario of the proposed method is also addressed for sound quality assessment of cellular phones in speakerphone mode.", "paper_title": "Efficient Reconstruction of Speakerphone-Mode Cellular Phone Sound for Application to Sound Quality Assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000299588300046"}
