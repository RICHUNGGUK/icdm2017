This has resulted in offering more dynamic and versatile methods for citizens to access certain government services. The objective of the current study is to address and posit the factors which can contribute to an understanding of citizen intention to adopt MG services. A model was used to capture citizen behavior in MG service adoption, and the results from this model are contrasted with adoption behavior for EG from a similar study. To that end, we have developed and validated a model entitled \"citizen adoption behavior of MG\" (CAB-MG).", "paper_title": "EXAMINING ADOPTION BEHAVIOR OF MOBILE GOVERNMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000208869000005"}
