Network operators are struggling to optimize their routing, but the effectiveness of those efforts is limited. In this article, we study sensitivity of routing stretch and diversity metrics to factors such as policies, topology, IGP weights, etc. using statistical techniques. We confirm previous findings that routing policies and AS size (in number of routers) are the dominating factors. Surprisingly, we find that intra-domain factors only have marginal impact on global path properties. Moreover, we study path inflation by comparing against the paths that are shortest in terms of AS-level/router-level hops or geographic distances. Overall, the majority of routes incur reasonable stretch. From the experience with our Internet-scale simulations, we find it hard to globally optimize path selection with respect to the geographic length of the routes, as long as inter-domain routing protocols do not include an explicit notion of geographic distance in the routing information.
