In such scenarios, keeping the operation going on for as long as possible is the most important aspect of the network. We propose that by placing sink at a carefully selected coordinate will results in a longer living network. We also place restrictions on the candidate locations so that the sensing quality of the network is above a useful predetermined value and the sink is placed in a relatively safe location to avoid destruction. In order to find the suitable coordinates we propose a modified lifetime metric which takes quality and safety measures into account. We also propose a genetic algorithm which uses a discrete event simulator-in-the-loop over a three dimensional terrain to find locations for the sink that fits the given quality and safety restrictions. Using a three dimensional underlying terrain makes the proposed approach more realistic. The results obtained for various sensor network scenarios indicate that the proposed algorithm can find locations that increase the lifetime by also considering the sensing quality and safety.
