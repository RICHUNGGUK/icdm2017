We investigate the size L(Sigma) (number of inner nodes) of BDD Sigma with different constraints on the number M(Sigma) of its merged nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a weighted complexity measure W(Sigma) = L(Sigma) + omega M(Sigma), where omega > 0. For the hardest Boolean function on n input variables we define the weight W-B D D (n) and the size L-B D D (n, t), where t limits the number of merged nodes. By using a new synthesis method and appropriate restrictions for the number t of merged nodes, we are able to prove tight upper and lower asymptotic bounds: W-B D D(n) = 2(n)/n (1 + log n +/- O(1)/n), L-B D D(n, t) = 2(n)/log nt(1 +/- O(1/n)), which have a relative error of O(1/n). Our results show how weight and structural restrictions of general BDDs influence the complexity of the hardest function in terms of high accuracy asymptotic bounds.", "paper_title": "High Accuracy Asymptotic Bounds on the BDD Size and Weight of the Hardest Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000285459900006"}
