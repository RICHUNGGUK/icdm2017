Less work has been made for the computation of Tchebichef moment and its inverse moment transform. In this paper, both a direct recursive algorithm and a compact algorithm are developed for the computation of Tchebichef moment. The effective recursive algorithm for inverse Tchebichef moment transform is also presented. Clenshaw's recurrence formula was used in this paper to transform kernels of the forward and inverse Tchebichef moment transform. There is no need for the proposed algorithms to compute the Tchebichef polynomial values. The approaches presented are more efficient compared with the straightforward methods, and particularly suitable for parallel VLSI implementation due to their regular and simple filter structures.
