These procedures allow one to apply different domain decompositions, different grids, and interpolation polynomials on the sub-domains at different time levels when necessary, in order to capture time-changing localized phenomena, such as, propagating fronts or moving layers. They rely on an implicit Galerkin method in the sub-domains and simple explicit flux calculation on the inter-domain boundaries by integral mean method to predict the inner-boundary conditions. Thus, the parallelism can be achieved by these procedures. These procedures are conservative both in the sub-domains and across inter-boundaries. The explicit nature of the flux prediction induces a time step limitation that is necessary to preserve stability, but this constraint is less severe than that for a fully explicit method. Stability and convergence analysis in L-2-norm are derived for these procedures. The experimental results are presented to confirm the theoretical results.
