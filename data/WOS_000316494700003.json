Currently, available tools ignore either the label relationship or the view complementarily. Motivated by the success of the vector-valued function that constructs matrix-valued kernels to explore the multilabel structure in the output space, we introduce multiview vector-valued manifold regularization ((MVMR)-M-3) to integrate multiple features. (MVMR)-M-3 exploits the complementary property of different features and discovers the intrinsic local geometry of the compact support shared by different features under the theme of manifold regularization. We conduct extensive experiments on two challenging, but popular, datasets, PASCAL VOC' 07 and MIR Flickr, and validate the effectiveness of the proposed (MVMR)-M-3 for image classification.", "paper_title": "Multiview Vector-Valued Manifold Regularization for Multilabel Image Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000316494700003"}
