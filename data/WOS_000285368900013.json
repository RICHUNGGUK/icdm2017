This article deals with the sizing of the required on-board energy between two stations in the worst case. The influence of the mechanical limitations is studied: acceleration, jerk and torque limitations. These limitations have an impact on the total energy required and thus on the size of the on-bard energy storage element. These mechanical limitations must thus to be taken into account in the energy storage design. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
