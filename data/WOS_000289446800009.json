In the latter as well as in PDE models of plasma physics and of electromechanical systems, semi-discretization in space gives rise to differential-algebraic (DAE) system of equations often of index higher than 1. In this paper we propose a new class of exponential integrators for index 2 DAEs arising from the semi-discretization of PDEs with a dominating and typically nonlinear convection term. This class of problems includes the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The integration methods are based on the backward differentiation formulae (BDF) and they can be applied without modifications in the semi-Lagrangian integration of convection diffusion problems. The approach gives improved performance at low viscosity regimes. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
