It has attracted considerable attention as a putative therapeutic target for lithium therapy in the treatment of bipolar disorder. A trio of activated cofactor Mg2+ ions is required for inositol monophosphate hydrolysis by IMPase. In the present study, computational studies, including two-layered ONIOM-based quantum mechanics/mechanical mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, molecular modeling, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, were performed to ascertain the role of the Mg2+ triad in the IMPase active site. The QM/MM calculations show that the structural identity of the nucleophilic water molecule W1 shared by Mg2+-1 and Mg2+-3, activated by Thr95/Asp47 dyad, is a hydroxide ion. Moreover, Mg2+.-3 needs to be conjugated with Mg2+-1 in the binding site to create the activated nucleophilic hydroxide ion in accordance with the three-metal ion catalytic mechanism. The MD simulation of the IMPase-substrate-Mg2+ complex shows that the three Mg2+ ions promote substrate binding and help fix the phosphate moiety of the substrate for nucleophilic attack by the hydroxide ion. When Mg2+-2 is displaced with Li+, the MD simulations of the postreaction complex indicate that the conformation of the catalytic loop (residues 33 to 44) is disrupted and water molecule W2 does not coordinate with Li+. This disruption traps the inorganic phosphate and inositolate in the active site, which lead to IMPase inhibition. By contrast, in the native Mg2+ system, the W2 ligated by Mg2+-2 and Asp200 aids in protonation of the leaving inositolate moiety.", "paper_title": "Insights into the Role of Magnesium Triad in myo-Inositol Monophosphatase: Metal Mechanism, Substrate Binding, and Lithium Therapy", "paper_id": "WOS:000308958400008"}
