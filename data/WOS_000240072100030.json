It is already known that Bounded Second-Order Unification is decidable and NP-hard, whereas general Second-Order Unification is undecidable. We prove that Bounded Second-Order Unification is NP-complete, provided that m is given in unary encoding, by proving that a size-minimal solution can be represented in polynomial space, and then applying a generalization of Plandowski's polynomial algorithm that compares compacted terms in polynomial time.", "paper_title": "Bounded second-order unification is NP-complete", "paper_id": "WOS:000240072100030"}
