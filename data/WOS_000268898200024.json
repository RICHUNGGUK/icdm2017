Besides the main ideas, we discuss issues related to our implementation and analyze numerical test applications. Our main interest lies in cosmological solutions of Einstein's field equations. Motivated by this, we also elaborate on problems of our approach for general tensorial evolution equations when certain symmetries are assumed. We restrict to U(1)- and Gowdy symmetry here.
