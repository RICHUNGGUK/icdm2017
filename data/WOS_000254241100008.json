In frontal or lateral crash situations, these injuries can be induced by pure deceleration effects or blunt trauma due to belt or steering wheel impact. Concerning the liver under frontal decelerations, how could one investigate organ behaviour leading to the injury mechanisms? This work couples experimental organ decelerations measurements (with 19 tests on cadaver trunks) and finite element simulation, provides a first analysis of the liver behaviour within the abdomen. It shows the influence of the liver attachment system that leads to liver trauma and also torsion effects between the two lobes of the liver. Injury mechanisms were evaluated through the four phases of the liver kinematics under frontal impact: (1) postero-anterior translation, (2) compression and sagittal rotation, (3) rotation in the transverse plane and (4) relaxation.", "paper_title": "Liver injuries in frontal crash situations a coupled numerical-experimental approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000254241100008"}
