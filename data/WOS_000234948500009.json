That is, we construct a key-privacy encryption scheme by using N-ary representation, and a ring signature scheme by using the repetition of evaluation of functions. We analyze precisely the properties of these schemes and show their advantage and disadvantage.", "paper_title": "Schemes for encryption with anonymity and ring signature", "paper_id": "WOS:000234948500009"}
