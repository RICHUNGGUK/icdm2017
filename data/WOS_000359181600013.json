Firstly, image background segmentation is performed and the principal gray-scale values in the segmented background are identified. By excluding the corresponding histogram bins from being expanded for data hiding, the contrast of region of interest (ROI) in medical images can be selectively enhanced. Considering the characteristics of pixel distribution, we develop a new pre-processing strategy to reduce the visual distortions that may be caused. With the proposed method, an original image can be exactly recovered from the corresponding enhanced image by hiding the side information within it. The experimental results on a set of medical images show that the visibility of ROI can be improved. Compared with the previous method, the proposed method can achieve more contrast enhancement effects and better visual quality for medical images. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
