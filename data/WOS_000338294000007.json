We present heuristic arguments in favour of this conjecture following the lines of classical arguments for the Erdos-Renyi random graph. As well as being of independent interest our groups would if our conjecture is true provide a large family of counterexamples to the conjecture of Iranmanesh and Jafarzadeh that the commuting graph of a finite group if connected must have a bounded diameter. Simulations of our model yielded explicit examples of groups whose commuting graphs have all diameters from 2 up to 10.", "paper_title": "On the Diameters of Commuting Graphs Arising from Random Skew-Symmetric Matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000338294000007"}
