However, the costs involved in collecting psychological evaluations for the sheer number of entities that exist mean that they are prohibitively impractical. In order to avoid this problem, the present article examines three types of models: a category-based neural network model, a category-based Bayesian model, and a feature-based neural network model. These models utilize the results of a statistical analysis of a Japanese corpus computing co-occurrence probabilities for word pairs, rather than using psychological evaluations. Argument strength ratings collected by a psychological experiment were found to correlate well with simulations for the category-based neural network model. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
