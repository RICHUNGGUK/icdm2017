The DIIM captures the inoperability of infrastructure systems, and therefore can easily analyse how perturbations propagate among interconnected infrastructures and how to implement effective mitigation efforts after a disaster. In this paper, based on the random recovery time distribution, we apply the Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the distributions of the economic losses for the critical interdependent infrastructure sectors after a disaster. The proposed method can provide the decision-makers the guidance in making suitable risk-management decisions as well as how the risks can be mitigated, if the disaster cannot be avoided to happen in the first place.", "paper_title": "The uncertainty recovery analysis for interdependent infrastructure systems using the dynamic inoperability input-output model", "paper_id": "WOS:000347547700013"}
