By removing redundant routes and constructing coalition agents, communication cost and negotiation complexity are reduced, and more importantly, the global performance of scheduling is improved. The performance of the PBA is evaluated via experiments with respect to the mean flow time, maximum completion time, mean tardiness, ratio of tardy parts, and ratio of intercell moves. Computational results show that compared with various heuristics, the PBA has significant advantages with respect to the performance measures considered in this paper.
