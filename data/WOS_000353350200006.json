However, when images are acquired by means of mobile devices under uncontrolled acquisition conditions, noisy images are produced and the effectiveness of the iris recognition system is significantly conditioned. This paper proposes a technique based on watershed transform for iris detection in noisy images captured by mobile devices. The method exploits the information related to limbus to segment the periocular region and merges its score with the iris' one to achieve greater accuracy in the recognition phase.
