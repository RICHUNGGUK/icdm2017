Toward this, the meshless point collocation method (MPCM) is used for MHD flow problems in channels with fully insulating or partially insulating and partially conducting walls, having rectangular, circular, elliptical or even arbitrary cross sections. MPC is a truly meshless and computationally efficient method. The maximum principle for the discrete harmonic operator in the mesh-free point collocation method has been proven very recently, and the convergence proof for the numerical solution of the Poisson problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions have been attained also. Additionally, in the present work convergence is attained for Neumann and Robin boundary conditions, accordingly. The shape functions are constructed using the Moving Least Squares (MLS) approximation. The refinement procedure with meshless methods is obtained with an easily handled and fully automated manner. We present results for Hartmann number up to 10(5). The numerical evidences of the proposed meshless method demonstrate the accuracy of the solutions after comparing with the exact solution and the conventional FEM and BEM, for the Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary conditions of interior problems with simple or complex boundaries.
