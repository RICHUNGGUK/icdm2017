These two novel flip-flops can achieve high speed and low power due to their short data paths and fewer redundant transitions. Simulation results show that the proposed semi-transparent flip-flop and dual-edge triggered semi-transparent flip-flop perform best compared with conventional flip-flops. STFF reduces the power-delay-product 33.1% compared with Antonio's sense amplifier based flip-flop. DSTFF improves the PDP 9.1% and 47.8% as compared with dual-edge triggered sense amplifier based flip-flop and high speed dual-edge triggered modified hybrid latch flip-flop respectively.", "paper_title": "Design of novel, semi-transparent flip-flops (STFF) for high speed and low power application", "paper_id": "WOS:000308814500019"}
