The protocol enables processes to take checkpoints at different frequencies so that each process can control its rollback distance. In traditional asynchronous and quasi-synchronous checkpointing protocols, the checkpoints that are not up-to-date may be used for recovery. As a result, the rollback distance is often difficult to control. In the proposed protocol, the checkpoint cycle of each process is dynamically adjusted using a pessimistic scheme so that strict 1-rollback is achieved; namely, one of the last two checkpoints of each process can be utilized for recovery.
