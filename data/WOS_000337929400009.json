By introducing a sectorwise spatial discretization using bases of accurately CP-computed eigenfunctions of carefully-chosen stationary problems, we deal with the possible highly oscillatory behavior of the wave function while keeping the dimension of the resulting ODE system low. Also for the time-integration of the ODE system a very effective CP-based approach can be used. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
