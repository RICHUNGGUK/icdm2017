It is very difficult to completely eliminate the frequency offset in practical channel scenarios. We demonstrate that the self-encoded MCSS (SE-MCSS) with iterative despreading manifests a remarkable immunity to residual frequency offset. The SE-MCSS can be an excellent candidate for the future generation of wireless services.", "paper_title": "Self-Encoded Multi-Carrier Spread Spectrum with Iterative Despreading for Random Residual Frequency Offset", "paper_id": "WOS:000322146200003"}
