Various basis representations have their distinct advantages and have their different associated multiplication architectures. In this paper, we will present a unified systolic multiplication architecture, by employing Hankel matrix-vector multiplication, for various basis representations. For various element representation in GF(2(m)), we will show that various basis multiplications can be performed by Hankel matrix-vector multiplications. A comparison with existing and similar structures has shown that the proposed architectures perform well both in space and time complexities.", "paper_title": "Unified parallel Systolic multiplier over GF(2(m))", "paper_id": "WOS:000243890200004"}
