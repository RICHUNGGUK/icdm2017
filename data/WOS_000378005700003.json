The work found in this study benefits a collaborative engineering strategy for testing available software applications, and their neutral exchange file types, which will be used in a bigger project among stakeholders in the product design or manufacturing phase. A collaborative methodology for future larger scale projects that would be done with a team, who has access to different software, has been tested on a smaller example in this study using a cordless hand drill reverse engineering project. This research aimed to establish a model for the start-up and testing of a virtual collaborative tool set-up for a future engineering collaboration on product design and realisation projects. A real case study was considered in this project to simulate a real situation, not uncommon for modern design and manufacturing projects, especially while collaborators are from mid-sized companies and working for a larger supplier. The proposed approach is a possible solution to accelerate the identification of possible problems in data conversion as early as in the design phase.", "paper_title": "Early problems identification in collaborative engineering with different product data modelling standards", "paper_id": "WOS:000378005700003"}
