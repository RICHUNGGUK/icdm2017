Adsorption energies for different surface sites of various conformations are calculated and the groove site is found to be energetically most favorable. We observed that the molecule-surface interactions might modify surface reconstruction: asymmetric surface dimers reconstruct to asymmetric dimers in opposite directions doubling the surface periodicity, which in turn gives the surface metallic properties.", "paper_title": "DIPEPTIDE ADSORPTION ON Si(100)-2 x 1 ASYMMETRIC SURFACE BY FIRST PRINCIPLES", "paper_id": "WOS:000274267700007"}
