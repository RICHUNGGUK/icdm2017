Additionally, they may also be employed to compute similarity between genes or proteins. Here, we describe and discuss a software suite we developed to implement and make publicly available some of such prediction methods and a computational technique based upon Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), which leverages both inferred and available annotations to search for semantically similar genes. The suite consists of three components. BioAnnotationPredictor is a computational software module to predict new gene-functions based upon Singular Value Decomposition of available annotations. SimilBio is a Web module that leverages annotations available or predicted by BioAnnotationPredictor to discover similarities between genes via LSI. The suite includes also SemSim, a new Web service built upon these modules to allow accessing them programmatically. We integrated SemSim in the Bio Search Computing framework (http://www.bioinformatics.deib.polimi.it/bio-seco/seco/), where users can exploit the Search Computing technology to run multi-topic complex queries on multiple integrated Web services. Accordingly, researchers may obtain ranked answers involving the computation of the functional similarity between genes in support of biomedical knowledge discovery.", "paper_title": "Software Suite for Gene and Protein Annotation Prediction and Similarity Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000359264900017"}
