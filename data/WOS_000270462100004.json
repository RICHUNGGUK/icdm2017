The applications include repairing, refuelling or the de-orbiting of a satellite, or removal of space debris. Such objects are generally non-cooperative, i.e. neither any artificial patterns used for the measurement nor grappling fixtures applied for the capture are mounted on the targets. In this article, we propose a method for autonomous rendezvous with and capturing of a non-cooperative object in space and develop a modelling and simulation system to verify the corresponding algorithms. The system, realized in VC (R) (Microsoft Visual C++) environment, is composed of seven modules: Image Processing and 3D Reconstruction, the Planning and Control of the Chaser, the Target Controller, the Dynamic Model, the Geometry Model, the Binocular Cameras Model and the Stereo Calibration Module. With the system, the closed-loop simulations, including image grabbing, image processing, pose measurement, chaser guidance, navigation and control (GNC) and the system's dynamic motion, were conducted and the key algorithms validated.", "paper_title": "A modelling and simulation system of space robot for capturing non-cooperative target", "paper_id": "WOS:000270462100004"}
