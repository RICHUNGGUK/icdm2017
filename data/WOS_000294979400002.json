The interface jump in the THINC (tangent of hyperbola for INterface capturing) scheme is adaptively scaled to a proper thickness according to the interface orientation. The numerical accuracy in computing multi-dimensional moving interfaces is significantly improved. Without any geometrical reconstruction, the proposed method is extremely simple and easy to use, and its numerical accuracy is superior to other existing methods of its kind and comparable to the conventional PLIC (piecewise linear interface calculation) type VOF schemes.
