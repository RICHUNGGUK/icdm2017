The first method has two different variants that are both based on a Monte Carlo approach, whereas the second uses the Gaver-Stehfest (GS) algorithm for the numerical inversion of the Laplace transform. If the former method is straightforward to implement, it is very much outperformed by the GS algorithm, which provides a very accurate approximation of the cumulative distribution as well as its upper quantiles. Our numerical work has a direct application in statistics: the maximal difference between a Brownian bridge and its concave majorant arises in connection with a nonparametric test for monotonicity of a density or regression curve on [0,1]. Our results can be used to construct very accurate rejection region for this test at a given asymptotic level.", "paper_title": "Efficient computation of the cdf of the maximal difference between a Brownian bridge and its concave majorant", "paper_id": "WOS:000302056900005"}
