This contribution compares different approaches for introducing spatial patterns into these dynamics. The applied techniques cover lattice gas cellular automata (LGCA), stochastic cellular automata (SCA) and partial differential equations (PDE). Even though these methods involve distinct types of spatial interaction, it can be shown, that consistent qualitative and quantitative model behaviour can be obtained by means of parameter adaptions and slight technical modifications. These modifications are motivated by stochastic analysis of distributed interaction (PDE, SCA) and diffusion dynamics (LGCA) as well as prevailing physical analogies. The law of large numbers permits to approximate stochastic contacts by distributed interaction. Diffusion of particles can be approximated through empiric adjustment of a Gaussian diffusion distribution. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
