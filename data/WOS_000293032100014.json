The driver integrates in 0.18 mu m BCD technology the cascade of the following circuits: resistor-string DAC circuitry for direct interface to a host digital processing unit, a voltage buffer between the DAC and the High-Voltage (HV) stage, and a fully-differential HV amplifier with programmable output common mode. A couple of the designed DACs permits to generate, starting from digital samples, low-voltage analog stimuli. This signal amplified up to 25 V by the HV stage provides the electrostatical actuation of the micromirror. When compared to state-of-the-art the driver offers an integrated solution with good dynamic performances.", "paper_title": "DESIGN OF AN INTEGRATED SCANNING MICROMIRROR DRIVER IN BCD TECHNOLOGY", "paper_id": "WOS:000293032100014"}
