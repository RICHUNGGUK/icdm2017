Design/methodology/approach - The operating principle and structure characteristics of the proposed three-phase 12/8-pole BSRM is analyzed in detail. Finite element method-based calculations are applied to a prototype and some important characteristics are obtained, including radial force, static torque, air-gap magnetic flux density, and effect of control winding current on the torque, where magnetic saturation is taken into account by using a nonlinear B-H curve. Findings - On the basis of the simulated results, it can be concluded that the proposed BSRM presents an excellent performance in the suspending force and in the torque. The analyzed results show that the two control-winding currents can effectively control the radial suspending forces and produce negligible effect on the motor torque, which is mainly produced by the main-winding currents. Originality/value - In this paper, a novel BSRM is proposed. Instead of the six sets of radial suspending control windings required by conventional three-phases BSRM, the proposed structure requires only two sets of suspending control windings, regardless of the phase number, leading to a simpler power converter with less power switches, thus lowering the overall system cost.", "paper_title": "A novel bearingless switched reluctance motor", "paper_id": "WOS:000313535700008"}
