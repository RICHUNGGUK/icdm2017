Financial decision-making is an area where decision support systems, knowledge-based decision support systems, and intelligent decision support systems are successfully applied. In consequence of the importance and complexity of this problem area a large number of methods of support to financial decision-making was developed. This paper presents the most important features of two decision support systems, a classical system and a system based on fuzzy logic. The performances of these two models are compared and the advantages achieved through the introduction of fuzzy concepts into the classical decision support systems are determined.", "paper_title": "Scoring Models: towards the More Realistic Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000268481800003"}
