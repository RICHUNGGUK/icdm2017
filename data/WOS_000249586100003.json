This paper briefly recaps the concepts proposed for capturing security aspects, and presents an implemented graphical CASE tool that supports the Secure Tropos methodology. Specifically, the tool supports the creation of Secure Tropos models, their translation to formal specifications, as well as the analysis of these specifications to ensure that they comply with specific security properties. Apart from presenting the tool, the paper also presents a two-tier evaluation consisting of two case studies and an experimental evaluation of the tool's scalability.", "paper_title": "Computer-aided support for secure tropos", "paper_id": "WOS:000249586100003"}
