The iterative tuning scheme, which is based on multiple iterations of least mean square (LMS) algorithm, is utilized for modifying the output of the conventional sliding window channel estimator. By using this, the proposed method is more flexible due to the tradeoff between the processing time and accuracy, which makes it more suitable for practical UWB wireless communications. Simulations are also provided for demonstrating the validation of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A sliding window method with iterative tuning for channel estimation of UWB signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093700041"}
