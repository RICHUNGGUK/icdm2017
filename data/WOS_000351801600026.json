The closed-loop NCSs are modeled as a nonlinear system with an interval time-varying delay and event-triggered communication strategy, which consider uncertainties in the networked Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model by the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) fuzzy control rules. By introducing some free weighting matrices to deal with the integral items and converting the coupling time-varying matrix inequalities into a group of decoupling matrix inequalities, a new delay-dependent stabilization criterion is firstly presented. Then, some novel criteria for the robust asymptotic stability analysis and control synthesis of the event-triggered networked T-S fuzzy systems are established in terms of matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example is exploited to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed design approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
