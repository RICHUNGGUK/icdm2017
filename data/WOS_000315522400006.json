The advantages of this new structure are justi fied by the reduction of power and area. For this purpose IIR filter block can be made with single CBSC gain stage that has the same accuracy and performance of second-order filter with two Op-amps. The design of CBSC gain stages is intended to minimize the power consumption, and maximize Modulator performance. As shown in the simulation result, for a 20-KHz signal bandwidth, the modulator achieves a dynamic range of 70.2 dB and a peak signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 68 dB with an over-sampling ratio of 64. In addition it consumes only 198 mu W from a 1.8-V power supply at 2.56 MS/s.", "paper_title": "AN ENERGY EFFICIENT SECOND-ORDER Sigma Delta MODULATOR BASED ON THE POWER AND DELAY OPTIMIZATION OF CBSC IIR FILTER", "paper_id": "WOS:000315522400006"}
