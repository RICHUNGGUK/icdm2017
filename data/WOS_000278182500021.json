We simulate the snow fall over the ground, as well as the conductive, convective and radiative thermal transfers using a finite volume method according to the variations of air and dew point temperatures, the amount of snow, cloud cover and day-night cycles. Our approach takes into account phase changes such as snow melting into water or water freezing into ice.", "paper_title": "Heat Transfer Simulation for Modeling Realistic Winter Sceneries", "paper_id": "WOS:000278182500021"}
