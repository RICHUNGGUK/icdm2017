Nevertheless, the development of new contrasts and optimization procedures is still needed, e.g. to improve the separation performances in specific cases. For example, algorithms may exploit prior information, such as the sparseness or the non-negativity of the sources. In this paper, we show that support-width minimization-based ICA algorithms may outperform other well-known ICA methods when extracting bounded sources. The output supports are estimated using symmetric differences of order statistics.", "paper_title": "Minimum support ICA using order statistics.
