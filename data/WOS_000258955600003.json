This problem has been considered in the context of ad hoc networks, where it is assumed that there is neither a secret key shared among the two parties nor a public-key infrastructure in place. A formal framework for protocols of this type is presented, along with a new protocol which is as efficient as the best previous protocols. The security of the proposed protocol is based on a new property of hash functions called 'hybrid-collision resistance'.", "paper_title": "Non-interactive two-channel message authentication based on hybrid-collision resistant hash functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000258955600003"}
