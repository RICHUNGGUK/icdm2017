The motivation comes from the problems created by the unstructured and haphazard growth of the Internet. Among the many guiding principles of Autonomic Communication is context-awareness. In this paper, we discuss architecture for context dissemination in Autonomic networks based on the Autonomous Decentralized Community Communication for information dissemination.", "paper_title": "Context dissemination for Autonomic Communication systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237211100019"}
