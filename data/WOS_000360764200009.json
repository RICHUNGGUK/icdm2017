A transformation engineer is thus left with too many choices for the language he use to perform a specific transformation task. Furthermore, it is currently not possible to combine or reuse transformations implemented in different languages. We therefore propose T-Core, a framework where primitive transformation constructs can be combined to define and encapsulate reusable model transformation idioms. In this context, the transformation engineer is free to use existing transformation building blocks from an extensible library or define his own transformation units. The proposed primitive transformation operators are the result of deconstructing different existing transformation languages. Reconstructing these languages offers a common basis to compare their expressiveness, provides a framework for inter-operating them, and allows the transformation engineer to design transformations with the most appropriate constructs for the task at hand.", "paper_title": "T-Core: a framework for custom-built model transformation engines", "paper_id": "WOS:000360764200009"}
