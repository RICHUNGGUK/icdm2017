The proposed network can be built using existing components and appears less complex and more efficient in terms of energy consumption than alternatives like optical packet switching and optical burst switching. The paper presents the multipath architecture and compares its energy consumption to that of a classical router-based Internet service provider network. A flow-aware dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm is proposed and shown to have excellent performance in terms of throughput and delay.", "paper_title": "Building a Low-Energy Transparent Optical Wide Area Network With \"Multipaths\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000313906300006"}
