The whole system is composed of a part of intelligent core and of an HF special-purpose management tool also providing the function to act as interface for the artificial intelligence training and use. To implement the smart intelligent functions, we adopted a machine learning approach. In this paper, we compare the performance of a neural network (NN), a support vector machine, a system with fuzzy rules genetically produced, and a classification and regression tree and its direct evolution, which is the random forest, in analyzing our database. Best performances in both HF severity evaluation and HF-type prediction functions are obtained by using the random forest algorithm. The management tool allows the cardiologist to populate a \"supervised database\" suitable for machine learning during his or her regular outpatient consultations. The idea comes from the fact that in literature there are a few databases of this type, and they are not scalable to our case.", "paper_title": "A Machine Learning System to Improve Heart Failure Patient Assistance", "paper_id": "WOS:000344993100002"}
