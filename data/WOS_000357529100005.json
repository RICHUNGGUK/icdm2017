Influencing CDN edge server (surrogate) selection allows the ISP to manage the rising amount of traffic emanating from CDNs to reduce the operational expenditures (OPEX) of his infrastructure, e.g., by preventing peered traffic. At the same time, including the ISP's hidden network knowledge in the surrogate selection process influences the quality of service a CDN provider can deliver positively. As a large amount of CDN traffic is video-on-demand traffic, this paper investigates the topic of CDN/ISP collaboration from a perspective of high-volume long-living flows. These types of flows are hardly manageable with state-of-the-art Dynamic Name Service (DNS)-based redirection, as a reassignment of flows during the session is difficult to achieve. Consequently, varying load of surrogates caused by flash crowds and congestion events in the ISP's network are hard to compensate. This paper presents a novel approach promoting ISP and CDN collaboration based on a minimal deployment of software-defined networking switches in the ISP's network. The approach complements standard DNS-based redirection by allowing for a migration of high-volume flows between surrogates in the backend even if the communication has state information, such as Hyper Text Transfer Protocol sessions. In addition to a proof-of-concept, the evaluation identifies factors influencing performance and shows large performance increases when compared to standard DNS-based redirection.", "paper_title": "An SDN-Based CDN/ISP Collaboration Architecture for Managing High-Volume Flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000357529100005"}
