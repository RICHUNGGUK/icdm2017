Our architecture relies upon a focused web crawler to download web documents relevant to culture. The focused crawler is a web crawler that searches and processes only those web pages that are relevant to a particular topic. After downloading the pages, we extract from each document a number of words for each thematic cultural area, filtering the documents with non-cultural content; we then create multidimensional document vectors comprising the most frequent cultural term occurrences. We calculate the dissimilarity between the cultural-related document vectors and for each cultural theme, we use cluster analysis to partition the documents into a number of clusters. Our approach is validated via a proof-of-concept application which analyzes hundreds of web pages spanning different cultural thematic areas.", "paper_title": "AN EFFECTIVE FUZZY CLUSTERING ALGORITHM FOR WEB DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION: A CASE STUDY IN CULTURAL CONTENT MINING", "paper_id": "WOS:000326446900005"}
