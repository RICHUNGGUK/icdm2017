For an instance L let FFD(L) and OPT(L) denote the number of bins used by algorithm FFD and by an optimal algorithm, respectively. In this paper we give the first complete proof of the inequality FFD(L) <= 11/9 . OPT(L) + 6/9. This result is best possible, as was shown earlier by Dosa (2007) [3]. The asymptotic coefficient 11/9 was proved already in 1973 by Johnson, but the tight bound of the additive constant was an open question for four decades. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
