Determining the actual causes of reported problems requires significant effort due to the large number of possible causes. This study presents an approach to detect problems and identify the causes of problems using multivariate SPC. This proposed method can be applied to monitor multiple measures of software process simultaneously. The measures which are detected as the major impacts to the out-of-control signals can be used to identify the causes where the partial least squares (PLS) and statistical hypothesis testing are utilized to validate the identified causes of problems in this study. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that the correlated indices can be monitored simultaneously to facilitate the causal analysis of a software process.", "paper_title": "Improvement of causal analysis using multivariate statistical process control", "paper_id": "WOS:000257959700006"}
