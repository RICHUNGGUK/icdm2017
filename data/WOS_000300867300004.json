In this paper we address the problem of minimizing the maximum curvature of a quadratic Bezier curve within a boundary constraint determined by a tetragonal concave polygon. The curve is parameterized by lengths between its control points, called the \"control lengths\". Finally, numerical results demonstrate applicability of the method to smooth a piecewise linear path resulting from a path search technique. The results apply whenever it is desired to have a smooth transition between intersecting straight lines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
