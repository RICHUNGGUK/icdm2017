However, the velocity information acquired is only the velocity component in the beam direction of the wave even if an observation plane is formed by beam scanning. Accordingly, it is difficult to know the velocity distribution in the observation plane in tree-dimensional flow. In this paper, the new idea for processing the velocity distribution in the beam direction on an observation plane for transposing to flux distribution (flow function method) has been introduced. Further, the flow in an observation domain is divided into two kinds of flows, viz., the base flow which indicates the directivity of the flow in the observation domain and the vortex which is considered a two-dimensional flow. By applying the theory of a stream function to the two-dimensional flow, and by using the physical feature of a streamline to the base flow, the velocity component v which intersects perpendicularly to the beam direction is estimated. The flow velocity distribution in a scanning plane (observation plane) can be known from these two components of velocity, viz., beam direction component U and perpendicular component to the beam direction v. The principle was explained by an example of the blood flow measurement in normal and abnormal heart chamber, by the ultrasonic Doppler method.", "paper_title": "The flow velocity distribution from the Doppler information on a plane in three-dimensional flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000234554800015"}
