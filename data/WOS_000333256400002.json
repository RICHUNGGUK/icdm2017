The steady emergence of new Internet applications, together with the use of encryption and obfuscation techniques, ensures that traffic classification remains a hot research topic. Much research has been devoted to this topic by the research community in the last decade. However, an optimal traffic classification model has yet to be defined. Many techniques and formats have been described, with the current literature therefore lacking appropriate benchmarks expressed in a consistent terminology. Moreover, existing surveys are outdated and do not include many recent advances in the field. In this article, we present a systematic multilevel taxonomy that covers a broad range of existing and recently proposed methods, together with examples of vendor classification techniques. Our taxonomy assists in defining a consistent terminology. It could be useful in future benchmarking contexts by characterizing and comparing methods at three different levels. From this perspective, we describe key features and provide design hints for future classification models, while emphasizing the main requirements for promoting future research efforts. To motivate researchers and other interested parties, we collect and share data captured from real traffic, using two models to protect data privacy.
