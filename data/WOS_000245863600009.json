Commonly deployed link state routing protocols such as OSPF react to link failures through global link state advertisements and routing table recomputations causing significant forwarding discontinuity after a failure. Careful tuning of various parameters to accelerate routing convergence may cause instability when the majority of failures are transient. To enhance failure resiliency without jeopardizing routing stability, we propose a local rerouting based approach called failure insensitive routing. The proposed approach prepares for failures using interface-specific forwarding, and upon a failure, suppresses the link state advertisement and instead triggers local rerouting using a backwarding table. With this approach, when no more than one link failure notification is suppressed, a packet is guaranteed to be forwarded along a loop-free path to its destination if such a path exists. This paper demonstrates the feasibility, reliability, and stability of our approach.", "paper_title": "Fast local rerouting for handling transient link failures", "paper_id": "WOS:000245863600009"}
