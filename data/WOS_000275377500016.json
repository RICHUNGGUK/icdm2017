By replacing the consequent part of the additive GFM rule by a non-additive function, we obtain the nonadditive GFM. The coefficients of the non-additive function then become the fuzzy measures. The defuzzified output constructed from both the premise and consequent parts of the modified GFM rules in the wake of non-additiveness takes the form of Choquet fuzzy integral. The parameters of the premise and the consequent parts of the non-additive fuzzy rules are updated based on the estimation error on the arrival of each online data to make the system adaptive. The resulting adaptive non-additive fuzzy model is applied on two benchmark applications and the results demonstrate the advantage of the adaptive feature. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
