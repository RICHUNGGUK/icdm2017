We give several examples of classes of graphs that are optimal with respect to the bounds. We prove that BIBD-graphs are characterized by their eigenvalues. Finally we present a new bound on the expansion coefficient of (c, d)-regular bipartite graphs and compare that with with a classical bound.", "paper_title": "Eigenvalues and expansion of bipartite graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000313055300010"}
