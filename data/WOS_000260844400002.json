We consider here the parallel TASEP, in which particles can jump simultaneously. On the other hand, the interest in this process comes from highway traffic modeling: it is the only solvable special case of the Nagel-Schreckenberg automation, the most populat model in that context. On the other hand, the parrallel TASEP is of some theoretical interest because the derivation of its stationary distribution, as appearing in the physics literature, is harder than that of the standard TASEP. We offer here an elementary derivation that extends the combinatorial approach we developed for the standard TASEP. In particular, we show that this stationary distribution can be expressed in terms of refinements of Catalan numbers. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
