In order to protect the high priority traffic flows and improve network performance in a heavy-loaded network, a new dynamic admission control algorithm is proposed in this paper. We firstly propose a method to fit the fractional autoregressive integrated moving average (FARIMA) models to four actual wireless traffic traces and a traffic prediction based on the upper probability limit. Our experiments show that the one-step forecasts based on the FARIMA models are better than those based on autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. We also propose a prediction -based admission control algorithm in hybrid QoS networks with WiFi access using the FARIMA models. The comprehensive simulation experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed admission control algorithm.", "paper_title": "Dynamic admission control in hybrid QoS networks with WiFi access", "paper_id": "WOS:000240614500001"}
