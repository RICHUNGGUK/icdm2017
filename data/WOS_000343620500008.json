First, in the proposed method, we aggregate linguistic terms and determine preference values of alternatives for each expert. Second, we compute the similarity degrees between the aggregated preference value of each alternative for all experts and the preference value of each alternative for each expert. Finally, it calculates the correlation coefficient between the preference order of the alternatives for all experts and the preference order of the alternatives for each expert for changing the weights of experts until the group consensus degree becomes larger than or equal to a certain predefined consensus threshold. The proposed method can overcome the drawbacks of the existing methods for autocratic decision making when using group recommendations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
