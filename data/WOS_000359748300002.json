We investigate three concrete platforms: the Intel Single-chip Cloud Computer, the Texas Instruments TMS320C6678 and the Tilera TILEmpower-Gx36. We define an execution model to safely execute dependent periodic task sets on these platforms. The four rules of the execution model entail that an off-line mapping of the application to the platform must be computed. The paper details our approach to automatically compute a valid mapping. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach, which is based on constraint programming, by applying it to several task sets that are derived from industrial applications.", "paper_title": "Off-line mapping of multi-rate dependent task sets to many-core platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000359748300002"}
