Denote by T-n(t) a tree with n vertices and n - 1 equivalent to t (mod 7). When n - 1 equivalent to 0 (mod 7) a tree with maximum Randic index has been found in [11]. In this paper we found trees of every order n >= 720 and t = 1, 2,...,6 for which the Randic index achieves its maximum value. The structure of the Max Tree - the tree with maximum Randic index R-1, is a little bit unexpected. It means that it differs from numerical results obtained by Hu, Jin, Li and Wang, but for t = 1, t = 3 and t = 5 we confirm their conjecture. The Max Tree has one vertex of the maximum degree and all adjacent vertices, except at most three, are center of (3, 4) systems. The remainder vertices can be the centers of (2, 3), (4, 5), (1, 5)* or (8(2,3), 9) systems.", "paper_title": "More on the best upper bound for the Randic index R-1 of trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000259765200026"}
