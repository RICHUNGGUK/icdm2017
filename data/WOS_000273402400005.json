The total restrained domination number of G, denoted by gamma (tr) (G), is the minimum cardinality of a TRDS of G. In this paper we characterize the claw-free graphs G of order n with gamma (tr) (G)=n. Also, we show that gamma (tr) (G)a parts per thousand currency signn-Delta+1 if G is a connected claw-free graph of order na parts per thousand yen4 with maximum degree Delta a parts per thousand currency signn-2 and minimum degree at least 2 and characterize those graphs which achieve this bound.", "paper_title": "Total restrained domination in claw-free graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000273402400005"}
