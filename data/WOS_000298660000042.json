Entropy is a key concept which provides a quantitative measurement of the uncertainty associated with uncertain variables. In order to compute the entropy more conveniently, this paper proposes some formulas of entropy of function of uncertain variables with regular uncertain distributions. Furthermore, the positive linearity property of the entropy operator is proved immediately following from these formulas at last. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
