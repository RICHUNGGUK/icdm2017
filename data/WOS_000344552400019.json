However, there are parameters, such as wind, that present a variation along terrain and time. In such cases, it is necessary to couple forest fire propagation models and complementary models, such as meteorological forecast and wind field models. This multi-model approach improves the accuracy of the predictions by introducing an overhead in the execution time. In this paper, different multi-model approaches are discussed and the results show that the propagation prediction is improved. Exploiting multi-core architectures of current processors, we can reduce the overhead introduced by complementary models.", "paper_title": "Enhancing multi-model forest fire spread prediction by exploiting multi-core parallelism", "paper_id": "WOS:000344552400019"}
