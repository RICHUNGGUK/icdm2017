The main strategy is based on region growing and pixel color difference. A rapid color similarity computing method is improved and applied for classifying different pixels. An algorithm based on corrosion from four directions is proposed to automatically extract the seed points for the serialized slices. Utilizing this method, the color slice images of the Visible Human body can be segmented in series automatically. Also, the multithreading frame of parallel computing is introduced in the entire segmentation process. This method is simple but rapid and automatic. The primary organs of the Visible Human can be segmented clearly and accurately. The 3D models of these organs after 3D reconstruction are satisfactory. This novel method can provide support to the Visible Human research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
