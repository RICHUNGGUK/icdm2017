The proposed sketch design system consists of a sketch representation and composing method, an interactive genetic algorithm (IGA)-based design model, and a user-friendly interface. The sketch representation and composing method generates feasible design sketches, based on the design parameters defined by the IGA-based design model, and the sketches are presented to customers via the user-friendly interface. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed system is effective in generating fashion design sketches reflecting users' preference. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
