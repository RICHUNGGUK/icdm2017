We present a new incremental distributed algorithm to construct a k-dominating set. The algorithm constructs a monotone family of dominating sets D(1) subset of D(2) ... subset of D(i) ... subset of D(k) such that each D(i) is an i-dominating set. For unit disk graphs, the size of each of the resulting i-dominating sets is at most six times the size of an optimal i-dominating set.", "paper_title": "Incremental Construction of k-Dominating Sets in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262993800003"}
