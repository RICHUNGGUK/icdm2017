However, VBSME is utilized in the MPEG4-AVC/H.264 standard which leads to high computational complexity and data dependency that make the hardware implementation very complex. This paper proposes a flexible VLSI architecture for full-search VBSME (FSVBSME), allowing the partitioning of the source frames into sixteen 4 x 4 sub-blocks and using a MVP scheme. A clock gating technique based on a distributed control unit is used for power saving. The proposed architecture was designed by Synopsys Design Compiler with 0.13 mu m CMOS standard cell library. Under a clock frequency of 500 MHz, it allows a power consumption of about 131 mW. Our VLSI architecture, compared with contemporary ones, can offer higher processing speed, lower power consumption, lower latency and lower gate count complexity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
