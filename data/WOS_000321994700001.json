To incorporate the effect of stratification in the simulations we have chosen a formulation that includes density as a variable in the system of equations, thus facilitating further study of buoyant flows. Given the importance of turbulence in this type of large-scale flows we have used Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to incorporate it in the calculation, using a Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) approach to solve the flow near walls. Specific initial and boundary conditions were defined. The results presented in this paper, including several tests of the solver where we compared our results with experimental or numerical data, have demonstrated the validity of using OpenFOAM to study this type of complex multiphysics problems. Especially advantageous in this regard are the flexibility provided by the modular structure of the code, the possibility of defining specific boundary and initial conditions for each case, and the ability of generating detailed meshes of complex geometries. Also we probed the benefits of using a DES approach, allowing us to solve developed turbulence and the interaction of the flow with detailed geometry. A second paper associated to this work will expose the application of the solver to large open pit mines, simulating the particular case of Chuquicamata, one of the largest open pit mines in the world, located in northern Chile.
