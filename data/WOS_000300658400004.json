This paper discusses the interaction of increasing wind, transmission constraints, renewable credits, wind and demand correlation, intermittency, carbon prices, and electricity market prices using the particular example of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas market. An estimate is made of the cost of using wind to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.", "paper_title": "Wind and Energy Markets: A Case Study of Texas", "paper_id": "WOS:000300658400004"}
