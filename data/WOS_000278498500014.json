A self-stabilizing system tolerates any kind and any finite number of transient faults, such as message loss, memory corruption, and topology change. Because such transient faults occur so frequently in mobile ad hoc networks, distributed algorithms on them should tolerate such events. In this paper, we propose a self-stabilizing distributed approximation algorithm for the minimum connected dominating set, which can be used, for example, as a virtual backbone or routing in mobile ad hoc networks. The size of the solution by our algorithm is at most 7.6 vertical bar D(opt)vertical bar + 1.4, where D(opt) is the minimum connected dominating set. The time complexity is O(k) rounds, where k is the depth of input BFS tree.", "paper_title": "A SELF-STABILIZING DISTRIBUTED APPROXIMATION ALGORITHM FOR THE MINIMUM CONNECTED DOMINATING SET", "paper_id": "WOS:000278498500014"}
