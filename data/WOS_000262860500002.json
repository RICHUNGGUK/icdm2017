Compared with traditional scheduling methods in distributed computing system such as computing grid, which emphasises execution time, the resource service scheduling in MGrid emphasises the manufacturing ability sharing, and requires higher resource service ability and reliability, therefore demands higher trust in MGrid resource service scheduling. In this paper, the measurement and evaluation models of trust-QoS in MGrid are proposed. A trust-QoS based MGrid resource service scheduling framework is proposed, followed by the scheduling algorithms. Simulation and algorithms performance comparison show that the proposed methods are sound on success rate and execution efficiency.", "paper_title": "An approach to manufacturing grid resource service scheduling based on trust-QoS", "paper_id": "WOS:000262860500002"}
