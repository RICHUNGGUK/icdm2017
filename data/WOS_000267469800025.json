Specifically, the applications are focused on opinion dynamics and job mobility phenomena. These two examples offer a first insight into multiscale issues: starting from the application, a preliminary mathematical framework taking into account both microscopic and macroscopic interactions is developed. This framework may be adapted to the modelling of a great variety of complex phenomena. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
