Registration between neighboring slices is achieved with a modified control grid interpolation algorithm that selectively accepts displacement field updates in a manner optimized for performance. A cubic interpolator is then applied to pixel intensities correlated by the displacement fields. Special considerations are made for efficiency, interpolation quality, and compression in the implementation of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the new method achieves good quality while offering dramatic improvement in efficiency relative to the best competing method.", "paper_title": "A new method for registration-based medical image interpolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000253558400008"}
