Because the disadvantages of the classical Amorphous algorithm will produce large localization error in the process of localization, an improved localization algorithm is proposed in this paper to solve the problem. The improved algorithm introduces the received signal strength threshold to modify the minimum hop from the unknown node to the beacon node. Then, Back Propagation (BP) algorithm is introduced to optimize the threshold and reduce the localization error. The simulation results show that the localization accuracy of the improved algorithm is higher than that of other algorithms and the energy consumption does not increase too much.", "paper_title": "Amorphous Localization Algorithm Based on BP Artificial Neural Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000358910900001"}
