A 3-D model is typically composed of a large number of measurements. When 3-D models of environments need to be transmitted or stored, they should be compressed efficiently to use the capacity of the communication channel or the storage medium effectively. We propose a novel compression technique based on compressive sampling applied to sparse representations of 3-D laser range measurements. The main issue here is finding highly sparse representations of the range measurements, since they do not have such representations in common domains, such as the frequency domain. To solve this problem, we develop a new algorithm to generate sparse innovations between consecutive range measurements acquired while the sensor moves. We compare the sparsity of our innovations with others generated by estimation and filtering. Furthermore, we compare the compression performance of our lossy compression method with widely used lossless and lossy compression techniques. The proposed method offers a small compression ratio and provides a reasonable compromise between the reconstruction error and processing time.", "paper_title": "Novel Compression Algorithm Based on Sparse Sampling of 3-D Laser Range Scans", "paper_id": "WOS:000321052400005"}
