The Evidential Reasoning (ER) approach, pioneered and developed by Yang, Xu and their colleagues since the early 1990's and currently with applications in a wide ranging set of domains, is among the premier methods for MCDM. While it is hard to dispute the versatility of the ER approach, a key disadvantage in the existing ER framework is that its formulation involves complex formulas with logically non-trivial proofs. This complexity forces the non-specialists to use ER as a black-box technique, and presents definite impediment for the specialists to further develop ER. A contribution of the present article is that through a conceptually simple recasting of ER into a simulation-based framework (termed SB-ER), we show that the complexity seen in the existing ER framework can be radically reduced - it now becomes logically straightforward to comprehend the inner working of ER. Further, we show that the capability of the existing ER approach can be readily extended via this simulation-based framework. Thus, owing its intellectual debt to and building upon the firm foundation of ER, SB-ER paves a promising shortcut for fine-tuning and further developing ER. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of SB-ER using a small industrial dataset. To facilitate further development, a set of Matlab source codes, which complements currently available ER-based software, is available from the author upon request. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
