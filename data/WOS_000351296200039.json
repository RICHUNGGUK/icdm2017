The proposed method can effectively avoid the failure caused by the use of inconsistent decision information and provides a decision-making idea for the case of \"the truth be held in minority\". It consists of three interrelated modules: weight determining mechanism, group consistency analysis, and ranking and selection procedure. For the first module, distance measures, expected values and arithmetic averaging operator for trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are used to determine the weight values of criteria and decision makers. For the second module, a consistency analysis and correction procedure based on trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging operator and OWA operator is developed to reduce the influence of conflicting opinions prior to the ranking process. For the third module, a trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS is used for ranking and selection. Then a procedure for the proposed MCGDM method is developed. Finally, a numerical example further illustrates the practicality and efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
