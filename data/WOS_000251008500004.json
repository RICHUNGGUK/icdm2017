MCB uses the bilingual bootstrapping as its core algorithm that leading to incremental knowledge acquisition. The EM model is applied to train parameters in a base learner. The feature translation model is improved by semantic correlation estimation. In addition we use multi- engine selection to produce qualified starting seeds from parallel corpora and monolingual corpora. Those seeds that are generated through unsupervised machine learning approaches can also ensure bootstrapping effectiveness in contrast with manually selected seeds in spite of their different selection mechanisms. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of MCB. Some factors including feature space and starting seed number are concerned involved in our experiments because the EM algorithm is sensitive to starting values. Limitation of resources is also a concern.", "paper_title": "Multi-engine collaborative bootstrapping for word sense disambiguation", "paper_id": "WOS:000251008500004"}
