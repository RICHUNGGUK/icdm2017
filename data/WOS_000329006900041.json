While a battery powers the modern embedded systems, these energy-harvesting devices power the energy-harvesting embedded systems. This claims a new energy efficient management techniques for the energy-harvesting systems dislike the previous management techniques. The higher entire system efficiency in an energy-harvesting system can be obtained by a higher generating efficiency, a higher consuming efficiency, or a higher transferring efficiency. This paper presents a generalized technique for a dynamic reconfiguration and a task scheduling considering the power loss in DC-DC converters in the system. The proposed technique minimizes the power loss in the DC-DC converter and charger of the system. The proposed technique minimizes the power loss in the DC-DC converters and charger of the system. Experiments with actual application demonstrate that our approach reduces the total energy consumption by 22% in average over the conventional approach.", "paper_title": "DC-DC Converter-Aware Task Scheduling and Dynamic Reconfiguration for Energy Harvesting Embedded Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000329006900041"}
