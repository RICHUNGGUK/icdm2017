In this paper, we present a simple algorithm for the analysis of granulometric images that consist of touching or overlapping convex objects such as coffee bean, food grain, nuts, blood cell, or cookies. The algorithm is based on certain underlying digital-geometric features embedded in their binary snapshots. The concept of an outer isothetic cover and the property of geometric convexity are used to extract the joining points (or concavity points) from the ensemble of objects. Next, a combinatorial technique is employed to determine the separator of two overlapping or neighboring objects. This technique is fully automated and it needs only integer-domain computation. The termination time of the algorithm can be tradedoff with the quality of segmentation by changing the resolution parameter. Experimental results for a variety of objects chosen from different application domains such as cell image, coffee-bean image and others demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method compared to earlier watershed-based algorithms.", "paper_title": "A Fast and Automated Granulometric Image Analysis Based on Digital Geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000352647000002"}
