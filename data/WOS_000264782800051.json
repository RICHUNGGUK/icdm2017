The paper establishes a material flow equilibrium system (EDMFES) that is applicable to embankment dam engineering and has traffic network assistant analysis function and presents in detail the embankment dam static flow equilibrium model, The system is applied to a Chinese national key project and the outcome demonstrates that the system is applicable to various types of Chinese high embankment dam engineerings and can provide material equilibrium scheme in accordance with basic data and requirements of the project supplied by the user.
