The benefit of using femtocells is the capacity and coverage extension capability. To fulfill strict quality of service requirements in next-generation mobile networks such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) or LTE-Advanced, capacity and coverage enhancing becomes rather important. On the other hand, adding small cells such as femtocells next to macrocell modifies the interference pattern of the current region. Therefore, the number of small cells in a given area should be limited. In this paper, we provide an analytic framework to calculate the outage probability for a macrocell user in OFDM-based femtocell networks when the deployed femto base stations are composing an independent Poisson cluster process such as Thomas cluster process. Cluster-based femtocell modeling offers accurate network planning for mobile operators. In this cluster-based realization, we give an interference characterization and consider the outage probability for a randomly deployed user when communication channel is infected with Rayleigh fading.
