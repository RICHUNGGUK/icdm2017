We show that part of the host-interference in SS-based watermarking is beneficial to blind watermark extraction or detection, and can be utilized rather than removed. Utilizing this positive effect of the host itself can improve the watermark robustness without significantly sacrificing the media fidelity. The proposed strategy is realized by selectively applying improved SS (ISS) modulation to traditional SS watermarking. Theoretically, the error probability of the new method under additive white Gaussian noise attacks is several orders of magnitude lower than that of ISS for high signal-to-watermark ratios, and the required minimum watermark power is reduced by 3 dB. Experiments were conducted on real audio signals, and the results show that our scheme is robust against most of common attacks even in high-transparency or high-payload applications.", "paper_title": "Selective Host-Interference Cancellation: A New Informed Embedding Strategy for Spread Spectrum Watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000305204400008"}
