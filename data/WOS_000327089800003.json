To measure saliency of pixels in a given image, we segment the image into patches by a fixed scale and then use principal component analysis to reduce the dimensions which are noises with respect to the saliency calculation. The dissimilarities between a patch and other patches, which indicate the patch's saliency, are computed based on the dissimilarity of colors and the spatial distance. Finally, we implement our algorithm through multiple scales that further decrease the saliency of background. Our method is compared with other saliency detection approaches on two public image datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on predicting human fixations and salient object segmentation.", "paper_title": "A New Framework for Multiscale Saliency Detection Based on Image Patches", "paper_id": "WOS:000327089800003"}
