A ubiquitous mobile-web interaction server, accessible with a variety of mobile Internet devices, could be a unified estimation hub in real-time analysis of human-centric mobile-web interactions. We propose the real-time analysis scheme based on real-time estimation of time-based usability and accessibility for human mobile-web interactions with a name-based directory server for social networking in the ubiquitous Internet environment. We present an implementation of a ubiquitous mobile-web directory service and discuss our approach with some empirical results.", "paper_title": "Real-time Analysis of Time-based Usability and Accessibility for Human Mobile-Web Interactions in the Ubiquitous Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000284089700003"}
