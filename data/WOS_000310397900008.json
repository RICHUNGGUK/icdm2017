This method is implemented on hardware system using FPGA. We take advantages of Content Addressable Memory (CAM) which has an ability of matching mode for designing the system. The CAM blocks have been designed using available memory blocks of the FPGA device to save access times of the whole system. The entire memory can return multi-match results concurrently. The system operates based on the CAMs for pattern matching, in a parallel manner, to output multiple addresses of multi-match results. Based on the parallel multi-match operations, the system can be applied for pattern matching with various required constraint conditions without using any search principles. The very fast multi-match results are achieved at 60 ns with the operation frequency 50 MHz. This increases the search performance of the information detection system which uses this method as the core system.", "paper_title": "An FPGA-Based Information Detection Hardware System Employing Multi-Match Content Addressable Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000310397900008"}
