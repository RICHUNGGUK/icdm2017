The main purpose of the MATMS is the optimised management of CBN grinding wheels for nickel base alloy turbine blade fabrication while operating in a multiple-supplier network environment made uncertain by external tool manufacturers showing unreliable tool delivery time response. Emergent synthesis concepts for tool management are analysed and discussed, and the design and functioning of Flexible Tool Management Strategies (FTMS), founded on an emergent synthesis methodology based on neuro-fuzzy paradigms, is illustrated. The FTMS paradigms, integrated in the MATMS as domain specific problem solving functions of the agent responsible tool inventory sizing and control, are proposed as dependable and robust toll delivery time forecasting methods, founded on knowledge evolution, for the solution of this Class II synthesis problem. The evaluation and comparison of the FTMS performance is carried out with reference to real industrial cases of CBN grinding wheel tool management. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
