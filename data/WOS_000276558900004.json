Inspired by vortex and actuator disk methods, the AS concept consists of using porous surfaces carrying velocity and pressure discontinuities to model the action of lifting surfaces on the flow. The underlying principles and mathematics associated with AS are first reviewed, as well as their implementation in a CVFEM. Results are presented for idealized 2D cases with analytical solutions, as well as for the 3D cases of a finite wing and an experimental wind turbine. In the case of the finite wing, wake induction is well handled by the model with accurate predictions of induced angles and drag when compared with the Prandtl lifting line model. Comparisons with volume force approaches, often used to model the action of propellers or wind turbine blades in a simplified analysis, show that the AS concept has some interesting advantages in terms of accuracy and respect of flow physics. This new approach is easy and rapid to embed in most computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods. It is applicable to a wide range of problems involving thin lifting devices like finite wings, propellers, helicopter or wind turbine blades.
