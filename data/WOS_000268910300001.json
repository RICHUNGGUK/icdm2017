First we present an approach, which is called infinite place model, described using modified fuzzy Petri net, with uses a new place definition based on physical infinity state concept. This method has some practical difficulties, which are taking care of in the second approach called variation model. This paper presents the above methodologies with some definitions and a necessary and sufficient condition for stability of a class of linguistic fuzzy system. This stability analysis is verified using some benchmark systems simulations", "paper_title": "A NEW METHOD FOR LINGUISTIC MODELING WITH STABILITY ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000268910300001"}
