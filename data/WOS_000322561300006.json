Time plays a more and more important role in collaborative filtering. However, there is a gap in one class collaborative filtering (OCCF). On the basis of collecting different real-time information, this paper proposes an optimization model for e-retailers. Through comparing different methods with different weights, results show that real-time dependent in OCCF performs better in improving the quality of recommendation. The model is effective in cross-selling e-commerce, personalized, targeted recommendation sales.", "paper_title": "A Model for Collaborative Filtering Recommendation in E-Commerce Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000322561300006"}
