This paper reviews the recent development of relevant technologies from the perspectives of computer vision and pattern recognition. The covered topics include multi-camera calibration, computing the topology of camera networks, multi-camera tracking, object re-identification, multi-camera activity analysis and cooperative video surveillance both with active and static cameras. Detailed descriptions of their technical challenges and comparison of different solutions are provided. It emphasizes the connection and integration of different modules in various environments and application scenarios. According to the most recent works, some problems can be jointly solved in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy. With the fast development of surveillance systems, the scales and complexities of camera networks are increasing and the monitored environments are becoming more and more complicated and crowded. This paper discusses how to face these emerging challenges. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
