ORPD problem is a multi-variable problem with non-linear characteristics and has established significant emphasize on secure and economical operation of power systems. Therefore, finding an effective algorithm to solve this problem is absorbing a growing attention among the academics. In this paper, a reliable and effective algorithm is introduced by combining modified teaching learning algorithm (MTLA) and double differential evolution (DDE) algorithm in order to handle the ORPD problem. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is applied to ORPD problem on IEEE 14-bus, IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus power systems for performance assessment and validation purposes. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed hybrid algorithm and show faster convergence and better solutions in comparison with previously reported algorithms.
