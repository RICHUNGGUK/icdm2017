Tandem mass spectrometry has the potential to provide a high-throughput method for biologists to identify peptides in complex samples. In this chapter, we provide an introduction to how tandem mass spectrometry works and how it may be used for peptide identification. We discuss two techniques for analyzing mass spectra, de novo sequencing and protein sequence database search. Finally, we present an experimental comparison of OMSSA, X!Tandem and Mascot, three popular protein database search algorithms used in peptide identification. We find these search algorithms are of comparable precision and can generally correctly identify peptides for mass spectra of high quality. However, low quality mass spectra present problems for all three algorithms and can lead to many incorrect peptide identifications. Improving algorithms for peptide identification using tandem mass spectrometry should thus be a rewarding area of research.", "paper_title": "Peptide identification via tandem mass spectrometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000243217700006"}
