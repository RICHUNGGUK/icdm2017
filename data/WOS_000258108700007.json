For the problem of function approximation, we developed a new approach combining two intelligent methods. At first we used an algorithm based on the notions of rough set theory as a preprocessor to our information system. Afterward an artificial neural network is employed as a function approximator to obtain values for decision attributes of information system while values of condition ones are passed to the network. This method has been applied to a real problem of approximating values for two hydraulic-geotechnical control variables of rubble mound breakwaters, and the results have been discussed.", "paper_title": "An intelligent data mining approach using neuro-rough hybridization to discover hidden knowledge from information systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000258108700007"}
