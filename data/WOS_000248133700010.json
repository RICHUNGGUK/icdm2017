Because of its notorious difficulties, aligning sequences within a constant band (c-diagonal) is a popular practice in bioinformatics with good practical results [D. Sankoff, J.

However, the problem is still NP-hard for multiple sequences. In this paper, we present a theoretical study of this problem. In particular, for arbitrarily small epsilon > 0, we present polynomial time algorithms that produce a multiple alignment (not necessarily c-diagonal) with cost at most I + epsilon times the cost of the optimal c-diagonal alignment, under standard models of both SP alignment and consensus (star) alignment. Our algorithms for consensus alignment allow very general score schemes. In order to prove our main results, we also present similar results for SP alignment and consensus alignment, allowing only constant number of insertion and deletion gaps (of arbitrary length) per sequence on the average. These results are interesting in their own rights and they improve some results in [M. Li, B. Ma, L. Wang, Finding similar regions in many sequences, in: Proc. 3 1 st ACM Symp.
