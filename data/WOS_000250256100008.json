In the literature, the continuous multicriteria location problem in two-dimensional spaces has received special attention in the last years, although only particular instances of convex functions have been considered. Our approach only requires the functions to be strictly quasiconvex and inf-compact. We obtain a geometrical description that provides a unified approach to handle multicriteria location models in two-dimensional spaces which has been implemented in MATHEMATICA.
