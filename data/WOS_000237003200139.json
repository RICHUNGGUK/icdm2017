We vectorized FFT kernels using Intel's Streaming SIMI) Extensions 2 (SSE2) instructions. We show that a combination of the vectorization and block three-dimensional FFT algorithm improves performance effectively. Performance results of three-dimensional FFTs on a dual Xeon 2.8 GHz PC SMP cluster are reported. We successfully achieved performance of over 5 GFLOPS on a 16-node dual Xeon 2.8 GHz PC SMP cluster.", "paper_title": "An implementation of parallel 3-D FFT using short vector SIMD instructions on clusters of PCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000237003200139"}
