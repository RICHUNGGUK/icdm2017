In such pay-per-use models, users are charged for services based on their usage and on the fulfilment of QoS constraints; execution time and cost are two common QoS requirements. Therefore, to produce effective scheduling maps, service pricing must be considered while optimising execution performance. In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous Budget Constrained Scheduling (HBCS) algorithm that guarantees an execution cost within the user's specified budget and that minimises the execution time of the user's application. The results presented show that our algorithm achieves lower makespans, with a guaranteed cost per application and with a lower time complexity than other budget-constrained state-of-the-art algorithms. The improvements are particularly high for more heterogeneous systems, in which a reduction of 30 % in execution time was achieved while maintaining the same budget level.", "paper_title": "A Budget Constrained Scheduling Algorithm for Workflow Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000345626100005"}
