Therefore the roaming services with the predefined security associations among all of the mobile devices in various networks is especially complex and difficult. Furthermore, there has been little study of security coordination for realistic autonomic system capable of authenticating users with different kinds of user interfaces, efficient context modeling with user profiles on Smart Cards, and providing pervasive access service by setting roaming agreements with a variety of wireless network operators. This paper proposes a Smart Card based security management framework that supports the capability of interoperator roaming with the pervasive security services among the network domains. Our proposed system with Roaming Coordinator is more open, secure, and easy to update for security services throughout the different network domains such as public wireless local area networks (PWLANs), 3G cellular networks and wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs).", "paper_title": "A security management framework with roaming coordinator for pervasive services", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800029"}
