Particularly in scientific fields investigating data relations, observation and analysis of relation among diverse data sets has begun to play a role of great importance. A graph is a representative expression for the purpose and many graph viewers and tools prevail today. However, most of these graph viewers do not offer the capability for displaying graphs on a multi-monitor visualization environment, even though multi-monitor visualization environment facilitates scientists in understanding data in a more detailed and intuitive manner. In this paper, our first exploration towards a high resolution graph viewer for a multi-monitor visualization environment is explored and reported.", "paper_title": "Research Note: A High Resolution Graph Viewer for Multi-monitor Visualization Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000364474900002"}
