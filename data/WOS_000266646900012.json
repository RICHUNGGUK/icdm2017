It is a broad field in which the aim is to optimise and facilitate supply chain operations by balancing between quality improvement and cost reduction. This research proposes a dynamic adaptive Genetic Algorithm that includes a chromosome refinement procedure to adjust the structure and order of the genes within the chromosome. The method improves the search efficiency in a complex space by locating near-global optimal solutions. The proposed approach is implemented as a process parameter controller that allows the values of the production and quality control variables to be adjusted at the run-time. A case study involving various evaluation criteria and a number of variables in multiple supply chains within a mixed production problem domain is adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
