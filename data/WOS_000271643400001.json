It is because that the abnormal patterns of a control chart can reveal the potential problem of machining quality. In order to improve the recognition rate and efficiency of control chart patterns, a neural network-numerical fitting (NN-NF) model is proposed to recognize different control chart patterns. A back propagation (BP) network is first used to recognize control chart patterns preliminarily. And then, numerical fitting method is adopted to estimate the parameters and specific types of the patterns, which is different from the traditional neural network-based control chart pattern recognition methods. Based on this, Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate training and testing data samples. The results of simulated experiment show that training time of this NN-NF model can be reduced. At the same time, the recognition rate can also be improved. At last, a real example is also provided to illustrate the NN-NF model.", "paper_title": "Recognizing control chart patterns with neural network and numerical fitting", "paper_id": "WOS:000271643400001"}
