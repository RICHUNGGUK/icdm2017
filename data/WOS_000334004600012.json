This paper addresses a need for Arabic font recognition research by introducing an Arabic font recognition database consisting of 40 fonts, 10 sizes (ranging from 8 to 24 points) and 4 styles (viz, normal, bold, italic, and bold italic). The database is split into three sets (viz. training, validation, and testing). The database is freely available to researchers.(1) Moreover, we introduce a baseline font recognition system for benchmarking purposes, and report identification rates on our KAFD database and the Arabic Printed Text Image (APTI) database with 20 and 10 fonts, respectively. The best recognition rates are achieved using log-Gabor filters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "KAFD Arabic font database", "paper_id": "WOS:000334004600012"}
