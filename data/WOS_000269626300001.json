In this paper, we proposed a method of concept categorization with the use of personal ontology to evaluate and select more suitable service according to the preferences of users. We use the attributes of 'reputation' 'compliance', 'verity', and 'user ranking' for our evaluation of service quality. In addition, a new attribute called 'reformation' is also added to evaluate service quality. Based oil the evaluation attributes, a fuzzy reasoning method is used for service selection. Our method is to aide the evaluation process with user preferences to reflect the fact that the user difference will affect the selection of different service providers. A system prototype has been built for determining the feasibility of our approach.", "paper_title": "Service Quality Evaluation by Personal Ontology", "paper_id": "WOS:000269626300001"}
