We focus on acyclic directed graph (DAG): a new algorithm to build a DAG, given an ordering among random variables, is described and peculiarities and advantages of this approach are discussed. Moreover, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a perfect map representing an independence model and we describe an algorithm based on this characterization.
