ALAR, to achieve anonymous delivery in Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networks. The objectives of ALAR are to minimize the probability of a data source being localized and to maximize the destination's probability of receiving the message. ALAR can protect the sender's location privacy through message fragmentation and forwarding each segment to different receivers. ALAR is validated on two real-world human mobility datasets. This study indicates that ALAR increases the sender's anonymity performance by over 81% in different adversary densities with a 5% reduction in delivery ratio. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
