Based on the work of Willsky and Jones [50], we propose a modified Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) test, allowing detection, isolation and estimation of multiple sequential faults. Our contribution aims to maximise the rate of good decision of fault detection, using another updating strategy. This is based on a reference model updated on line after each detection and isolation of one jump. To reduce the computational requirement, the passive GLR test will be derived from a state estimator designed on a fixed reference model directly sensitive to system changes. We will show that the active and passive GLR tests give an interesting result compared with the GLR of Willsky and Jones [50], and can be easily integrated in a reconfigurable Fault-Tolerant Control System (FTCS) to asymptotically recover the nominal system performances of the jump-free system.", "paper_title": "A GENERALIZED LIKELIHOOD RATIO TEST FOR A FAULT-TOLERANT CONTROL SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000301405300015"}
