MANETs (Mobile Ad hoc NETworks) have become a promising solution to set up a network with any mobile device. Routing in MANET is still a difficult task since the mobility of the nodes affects the local connections and makes the network topology change constantly. Traditional routing protocols in MANET work sending periodic messages to realize the changes in the topology in order to maintain the local connections up-to-date. However, sending periodic messages at a fixed rate can cause overhead in situations where it can be prevented and thus reduced. In this paper, we introduce a scheme to improve the performance of the routing protocols used in MANET focusing on the reduction of the overhead. In the proposed scheme, instead of sending periodic messages at a fixed rate, we use a link change rate estimation to dynamically adjust the rate at which each node sends the control messages. The link change rate estimation is based on the constant measurement of the local connectivity that reflects the network conditions. We evaluate the performance of our scheme using ns-2 and we compare it to other approaches to show its advantages. With the usage of our scheme, we notice a considerable reduction of the overhead without sacrificing the overall performance of the tested protocols. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
