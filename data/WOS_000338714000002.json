Preliminary results based on implementation and analysis show that CoLoR is promising since it satisfies many requirements of the future Internet, including being information-centric, encouraging innovations, and providing efficient support for mobility, multicast, multi-homing, and middleboxes.", "paper_title": "CoLoR: An Information-Centric Internet Architecture for Innovations", "paper_id": "WOS:000338714000002"}
