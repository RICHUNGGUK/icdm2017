In this article, we study how to apply SDN concept to a wireless mesh network that has been widely adopted by various applications. We first propose a novel architecture of SD-WMNs, and identify several critical challenges. Since wireless spectrum is a scarce resource that is shared by both data and control traffic in SD-WMNs, we propose three spectrum allocation and scheduling algorithms, namely FB-NS, NFB-NS, and NFB-S that orchestrate both control and data traffic. Finally, performance is evaluated via extensive simulations.", "paper_title": "Software-Defined Wireless Mesh Networks: Architecture and Traffic Orchestration", "paper_id": "WOS:000358622400005"}
