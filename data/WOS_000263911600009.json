Blurring is achieved by nonlinearly interpolating mipmap images generated from a pinhole image. Major artifacts common in the postfiltering techniques such as a bilinear magnification artifact, intensity leakage, and blurring discontinuity are practically eliminated via magnification with a circular filter, anisotropic mipmapping, and smoothing of blurring degrees. The whole framework is accelerated using GPU programs for constant and scalable real-time performance required for virtual reality. We also compare our method to recent GPU-based methods in terms of image quality and rendering performance.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Depth-of-Field Rendering Using Anisotropically Filtered Mipmap Interpolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000263911600009"}
