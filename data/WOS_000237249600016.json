Both types of algorithms have their own drawbacks. Single-Link suffers from the well-known single-link effect and is not robust against noise objects. Furthermore, the interpretability of the resulting dendrogram deteriorates heavily with increasing database size. OPTICS overcomes these limitations by using a density estimator for data grouping and computing a reachability diagram which provides a clear presentation of the hierarchical clustering structure even for large data sets. However, it requires a non-intuitive parameter, that has significant impact on the performance of the algorithm and the accuracy of the results. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient k-nearest neighbor join closest-pair ranking algorithm to overcome the problems of both worlds. Our density-link clustering algorithm uses a similar density estimator for data grouping, but does not require the E parameter of OPTICS and thus produces the optimal result w.r.t. accuracy. In addition, it provides a significant performance boosting over Single-Link and OPTICS. Our experiments show both, the improvement of accuracy as well as the efficiency acceleration of our method compared to Single-Link and OPTICS.", "paper_title": "DeLiClu: Boosting robustness, completeness, usability, and efficiency of hierarchical clustering by a closest pair ranking", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600016"}
