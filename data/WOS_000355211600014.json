The system's health condition and subsystem effectiveness have a direct effect on safety. This study evaluates the system effectiveness of a health management system for MSA within a framework of a system condition assessment and subsystem effectiveness evaluation using comprehensive-integrated-evaluation technology. The framework for this study is based on two main thoughts: The first is the necessity to focus on the problem of the integrated-system-health-management-oriented effectiveness evaluation, which has rarely been looked at from this perspective, and the second is the necessity to consider the interactivity of the criteria to ensure a determination of the evaluation result. In the scope of this study, first, the system condition was assessed, and then, an effectiveness evaluation was conducted on the test subsystem selected based on the system condition assessment, which was shown to provide a strong basis for decision making.", "paper_title": "ISHM-Oriented Hierarchical Effectiveness Evaluation Approach for Spacecraft Avionics", "paper_id": "WOS:000355211600014"}
