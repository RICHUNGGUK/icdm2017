By definition, these codes are left ideals in a certain skew polynomial ring. Using that the skew polynomial ring is isomorphic to a matrix ring we can describe the algebraic parameters of the codes in a more accessible way. We show that the existence of such codes with given algebraic parameters can be reduced to the solvability of a modified rook problem. It is our strong belief that the rook problem is always solvable, and we present solutions in particular cases.", "paper_title": "A matrix ring description for cyclic convolutional codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000254707800004"}
