Simulations on two illustrative networks were used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. In this paper, the performance of the proposed leak detection and identification methodology was evaluated using experiments with compressed air on a laboratory scale network. The on-line applicability of the proposed methodology was demonstrated through field level leak detection tests carried out on a 204.7km long pipeline in India, supplying natural gas to a power plant. The laboratory and field tests demonstrated that the proposed methodology can be used for quick on-line detection of leaks, and locating the leaks reasonably accurately. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
