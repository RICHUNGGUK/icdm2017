It includes a substrate network and a high resistive component to accurately capture the substrate eddy current effect, skin and proximity effects at high frequencies. The proposed model shows a good match with the measurement results over a frequency range of up to 20 GHz. An automated parameter extraction and optimization procedure has been developed using equivalent circuit analysis and particle swarm optimization. We achieved good scalability for all model parameters with respect to spiral layout geometry.
