Under a cluster-based network design, Chase combining (Chase, IEEE Transactions on Communications 33(5): 385-393, 1985) is used together with FEC to improve the link layer reliability. This approach is different from how combining is used in the conventional hybrid ARQ, which is in a sequential way. The analytical results and the simulations show that with the cooperation of nodes in a clustering network, the link reliability will be greatly improved with the same power consumption. We also show that not only transmission power is greatly reduced, but also the aggregate power consumption for a successful transmission and reception.", "paper_title": "Energy-efficient cluster-based cooperative FEC in wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270898800001"}
