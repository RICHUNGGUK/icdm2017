Combining these challenges by relating them to user preference and customization only complicates the matter further. The goal of this survey is to give an overview of the current situation in the branches of research that are involved in annotation, relation and presentation to a user by preference. This paper will present some current models and techniques being researched to model ontology, preference, context, and presentation and bring them together in a chain of ideas that leads from raw uninformed data to an actual usable user interface that adapts with user preference and customization.", "paper_title": "Personalization in multimedia retrieval: A survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000286103800010"}
