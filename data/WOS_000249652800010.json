The scheme uses a preemption weight consisting of two terms: the first term is a function of the size of the burst and the second term is the product of the hop count times the length of the lightpath of the burst. The second term is adjusted by a minimum function to prevent the problem of reverse unfairness. Extensive simulation tests showed that the application of the scheme results in higher throughput and at the same time improves the fairness coefficient. The scheme is further enhanced by combining it with a fairness-improving scheme previously proposed in the literature. Detailed performance tests are presented and analyzed.", "paper_title": "Concurrent enhancement of network throughput and fairness in optical burst switching environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000249652800010"}
