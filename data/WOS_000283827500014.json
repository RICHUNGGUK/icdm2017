The proposed FVC scheme encodes two secret images into two dual-purpose transparencies. Stacking the two transparencies can reveal one secret image. Flipping one of the two transparencies and then stacking with the other transparency can reveal the second secret image. The proposed scheme is proved to have conditionally optimal contrast: its contrast is optimal if the double-secrets non-expanded FVC scheme is required to have perfect security. The perfect security is also proved. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
