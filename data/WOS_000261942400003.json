After introducing an auxiliary state model a finite-spectrum observer is designed to close a stabilizing state feedback. The observer finite spectrum is the key to implement a state feedback stabilization scheme and to apply the affine parametrization in controller design. On the basis of the so-called RQ-meromorphic functions an algebraic solution to the problem of time-delay system stabilization and control is presented that practically provides a finite spectrum assignment of the control loop.", "paper_title": "MEROMORPHIC OBSERVER-BASED POLE ASSIGNMENT IN TIME DELAY SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261942400003"}
