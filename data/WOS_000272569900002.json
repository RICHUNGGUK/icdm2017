In this paper, the computational burden is relieved by frequency sweep algorithm or mode acceleration method for a reduced-order system constructed by algebraic substructuring, a variant of model order reduction. The two methods are compared with the help of numerical experiments and their computational complexity. As demonstrated by the finite element simulations, in which proportional damping is assumed, of a turbo-prop aircraft and a ring resonator, the frequency sweep algorithm for reduced-order systems shows the best performance among all considered numerical solutions, including the conventional approach.
