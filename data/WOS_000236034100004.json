Exact methods (such as ray tracing, and multiple light source simulation) are too slow, while approximate methods often overestimate the umbra regions. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm based on the shadow map method to quickly and highly accurately render soft shadows produced by a light source. Our method builds inner and outer translucent fins on objects to represent the penumbra area inside and outside hard shadows, respectively. The fins are traced into multilayered light space maps to store illuminance adjustment to shadows. The viewing space illuminance buffer is then calculated using those maps. Finally, by blending illuminance and shading, a scene with highly accurate soft shadow effects is produced. Our method does not suffer from umbra overestimation. Physical relations between light, objects and shadows demonstrate the soundness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Rendering soft shadows using multilayered shadow fins", "paper_id": "WOS:000236034100004"}
