In order to understand how this interaction is affected by different macrocyclic ligands, O-2 was bonded to iron-tetraaza[14] annulene (FeTAA), irontetramethyl- tetraaza[14] annulene (FeTMTAA), ironhexamethyl- tetraaza[14] annulene (FeHMTAA), iron dibenzotetraaza[14] annulene (FeDBTAA), and two irontetramethyl- dibenzotetraaza[14] annulene complexes (FeTMDBTAA1, FeTMDBTAA2). The ground state for FeN4-O-2 adducts was the open-shell singlet. Analysis of the factors influencing the O-2 bonding process showed that different macrocyclic ligands yielded adducts with differences in O-O and Fe-O-2 bond lengths, total charge over the O-2 fragment, O-O vibrational frequency, and spin density in the O-2 fragment. A smaller energy gap between the a-HOMO of the FeN4 complexes and the beta-LUMO of O-2 increased the interaction between the complex and the O-2 molecule. The order of activity was FeDBTAA< FeTMDBTAA2< FeTMDBTAA1< FeTAA< FeTMTAA< FeHMTAA.", "paper_title": "Quantum chemical DFT study of the interaction between molecular oxygen and FeN4 complexes, and effect of the macrocyclic ligand", "paper_id": "WOS:000332180100026"}
