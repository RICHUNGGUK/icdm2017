A manipulator with multiple flexible links is a multivariable system of considerable complexity due to the inter-link coupling effects that are present in both rigid and flexible motions. Modelling and controlling the dynamics of such manipulators is therefore difficult. The proposed HFNC scheme generates control actions combining contributions form both a fuzzy controller and a neural controller. The primary loop of the proposed HFNC contains a fuzzy controller and a neural network controller in the secondary loop to compensate for the coupling effects due to the rigid and flexible motion along with the inter-link coupling. It has been ascertained from the present investigation that the proposed soft-computing-based controller works effectively in the tracking control of such a multi-link flexible manipulator. The results are extendable to other multivariable systems of similar complexity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
