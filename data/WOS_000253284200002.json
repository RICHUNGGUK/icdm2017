Cerny conjectured in 1964 that every n-state synchronizable DFA possesses a synchronizing word of length at most (n - 1)(2). We consider automata with aperiodic transition monoid (such automata are called aperiodic). We show that every synchronizable n-state aperiodic DFA has a synchronizing word of length at most n(n - 1)/2. Thus, for aperiodic automata as well as for automata accepting only star-free languages, the Cerny conjecture holds true.", "paper_title": "The Cerny conjecture for aperiodic automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000253284200002"}
