Compared to earlier attempts for finding genes, the recent techniques are significantly more accurate and reliable. Many of the current gene-finding methods employ computational intelligence techniques that are known to be more robust when dealing with uncertainty and imprecision. In this paper, a detailed survey on the existing classical and computational intelligence based methods for gene identification is carried out. This includes a brief description of the classical and computational intelligence methods before discussing their applications to gene finding. In addition, a long list of available gene finders is compiled. For the convenience of the readers, the list is enhanced by mentioning their corresponding Web sites and commenting on the general approach adopted. An extensive bibliography is provided. Finally, some limitations of the current approaches and future directions are discussed.", "paper_title": "Gene identification: Classical and computational intelligence approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000251840500007"}
