This methodology is an extension of the level set methods, in which the interface is represented as the zero level set of a function. According to the proposed formulation, the Fourier coefficients of that function are the design variables describing the interface during the topology optimization. An advantage of the spectral level set methodology, in the case of a sufficiently regular interface, is to admit an upper bound error which is asymptotically smaller than the one for nonadaptive spacial discretizations of the level set function. Other advantages include the nucleation of holes in the interior of the interface and the avoidance of checkerboard-like designs. The theoretical framework of the methodology is presented and estimates on its convergence rate are discussed. The numerical applications consist in the design of short and long cantilevers subject to a vertical concentrated load opposite to the fixed end. The goal is to maximize the structural stiffness subject to a solid volume constraint. The zero level set of the level set function defines the structural boundary.", "paper_title": "Application of spectral level set methodology in topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000242613000002"}
