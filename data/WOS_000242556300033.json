In this paper, we focus on a class of very typical GA-hard problems that we call decomposable black-box optimization problems (DBBOP). Different from random methods in GA literature, two \"deterministic\" divide-and-conquer algorithms DA1 and DA2 are proposed respectively for non-overlapping and overlapping DBBOP, in which there are no classical genetic operations and even no random operations. Given any DBBOP with dimension I and bounded order k, our algorithms can always reliably and accurately obtain the optimal solutions in deterministic way using O(l(k)) function evaluations.", "paper_title": "Deterministic divide-and-conquer algorithm for decomposable black-box optimization problems with bounded difficulty", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300033"}
