Such problems are not well understood due to the limitations of numerical methods. Most of the popular shock-capturing methods are only first-order accurate at the shock and may incur spurious numerical oscillations near the shock. Shock-fitting algorithms have been proposed as an alternative which can achieve uniform high-order accuracy and can avoid possible spurious oscillations incurred in shock-capturing methods by treating shocks as sharp interfaces. We explore two ways for shock-fitting: conventional moving grid setup and a new fixed grid set-up with front tracking. In the conventional shock-fitting method, a moving grid is fitted to the shock whereas in the newly developed fixed grid set-up the shock front is tracked using Lagrangian points and is free to move across the underlying fixed grid. Different implementations of shock-fitting methods have been published in the literature. However, uniform high-order accuracy of various shock-fitting methods has not been systematically established. In this paper, we carry out a rigorous grid-convergence analysis on different variations of shock-fitting methods with both moving and fixed grids. These shock-fitting methods consist of different combinations of numerical methods for computing flow away from the shock and those for computing the shock movement. Specifically, we consider fifth-order upwind finite-difference scheme and shock-capturing WENO schemes with conventional shock-fitting and show that a fifth-order convergence is indeed achieved for a canonical one-dimensional shock-entropy wave interaction problem. We also show that the method of finding shock velocity from one characteristic relation and Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition performs better than the other methods of computing shock velocities. A high-order front-tracking implementation of shock-fitting is also presented in this paper and nominal rate of convergence is shown. The front-tracking results are validated by comparing to results from the conventional shock-fitting method and a linear-interaction analysis for a two-dimensional shock disturbance interaction problem.
