At the same time, different business models have been developed for access and consumption. Many of these business models are based on making a payment via the web. The use of electronic payments in the web is a complex issue since it involves the support of multiple payment instruments, the secure exchange of payment information, receipts, and so on. A proposed solution approach to web payments is the development of a web payment framework based on a layered approach. This article analyzes the functionality this framework should provide, what solutions may be used, and what issues still need to be addressed so that a web payment framework can make e-payments more widespread.
