The aim of the project is the development of a support system for association Studies. We identify the notion of clinical phenotypes, that is, the pathological condition of a patient, as the central construct Of the knowledge model. Clinical phenotypes are assessed through the diagnostic activity, performed by clinical experts operating within communities of practice; the different Communities operate according to specific procedures, but they also conform to the minimal requirements of international guidelines, displayed by the adoption of a common standard for the patient classification. We develop a central model for the clinical phenotypes, able to reconcile the different methodologies into a common classificatory system. To bridge neurovascular medicine and genomics, we identify the general theory of biological function as the common ground between the two disciplines; therefore, we decompose the clinical phenotypes into elementary phenotypes with a homogeneous physiological background, and we connect them to the biological processes, acting as the elementary units of the genomic world.", "paper_title": "Ontological modeling at a domain interface: bridging clinical and biomolecular knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000270887000002"}
