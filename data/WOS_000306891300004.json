Online shops can use a ping service to submit their RDFa annotated Web pages for processing. The platform is able to process these RDFa annotated (X)HTML pages and aggregate product information coming from different Web stores. We propose solutions for the identification of products and the mapping of the categories in this process. Furthermore, when a loose vocabulary such as the Google RDFa vocabulary is used, the platform deals with the issue of heterogeneous information (e.g., currencies, rating scales, etc.).
