We show that the regularization is simpler than in the case of the inversion using continuous finite elements. We numerically demonstrate that there exist optimal step sizes and polynomial degrees for inversion using the DG method. Numerical results are compared with those obtained by applying the standard finite element method with B-splines as a basis. (C) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
