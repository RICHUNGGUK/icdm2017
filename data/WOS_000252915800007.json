In contrast to other classification systems, the method used to obtain the topology or architecture is taken as base for the classification. Different methods may be preferred depending on the type of system, the abstraction level, the experience of the designer or the need for extensive exploration of different architectures. Therefore, this overview helps the analog designer to select the right approach for the right task. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
