(b) For any countable sequence (t(k))(k is an element of omega) of Closed -terms there is a graph model that satisfies (lambda x.xx)(lambda x.xx)u(k) for all k. We apply these two results, which are corollaries of a unique theorem, to prove the existence of (1) a finitely axiomatized lambda-theory L such that the interval lattice constituted by the lambda-theories extending L is distributive; (2) a continuum of pairwise inconsistent graph theories (= lambda-theories that can be realized as theories of graph models); (3) a congruence distributive variety of combinatory algebras (lambda abstraction algebras, respectively).
