The analysis is based on next-to-leading order QCD calculations. The input parameters are fixed to recent measurements. We compare different PDF sets and investigate the related uncertainties. The impact of uncalculated higher orders is estimated using an independent variation of the renormalisation and factorisation scale. The theoretical predictions are compared with recent measurements from Tevatron and LHC. Furthermore, the cross section measurements are used to estimate the top-quark mass. To perform the analysis we extended the publicly available HATHOR program to single top-quark production. We thus provide a unified framework for the fast numerical evaluation of total cross sections for top-quark production, which may be used for example in Standard Model fits. For future extensions towards NNLO accuracy, we include already all scale dependent terms at NNLO. We briefly describe how to use the program and provide all required tools to repeat the aforementioned analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
