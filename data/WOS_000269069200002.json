This study attempts to explore the development of a productive learning atmosphere in the context of Web-based learning. An experiment is conducted with university-level students having homogenous background and coursework by applying heterogeneous pedagogies that create either competitive or collaborative learning atmospheres. The differences in learning atmosphere bring about variations in social presence and enjoyment of learning. The findings show that \"coopetition\" (defined as collaboration within the group and competition between groups) was the best learning strategy because competition and collaboration stimulated different types of knowledge growth in the knowledge-creation spiral. Competitive learning atmospheres encourage Students to develop higher analytic skills, while collaborative learning atmospheres prompt students to demonstrate higher synthetic skills. Because both atmospheres contribute to learning, this study has found that combining both pedagogies in constructing a coopetitive learning atmosphere not only contributes to analytic and synthetic skills, but also raises the overall knowledge level. The findings pinpointed the importance of creating a learning environment that integrates ICTs. learners' backgrounds, courseware, and pedagogic considerations in the process of increasing knowledge levels.
