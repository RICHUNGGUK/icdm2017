The up-to-date three dimensional (3D) stacked Phase change Random Access Memory (PRAM) is the promising approach for on-chip caching the reference signals, as 3D stacking offers high memory bandwidth, while PRAM possesses the advantages in terms of high density and low leakage power. However, the write endurance problem, that is a PRAM cell can only tolerant limited number of write operations, becomes the main barrier in practical applications. This paper studies the wear reduction techniques of PRAM based FS in H.264 codec system. On the basis of rate-distortion theory, the content oriented selective writing mechanisms are proposed to reduce bit updates in the reference frame buffers. With the proposed control parameter a, our methods make the quantitative trade off between the quality degradation and the PRAM lifetime prolongation. Specifically, taking a in the range of [0.2,2], experimental results demonstrate that, our methods averagely save 29.9-35.5% bit-wise write operations and reduce 52-57% power, at the cost of 12.95-20.57% BDBR bit-rate increase accordingly.", "paper_title": "Content-Aware Write Reduction Mechanism of 3D Stacked Phase-Change RAM Based Frame Store in H.264 Video Codec System", "paper_id": "WOS:000320014500030"}
