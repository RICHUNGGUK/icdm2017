This method was applied to the design of a focused library for cytochrome P450 (CYP) ligands, not only to distinguish CYP ligands from other compounds but also to identify the putative ligands for a particular CYP. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the protein-compound affinity matrix, which was obtained by thorough docking calculations between a large set of protein pockets and chemical compounds. Each compound was depicted as a point in the PCA space. Compounds that were close to the known active compounds were selected as candidate hit compounds. A machine-learning technique optimized the docking scores of the protein-compound affinity matrix to maximize the database enrichment of the known active compounds, providing an optimized focused library.", "paper_title": "An efficient in silico screening method based on the protein-compound affinity matrix and its application to the design of a focused library for cytochrome P450 (CYP) ligands", "paper_id": "WOS:000242298100039"}
