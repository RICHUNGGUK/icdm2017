A birandom simulation technique is developed to tackle general birandom objective functions and birandom constraints. Combined with a birandom simulation technique, a genetic algorithm is designed for solving a birandom multi-objective decision-making problem. The proposed model and algorithm are applied to a hydropower station operation problem. The stochastic model and fuzzy programming approach are used for comparison to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model and algorithm. (C) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
