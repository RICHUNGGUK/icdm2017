Numerical results show that obstacles setting repeatedly along the path of the flame propagation process obviously can accelerate the flame. The mechanism of the accelerating effect is attributed to the positive feedback of the turbulence region induced by obstacles for combustion process.", "paper_title": "Numerical study on propagation of explosion wave in H-2-O-2 mixtures", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100104"}
