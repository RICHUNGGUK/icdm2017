In an information retrieval system a hierarchical user profile, used to personalize the document retrieval process, is being recommended to a new user based on profiles of other, similar users. Using methodology from the Knowledge Integration domain, four criteria are defined and analyzed to complete the aim of recommendation: Reliability is required for maintaining the correct structure of the profile, O-1 and O-2 Optimality postulates are required to calculate the best output profile by minimizing distances to other profiles, and Conflict Solution is used to better represent situations inherent to profile recommendation. Based on those criteria, four algorithms are proposed: O-1 and O-2 algorithms and modified O-1 and O-2 algorithms. These algorithms are further analyzed to check if they provide good recommendation.
