To establish a set of operative dispatching rules in the photolithography area while taking into consideration the rework of defective products would assist in coordinating and balancing the workload of the entire production line. Furthermore, it would help to enhance both the productivity and efficiency of the wafer fabrication, reduce the on-line WIP stock, shorten the production cycle time, and satisfy the requirements of customers regarding production due time and product quality. This research uses on-line rework as the basis for bringing the factor of reworking of a batch process into the dispatching rule for measurement. It then develops the dispatching rule (Rw-DR) which includes the rework strategy. In addition, this research focuses on the batch with high finished proportion in the photolithography area for finding a way to complete the manufacturing procedure faster, lighten the machine workload of the waiting line, and at the same time increase the output quantity.
