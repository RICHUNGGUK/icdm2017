Combined with the property of convex function, by generalizing the famous Jensen integral inequality, a new triple-integral Lyapunov function is constructed, and a new improved delay-dependent stability criterion is derived. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the less conservatism and the effectiveness of the main results. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
