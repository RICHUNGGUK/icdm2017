Most existing approaches require a detailed specification of the desired behaviors of a composite service beforehand and then perform certain formal verification to guarantee the correctness of the design, which makes the composition process both complex and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, referred to as AutoSyn to compose web services, where the correctness is guaranteed in the synthesis process. For a given set of services, a composite service is automatically constructed based on L* algorithm, which guarantees that the composite service is the most general way of coordinating services so that the correctness is ensured. We show the soundness and completeness of our solution and give a set of optimization techniques for reducing the time consumption. We have implemented a prototype system of AutoSyn and evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of AutoSyn through an experimental study.", "paper_title": "AutoSyn: A new approach to automated synthesis of composite web services with correctness guarantee", "paper_id": "WOS:000269899800002"}
