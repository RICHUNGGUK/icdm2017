A memory-based inclination is developed gradually during the process of social interaction; however, if the individual inclination gets strong enough, it will react to opinion dynamics. We assume that an individual inclination increases with the number of times the individual has held its most frequent opinion in the past interactions. As a result of inclination choices the transition rate following neighbors decreases, thus slowing down the microscopic dynamics. Analytical and simulation results indicate the system under the action of opinion inclinations evolves to a more polarized state for average opinion. The appearance of extremists holding the minority opinion is observed in the final state, where one opinion predominates. It is also found that the stable opinion and relaxation time depend on network topology and memory length. Moreover, this model is not only valid to the voter model, but can also be applied to other spin systems.", "paper_title": "DYNAMICS WITH CO-EVOLUTION OF INDIVIDUAL INCLINATION AND OPINION", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612500005"}
