IoT services are environmentally sensitive and event-driven, so new IoT service architecture should adapt to these features. This paper analyses IoT sensing service characteristics and proposes future services architecture. It is focused on middleware architecture and interface presentation technology. In the middleware layer, traditional SOA architecture is insufficient in real-time response and parallel processes of service execution. This paper proposes a new sensing service system based on EDSOA (Event Driven SOA) architecture to support real-time, event-driven, and active service execution. At the presentation layer, this paper presents new IoT browser features, including using augmented reality technology for input and output and realizing the superposition of the physical world and abstract information. Through a use case and proof-of-concept implementation-road manhole cover monitoring system-we verified the feasibility of the proposed ideas and framework.", "paper_title": "An Event-driven Service-oriented Architecture for the Internet of Things Service Execution", "paper_id": "WOS:000366994600001"}
