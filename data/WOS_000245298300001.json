This essay considers real-life approximations of Chinese Rooms, focusing on Helen Keller's experiences growing up deaf and blind, locked in a sort of Chinese Room yet learning how to communicate with the outside world. Using the SNePS computational knowledge-representation system, the essay analyzes Keller's belief that learning that \"everything has a name\" was the key to her success, enabling her to \"partition\" her mental concepts into mental representations of: words, objects, and the naming relations between them. It next looks at Herbert Terrace's theory of naming, which is akin to Keller's, and which only humans are supposed to be capable of. The essay suggests that computers at least, and perhaps non-human primates, are also capable of this kind of naming.", "paper_title": "How Helen Keller used syntactic semantics to escape from a Chinese Room", "paper_id": "WOS:000245298300001"}
