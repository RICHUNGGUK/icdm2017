However, many of these new devices, like handheld devices, pose new challenges in terms of QoS and energy efficiency. In order to address these challenges, in this paper we study how the novel MAC aggregation mechanisms developed in the 802.11n standard can be used to enhance the current 802.11 QoS and power saving protocols. Our contribution is twofold. First, we present a simulation study that illustrates the interactions between 802.11n and the current 802.11 QoS and power saving protocols. This study reveals that the 802.11n MAC aggregation mechanisms perform better when combined with the power save mode included in the original 802.11 standard than with the 802.11e U-APSD protocol. Second, we design CA-DFA, an algorithm that, using only information available at layer two, adapts the amount of 802.11n aggregation used by a Wi-Fi station according to the level of congestion in the network. A detailed performance evaluation demonstrates the benefits of CA-DFA in terms of QoS, energy efficiency and network capacity with respect to state of the art alternatives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
