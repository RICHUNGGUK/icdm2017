The digitized images were collected since 1999 by a community of physicists in collaboration with radiologists in several Italian hospitals, as a first step in order to develop and implement a Computer Aided Detection (CAD) system. 3369 mammograms were collected from 967 patients; they were classified according to the type and the morphology of the lesions, the type of the breast tissue and the type of pathologies. A dedicated Graphical User Interface was developed for mammography visualization and processing, in order to support the medical diagnosis directly on a high-resolution screen. The database has been the starting point for the development of other medical imaging applications such as a breast CAD, currently being upgraded and optimized for the use in conjunction of the GRID technology in the framework of the INFN-funded MAGIC-5 project.", "paper_title": "GPCALMA: An Italian mammographic database of digitized images for research", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454900052"}
