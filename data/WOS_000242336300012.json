It is shown how Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) can be used to model the relationship between formant frequencies and MFCCs. Using such models and an input MFCC vector, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) prediction of formant frequencies can be made. The specific relationship each speech sound has between MFCCs and formant frequencies is exploited by using state-specific GMMs within a framework of a set of hidden Markov models (HMMs). Formant prediction accuracy and voicing prediction of speaker-independent male speech are evaluated on both a constrained vocabulary connected digits database and a large vocabulary database. Experimental results show that for HMM-GMM prediction on the connected digits database, voicing class prediction error is less than 3.5%. Less than 1.8% of frames have formant frequency percentage errors greater than 20% and the mean percentage error of the remaining frames is less than 3.7%. Further experiments show prediction accuracy under noisy conditions. For example, at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0 dB, voicing class prediction error increases to 9.4%, less than 4.3% of frames have formant frequency percentage errors over 20% and the formant frequency percentage error for the remaining frames is less than 5.7%.
