With the \"last mile\" network bandwidth no longer a constraint, the bottleneck for video streaming has been pushed closer to the server. Streaming high-quality audio and video to a myriad of clients imposes significant resource demands on the server. In this work, we propose a demand adaptive and locality aware (DALA) clustered media server architecture that can dynamically allocate resources to adapt to changing demand and also maximize the number of clients serviced by the server cluster. Moreover, our design exploits temporal locality among requests by dispatching newly arriving requests to servers that are already servicing prior requests for those objects, thereby extracting the benefits of locality. We explore the efficacy of the DALA clustered architecture through both performance models and simulations. Evaluation of the models and simulation results show that DALA exhibits significant performance gains when compared to static schemes. Furthermore, our simulation results show that DALA is highly adaptive, and has a low system overhead. Our results demonstrate that DALA is a simple, yet effective approach for designing clustered media servers.", "paper_title": "Design and analysis of a demand adaptive and locality aware streaming media server cluster", "paper_id": "WOS:000248837200005"}
