In this paper, we propose a new analytical model for calculating RRT (Reliable Real-Time) degree in multihop WSNs, where RRT degree describes the percentage of real-time data that the network can reliably deliver on time from any source to its destination. Also, packet loss probability is modeled as a function of the probability of link failure when the buffer is full and the probability of node failure when node's energy is depleted. Most of the network properties are considered as random variables and a queuing theory based model is derived. In this model, the effect of network load on the packets' delay, RRT degree, and node's energy depletion rate are considered. Also network calculus is tailored and extended so that a worst case analysis of the delay and queue quantities in sensor networks is possible. Simulation results are used to validate the proposed model. The simulation results agree very well with the model. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
