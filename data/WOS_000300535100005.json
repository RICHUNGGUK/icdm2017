Design/methodology/approach - The electromagnetic performance of the analysed machines is compared using the finite element (FE) analysis. Findings - Both iron and conductor eddy current losses increase with the rotor pole number, while the 11- and 13-rotor pole machine always exhibit lower magnet eddy current loss than those of the 10- and 14-rotor pole machines, respectively. The E- and C-core machines use half the number and volume of magnets and also exhibit higher efficiency than those of the conventional SFPM machine. Originality/value - Investigation of the influence of stator and rotor pole combinations on the performances of conventional, novel E- and C-core SFPM machines, include losses and efficiency.", "paper_title": "Losses and efficiency in alternate switched-flux permanent magnet machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000300535100005"}
