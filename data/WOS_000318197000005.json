A quad-dominated non-convex bounding polyhedron is firstly created along the skeleton, which is then tetrahedralized and subdivided into the pre-defined resolution. After that, the iso-surface within each tetrahedron is extracted using marching tetrahedra. Our algorithm can generate polygons with adaptive edge lengths according to the thickness of the trunk. In addition, we present an efficient CUDA-based parallel algorithm utilizing the high parallelism of the tetrahedron subdivision, the potential field calculation, and the iso-surface extraction.", "paper_title": "Efficient polygonization of tree trunks modeled by convolution surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000318197000005"}
