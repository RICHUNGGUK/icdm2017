M. Hadjiandreou, R. Conejeros and V. S. Vassiliadis (Math. Biosci. Eng. 4 (2007) 489-504) proposed an ODE model of long-term HIV infection dynamics. This model considers all important population compartments including macrophages, latently-infected CD4(+) T cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which in many respects is novel in the field of mathematical modeling of HIV infection. The purpose of the paper is to simplify their model into a five-dimensional HIV dynamics model, and give a detailed classification on the existence of the equilibria of the reduced model by introducing four reproductive numbers. Then the global asymptotic stability of each equilibrium is analyzed by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions. The results in the paper extend and improve the understanding of the dynamics of HIV latency.", "paper_title": "GLOBAL PROPERTIES FOR A CLASS OF LATENT HIV INFECTION DYNAMICS MODEL WITH CTL IMMUNE RESPONSE", "paper_id": "WOS:000310462400005"}
