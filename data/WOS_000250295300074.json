A saying holds true in regard to knowledge management systems (KMS) \"no measurement-no management\". Without accurate measurement it is impossible to gauge the actual performance and value of KMS. In this study, we have used a survey to investigate the effects of KMS for disease classification in a major Taiwanese medical center. Structural modeling techniques were applied to the data collected by questionnaires from 163 KMS system users. The results exhibited a good fit with the data and appeared to be superior in explaining the effectiveness and influence of KMS adoption. These results and conclusions serve as a reference to determine whether or not to further extend a full-scale KMS in both Medicare and administrative affairs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
