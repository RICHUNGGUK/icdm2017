For a given stable system, our attention is focussed on the construction of reduced-order models, which approximate the original system well in a Hankel-norm sense. By applying the slack matrix approach, a delay-dependent sufficient condition is proposed for the robustly asymptotic stability with a Hankel-norm error performance for the error system. Then, the HNMA problem is solved by using the projection approach, which casts the model approximation into a sequential minimisation problem subject to linear matrix inequality constraints by employing the cone complementary linearisation algorithm. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Hankel-norm model approximation for LPV systems with parameter-varying time delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000281652800005"}
