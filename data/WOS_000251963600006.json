The network offers good compromise between robust implementations resulting from the redundancy characteristic of non-orthogonal wavelets, and efficient functional representations that build on the time-frequency localization property of wavelets. Moreover, the network can deal with continuous input signals directly. The corresponding learning algorithm is given and the network is used to solve the problems of aeroengine condition monitoring. The simulation test results indicate that the CWPNN has a faster convergence speed and higher accuracy than the same scale process neural network (PNN) and BP neural network. This provided an effective way for the problems of aeroengine condition monitoring.", "paper_title": "Continuous wavelet process neural network and its application", "paper_id": "WOS:000251963600006"}
