The new labeling corresponds to an embedding of B into the integer lattice Z(d) and is shown to be optimal for all practical purposes. A coordinatization algorithm is presented and it is demonstrated that it can be easily carried out by hand.", "paper_title": "THE LATTICE DIMENSION OF BENZENOID SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000208094500021"}
