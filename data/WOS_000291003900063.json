In this paper we study a different noise model where the noise operators act on all qubits together, but are otherwise restricted in their action. One example to such an operator is a controlled bit-flip operator, where the control depends on all qubits, i.e., we allow restricted, highly correlated noise. We show both positive and negative results. On the positive side, we show that even though controlled bit-flip errors cannot be perfectly corrected, they can be approximately corrected with a sub-constant approximation error. On the negative side, we show that no nontrivial quantum error-correcting code can approximately correct controlled phase error with a sub-constant approximation error.", "paper_title": "Approximate Quantum Error Correction for Correlated Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000291003900063"}
