The usefulness of such a solver hinges on the balance among competing desires like ease of use, speed of forward calculation, scalability to large problems or compute clusters, parsimonious use of memory access, accuracy and by necessity, the ability to faithfully accommodate a broad range of geologic scenarios over extremes in length scale and frequency content. This is indeed a tall order. The present study addresses recent progress toward the development of a forward solver with these properties. Based on the Lorenz-gauged Helmholtz decomposition, a new finite volume solution over Cartesian model domains endowed with complex-valued electrical properties is shown to be stable over the frequency range 10(-2)-10(10) Hz and range 10(-3)-10(5) m in length scale. Benchmark examples are drawn from magnetotellurics, exploration geophysics, geotechnical mapping and laboratory-scale analysis, showing excellent agreement with reference analytic solutions. Computational efficiency is achieved through use of a matrix-free implementation of the quasi-minimum-residual (QMR) iterative solver, which eliminates explicit storage of finite volume matrix elements in favor of \"on the fly\" computation as needed by the iterative Krylov sequence. Further efficiency is achieved through sparse coupling matrices between the vector and scalar potentials whose non-zero elements arise only in those parts of the model domain where the conductivity gradient is non-zero. Multi-thread parallelization in the QMR solver through OpenMP pragmas is used to reduce the computational cost of its most expensive step: the single matrix vector product at each iteration. High-level MPI communicators farm independent processes to available compute nodes for simultaneous computation of multi-frequency or multi-transmitter responses. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
