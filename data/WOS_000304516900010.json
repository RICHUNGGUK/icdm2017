A spatial or temporal offset can occur between sensor and position measurements (mostly obtained with global navigation satellite systems such as the Global Positioning System, GPS), e.g. if the antenna of the navigation system cannot be placed on top of the sensor. To correct for such an offset, we present a kinematic model that accounts for the mechanisms underlying the offset. Our model considers a sensor on a cart or sledge towed by a drawing vehicle equipped with a positioning system. The model was applied to a soil electrical conductivity survey on a 135 ha site with over 100 000 measured positions. Application of the model halved a nugget effect in semivariograms, significantly (p < 0.01) reduced prediction errors and thus substantially improved map quality. The model allows offset correction between sensors and a positioning system mounted independently on agricultural machinery, even retrospectively from the geometric configuration of the positioning system-sensor combination. Thus we propose the model for use in research and practical applications of sensor based mapping. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
