Generally, these idle periods do not permit to carry out the computations completely. It is therefore necessary to save the context of uncompleted applications for possible restart. This checkpointing mechanism is subject to resource constraints: the network bandwidth, the disk bandwidth, and the delay T imposed for releasing the workstations. We first introduce a function bw that gives the bandwidth bw(m, V) of a system during the checkpointing of m applications with aggregated memory requirement V. Assuming that this bandwidth is shared equitably among the applications, the scheduling problem becomes a sequence of knapsack problems with nonlinear constraints for which we propose approximate solutions. Experiments carried out on Grid5000 show that the running time of this algorithm is negligible compared to the delay T which is of the order of few minutes. This means that the proposed scheduling algorithm does not induce a significant overhead on the checkpointing process. As a consequence, our mechanism can be incorporated in a batch scheduler.", "paper_title": "Scheduling of Computing Services on Intranet Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000300880400004"}
