The db8 wavelet packet decomposes the faulted phase voltage waveform to obtain the coefficients of the nodes 257, 259 to 262. An index is then defined from the sum of the energy coefficients of these nodes. By evaluating the index, transient and permanent faults, as well as the secondary arc extinction instant, can be identified. The significant advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it does not need a threshold level and therefore its performance is independent of fault location, line parameters, and operating conditions. Moreover, it can be used in transmission lines with reactor compensation. The proposed method has been successfully tested under a variety of fault conditions on a 400 kV overhead line of the Iranian National Grid using the Electro-Magnetic Transient Program (EMTP). The test results validated the algorithm's ability in distinguishing between transient arcing and permanent faults and determining the instant of secondary arc extinction.", "paper_title": "A wavelet packet based method for adaptive single-pole auto-reclosing", "paper_id": "WOS:000285525700010"}
