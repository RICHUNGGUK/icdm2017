Each patch P(i) is the image of the unit square by gamma(i) which is the composition of a 2D Coons mapping and a bivariate function coming from a trimmed surface. Here, we concentrate on the analysis of the global continuity of the mappings gamma(i) over the whole surface. While using Coons functions to generate the mappings gamma(i) arc length parametrization ensures that the images of the functions gamma(i) match pointwise at surface joints independently of the blending functions. We will describe a reparametrization technique based on cubic Bezier whose goal is to keep the shape of the initial curves while achieving arc length parametrization. The required accuracy of length computation is shown in L(infinity)-norm in order not to deteriorate the accuracy of the cubic spline approximation. Practical results from simulated and real CAD data which come from IGES files are reported. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
