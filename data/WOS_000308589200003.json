However, because online shopping does not allow immediate enjoyment of purchases as bricks-and-mortar shops do, cultivating customers' trust in online businesses is especially important in attracting return customers. Previous studies have put forward the factors that build multidimensional trust but not systematically examined them. This article reexamines factors of building customer trust and makes a systematic study of the relationship between customers' perceived waiting and repurchase intention. This study examines online stores' professional ability, integrity, and benevolence were selected as the three constructing factors of trust. A total of 351 valid customer questionnaires were collected and analyzed using structural equation modeling. It was found that the most influential factor in customer trust was the security of the online business' information system, followed by the privacy protection, whereas the third-party guarantees and recommendation exhibited the third strongest correlation. Furthermore, the perceived waiting was a significant factor affecting customers' decision to return, notwithstanding their trust in an online business.", "paper_title": "Reexamining the Factors for Trust in Cultivating Online Customer Repurchase Intentions: The Moderating Effect of Perceived Waiting", "paper_id": "WOS:000308589200003"}
