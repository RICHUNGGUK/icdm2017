The adjacency query asks whether there is an edge between two vertices, the neighborhood query reports the neighbors of a given vertex in constant time per neighbor, and the degree query reports the number of incident edges to a given vertex. We study the problem in the context of succinctness, where the goal is to achieve the optimal space requirement as a function of n and m, to within lower order terms. We prove a lower bound in the cell probe model indicating it is impossible to achieve the information-theory lower bound up to lower order terms unless the graph is either too sparse (namely, m = o(n(delta)) for any constant delta > 0) or too dense (namely m = omega(n(2-8)) for any constant delta > 0). Furthermore, we present a succinct encoding of graphs supporting aforementioned queries in constant time. The space requirement of the encoding is within a multiplicative 1 + epsilon factor of the information-theory lower bound for any arbitrarily small constant epsilon > 0. This is the best achievable space bound according to our lower bound where it applies. The space requirement of the representation achieves the information-theory lower bound tightly within lower order terms where the graph is very sparse (m = o(n(delta)) for any constant delta > 0), or very dense (m > n(2)/1g(1-delta) n for an arbitrarily small constant delta > 0).
