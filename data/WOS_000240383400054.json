The response rate of VRC algorithm is rapider than traditional AQM arithmetic. A new VRC algorithm based on the fuzzy immune adaptive PID control and Smith predictor is proposed. PID parameters' online self-adapting was implemented by immune feedback mechanism. Moreover the Smith predictor was successfully introduced into feedback to compensate the time delay in network. Contrasted with traditional PID algorithm, fuzzy immune PID-Smith is validated by simulation results. It can adjust itself to new network conditions rapidly and stably, can converge to queue size-setting value, and can get better robustness.", "paper_title": "A VRC algorithm based on fuzzy immune PID-Smith", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400054"}
