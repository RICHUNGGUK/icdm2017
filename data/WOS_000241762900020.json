It is composed of three steps. First, corner extraction and matching. We use the gray level information around the corner to setup the correspondences, then use the affine invariant of Mahalannobis distance to remove the mismatched corner points. From this correspondence of the corner points, the affine matrix between two different images can be determined. Finally, map all points in the sensed image to the reference using the estimated transformation matrix and assign the corresponding gray level by re-sampling the image in the sensed image. Experiments with different types of multi-sensor images demonstrated the feasibility of our method.", "paper_title": "A multi-sensor image registration method based on Harris corner matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900020"}
