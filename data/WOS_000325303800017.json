In order to obtain less conservative conditions, a new approach is introduced by improving Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional together with the free-weighting matrices. Besides, we use the series compensation technique and Jensen inequality lemma to get the new stability criteria. Furthermore, the criteria can be applicable to both fast and slow time-varying delays. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the theoretical results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
