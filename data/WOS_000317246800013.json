By the theoretical analysis and mathematical manipulation, the average spectral efficiency (SE), packet error rate (PER) and packet loss rate (PLR) are derived. As a result, closed-form expressions of the average SE, PER and PLR are obtained, respectively. According to these, a cross-layer design (CLD) scheme subject to the average PER constraints is proposed to avoid the SE performance loss caused by the conventional instantaneous PER constraints. The scheme optimizes the adaptive thresholds by maximizing the average SE of the system, and an iteration method joint the Lagrange multiplier and Newton methods is presented to solve the above optimization problem. Simulation results verify the validity of the theoretical analysis. The results show that the proposed CLD scheme can improve the SE while target PLR is maintained. The CLD scheme under average PER constraints has higher SE than the conventional CLD scheme under instantaneous PER constraints.", "paper_title": "Cross-layer design for cooperative MIMO systems with relay selection and imperfect CSI", "paper_id": "WOS:000317246800013"}
