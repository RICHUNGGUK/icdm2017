For that purpose, an integrated product model based on STEP and the feature technology is developed. The application objects and schemas of STEP AP210 are used and extended to support the horizontal collaboration between electronic and mechanical design. Special attention is paid to the description of the three-dimensional structure of the circuit carrier and the circuit traces running within it and on its surface. In addition, the integrated product model also supports the hierarchical collaboration between upstream MID design and downstream simulation and manufacturing. Based on this product model, an effective communication between MID design in MIDCAD and the simulation of the injection moulding process in MOLDFLOW and manufacturing utilising MID-specific automatic placement equipment could be established.", "paper_title": "Horizontal and vertical integration of product data for the design of moulded interconnect devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000271035400004"}
