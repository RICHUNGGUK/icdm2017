[Objective Bayesian analysis for the Student-t regression model, Biometrika 95 (2008), pp. 325-333] as objective priors for the Student-t regression model. The authors showed that the priors provide proper posterior distributions and perform favourably in parameter estimation. Motivated by a practical financial risk management application, we compare the performance of the two Jeffreys priors with other priors proposed in the literature in a problem of estimating high quantiles for the Student-t model with unknown degrees of freedom. Through an asymptotic analysis and a simulation study, we show that both Jeffreys priors perform better in using a specific quantile of the Bayesian predictive distribution to approximate the true quantile.", "paper_title": "The use of Jeffreys priors for the Student-t distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000305913100005"}
