The methods are based on the Douglas-Rachford splitting algorithm applied to various splittings of the primal-dual optimality conditions. We discuss applications to image deblurring problems with nonquadratic data fidelity terms, different types of convex regularization, and simple convex constraints. In these applications, the primal-dual splitting approach allows us to handle general boundary conditions for the blurring operator. Numerical results indicate that the primal-dual splitting methods compare favorably with the alternating direction method of multipliers, the Douglas-Rachford algorithm applied to a reformulated primal problem, and the Chambolle-Pock primal-dual algorithm.", "paper_title": "Primal-Dual Decomposition by Operator Splitting and Applications to Image Deblurring", "paper_id": "WOS:000343228200010"}
