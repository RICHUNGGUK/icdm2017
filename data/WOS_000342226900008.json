Based on the rough set properties, the lower region and boundary region are defined to partition the input signal to a consistent (predictable) part and an inconsistent (random) part. In this way, the neural network is designed to deal only with the boundary region, which mainly consists of an inconsistent part of applied input signal causing inaccurate modeling of the data set. Owing to different characteristics of neural network (NN) applications, the same structure of conventional NN might not give the optimal solution. Based on the knowledge of application in this paper, a block-based neural network (BBNN) is selected as a suitable classifier due to its ability to evolve internal structures and adaptability in dynamic environments. This architecture will systematically incorporate the characteristics of application to the structure of hybrid rough-block-based neural network (R-BBNN). A global training algorithm, hybrid particle swarm optimization with wavelet mutation is introduced for parameter optimization of proposed R-BBNN. The performance of the proposed R-BBNN algorithm was evaluated by an application to the field of medical diagnosis using real hypoglycemia episodes in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. The performance of the proposed hybrid system has been compared with some of the existing neural networks. The comparison results indicated that the proposed method has improved classification performance and results in early convergence of the network.", "paper_title": "Evolvable Rough-Block-Based Neural Network and Its Biomedical Application to Hypoglycemia Detection System", "paper_id": "WOS:000342226900008"}
