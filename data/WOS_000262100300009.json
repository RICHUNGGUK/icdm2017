In this paper, we shall examine the implementation of an analysis system specifically with reference to the software engineering principles utilized and the modular framework within with a flexible implementation can be realized. We shall highlight some of the implemented modules and, using two actual test batteries as examples, demonstrate the flow of information between each module. We shall also show the additional reporting and analysis features implemented for clinician support and describe how the framework can be utilized for more generic applications of handwriting/drawing analysis.", "paper_title": "THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPUTER-ASSISTED TOOL FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL DRAWING TASKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000262100300009"}
