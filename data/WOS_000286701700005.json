In this paper we propose an algorithmic approach to this problem, for which, as far as we know, no optimal polynomial time solutions have been put forward in the literature. The core of our scheme consists of a sequential divide-and-conquer technique which divides the overall Joint Channel Assignment and Routing (JCAR) problem into a number of local optimization sub-problems that are executed sequentially. We propose a generalized scheme called Generalized Partitioned Mesh network traffic and interference aware channeL Assignment (G-PaMeLA), where the number of sub-problems is equal to the maximum number of hops to the gateway, and a customized version which takes advantage of the knowledge of the topology. In both cases each sub-problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization problem. An optimal solution for each sub-problem can be found by using a branch-and-cut method. The final solution is obtained after a post-processing phase, which improves network connectivity. The divide-and-conquer technique significantly reduces the execution time and makes our solution feasible for an operational WMN. With the help of a detailed packet level simulation, the G-PaMeLA technique is compared with several state-of-the-art JCAR algorithms. Our results highlight that G-PaMeLA performs much better than the others in terms of packet loss rate, collision probability and fairness among traffic flows. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
