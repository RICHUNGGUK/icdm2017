The DMNs offer a solution to rapidly and efficiently designing and operating a new manufacturing network, or to reconfiguring an existing one, in order for specific objectives in each situation to be accomplished. This is a study of the evolution of such networks which highlights the main prerequisites to their success and presents a comprehensive approach to the organisation and operation of DMNs. The proposed approach is applied to an industrial pilot case and the results are critically reviewed.", "paper_title": "Organisation and operation of dynamic manufacturing networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000354624600008"}
