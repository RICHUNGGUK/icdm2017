(Constr. Approx. 20: 399-463, 2004) and Runborg (Multiscale Methods in Science and Engineering, pp. 205-224, 2005), we provide the theoretical analysis of normal multi-scale transforms for curves with general linear predictor S, and a more flexible choice of normal directions. The main parameters influencing the asymptotic properties (convergence, decay estimates for detail coefficients, smoothness of normal re-parametrization) of this transform are the smoothness of the curve, the smoothness of S, and its order of exact polynomial reproduction. Our results give another indication why approximating S may not be the first choice in compression applications of normal multi-scale transforms.", "paper_title": "Normal Multi-scale Transforms for Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000300097700001"}
