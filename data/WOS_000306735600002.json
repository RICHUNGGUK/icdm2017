The model is based on a multifluid NavierStokes approach in which all fluids are assumed compressible. The numerical method is based on a finite volume algorithm in space and a second order RungeKutta method in time. A validation of this model is performed. It shows a good accuracy for acoustic and shock wave propagation in a bubbly liquid and for wave breaking.
