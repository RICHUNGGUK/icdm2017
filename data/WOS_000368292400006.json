Given a collection of DNA fragments sequenced from a homologous pair of chromosomes, the problem of single individual haplotyping (SIH) aims to reconstruct a pair of haplotypes using a computer algorithm. In this paper, we encode the information of aligned DNA fragments into a two-locus linkage graph and approach the SIH problem by vertex labeling of the graph. In order to find a vertex labeling with the minimum sum of weights of incompatible edges, we develop a fast and accurate heuristic algorithm. It starts with detecting error-tolerant components by an adapted breadth-first search. A proper labeling of vertices is then identified for each component, with which sequencing errors are further corrected and edge weights are adjusted accordingly. After contracting each error-tolerant component into a single vertex, the above procedure is iterated on the resulting condensed linkage graph until error-tolerant components are no longer detected. The algorithm finally outputs a haplotype pair based on the vertex labeling. Extensive experiments on simulated and real data show that our algorithm is more accurate and faster than five existing algorithms for single individual haplotyping.", "paper_title": "LGH: A Fast and Accurate Algorithm for Single Individual Haplotyping Based on a Two-Locus Linkage Graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000368292400006"}
