This algorithm can not only detect malicious manipulations but reveal block substitutions when the VQ attack occurs. An image is partitioned into non-overlapped blocks. The pixels in one block and its neighboring block are combined to produce an authentication watermark based on a chaotic system with feedback, which is sensitive to the initial value. The produced water-mark is embedded into the current block. During detection, the detector extracts the watermark firstly, then generates a reference sequence and compares it with the extracted watermark to authenticate the integrity of the image and locate the tampered regions. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Neighbor-aided authentication watermarking based on a chaotic system with feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000258395000012"}
