The objective is to identify favorable outcome(s) in a multiple participant-multiple objective decision problem with fuzzy preference information. More specifically, coalition versions of fuzzy Nash stability, fuzzy general metarationality, fuzzy symmetric metarationality, and fuzzy sequential stability are proposed. They constitute a natural generalization of the corresponding non-cooperative fuzzy preference-based definitions for Nash stability, general metarationality, symmetric metarationality, and sequential stability, respectively. Coalition fuzzy stability definitions are employed to analyze an actual dispute over groundwater contamination in Elmira, Ontario, Canada, demonstrating how these new concepts can be conveniently applied to practical problems in order to gain valuable strategic insights.", "paper_title": "Coalition fuzzy stability analysis in the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000362627100014"}
