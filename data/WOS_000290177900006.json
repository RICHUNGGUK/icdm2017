The Open Science Grid consortium not only provides services and software to an increasingly diverse set of scientific communities, but also fosters a collaborative team of practitioners and researchers who use, support and advance the state of the art in large-scale distributed computing. The scale of the infrastructure can be expressed by the daily throughput of around seven hundred thousand jobs, just under a million hours of computing, a million file transfers, and half a petabyte of data movement. In this paper we introduce and reflect on some of the OSG capabilities, usage and activities.", "paper_title": "A Science Driven Production Cyberinfrastructure-the Open Science Grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000290177900006"}
