Extracellular single-unit neural activity was recorded from DA neurons in the VTA area of rats. One group had their PFC inputs to the VTA intact, while the other group had the inputs to VTA bilaterally transected immediate caudal to the PFC. We hypothesized that the systemic nicotine exposure will significantly change the energy distribution in the recorded neural activity. Additionally, we investigated whether the loss of inputs to the VTA caused by the PFC transection resulted in the cancellation of the nicotine' effect on the neurons' firing patterns. The time-frequency representations of VTA DA neurons firing activity were estimated from the reconstructed firing rate histogram. The energy contents were estimated from three frequency bands, which are known to encompass the significant modes of operation of DA neurons. Our results show that systemic nicotine exposure disrupts the energy distribution in PFC-intact rats. Particularly, there is a significant increase in energy contents of the 1-1.5 Hz frequency band. This corresponds to an observed increase in the firing rate of VTA DA neurons following nicotine exposure. Additionally, our results from PFC-transected rats show that there is no change in the energy distribution of the recordings after systemic nicotine exposure. These results indicate that the PFC plays an important role in affecting the activities of VTA DA neurons and that the CWT is a useful method for monitoring the changes in neural activity patterns in both time and frequency domains.", "paper_title": "The effects of nicotine exposure and PFC transection on the time-frequency distribution of VTA DA neurons' firing activities", "paper_id": "WOS:000290772800011"}
