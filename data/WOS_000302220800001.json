Besides eliminating noise and preserving edges of objects efficiently, our model can keep corners of objects and greyscale intensity contrasts of images and also remove the staircase effect. In this paper, we analytically study the proposed model and justify why our model can preserve object corners and image contrasts. We apply the proposed model to the denoising of curves and plane images, and also compare the results with those obtained by using the classical Rudin-Osher-Fatemi model [Phys. D, 60 (1992), pp. 259-268].", "paper_title": "Image Denoising Using Mean Curvature of Image Surface", "paper_id": "WOS:000302220800001"}
