In the conventional scheme, a destination exploits only one base station to communicate information. The proposed scheme can use an extra source from another base station through a relay, since the restriction of power in vehicle are less than cellular device. If a destination is distant from a base station, the performance is degraded. When a destination is distant from a base station, the proposed scheme employing space time block code (STBC) and cyclic delay diversity (CDD) has a higher bit error rate (BER) performance and throughput than the conventional scheme.", "paper_title": "An Improved Cooperative Transmission Scheme Using an Adjacent Base Station in Vehicular Communication System", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567100049"}
