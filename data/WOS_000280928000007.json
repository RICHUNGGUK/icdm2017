Both systems are computer-based, and they are diverse in sensors, hardware and software. They are responsible for nuclear safety of the reactor, so the quality requirements for their software are strict. The software was developed in accordance with nuclear standards. During the development, both software products were carefully tested, and after the integration of hardware/software, they were validated with the simulation of input signals and the checking of their responses.
