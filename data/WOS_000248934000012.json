We call this protocol the MARK-OPT protocol, since it marks the lowest SMO occurrence point during optimistic latch-coupling operations. The marking reduces middle phases for spreading an X latch and removes needless X latches. In addition, we propose three variations of the MARK-OPT, which focus on tree structure changes from other transactions. Moreover, the proposed protocols are deadlock-free and satisfy the physical consistency requirement for B-trees. These indicate that the proposed protocols are suitable as concurrency control protocols for B-tree structures. To compare the performance of the proposed protocols, the INC-OPT, and the ARIES/IM, we implement these protocols on an autonomous disk system adopting the Fat-Btree structure, a form of parallel B-tree structure. Experimental results in various environments indicate that the proposed protocols always improve system throughput, and 2P-REP-MARK-OPT is the most useful protocol in high update environment. Additionally, to mitigate access skew, data should be migrated between PEs. We also demonstrate that MARK-OPT improves the system throughput under the data migration and reduces the time for data migration to balance load distribution.", "paper_title": "MARK-OPT: A concurrency control protocol for parallel B-Tree structures to reduce the cost of SMOs", "paper_id": "WOS:000248934000012"}
