Enterprises can enhance competitive advantage by providing more values to all stakeholders in the network. Design/methodology/approach: Our model employs a stylized database to identify successful cases of value chain application under similar company marketing conditions, illustrating potential value chains and sustainable networks as references. This work first identifies economic benefits, environmental friendliness and social contribution values based on prior studies. Next, a search engine which is developed based on the rough set theory will search and map similarities to find similar or parallel cases in the database. Finally, a visualized network mapping will be automatically generated to possible value chains. Findings: This study applies a case-based methodology to assist enterprises in developing a service-oriented value chain design. For decision makers, this can reduce survey time and inspire innovative works based on previous successful experience. Besides, successful ideas from prior cases can be reused. In addition to customer values, this methodology incorporates environment and social values that may encourage a company to build their value chain in a more comprehensive and sustainable manner. Research implications: This is a pilot study which attempts to utilize computer-aided methodology to assist in service or value-related design. The pertinent existing solutions can be filtered from an array of cases to engage the advantages from both product-oriented and service-oriented companies. Finally, the visualized display of value network is formed to illustrate the results. Practical implications: A customized service-oriented value chains which incorporates environment and social values can be designed according to different conditions. Also, this system engages the advantages from both product-oriented and service-oriented companies to build a more comprehensive value network. Apart from this, the system can be utilized as a benchmarking tool, and it could remind the decision makers to consider potential value from a more multifaceted perspective. Originality/value: This is the first paper that applied a computer-aided method to design service-oriented value chains. This work also can serve as a decision support and benchmarking system because decision makers can develop different value networks according to various emphasized values. Finally, the visualized display of value network can improve the communication among stakeholders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
