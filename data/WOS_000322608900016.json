Also, pulse modulation components in output current of current source should be minimized. Design/methodology/approach - The power electronics controlled current source utilizes both, the concept of the inductor with variable (controlled) inductance located at the output of an inverter and the concept of the multi-channel (interleaved) inverter. The small signal (linear) and simulation models of an active filter have been investigated. Findings - The work presents the concept of 1-phase active shunt filter with utilization of the power electronics current source about extended pass-band. Research limitations/implications - The research should be continued to achieve stability of the electrical system with variable parameters of the power network and receiver. Practical implications - The research will be continued towards realization of a laboratory model of a 3-phase active shunt filter with the DSP based control module. Social implications - Social implications are difficult to determine. Originality/value - The paper presents a new concept of the precision power electronics controlled current source with the extended pass-band. The controlled current source is the fundamental block of a power electronics active shunt filter.", "paper_title": "Power electronics active shunt filter with controlled dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000322608900016"}
