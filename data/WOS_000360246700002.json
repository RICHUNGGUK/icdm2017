It has lately received considerable attention within the engineering community. This paper describes a random derivative-free algorithm for solving unconstrained or bound constrained continuously differentiable non-linear problems. This method is a combination of particle swarm and directional direct search algorithms. The key difference in direct search methods is in the way of generating positive bases. At first glance, a simple way of generating positive bases has been introduced for solving continuously differentiable problems. Then, it has been shown that using the particle swarm algorithm with a direct search algorithm can solve non-linear optimization problems efficiently. Some standard examples have been presented to demonstrate the ability and effectiveness of this approach.", "paper_title": "Random derivative-free algorithm for solving unconstrained or bound constrained continuously differentiable non-linear problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000360246700002"}
