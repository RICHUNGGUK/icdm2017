The camera housing contains actuators that change the orientation of the camera - enabling a full rotation around the vertical axis (pan) and 90 around the horizontal axis (tilt). A system for acquisition, processing image analysis and a camera driver are implemented in the FPGA Xilinx Spartan-6 device. An original, innovative reconfigurable system architecture has been developed. The FPGA device is connected directly to the eight independently operated SRAM memory banks. A prototype device has been constructed with a real-time tracking algorithm, enabling an automatically control of the position of the camera. The device has been tested indoors and outdoors. The camera is able to keep a tracked object close to the center of its field of view. The power consumption of the control system is 2 W. A reconfigurable part reaches the computing performance of 3200 MOPS. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
