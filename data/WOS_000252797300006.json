A computer game product line definition and its architecture are specified and implemented by means of software factory assets, such as a visual designer based on a domain-specific language, semantic validators and code generators. The proposed approach is then illustrated and empirically validated by the creation of real world case studies. Finally, it is investigated how the proposed factory can be used as an edutainment platform for Computer Science I and 2 courses. The final intention is to empower game developers and designers to work more productively, with a higher level of abstraction and closer to their application domain.", "paper_title": "Computer games software factory and edutainment platform or Microsoft .NET", "paper_id": "WOS:000252797300006"}
