A single package including the various multivariate statistical methods for angular data that accounts for the distinct topology of such data does not exist. Here, we present a lightweight standalone, operating-system independent package called Clustangles to fill this gap. Clustangles will be useful in analyzing the ever-increasing number of structures in the Protein Data Bank and clustering the copious conformations from increasingly long molecular dynamics simulations.", "paper_title": "Clustangles: An Open Library for Clustering Angular Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000360322800002"}
