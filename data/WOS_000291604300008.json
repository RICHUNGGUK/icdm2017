By the known upper bounds on the order of cages, this implies that the cop number of a connected n-vertex graph can be as large as Omega(n(2/3)) if t >= 2, and Omega(n(4/5)) if t >= 4. This improves the Omega(n(t-3/t-2)) lower bound of Frieze, Krivelevich and Loh (Variations on cops and robbers, J. Graph Theory, to appear) when 2 <= t <= 6. We also conjecture a general upper bound O(n(t/t+1)) for the cop number in this variant, generalizing Meyniel's conjecture.", "paper_title": "Lower Bounds for the Cop Number when the Robber is Fast", "paper_id": "WOS:000291604300008"}
