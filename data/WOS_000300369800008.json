In practice, as the network scale keeps expanding, this design problem becomes more critical. Due to scalability and domain privacy, designing the protection scheme in multi-domain networks is more difficult than that in single domain networks. The path computation element (PCE) is known as an efficient architecture to compute optimal traffic engineering (TE) paths in multidomain multilayer networks. Based on the PCE architecture, we first propose a new dynamic domain-sequencing scheme that considers the load balance of inter-domain links and then propose an improved segment-shared protection approach called DDSP. It can provide 100% protection ability for multiple failures that each single domain has only one failed link. Finally, the protection based on the optimal dynamic domain-sequencing scheme, called OPT, is designed, to evaluate performance of our algorithm and to provide the good bounding for the dynamic domain-sequencing scheme with limited intra TE information. Simulation evaluation shows that the proposed scheme is effective in multi-domain path protection with more efficient resource utilization, lower blocking probabilities and less inter-domain cost. Furthermore, the performance of it is near to OPT.", "paper_title": "A novel segment-shared protection algorithm based on dynamic domain-sequencing scheme for multi-domain optical mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000300369800008"}
