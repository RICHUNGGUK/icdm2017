The multiplexing is known as traffic grooming and performed by SONET Add-Drop Multiplexers (SADM). The maximum number of low-rate traffic demands that can be multiplexed into one wavelength channel is called grooming factor. Since SADMs are expensive, a key optimization goal of traffic grooming is to minimize the total number of SADMs in order to satisfy a given set of traffic demands. As an important communication traffic pattern, all-to-all traffic has been widely studied for the traffic grooming problem. In this paper, we study the regular traffic pattern, which is considered as a generalization of the all-to-all traffic pattern. We focus on the Unidirectional Path-Switched Ring (UPSR) networks. We prove that the traffic grooming problem is NP-hard for the regular traffic pattern in UPSR networks, and show that the problem does not admit a Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS). We further prove that the problem remains NP-hard even if the grooming factor is any fixed value chosen from a subset of integers. We also propose a performance guaranteed algorithm to minimize the total number of required SADMs, and show that the algorithm achieves a better upper bound than previous algorithms. Extensive simulations are conducted, and the empirical results validate that our algorithm outperforms the previous ones in most cases. In addition, our algorithm always uses the minimum number of wavelengths, which are precious resources as well in optical networks. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
