The CIE-LAB 1976 colour space coordinates of the purple di-n-heptyl viologen radical cation salt were L* = 76, a* = 33, and b* = -20, with a complementary wavelength of 548 nm. A sharp decrease in luminance Was found on formation of the di-n-heptyl viologen radical cation salt. Colour coordinates for the reverse (oxidation) direction plots show hysteresis, implying that specific choice of colour values depends oil both the potential applied and from which direction the potential is changed.
