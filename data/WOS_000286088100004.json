This paper adopts an advanced discretisation approach to simulate rock failure problems within the discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA) framework. The accuracy of this approach in continuum analysis is verified first. Then, the advanced discretisation approach for fracturing modelling is presented, and the discretisation strategy is discussed. Sample rock static failures are simulated and the results are compared with experimental results. Thereafter, with a generalised definition of the artificial joints, this approach is further extended and applied in the simulation of blast-induced rock mass failures in which the instant explosion gas pressure obtained by the detonation pressure equation of state is loaded on the main blast chamber walls and the induced surrounding connected fracture surfaces. In the simulation instance of rock mass cast blasting, the whole process, including the blast chamber expansion, explosion gas penetration, rock mass failure and cast, and the formation of the final blasting pile, is wholly reproduced.
