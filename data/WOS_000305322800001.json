So far, developers of WSNs have created various visualisation tools under different project/research backgrounds. These tools, however, are limited in certain application scenarios, since the underlying packet formats are hard coded into the programs. For this purpose, we present NetViewer, a universal visualisation tool for all the applications, and we provide many useful data services to fulfil different needs of various fields.", "paper_title": "Visualising wireless sensor networks with NetViewer", "paper_id": "WOS:000305322800001"}
