Suprasegmental and segmental features were manipulated independently by transferring (1) native intonation contours and/or syllable durations onto non-native segments and (2) non-native intonation contours and/or syllable durations onto native segments in both English and German. These resynthesized stimuli were then presented, in an intelligibility task, to native speakers of German and English who were proficient in both languages. Both of these groups of speakers and monolingual native speakers of English also rated the foreign accentedness of the manipulated stimuli. In general, tokens became more accented and less intelligible, the more they were manipulated. Tokens were also less accented and more intelligible when produced by speakers of (and in) the listeners' L1. Nonetheless, in certain L2 productions, there was both a reduction in perceived accentedness and decreased intelligibility for tokens in which native prosody was applied to non-native segments, indicating a disconnect between the perceptual processing of intelligibility and accent.
