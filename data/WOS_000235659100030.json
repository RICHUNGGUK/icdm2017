But adopting this approach, we need to solve two problems: 1) how to characterize the distance among data trends (rather than raw data) of different sensors; 2) based on the distance, how to form the cluster and use the virtual network to represent the whole sensor network within certain error range: For the first problem, the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) is used to characterize the distance among different distributions which represent the data trend of sensors. Then, based on JSD, a hierarchical clustering algorithm is provided to form the virtual sensor network topology. Finally, the performance of our approach is evaluated through simulation.", "paper_title": "On studying partial coverage and spatial clustering based on Jensen-Shannon divergence in sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100030"}
