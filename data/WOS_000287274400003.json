To discipline the right of network usage, network system identifies users before providing network services or resources. In the historical researches, the conventional authentication mechanisms frequently adopted the names and passwords of users as login authentication. However, these Single Factor Authentication mechanisms are proved to be defective. In virtue of enhancing security, recent researches on authentication are built on Two-Factor Authentication schemes. Nevertheless, the expensive cost of building Two-Factor Authentication approaches has affected the will of users. For the purpose of lifting the rate of usage, in this paper, we apply low-cost passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag along with the names and passwords of users as login authentication. The analytic comparison indicates the research not only reduces the cost of Two-Factor Authentication schemes, but provides security in the same way as smart cards technology. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
