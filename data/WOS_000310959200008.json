Several methods in the time and spectral domain have previously been devised to conduct such a test. Here, we explore a new approach to the problem by comparing sample arc lengths (ALs) of the two series. Because sample ALs are derived from first-order differences in the series, the proposed methods work for both stationary autoregressive moving average and non-stationary autoregressive integrated moving average processes. This robustness is advantageous when one is unsure about unit root properties in the underlying series.", "paper_title": "Arc length tests for equivalent autocovariances", "paper_id": "WOS:000310959200008"}
