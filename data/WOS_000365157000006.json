One of the most famous SLS algorithms for SAT is WalkSAT, which is an initial algorithm that has wide influence and performs very well on random 3-SAT instances. However, the performance of WalkSAT on random k-SAT instances with k > 3 lags far behind. Indeed, there are limited works on improving SLS algorithms for such instances. This work takes a good step toward this direction. We propose a novel concept namely multilevel make. Based on this concept, we design a scoring function called linear make, which is utilized to break ties in WalkSAT, leading to a new algorithm called WalkSATlm. Our experimental results show that WalkSATlm improves WalkSAT by orders of magnitude on random k-SAT instances with k > 3 near the phase transition. Additionally, we propose an efficient implementation for WalkSATlm, which leads to a speedup of 100%. We also give some insights on different forms of linear make functions, and show the limitation of the linear make function on random 3-SAT through theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Improving WalkSAT By Effective Tie-Breaking and Efficient Implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000365157000006"}
