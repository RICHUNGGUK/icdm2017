However, the \"publish first, refine later\" philosophy leads to various quality problems arising in the underlying data such as incompleteness, inconsistency and semantic ambiguities. In this article, we describe the current state of Data Quality in the Web of Data along with details of the three papers accepted for the International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems' (IJSWIS) Special Issue on Web Data Quality. Additionally, we identify new challenges that are specific to the Web of Data and provide insights into the current progress and future directions for each of those challenges.", "paper_title": "Web Data Quality: Current State and New Challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000345429300001"}
