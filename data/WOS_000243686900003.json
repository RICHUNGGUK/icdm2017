Although deadlock-free routing is often employed for low-latency communications using wormhole or virtual cut-through switching, the interconnection adaptivity introduces difficulties in establishing deadlock- free paths. An up*/down* routing algorithm, which has been widely used to avoid deadlocks in irregular networks, tends to make unbalanced paths as it employs a one-dimensional directed graph. The current study introduces a two-dimensional directed graph on which adaptive routings called left-up first turn (L-turn) routings and right-down last turn (R-turn) routings are proposed to make the paths as uniformly distributed as possible. This scheme guarantees deadlock- freedom because it uses the turn model approach, and the extra degree of freedom in the two-dimensional graph helps to ensure that the prohibited turns are well-distributed. Simulation results show that better throughput and latency results from uniformly distributing the prohibited turns by which the traffic would be more distributed toward the leaf nodes. The L-turn routings, which meet this condition, improve throughput by up to 100 percent compared with two up*/down*-based routings, and also reduce latency.", "paper_title": "An effective design of deadlock-free routing algorithms based on 2D turn model for irregular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000243686900003"}
