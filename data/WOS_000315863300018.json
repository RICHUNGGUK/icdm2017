Large Eddy Simulation will be used to model the internal flow turbulence in a Diesel fuel injector with velocities over 500 m/s. More specifically, the influence of boundary conditions applied to the model will be studied. The article analyzes the influence of the inlet boundary condition upon activation and maintenance of turbulent flow during the calculation. Carefully assessing which inlet boundary condition is more trustworthy in reality, for this the outlet velocity, pressure, turbulence and level of stabilization will be studied.
