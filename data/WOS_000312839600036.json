The nonlinear system is represented by a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system, and a network-induced delay is incorporated in the modeling of the connection link. In order to compensate for the network link effects and eliminate the tracking error, we employ some techniques mainly used in the predictive control and the integral control. Moreover, a quadratic cost function which includes terms related to the performance of the system and the actuating capacity is used. We assume that the lumped network-induced delay lies within a known set, and that the occurrence probability for each element in the set is known a priori. Then, the delay information will be incorporated into the delay-dependent tracking controllers. The parameters for the tracking controller are derived by solving an optimization problem. A networked inverted pendulum is used to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed design method.", "paper_title": "H-infinity Step Tracking Control for Networked Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems With Integral and Predictive Actions", "paper_id": "WOS:000312839600036"}
