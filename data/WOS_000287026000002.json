The fourth generation of ISD represents the attempt to establish a system that can adapt to individual learning and performance problems/needs while also being able to continuously update itself. It is learning-theory-neutral and takes into account the expertise of the instructional designer, while presenting the instructional designer an opportunity to utilise different domains of the system to address instructional problems or needs.", "paper_title": "A problem-solving approach to management of instructional systems design", "paper_id": "WOS:000287026000002"}
