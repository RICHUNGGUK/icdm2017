The number and states of targets and the biases of sensors are jointly estimated by this method without the data association. Monte Carlo (MC) simulation results show that the proposed method (i) outperforms, although computationally more expensive than, the extended multi-sensor PHD filter which has been proposed for joint spatial registration and MTT; (ii) outperforms the multi-sensor joint probabilistic data association (MSJPDA) filter which is also extended in this study for joint spatial registration and MTT when the clutter is relatively dense.", "paper_title": "Joint spatial registration and multi-target tracking using an extended PM-CPHD filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000300774900002"}
