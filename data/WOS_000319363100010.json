Two Norwegian universities have developed a continuing education programme at two levels. The client has been three industrial companies in the oil and gas sector. For delivery another two universities outside Norway has participated. The hybrid model contains two plenary sessions using traditional teaching methods. In addition there are a number of virtual sessions using technology enhanced learning including multimedia technology. In addition there is a project assignment to be solved by groups of three course participants. Experience has shown that training based on a combination of on-campus and Web-based is an effective approach. This concept may be significantly more effective than traditional programs with plenary sessions only or with virtual content only.", "paper_title": "Experience from continuing education using e-learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000319363100010"}
