The best previously published attack on IDEA could only handle 6 of its 8.5-rounds. In this paper, we combine a highly optimized meet-in-the-middle attack with a keyless version of the Biryukov-Demirci relation to obtain a greatly improved attack on 6-round IDEA which requires only two known plaintexts, and the first key recovery attacks on versions of IDEA with 6.5 to 8.5 rounds.", "paper_title": "New Attacks on IDEA with at Least 6 Rounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000350245700001"}
