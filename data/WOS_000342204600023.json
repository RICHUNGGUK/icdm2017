Using some new upper bound norms for the interconnection matrices of the neural networks and constructing suitable Lyapunov functional, we derive novel conditions for the global robust asymptotic stability of equilibrium point. The obtained results can be easily verified as they can be expressed in terms of the network parameters only. It is shown that the established stability condition generalizes some existing ones, and it can be considered to an alternative result to some other corresponding results derived in previous literature. We also provide two comparative numerical examples to illustrate the advantages of our result over the previously published corresponding robust stability results.", "paper_title": "Improved robust stability criteria for bidirectional associative memory neural networks under parameter uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000342204600023"}
