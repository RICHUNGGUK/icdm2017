For that purpose it introduces a first order functional stream language that allows the programmer to implement second order functionals. This characterization is extended through the use of exp-poly interpretations as an attempt to capture the class of Basic Feasible Functionals (BFF). Moreover, these results are adapted to provide a new characterization of polynomial time complexity in computable analysis. These characterizations give a new insight on the relations between the complexity of functional stream programs and the classes of functions computed by Oracle Turing Machine, where oracles are treated as inputs.
