In recent years, many works have emerged presenting energy-efficient actuators with electrical motors. However, there is little consistency in the way energy consumption is calculated. Drive inertia, motor efficiency and controller efficiency are often neglected in optimizations, and so are the load- and speed-dependency of the losses and other non-linearities. While this approach works well in stationary circumstances, it can lead to significant errors in highly dynamic tasks with a wide range of operation, such as the ones faced by actuators in the field of robotics. This paper discusses the losses occurring in an actuator consisting of a DC motor and gearbox as it is forcing a swinging motion on a pendulum. From this simple case study, some general recommendations on the modeling of energy losses are formulated. Combining data from manufacturer's datasheets with empirical data, the approach presented in this paper was able to predict the energy consumption for this specific case with an error of less than 10%.
