This study presents multi-lag Tone-Entropy (T-E) analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) at multiple lags as a screening tool for CAN. A total of 41 ECG recordings were acquired from diabetic subjects with definite CAN (CAN+) and without CAN (CAN-) and analyzed. Tone and entropy values of each patient were calculated for different beat sequence lengths (len: 50-900) and lags (m: 1-8). The CAN- group was found to have a lower mean tone value compared to that of CAN+ group for all m and len, whereas the mean entropy value was higher in CAN- than that in CAN+ group. Leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation tests using a quadratic discriminant (QD) classifier were applied to investigate the performance of multi-lag T-E features. We obtained 100 % accuracy for tone and entropy with len = 250 and m = {2, 3} settings, which is better than the performance of T-E technique based on lag m = 1. The results demonstrate the usefulness of multi-lag T-E analysis over single lag analysis in CAN diagnosis for risk stratification and highlight the change in autonomic nervous system modulation of the heart rate associated with cardiac autonomic neuropathy.", "paper_title": "Risk stratification of cardiac autonomic neuropathy based on multi-lag Tone-Entropy", "paper_id": "WOS:000317844500006"}
