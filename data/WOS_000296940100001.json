This multi-viewpoint approach interprets the same set of events from the different viewpoints in this set. The algorithms for managing these viewpoints and the set of events are related to hypothetical reasoning, and they use several main functions to (1) select or reject certain events, (2) cancel or recover these events, and (3) manage the consistency of the viewpoints. This approach is applied to diagnosis and trial-and-error activities related to the phone troubleshooting problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
