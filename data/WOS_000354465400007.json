The problem is formulated as a double-objective optimization problem with the adjusted average time to signal as the statistical objective and the expected cost per hour as the economic objective. Bai and Lee's [An economic design of variable sampling interval over bar X control charts. Int J Prod Econ. 1998;54:57-64] economic model is considered. Then we find the Pareto-optimal designs in which the two objectives are minimized simultaneously by using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. Through an illustrative example, the advantages of the proposed approach are shown by providing a list of viable optimal solutions and graphical representations, which indicate the advantage of flexibility and adaptability of our approach.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of the economic statistical design of the multivariate T-2 control chart with multiple variable sampling intervals scheme: NSGA-II approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000354465400007"}
