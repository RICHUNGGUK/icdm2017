Csiszar and Narayan's result for the single-user arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) establishes the missing part in Jahn's characterization. Nevertheless, being based on Ahlswede's elimination technique, Jahn's characterization is not applicable for symmetrizable channels under state constraint. Here, the various notions of symnietrizability for the two-user broadcast AVC are defined. Sufficient non-symmetrizability condition that renders the common message capacity of the AVGBC positive is identified using an approach different from Jahn's. The decoding rules we use establish an achievable region under state and input constraints for the family of degraded message sets codes over the AVGBC.", "paper_title": "On the deterministic-code capacity of the two-user discrete memoryless arbitrarily varying general broadcast channel with degraded message sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000241805700018"}
