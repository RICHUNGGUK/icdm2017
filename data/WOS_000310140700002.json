The framework consists of two phases: training and prediction. In the training phase, two supervised nonnegative matrix factorizations for image descriptors and annotation terms are combined to identify the latent image bases, and to represent the training images in the bases space. These latent bases can capture the representation of the images in terms of both descriptors and annotation terms. Based on the new representation of training images, classifiers can be learnt and built. In the prediction phase, a test image is first represented by the latent bases via solving a linear least squares problem, and then its class label and annotation can be predicted via the trained classifiers and the proposed annotation mapping model. In the algorithm, we develop a three-block proximal alternating nonnegative least squares algorithm to determine the latent image bases, and show its convergent property. Extensive experiments on real-world image data sets suggest that the proposed framework is able to predict the label and annotation for testing images successfully. Experimental results have also shown that our algorithm is computationally efficient and effective for image classification and annotation.", "paper_title": "SNMFCA: Supervised NMF-Based Image Classification and Annotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000310140700002"}
