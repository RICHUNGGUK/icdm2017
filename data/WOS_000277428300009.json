It forms the kernel in many important tile-based BLAS algorithms, making an excellent candidate for acceleration. The designs, both based on the rank-1 update scheme, can handle arbitrary matrix sizes, and are able to sustain their peak performance except during an initial latency period. Through these designs, the trade-offs involved in terms of local-memory and bandwidth for an FPGA implementation are demonstrated and an analysis is presented for the optimal choice of design parameters. The designs, implemented on a Virtex-5 SX240T FPGA, scale gracefully from 1 to 40 processing elements(PEs) with a less than 1% degradation in the design frequency of 373 MHz. With 40 PEs and a design speed of 373 MHz, a sustained performance of 29.8 GFLOPS is possible with a bandwidth requirement of 750 MB/s for design-II and 5.9 GB/s for design-I. This compares favourably with both related art and general purpose CPU implementations.", "paper_title": "FPGA Based High Performance Double-Precision Matrix Multiplication", "paper_id": "WOS:000277428300009"}
