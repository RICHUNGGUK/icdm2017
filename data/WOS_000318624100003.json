The two-parametric mathematical model of lateral torsional buckling is based on the Bernoulli-Euler beam theory and is given in dimensionless form. The optimization procedure is performed using the optimal control theory and the relation between state and adjoint variables is presented. The boundary value problem derived from the optimization procedure is solved numerically and compared to solutions obtained via an alternative optimization approach called sequential approximate optimization.", "paper_title": "Geometry optimization of a slender cantilever beam subjected to lateral buckling", "paper_id": "WOS:000318624100003"}
