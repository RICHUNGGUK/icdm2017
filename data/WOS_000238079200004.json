One feature in C2DVLC is the usage of multiple 2D-VLC tables and another feature is the usage of simple Exponential-Golomb codes. C2DVLC employs context-based adaptive multiple table coding to exploit the statistical correlation between DCT coefficients of one block for higher coding efficiency. Exp-Golomb codes are applied to code the pairs of the run-length of zero coefficients and the nonzero coefficient for lower storage requirement. C2DVLC is a low complexity coder in terms of both computational time and memory requirement. The experimental results show that C2DVLC can gain 0.34dB in average for the tested videos when compared with the traditional 2D-VLC coding method like that used in MPEG-2. And compared with CAVLC in H.264/AVC, C2DVLC shows similar coding efficiency.", "paper_title": "Context-based 2D-VLC entropy coder in AVS video coding standard", "paper_id": "WOS:000238079200004"}
