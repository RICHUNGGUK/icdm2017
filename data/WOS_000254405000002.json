Three phases of contributions are included in this work: reliable shot classification, explicit event detection, and elaborate applications. At the shot classification stage, color and geometric information are utilized to classify video shots into several canonical views. To explicitly detect semantic events, rule-based decision and model-based decision methods are developed. We emphasize that this system efficiently and exactly identifies what happened in baseball games rather than roughly finding some interesting parts. On the basis of explicit event detection, many accurate and practical applications such as automatic box score generation and game summarization could be built. The reported results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework and demonstrate some research opportunities about bridging the semantic gap for sports videos.", "paper_title": "Explicit semantic events detection and development of realistic applications for broadcasting baseball videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000254405000002"}
