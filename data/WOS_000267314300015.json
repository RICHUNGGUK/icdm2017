These analyses are evaluated against data from an extensive series of physical model tests examining the influence of an embedded wall placed near a tunnel on ground movements and tunnel stability. It is shown that for heavily overconsoliclated soils reasonable predictions of both deformations and failure can be obtained from kinematic hardening models such as the 3-SKH model, which allow plastic deformation inside a Modified Cam clay state boundary surface.
