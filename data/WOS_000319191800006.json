The existence and uniqueness of T-transitive closure of interval-valued fuzzy relations is proved. An algorithm to compute the T-transitive closure of finite interval-valued fuzzy relations is showed. Some properties and some examples is given for t-representable and t-pseudo representable generalized t-norms.", "paper_title": "Transitive Closure of Interval-valued Fuzzy Relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000319191800006"}
