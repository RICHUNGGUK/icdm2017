This problem, motivated by RNA secondary structure prediction, asks to find a maximum cardinality subset of a 2-interval set with respect to some prespecified geometric constraints. We present several constant factor approximation algorithms whose performance guarantee depends on the different possible restrictions imposed on the input 2-interval set. In addition, we show that our results extend to the weighted variant of the problem. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
