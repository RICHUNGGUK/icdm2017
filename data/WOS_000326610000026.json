First we propose a GRASP algorithm, including a constructive procedure, a postprocessing phase and some improvement moves. The best solutions obtained are then combined into a Path Relinking procedure for which we have developed three versions: static, dynamic and evolutionary. An extensive computational study, using two- and three-dimensional instances, shows the relative efficiency of the alternatives considered for each phase of the algorithm and the good performance of our algorithm compared with previously reported results.
