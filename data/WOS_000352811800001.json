Examples of such networks are often found in heterogeneous networks, mobile or extreme terrestrial networks, and planned networks in space. In this paper, we examine the metropolitan bus network as a research target of DTN for a public transport network. We analyze the metropolitan bus network through spatial and temporal modeling using an existing Bus Information System (BIS) database. On the basis of the results of our analysis, we propose and design an appropriate DTN routing scheme called Hybrid Position-based DTN Routing. This scheme uses position-based routing instead of address-based routing by soliciting infrastructural help from nearby Access Points for the real-time BIS location service. We simulated our scheme using a WLAN for the wideband DTN communication and evaluated it by comparing it with traditional Ad hoc flooding, Epidemic routing, and strategic protocol steps in our own algorithm. The results indicate that our scheme achieves reasonably high performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, latency, and resource usage.
