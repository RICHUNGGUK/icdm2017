Firstly, we put forward a novel dissipative Hamiltonian realization (DHR) structure and give the condition to complete the Hamiltonian realization. Then, based on the DHR, we present a criterion for the stability analysis of NDAS and construct a stabilization controller for NDAS in absence of disturbances. Finally, for NDAS in presence of disturbances, the L-2 gain is analyzed via generalized Hamilton-Jacobi inequality and an H-infinity control strategy is constructed. The proposed stabilization and robust controller can effectively take advantage of the structural characteristics of NDAS and is simple in form.", "paper_title": "Feedback control of nonlinear differential algebraic systems using Hamiltonian function method", "paper_id": "WOS:000240614500003"}
