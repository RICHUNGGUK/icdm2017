In the case of the design of fixtures for complex components, this approach often results in a need for rework and consequent delays to production. Machining fixture design has been the subject of considerable research efforts; however most research activities have addressed one or a small number of interactions between fixture and other manufacturing system elements. In this paper, a novel fixture design methodology based on concurrent engineering is described. This methodology models physical space, loads, stress, deformation, thermal effects, vibration, etc., determines the loads and deflections arising from the locating, clamping and machining procedures, and estimates the resultant effects on component quality. To assist in the development of the methodology, the high technology industrial partner originally provided the researchers with a range of complex machined components of various sizes, incorporating many different features. The methodology has been tested against a range of successful and unsuccessful fixture designs supplied by the industrial partner.", "paper_title": "A methodology for the development of machining fixtures for components with complicated geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000259223800008"}
