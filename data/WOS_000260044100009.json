Herein, a new waveform is proposed for high-speed driving. A proposed driving waveform, which had a log-type scan waveform, was proved by applying to a 4-in. test panel. The results showed that the minimum V-data voltage of the driving waveform was about 27.0 V at a scan pulse width of 0.8 mu s. This result shows that the minimum V-data voltage decreases by 27.0 V from the conventional driving waveform. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
