The score describes the effective metabolic overlap (EMO) between two species, derived from analyzing the topology of the corresponding metabolic models.

It takes as input lists of species-specific enzymatic reactions (EC numbers) and generates a matrix of the potential competition scores between all pairwise combinations.", "paper_title": "NetCmpt: a network-based tool for calculating the metabolic competition between bacterial species", "paper_id": "WOS:000307501100021"}
