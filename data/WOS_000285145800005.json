PPT data were recorded from 36 points in 20 healthy males using a standardised grid. Points were clustered using the K-means algorithm with a fixed initialisation procedure. The total number of clusters was determined on the basis of (1) R(2) evaluation of the clustering outcome compared against a desired 95% reduction in variance criterion and (2) the number of empty clusters. A minimum of three clusters were found which fulfilled the criteria. The proposed method enables the identification of a relation between the muscle subdivisions and pressure pain sensitivity within the trapezius. Further, the cluster analysis will enable the study of differences in pain sensitivity distributions between patients and controls and quantify the effect of intervention (physical or pharmacological treatments).", "paper_title": "Cluster analysis of pressure pain threshold maps from the trapezius muscle", "paper_id": "WOS:000285145800005"}
