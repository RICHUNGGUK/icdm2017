The reason that the sentences in different natural languages can be translated to each other is that they have the same meaning. This paper discusses a new sentence parsing, called semantic-parsing, based on semantic units theory. It is a new theory where a sentence of a natural language is not regarded as of words and phrases arranged linearly; rather it is expected to consist of semantic units with or without type-parameters. This is a new parsing approach where the syntax-parsing-tree and semantic-parsing-tree are isomorphic. It is also a new approach in which the structure-trees of the sentences in all different natural languages can correspond.", "paper_title": "SEMANTIC-PARSING BASED ON SEMANTIC UNITS THEORY - A NEW APPROACH TO NATURAL LANGUAGES PROCESSING", "paper_id": "WOS:000262598400009"}
