In addition, a feature selection method called recursive feature elimination (RFE), originally used for support vector machine (SVM), was introduced and modified to fit the scheme of ULDA. From the evaluation of six pharmaceutical datasets, the M-UDLA coupled with RFE showed better or comparable classification accuracy with respect to other well-studied methods such as SVM and decision trees. The RFE used for ULDA has the advantage of increasing the computational speed and provides useful insights into biochemical mechanisms related to pharmaceutical activity by significantly reducing the number of variables used for the final model.", "paper_title": "A modified uncorrelated linear discriminant analysis model coupled with recursive feature elimination for the prediction of bioactivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000264827500001"}
