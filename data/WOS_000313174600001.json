However, it is almost impossible to use IPv6 directly in WSN due to its huge energy consumption. This paper proposes a double adaptively clustering hierarchy (DACH) algorithm which enables using IPv6 in WSN in an efficient and reliable way. Firstly, we present a clustering method to adaptively divide the whole sensor network into clusters according to its energy consumption in the last round. Then we propose an adaptive cluster head selection algorithm which employs a strategy to choose the most suitable cluster heads; meantime, this selection algorithm is integrated into DACH. Finally, the complete framework is built between headers and their slave nodes based on IEEE 802.15.4, and IPv6 is used to connect the headers and the base stations. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the DACH algorithm has lower time and energy consumption. Moreover, it is more reliable and applicable than many other IP-based WSN algorithms.", "paper_title": "DACH: An Efficient and Reliable Way to Integrate WSN with IPv6", "paper_id": "WOS:000313174600001"}
