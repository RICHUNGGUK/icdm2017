According to the work procedure in assigning maintenance tasks, a maintenance process simulation is generated on the virtual maintenance platform by following the simulation principle. The basic compensation time or ratio is acquired by analyzing the relationship between practical human motions and corresponding virtual human motions. After that, the compensation principle is confirmed based on the generated simulation principle. Finally, the simulation time and compensation time are approached according to the compensation model to obtain the predicted time. The obtained predicted time of several cases are accurate to a certain extent compared with feedback information. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
