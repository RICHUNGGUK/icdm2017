Several typical structures have been analyzed, and the computation time is compared with that of other algorithms such as biconjugate-gradient (BCG) algorithm and the conventional symmetric successive over-relaxation preconditioning biconjugate-gradient algorithm (SSOR-PBCG). The CPU time saved using the ISSOR-PBCG algorithm is nearly 27% and 65.5%, as compared with that using the SSOR-PBCG and the BCG algorithm. It can be seen that the ISSOR-PBCG algorithm is efficient for edge FEM equation sets derived from large-scale time-harmonic electromagnetic-field problems.
