The Joints of circular/linear elements are replaced by small segments of Pythagorean hodograph (PH) curves so that the final curve is globally C-2 continuous. The PH segments are produced via a second order Hermite interpolation. We discuss some implementation details and investigate the error introduced by replacing a part of G-code by a PH curve segment. We also report results of tests within an industrial environment that demonstrate an increase in path velocity while decreasing peak acceleration.", "paper_title": "Rounding spatial G-code tool paths using Pythagorean hodograph curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000249629200002"}
