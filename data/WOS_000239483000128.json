At every sample time, the closest model is selected by an index function which is formed by the integration of model output error. The element controller based on this model will be switched as the controller of the controlled system. This kind of multiple model adaptive controller (MMAC)is an extension of the MMAC in linear system, and it can improve the transient response and performance of the controlled system greatly.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear system adaptive control by using multiple neural network models", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000128"}
