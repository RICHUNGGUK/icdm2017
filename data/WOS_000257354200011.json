We discuss the advantages of the service-oriented approach with regard to the enactment of scientific applications on a grid infrastructure. Based on the development of a generic Web-Services wrapper, we show how the flexibility of our architecture enables dynamic service grouping for optimizing the application execution time. We demonstrate performance results on a real medical imaging application. On a production grid infrastructure, the optimization proposed introduces a significant speed-up (from 1.2 to 2.9) when compared to a traditional execution. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
