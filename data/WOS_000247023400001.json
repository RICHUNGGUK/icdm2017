This reputation algorithm, has been proved in several scenarios where the goal is to avoid (in other words, filter out) the disturbing influence of wrong recommendations from agents with malicious intentions, such as a collusion between a merchant and a recommender. Results show how the evolution of reputation computed with our fuzzy reputation algorithm is compared with other previous reputation models.", "paper_title": "Avoiding malicious agents in E-commerce using fuzzy recommendations", "paper_id": "WOS:000247023400001"}
