In this paper, we propose a super node system architecture to achieve the connectivity over interconnected heterogeneous wireless access networks, which employs the delay-tolerant network (DTN) concept to overcome the problem of potential intermittent connections caused by user roaming and ensures message delivery in the presence of a long disconnection period. By introducing the concept of virtual network topology, we present a new routing technique for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) within the system architecture, which redefines the dominating-set based routing for the challenged network environment. A time based methodology is presented to predict the probability of future contacts between node pairs for constructing the virtual network topology. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dominating-set based routing scheme under the DTN system architecture.", "paper_title": "DTN Based Dominating Set Routing for MANET in Heterogeneous Wireless Networking", "paper_id": "WOS:000263978900005"}
