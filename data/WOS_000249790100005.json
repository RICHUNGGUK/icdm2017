The FBS ontology provides a uniform framework for classifying processes, and includes higher level semantics in their representation. We show that this ontology supports a situated view of processes based on a model of three interacting worlds. The situated FBS framework is then used to describe the situated design of processes.", "paper_title": "A function-behavior-structure ontology of processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000249790100005"}
