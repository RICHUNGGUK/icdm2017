The interpreted behavior combined with the minimal foraging is simulated by the artificial bee colony algorithm to develop a robust search technique that exhibits elevated performance in multidimensional objective space. Through detailed experimental study and rigorous analysis, we highlight the statistical superiority enjoyed by our algorithm over a wide variety of functions as compared to some highly competitive state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "A Spatially Informative Optic Flow Model of Bee Colony With Saccadic Flight Strategy for Global Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000342228100015"}
