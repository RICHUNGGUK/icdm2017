In the last decade, the amount of customers, services and online information has grown rapidly, yielding the big data analysis problem for service recommender systems. Consequently, traditional service recommender systems often suffer from scalability and inefficiency problems when processing or analysing such large-scale data. Moreover, most of existing service recommender systems present the same ratings and rankings of services to different users without considering diverse users' preferences, and therefore fails to meet users' personalized requirements. In this paper, we propose a Keyword-Aware Service Recommendation method, named KASR, to address the above challenges. It aims at presenting a personalized service recommendation list and recommending the most appropriate services to the users effectively. Specifically, keywords are used to indicate users' preferences, and a user-based Collaborative Filtering algorithm is adopted to generate appropriate recommendations. To improve its scalability and efficiency in big data environment, KASR is implemented on Hadoop, a widely-adopted distributed computing platform using the MapReduce parallel processing paradigm. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on real-world data sets, and results demonstrate that KASR significantly improves the accuracy and scalability of service recommender systems over existing approaches.", "paper_title": "KASR: A Keyword-Aware Service Recommendation Method on MapReduce for Big Data Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000347015800017"}
