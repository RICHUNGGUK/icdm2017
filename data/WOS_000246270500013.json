In general, over 30% of memory can be saved over conventional partially parallel decoder architectures. Efficient techniques have been developed to reduce the computation delay of the node processing units and to minimize hardware overhead for parallel processing. The proposed decoder architecture can linearly increase the decoding throughput with a small percentage of extra hardware. Consequently, it facilitates the applications of LDPC codes in area/power sensitive high-speed communication systems.", "paper_title": "A memory efficient partially parallel decoder architecture for quasi-cyclic LDPC codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000246270500013"}
