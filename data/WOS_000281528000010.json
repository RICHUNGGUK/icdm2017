In this work we use data sets which represent actual attacks in the operational Internet. We analyze the data sets to understand the dynamics of the attacks and then go onto show the effectiveness of sharing incident related information to contain these attacks. We describe universal data acquisition system for event based management (UniDAS), a novel system for secure and automated cross-domain event information sharing. The system uses a generic, structured data format based on a standardized incident object description and exchange format (IODEF). IODEF is an XML-based extensible data format for security incident information exchange. We propose a simple and effective security model for IODEF and apply it to the secure and automated generic event information sharing system UniDAS. We present the system we have developed and evaluate its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Sharing Information for Event Analysis over the Wide Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000281528000010"}
