The bond, which comprises a spring bond and water bond, is developed to consider the interaction of the pore pressure with deformation of the soil matrix. A parameter representing soil heterogeneity is introduced to consider the uneven drying during desiccation. The capability of the model is demonstrated through a number of numerical examples, which are in good agreement with the experimental observations. Three significant factors controlling desiccation cracking, which are soil particle size, heterogeneity and boundary conditions, are identified. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
