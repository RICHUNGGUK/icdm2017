The curves of 50% successes in solving underdetermined systems, z = Aw, by l(1) linear programming with uniformly distributed compressed sensing matrices A is an element of R-d (x) (m), where d < m and w is a sparse vector, have been numerically observed and recently shown to coincide with the Donoho-Tanner curves for normally-distributed compressed sensing matrices A derived from geometric combinatorics. When n <= m/2, correcting a linear code is faster if done directly by l(1) linear programming. However, when n > m/2, to save computing time, this problem can be transformed into an underdetermined compressed sensing problem, Aw = z := Ay, for the syndrome z by a full rank matrix A is an element of R-d x m, d = m - n, such that AB = 0. For this purpose, to have equivalently high mean breakdown points by l(1) linear programming, one can use uniformly distributed random matrices A is an element of R(m-n) x m and matrices B is an element of R-d x m with orthonormal columns spanning the null space of A. Two exceptional cases have been found.
