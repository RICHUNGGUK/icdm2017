The design problem is formulated as a semi-infinite linear programming problem. With suitable discretizations, an exchange algorithm is employed. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is established. In the formulation, since the stopband is minimized, the method can be employed for the design of very highly optimized windows.", "paper_title": "A fast algorithm for the optimal design of high accuracy windows in signal processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000320925500015"}
