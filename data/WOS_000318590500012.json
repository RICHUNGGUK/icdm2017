At present, MDS lacks a unifying methodology as it consists of a discrete collection of proposals that differ in their optimization criteria, called \"stress functions\". To correct this situation we propose (1) to embed many of the extant stress functions in a parametric family of stress functions, and (2) to replace the ad hoc choice among discrete proposals with a principled parameter selection method. This methodology yields the following benefits and problem solutions: (a) It provides guidance in tailoring stress functions to a given data situation, responding to the fact that no single stress function dominates all others across all data situations; (b) the methodology enriches the supply of available stress functions; (c) it helps our understanding of stress functions by replacing the comparison of discrete proposals with a characterization of the effect of parameters on embeddings; (d) it builds a bridge to graph drawing, which is the related but not identical art of constructing embeddings from graphs.", "paper_title": "Stress Functions for Nonlinear Dimension Reduction, Proximity Analysis, and Graph Drawing", "paper_id": "WOS:000318590500012"}
