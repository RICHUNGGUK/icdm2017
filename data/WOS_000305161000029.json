In this study, the major research effort is devoted to consider jointly adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) intrusion detection in the MAC layer and multimodal digital beamforming (DBF) in the PHY layer, with focus on improving the average detection delay (ADD) of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and demonstrating the defensive function of the robust null extension mode of a multimodal DBF by taking advantage of a two-state Markov chain model. A packet acquisition and analysis system (PAAS) is designed to collect and analyze the friend, intrusion and interference information generated from the wireless networks. A prototype of the ANFIS-based intrusion detection system (ANFIS-IDS) is implemented, trained and tested against a real de-authentication DoS attack to empirically demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed ANFIS-IDS, compared with the IDS using non-parametric sequential change point detection (NPSCPD) algorithm.", "paper_title": "INTELLIGENT INTRUSION DETECTION AND ROBUST NULL DEFENSE FOR WIRELESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000305161000029"}
