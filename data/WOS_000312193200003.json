A key issue is how to organize the data to adapt the challenges of data analysis. This paper borrows ideas from the Internet of things (IOT) into the digital world and organize the data entities to form a network, the Internet of data (IOD), which has huge potential in data-intensive applications. In the IOD, data hiding technology is utilized to embed virtual tags, which record all the activities of the data entities since they are created, into every data entity in the system. The IOD aims to organize the data to be interconnected as a network and collect useful information for data identification, data tracing, data vitalization and further data analysis.", "paper_title": "The Internet of data: a new idea to extend the IOT in the digital world", "paper_id": "WOS:000312193200003"}
