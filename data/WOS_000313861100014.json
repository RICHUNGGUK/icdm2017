A circuit family {Phi(n)} is succinct if there exists a nonuniform Boolean circuit family {C-n} with O (log n) many inputs and size n(0(1)) such that C-n can correctly answer direct connection language queries about Phi(n) - succinctness is a relaxation of uniformity. To obtain this result we develop a novel technique that further strengthens the connection between black-box derandomization of polynomial identity testing and lower bounds for arithmetic circuits. From this, we obtain the lower bound by giving an explicit construction, computable in the polynomial hierarchy, of a hitting set for arithmetic circuits. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
