The new stochastic search of parallel vector evaluated honeybee mating optimization (VEHBMO) technique mimics the honeybee's mating. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is compared with other stochastic optimization methods through standard benchmark functions. Also, the proposed VEHBMO is applied over real engineering problems of economic load dispatch and environmental/economic power dispatch problems. Obtained results confirm the validity of the proposed stochastic search technique.", "paper_title": "A new stochastic search algorithm bundled honeybee mating for solving optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000344775800034"}
