A Simultaneous Directions Implicit algorithm is employed which gives the model a high level of parallelization. The projection of the fluid velocity onto rigid motion on the particles is based on a fast computational technique which relies on the conservation of linear and angular momenta. Numerical results are presented which confirm the ability of the proposed method to simulate the sedimentation of one and many particles; the parallel efficiency of the algorithm is also assessed.
