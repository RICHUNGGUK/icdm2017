We consider the joint distribution of the pair (H(N), W(N)) and derive, after proper scaling, the joint limiting distribution. One of the results is that H(N) and W(N), properly scaled, are asymptotically independent.", "paper_title": "The weight and hopcount of the shortest path in the complete graph with exponential weights", "paper_id": "WOS:000258173600006"}
