In this paper, the authors present an integrated framework for semantic service composition using answer set programming. Unlike the AI planning approaches of top-down workflow with nested composition and combining composition procedure into service discovery, this proposed framework integrates designed workflow with nested composition. In addition, the planning is based on interface variables with validation through pre and post conditions. Moreover, a unified implementation of service discovery, selection, composition and validation is achieved by answer set programming. Finally, the framework performance is demonstrated by a travel booking example on QWSDataset.", "paper_title": "An Integrated Framework for Semantic Service Composition using Answer Set Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000353297300004"}
