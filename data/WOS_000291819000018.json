To facilitate concept sharing and ontology reusing, we developed Falcons Concept Search, a novel keyword-based ontology search engine. In this paper, we illustrate how the proposed mode of interaction helps users quickly find ontologies that satisfy their needs and present several supportive techniques including a new method of constructing virtual documents of concepts for keyword search, a popularity-based scheme to rank concepts and ontologies, and a way to generate query-relevant structured snippets. We also report the results of a usability evaluation as well as user feedback.", "paper_title": "Falcons Concept Search: A Practical Search Engine for Web Ontologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000291819000018"}
