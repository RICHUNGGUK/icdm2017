We first define the concepts of linguistic positive ideal point, linguistic negative ideal point, and satisfactory degree of alternative. Based on these concepts, we then establish some linear programming models, through which the decision maker interacts with the analyst. Furthermore, we establish a practical interactive procedure for solving the MADM problems considered in this paper. The interactive process can be realized by giving and revising the satisfactory degrees of alternatives till an optimum satisfactory solution is achieved. Finally, a practical example is given to illustrate the developed procedure.", "paper_title": "An interactive procedure for linguistic multiple attribute decision making with incomplete weight information", "paper_id": "WOS:000259039800002"}
