We call an undirected graph G(V,E) a neighborhood structure for f. The problem of finding a local minimum for f can be phrased as: for a fixed neighborhood structure G(V,E) find a vertex xaV such that f(x) is not bigger than any value that f takes on some neighbor of x. The complexity of the algorithm is measured by the number of questions of the form \"what is the value of f on x?\" We show that the deterministic, randomized and quantum query complexities of the problem are polynomially related. This generalizes earlier results of Aldous (Ann. Probab. 11(2):403-413, [1983]) and Aaronson (SIAM J. Comput. 35(4):804-824, [2006]) and solves the main open problem in Aaronson (SIAM J.
