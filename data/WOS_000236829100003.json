We show that the subexponential tail of the stationary queue length of an M/G/1 retrial queue is determined by that of the corresponding M/G/1 queue, and hence the stationary queue length in an M/G/1 retrial queue is subexponential if the stationary queue length in the corresponding M/G/1 queue is subexponential. Our results for subexponential tails also apply to regularly varying tails, and we provide the regularly varying tail asymptotics for the stationary queue length of the M/G/1 retrial queue.", "paper_title": "Tail asymptotics for the queue length in an M/G/1 retrial queue", "paper_id": "WOS:000236829100003"}
