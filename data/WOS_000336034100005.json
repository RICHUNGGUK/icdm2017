The algorithm uses the spatial frequency analysis provided by the discrete cosine transform within JPEG to combine the uniform regions of the long-exposure image with the detailed regions of the short-exposure image, thereby reducing noise while providing sharp details. Two additional features of the algorithm enable its implementation at low cost, and in real time, on a digital camera: the camera's response between exposures is equalized with a look-up table implementing a parametric sigmoidal function; and image fusion is performed by selective overwriting during the JPEG file save operation. The algorithm requires no more than a single JPEG macro-block of the short-exposure image to be maintained in RAM at any one time, and needs only a single pass over both long- and short-exposure images. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated with examples of image stabilization and high dynamic range image acquisition.", "paper_title": "A method for fusing a pair of images in the JPEG domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000336034100005"}
