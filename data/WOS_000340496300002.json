We want to study the outage probability behavior of the proposed mixed AF and DF relay systems under independent Nakagami-m fading channels. In particular, we will derive the lower and upper bounds of outage probability of the mixed AF and DF relay systems based on maximal ratio combining diversity reception. The results give optimal configuration of AF and DF relays under a specific channel condition, thus helping us to design an optimized mixed AF and DF relay system in a generic fading environment. The trade-off between complexity and performance is discussed in this paper. In addition, we will use computer simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed mixed AF and DF relay configurations. Finally, the power allocation issues for such a mixed AF and DF relay system will also be discussed.
