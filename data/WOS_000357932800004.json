In this setting, we address the fundamental of computing the probability that a set of arguments is an extension according to a given semantics. We on the most popular semantics (i.e., admissible, stable, complete, grounded, preferred, ideal-set, ideal, and semistable) and show the following dichotomy result: computing the probability that a set of is an extension is either FP or FP#P-complete depending on the semantics adopted. Our polynomial-results are particularly interesting, as they hold for some semantics for which no polynomial-time was known so far.", "paper_title": "On the Complexity of Probabilistic Abstract Argumentation Frameworks", "paper_id": "WOS:000357932800004"}
