Their reputation decreased in the last 10 years due to the comparative success of interior-point Newtonian algorithms, which are asymptotically faster. In this research, a combination of both approaches is evaluated. The idea is to produce a competitive method, being more robust and efficient than its 'pure' counterparts for critical problems. Moreover, an additional hybrid algorithm is defined, in which the interior-point method is replaced by the Newtonian resolution of a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) system identified by the augmented Lagrangian algorithm.
