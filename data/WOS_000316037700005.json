These c.e. sets belong to the weak truth table degree of the halting problem, but not every weak truth table complete c.e. set has maximum initial segment Kolmogorov complexity. Moreover, every c.e. set with maximum initial segment prefix-free complexity is the disjoint union of two c.e. sets with the same property; and is also the disjoint union of two c.e. sets of lesser initial segment complexity.
