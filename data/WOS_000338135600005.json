These phenomena lead to increasing device delays during the operational lifetime, which result in growing delays of the instruction pipeline stages. However, the aging rates of different stages are different. Hence, a previously delay-balanced pipeline becomes increasingly imbalanced resulting in a non-optimized design in terms of lifetime [i.e., mean time to failure (MTTF)], frequency, area, and power consumption. In this paper, we propose an aging-aware, MTTF-balanced pipeline design, in which the pipeline stage delays are balanced at the desired lifetime rather than at design time. This can lead to significant MTTF (lifetime) improvements as well as additional performance, area, and power benefits. Our experimental results show that for two different microprocessors, MTTF can be extended by at least 2.3 times while achieving an additional 10% energy improvement with no penalty on delay and area. If the demand for performance is higher than that for a longer MTTF, it is also possible to improve the clock frequency by 2%.", "paper_title": "Aging-Aware Design of Microprocessor Instruction Pipelines", "paper_id": "WOS:000338135600005"}
