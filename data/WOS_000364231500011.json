In-band self-backhauling enables efficient usage of frequency resources. When coupled with a flexible frame format, it also enables efficient time-division duplexing of uplink, downlink, and backhaul transmissions. Self-backhauling is particularly efficient when coupled with FD relaying. Antenna design, as well as cancellation in radio frequency and digital domains at an FD relay enables reuse of the same resources for backhaul and access hops. The use of radio resources in the self-backhauling and access hops can be coordinated to maximize end-to-end performance. We evaluate FD in-band self-backhauling in indoor 5G scenarios, targeting mobile broadband and ultrareliable communication use cases. Self-backhauling shows considerable promise for reaching 5G targets in these scenarios.", "paper_title": "FULL-DUPLEX SELF-BACKHAULING FOR SMALL-CELL 5G NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000364231500011"}
