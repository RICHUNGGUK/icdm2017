This is certainly true for terms, tree-like data structures that can represent prefix formulae, syntax trees, intermediate code, and more. We first describe the motivation to introduce Annotated Terms (ATERMS): unifying several term formats, optimizing storage requirements by introducing maximal subterm sharing, and providing a language-neutral exchange format. Next, we present a brief overview of the ATERM technology itself and of its wide range of applications. A discussion of competing technologies and the future of ATERMS concludes the paper.
