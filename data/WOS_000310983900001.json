In this paper, we propose a two-phase based cooperative transmission protocol with the interference cancellation (IC) and best-relay selection to improve the secondary performance in underlay models under stringent power constraints while ensuring the primary quality-of-service (QoS). In the proposed protocol, IC is employed at both the secondary relays and the secondary destination, where the IC-based best-relay selection and cooperative relaying schemes are well developed to reduce the interference from primary systems. The closed-form expression of secondary outage probability is derived for the proposed protocol over Rayleigh fading channels. Simulation results show that, with a guaranteed primary outage probability, the proposed protocol can achieve not only lower secondary outage probability but also higher secondary diversity order than the traditional underlay case.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Relaying with Interference Cancellation for Secondary Spectrum Access", "paper_id": "WOS:000310983900001"}
