Several years ago, the Nitsche method was introduced to impose weakly essential boundary conditions in the scalar Laplace operator. Then, it has been worked out more generally and transferred to continuity conditions. We propose here an extension to vector div-curl problems. This allows us to solve the Maxwell equations, particularly in domains with reentrant corners, where the solution can be singular. We formulate the method for both the electric and magnetic fields and report some numerical experiments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
