The considered system is in the strict-feedback form with unknown control direction. A full-order observer is constructed with the gains computed via linear matrix inequality at first. Then, with the bounds of uncertain functions known, we design the dynamic output-feedback controller such that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. Furthermore, when the bound functions of uncertainties are not available, the adaptive fuzzy-logic system is employed to approximate the uncertain function, and the corresponding output-feedback controller is designed. It is shown that the resulting closed-loop system is stable in the sense of semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness. Finally, simulations are done to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Fuzzy Output-Feedback Controller Design for Nonlinear Time-Delay Systems With Unknown Control Direction", "paper_id": "WOS:000264630500005"}
