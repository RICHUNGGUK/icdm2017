The filter can also realize notch and all-pass responses with interconnection of relevant output currents. The presented filter employs four second-generation current controlled conveyors (CCCIIs) as active elements and only two capacitors as passive elements. The proposed active-C filter can be tuned electronically, and has low element sensitivities.", "paper_title": "Universal current-mode active-C filter employing minimum number of passive elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000234308500012"}
