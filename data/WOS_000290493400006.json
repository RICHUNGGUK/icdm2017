The need to support integrated services and ensure quality of service (QoS) satisfaction for various applications is one of the fundamental challenges for successful WMN deployment. In order to provide differentiated services, medium access control (MAC) should have priority management at the link layer. In code division multiple access (CDMA)-based WMNs, the interference phenomenon and simultaneous transmissions must be considered. We propose two priority schemes for MAC in a distributed CDMA-based WMN, taking into account interference, multimedia services, QoS requirements, and simultaneous transmissions. The first priority scheme is within a node. Each node has an independent queue for each traffic class. According to QoS requirements, the queue that should be served first is determined. The second priority scheme is among neighbor nodes. It is proposed for multiple simultaneous transmissions in the CDMA network. This scheme gives a larger chance of correct transmission to high priority traffic than low priority traffic. In addition, we propose to use adaptive spreading gain and a frame structure to achieve high resource utilization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed schemes can achieve effective QoS guarantee.
