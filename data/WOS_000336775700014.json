Turbulence simulation is very sensitive to numerical dissipation, which may dissipate the small length scales. On the other hand, dealing with shock waves, capturing and reproducing of the discontinuity may lead to non-physical oscillations for non-dissipative schemes. In the present work, a new high-order modified weighted compact scheme (MWCS) is proposed for accurate approximation of the derivatives in the governing Euler equations. The basic idea includes two parts: first, WENO scheme is added to WCS so that the scheme has appropriate dissipation and to eliminate oscillations; second, instead of using a black box subroutine for derivative, we only calculate the weights for pressure and density outside the subroutine at each time step. In such a way, the computation cost is dramatically reduced. Formulation is given and numerical test cases are performed for the one- and two-dimensional cases and results are compared with the well-established WENO scheme. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
