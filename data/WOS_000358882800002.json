However, secure share and search for the outsourced data is a formidable task, which may easily incur the leakage of sensitive personal information. Efficient data sharing and searching with security is of critical importance. This paper, for the first time, proposes a searchable attribute-based proxy reencryption system. When compared with the existing systems only supporting either searchable attribute-based functionality or attribute-based proxy reencryption, our new primitive supports both abilities and provides flexible keyword update service. In particular, the system enables a data owner to efficiently share his data to a specified group of users matching a sharing policy and meanwhile, the data will maintain its searchable property but also the corresponding search keyword(s) can be updated after the data sharing. The new mechanism is applicable to many real-world applications, such as electronic health record systems. It is also proved chosen ciphertext secure in the random oracle model.", "paper_title": "Searchable Attribute-Based Mechanism With Efficient Data Sharing for Secure Cloud Storage", "paper_id": "WOS:000358882800002"}
