The step when system emits a spike or an anti-spike is associated with symbol 1 and 0, respectively. Here we consider these computing devices as language generators. They allow non-determinism between the rules a(c) -> a and a(c) -> (a) over bar, c is an element of N, thus help to generate languages which cannot be generated using simple SN P systems.", "paper_title": "ON STRING LANGUAGES GENERATED BY SPIKING NEURAL P SYSTEMS WITH ANTI-SPIKES", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612200014"}
