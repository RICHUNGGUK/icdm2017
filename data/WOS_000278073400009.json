The event-based programming paradigm is a strong candidate for the development of mobile applications due to its inherent support for the loose coupling between components required by mobile applications. However, existing middleware that supports the event-based programming paradigm is not well suited to supporting location-aware mobile applications in which highly mobile components come together dynamically to collaborate at some location. This paper presents a number of techniques including location-independent announcement and subscription coupled with location-dependent filtering and event delivery that can be used by event-based middleware to support such collaboration. We describe how these techniques have been implemented in STEAM, an event-based middleware with a fully decentralized architecture, which is particularly well suited to deployment in ad hoc network environments. The cost of such location-based event dissemination and the benefits of distributed event filtering are evaluated.", "paper_title": "On Event-Based Middleware for Location-Aware Mobile Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000278073400009"}
