Many approaches such rule base, machine learning and statistical methods have been applied, targeting different types of relation ranging from hyponymy, hypernymy, meronymy, holonymy to domain-specific relation. In this paper, we present a computational method for extraction of explicit and implicit semantic relation from text, by applying statistic and linear algebraic approaches besides syntactic and semantic processing of text.", "paper_title": "SREC: Discourse-level semantic relation extraction from text", "paper_id": "WOS:000325809300006"}
