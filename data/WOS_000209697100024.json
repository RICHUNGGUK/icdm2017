Our approach maintains a running count of successive, simple, short-term false lock decisions, rather than conducting a single, long-term decision. Using a Markov chain model, we show that our scheme can provide accurate and rapid synchronization for capacity-approaching CPMs that operate at very low signal-to-noise ratios.", "paper_title": "A Timing False Lock Detector for M-ary Partial-Response CPM", "paper_id": "WOS:000209697100024"}
