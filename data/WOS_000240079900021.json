This variant consists in removing some of the n polynomials of the public key, and permits to thwart an attack described at Crypto'99 [25] against two-round schemes. Usually, the \"minus variant\" leads to a real strengthening of the considered schemes. We show here that this is actually not true for 2R(-) schemes. We indeed propose an efficient algorithm for decomposing 2R(-) schemes. For instance, we can remove up to [(n)/(2)] equations and still be able to recover a decomposition in O(n(12)). We provide experimental results illustrating the efficiency of our approach. In practice, we have been able to decompose 2R(-) schemes in less than a handful of hours for most of the challenges proposed by the designers [18]. We believe that this result makes the principle of two-round schemes, including 2R(-) schemes, useless.", "paper_title": "Cryptanallysis of 2R(-) schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079900021"}
