However, in real life, there are many applications in which the registration is implemented remotely through an insecure channel and the authentication is achieved through a secure channel. In this paper, a novel authentication protocol that is suitable for the insecure registration is proposed. There are three main contributions, i.e. (i) the registration can be implemented through an insecure channel, (ii) the authentication is achieved by image exchange between the registration center and the user and (iii) a proxy user authentication mechanism is proposed, which allows a proxy user to act on behalf of the primary user. The correctness and security of the proposed authentication protocol are proved by both theoretical analysis and experimental simulations.", "paper_title": "A Proxy User Authentication Protocol Using Source-Based Image Morphing", "paper_id": "WOS:000359141100005"}
