R. Jooyandeh, D. Kiani, M. Mirzakhah, MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem., preceding article] coincides with the previously studied Laplacian-energy like invariant, LEL [J. Liu, B. Liu, MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 59 (2008) 355-372]. In the case of non-bipartite graphs, IE is equal to the quantity LEL(+), calculated in an analogous manner as LEL, but from the eigenvalues of the signless Laplacian matrix. Some other relations for IE are pointed out.", "paper_title": "On Incidence Energy of Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000270019100013"}
