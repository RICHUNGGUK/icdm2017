There is a serious lag in the development time of the systems due to time-consuming interface design between the chip, package, and board. In order to enable chip-package-board codesign to speed up the design process, we propose an approach to address this issue by efficiently planning wires for board and chip design awareness, which includes the package pin-out designation and the corresponding wire planning in package and board. We model the problem as an interval intersection problem. Because of the special need in pin-out rules, an algorithm to resolve the problem is developed. We then use some optimization techniques to further improve objectives such as global wire congestion and length deviation. Our results show that a very efficient estimation can be made considering those important objectives, and package congestion can be successfully mitigated.", "paper_title": "Board- and Chip-Aware Package Wire Planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000322380600001"}
