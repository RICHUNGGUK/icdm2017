Over the equivalent non-fading channel, capacity has recently been shown to be achievable using transmission schemes that were designed for the \"dirty paper\" channel. We focus on a similar \"fading paper\" model. The evaluation of the fading paper capacity is difficult to obtain. We confine ourselves to the linear-assignment capacity, which we define, and use convex analysis methods to prove that its maximizing distribution is Gaussian. We compare our fading-paper transmission to an application of dirty paper coding that ignores the partial state information and assumes the channel is fixed at the average fade. We show that a gain is easily achieved by appropriately exploiting the information. We also consider a cooperative upper bound on the sum-rate capacity as suggested by Sato. We present a numeric example that indicates that our scheme is capable of realizing much of this upper bound.", "paper_title": "On the fading-paper achievable region of the fading MIMO broadcast channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000252256900008"}
