In this article, we analyze the influence of QRS detection errors on HRV results based on signal entropy measures. Specifically, we study the influence that QRS detection errors have on the discrimination power of ApEn and SampEn using the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) database. The experiments assessed the discrimination capability of ApEn and SampEn under different levels of QRS detection errors. The results demonstrate that these measures are sensitive to the presence of ectopic peaks: from a successful classification rate of 100%, down to a 75% when spikes are present. The discriminating capability of the metrics degraded as the number of misdetections increased. For an error rate of 2% the segmentation failed in a 12.5% of the experiments, whereas for a 5% rate, it failed in a 25%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
