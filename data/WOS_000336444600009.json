It has parameters [63, 45, 7]. We also give better bounds on minimum distances of some [2 (n) - 1, 2 (n) - 3n - 1] cyclic codes with three small zeroes. Finally, we reprove weight distribution results of Kasami for triple-error-correcting BCH-like codes using direct methods.", "paper_title": "A non-cyclic triple-error-correcting BCH-like code and some minimum distance results", "paper_id": "WOS:000336444600009"}
