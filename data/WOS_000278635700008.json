In this paper, we consider the problem of embedding a long fault-free cycle in a crossed cube with more faulty nodes. We prove that for n >= 5 and f <= 2n - 7, a fault-free cycle of length at least 2(n) - f - (n - 5) can be embedded in an n-dimensional crossed cube with f faulty nodes. Our work extends some previously known results in the sense of the maximum number of faulty nodes tolerable in a crossed cube. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
