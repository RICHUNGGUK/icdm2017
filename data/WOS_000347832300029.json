To assist this task, we designed a dihedral angle database for searching protein segment homologs. The search engine relies on encoding of the protein coordinates into text characters representing amino acid sequence, phi and psi dihedral angles. The search engine is advantageous owing to its high speed and interactive nature and is expected to assist scientists in discovering conformation homologs and evolutionary kinship. The search engine is fast, with query times lasting a few seconds, and freely available at http://tarshish.md.biu.ac.il/similar to samsona", "paper_title": "PHI-DAC: protein homology database through dihedral angle conservation", "paper_id": "WOS:000347832300029"}
