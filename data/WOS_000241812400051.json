However, a number of key issues have yet to be faced, in a variety of fields, such as pedagogy, digital signal processing, and Human-Computer Interaction. Starting from pedagogical principles rooted in the constructionism theory, the ELU IST project presents a t-leaming framework where learners are involved in compelling educational games through iDTV and engaged in their actual construction as well.", "paper_title": "Designing a constructionistic framework for T-learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000241812400051"}
