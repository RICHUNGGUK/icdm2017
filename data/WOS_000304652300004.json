This model is based on the simple notion of set timeliness-a natural generalization of the seminal concept of timeliness in the partially synchrony model of Dwork et al. (J. ACM 35(2):288-323, 1988). Despite its simplicity, the concept of set timeliness is powerful enough to define a family of partially synchronous systems that closely match individual instances of the t-resilient k-set agreement problem among n processes, henceforth denoted (t, k, n)-agreement. In particular, we use it to give a partially synchronous system that is synchronous enough for solving (t, k, n)-agreement, but not enough for solving two incrementally stronger problems, namely, (t + 1, k, n)-agreement, which has a slightly stronger resiliency requirement, and (t, k - 1, n)-agreement, which has a slightly stronger agreement requirement. This is the first partially synchronous system that separates these sub-consensus problems. The above results show that set timeliness can be used to study and compare the partial synchrony requirements of problems that are strictly weaker than consensus.", "paper_title": "Partial synchrony based on set timeliness", "paper_id": "WOS:000304652300004"}
