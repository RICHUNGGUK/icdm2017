Even though a couple of medical applications such as those described above had shown generally proven results, the literature regarding applying fuzzy logic in healthcare delivery remains modest and the application of fuzzy logic to healthcare services had been rare. Applying fuzzy logic in healthcare services is still a mostly untapped region, especially collecting the voice of customer. Coupled fuzzy logic with QFD in healthcare services enables medical practitioners to understand customer requirements and include them for continuous improvement during the health service delivery. A fuzzy QFD approach for analyzing healthcare service requirement is proposed and realized through a case study. It is realized that the proposed approach can adjust service quality toward customer requirements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
