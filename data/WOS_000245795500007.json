The highest-weight binary form (HBF) of scalars and randomization are applied to resist power analysis. By using a special method to recode the scalars, the proposed algorithms do not suffer from simple power analysis (SPA). With the randomization of the secret scalar or base point, three of the four algorithms are secure against differential power analysis (DPA), refined power analysis (RPA) and zero-value point attacks (ZPA). The countermeasures are also immune to the doubling attack. Fast Shamir's method is used in order to improve the efficiency of parallel scalar multiplication. Compared with previous countermeasures, the new countermeasures achieve higher security and do not impact overall performance. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
