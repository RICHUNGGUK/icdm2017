The algorithm iteratively increases the dimensionality of reference spaces in a controlled manner by evaluating a single descriptor per iteration. For seven sets of closely related biogenic amine G protein Coupled receptor (GPCR) antagonists with different selectivity, target-selective reference spaces were designed and used to identify selective compounds by screening a biologically annotated database. Combinations of descriptors that constitute target-selective reference spaces identified with CA-DynaMAD can also be used to build other computational models for the prediction of compound selectivity.", "paper_title": "Design and exploration of target-selective chemical space representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000258004300010"}
