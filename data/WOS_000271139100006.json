The first step to retrieve data from a sensor network in this way is the dissemination of the query. Energy-efficient query dissemination plays an important role for the lifetime of sensor networks. The topic of this paper is the optimization of probabilistic query dissemination: Based on easy-to-acquire topology information, the optimizer can predict the number of nodes reached and the energy consumption. Furthermore, we propose a topology-discovery protocol that collects the structural information required by the optimizer. Our analysis shows that the energy savings exceed the energy spent to obtain the required information after a small number of queries disseminated in realistic settings. Our evaluation explores the tradeoff between reachability and energy consumption using both simulations and a deployment of Sun SPOT sensor nodes.", "paper_title": "Query Dissemination in Sensor Networks - Predicting Reachability and Energy Consumption", "paper_id": "WOS:000271139100006"}
