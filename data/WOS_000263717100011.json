A face validation study was conducted by collecting x, y, z coordinate data and using them in both virtual and LSM models. An upper body virtual model was needed to calculate the 3D torques about human joints for use in simulated lifting styles and to estimate the effect of external mechanical devices on human body. Firstly, the model had to be validated to be sure it provided accurate estimates of 3D moments in comparison to a previously validated LSM. Three synchronised Fastrak units with nine sensors were used to record data from one male subject who completed dynamic box lifting under 27 different load conditions (box weights (3), lifting techniques (3) and rotations (3)). The external moments about three axes of L4/L5 were compared for both models. A pressure switch on the box was used to denote the start and end of the lift. An excellent agreement [image omitted] was found between the two models for dynamic lifting tasks, especially for larger moments in flexion and extension. This virtual model was considered valid for use in a complete simulation of the upper body skeletal system. This biomechanical virtual model of the musculoskeletal system can be used by researchers and practitioners to give a better tool to study the causes of LBP and the effect of intervention strategies, by permitting the researcher to see and control a virtual subject's motions.", "paper_title": "Comparison of 3D dynamic virtual model to link segment model for estimation of net L4/L5 reaction moments during lifting", "paper_id": "WOS:000263717100011"}
