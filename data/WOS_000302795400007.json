In this paper, empirical in nature, we characterize the evolution of one such ecosystem of local ISPs by studying the interactions between ISPs happening at the Slovak Internet eXchange (SIX). By crawling the web archive waybackmachine. org we collect 158 snapshots (spanning 14 years) of the SIX website, with the relevant data that allows us to study the dynamics of the Slovak ISPs in terms of: the local ISP peering, the traffic distribution, the port capacity/utilization and the local AS-level traffic matrix. Examining our data revealed a number of invariant and dynamic properties of the studied ecosystem that we report in detail.", "paper_title": "A History of an Internet eXchange Point", "paper_id": "WOS:000302795400007"}
