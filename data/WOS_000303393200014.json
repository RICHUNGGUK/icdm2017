In WAVE, the WAVE Short Message Protocol (WSMP) provides broadcast services but does not define unicast/multicast services that require mobility management to track the locations of the vehicles. To resolve this issue, this article proposes a location estimation-based mobility management mechanism by utilizing positioning systems (e.g., GPS) for a WAVE system deployed in highway environment with a large volume of high-speed vehicles. Performance study indicates that under the same paging cost, our approach can reduce 40-90 percent of the network traffic as compared with the traditional cellular mobility management approach.", "paper_title": "MOBILITY MANAGEMENT OF UNICAST SERVICES FOR WIRELESS ACCESS IN VEHICULAR ENVIRONMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000303393200014"}
