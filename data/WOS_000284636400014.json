There is no inventory space capacity and the production activity incurs a fixed charge linear cost function. Similarly, the inventory holding cost and the cost of lost demand are both associated with a linear no-fixed charge function. For the sake of simplicity, a unit of each item is assumed to consume one unit of production/procurement capacity. We analyse a different version of setup costs incurred by a production or procurement activity in a given period of the planning horizon. In this version, called the joint and item-dependent setup cost, an additional item-dependent setup cost is incurred separately for each produced or ordered item on top of the joint setup cost.", "paper_title": "Grouping in decomposition method for multi-item capacitated lot-sizing problem with immediate lost sales and joint and item-dependent setup cost", "paper_id": "WOS:000284636400014"}
