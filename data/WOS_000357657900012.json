Due to the limited size of equipped screens, scrolling operations are indispensable in order to display the content of interest on screen. While power consumption caused by hardware and software installed within smartphones is well studied, the energy cost made by human-screen interaction such as scrolling remains unknown. In this paper, we analyze the impact of scrolling operations to the power consumption of smartphones, finding that the state-of-art strategy of smartphones in responding a scrolling operation is to always use the highest frame rate which arouses huge computation burden and can contribute nearly 50 percent to the total power consumption of smartphones. In recognizing this significance, we further propose a novel system, energy-efficient engine (E-3), which automatically tracks the scrolling speed and adaptively adjusts the frame rate according to user preference. The goal of E-3 is to guarantee the user experience and minimize the energy consumption caused by scrolling at the same time. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the efficiency of E-3 design. On average, E-3 can save up to 60 percent of the energy consumed by CPU and 35 percent of the overall energy consumption.", "paper_title": "Sensing Human-Screen Interaction for Energy-Efficient Frame Rate Adaptation on Smartphones", "paper_id": "WOS:000357657900012"}
