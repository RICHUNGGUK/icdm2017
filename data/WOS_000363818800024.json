Half of the students were presented information in a sequential series of single frames in which each frame replaced the preceding frame while the other half were presented the information in simultaneous multiple frames in which each frame was added to the previous frames without replacement. It was hypothesized that if the isolated elements effect occurs, the single-frame condition should be superior. Alternatively, if the transient information effect dominates, the multiple-frame condition should be superior. Results confirmed the superiority of the single-frame presentation. Eye-tracking indicated that participants who learned with single frames paid more attention to the important representations than participants who learned with multiple frames. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
