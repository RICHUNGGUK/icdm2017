As a result of having no-wait constraints, each operation of a job should start as soon as the previous operation is processed. In addition, sequence-dependent set-up times are considered for each operation. This means that the set-up time of an operation on a machine is dependent on the previous operation on the same machine. The considered performance measure is makespan. This problem is proven to be strongly NP-hard. In order to deal with the problem, an encoding system called Matrix Coding (MC) is used to code job sequences. The developed particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is applied on the encoded sequences for further exploration of the solution space. In order to evaluate the performance of the developed framework, a large number of benchmark problems are selected. Computational results confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms competitive methods, by improving many of the best-known solutions of the test problems.", "paper_title": "Solving the no-wait flow-shop problem with sequence-dependent set-up times", "paper_id": "WOS:000328188900002"}
