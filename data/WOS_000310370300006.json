The core idea is to enlarge the distance between different classes under the conceptual framework of LSR. First, a technique called epsilon-dragging is introduced to force the regression targets of different classes moving along opposite directions such that the distances between classes can be enlarged. Then, the epsilon-draggings are integrated into the LSR model for multiclass classification. Our learning framework, referred to as discriminative LSR, has a compact model form, where there is no need to train two-class machines that are independent of each other. With its compact form, this model can be naturally extended for feature selection. This goal is achieved in terms of L-2,L-1 norm of matrix, generating a sparse learning model for feature selection. The model for multiclass classification and its extension for feature selection are finally solved elegantly and efficiently. Experimental evaluation over a range of benchmark datasets indicates the validity of our method.", "paper_title": "Discriminative Least Squares Regression for Multiclass Classification and Feature Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000310370300006"}
