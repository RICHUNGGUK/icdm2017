This choice strongly reduces the power consumption, since operational amplifiers are the most power hungry blocks in the DSM. The DSM has been implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process, where it occupies an area of . It achieves an SNDR of 64 dB over a 500 kHz signal bandwidth with an oversampling ratio of 16. The power consumption is from a 800 mV power supply. The DSM figure-of-merit is 59 fJ/conversion. The CT DSM is well suited for the receiver of an ultra-low-power radio.", "paper_title": "A low-power 2nd-order CT delta-sigma modulator with a single operational amplifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000342079400007"}
