Merging high-contrast image information from other image modalities enhances the guidance capability of ultrasound. However, few registration methods work well for it. In this paper we present a surface-to-image registration technique for mono- or multimodal medical data concerning ultrasound. This approach is able to automatically register the object surface to its counterpart in image volume. Three similarity measurements are investigated in the rigid registration experiments of the pubic arch in transrectal ultrasound images. It shown that the selection of the similarity function is related to the ultrasound characteristics of the object to be registered.", "paper_title": "Evaluation on similarity measures of a surface-to-image registration technique for ultrasound images", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700091"}
