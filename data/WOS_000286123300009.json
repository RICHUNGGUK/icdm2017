Its use as a tool of Science Gateways to facilitate massive calculations also with the aim of improving scientific collaboration is discussed. Accordingly, a preliminary study on how to profile the users of virtual organizations in order to pave the way to a systematic evaluation of the work carried out in the Grid and to foster its sustainability, is presented.
