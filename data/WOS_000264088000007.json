In this context, the study of inverters, i.e., circuits with inputs x(1),...,x(n) and outputs -x(1),....,-x(n), is fundamental since an inverter with r NOTs can be used to convert a general circuit to one with only r NOTs. Beals, Nishino, and Tanaka [R. Beals, T. Nishino, K. Tanaka, On the complexity of negation-limited Boolean networks, SIAM journal on Computing 27 (5) (1998) 1334-1347. A preliminary version appears in: Proceedings of STOC95: The 27th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 1995, pp. 585-595] gave a construction of an n-inverter with size O(n log n), depth O(log n), and [log(2)(n + 1)] NOTs. A zero-one sequence x(1),....,x(n) is k-tonic if the number of is such that x(i) not equal x(i+1) is at most k. The notion generalizes well-known bitonic sequences. We give a construction of circuits inverting k-tonic sequences with size O((log k) n) and depth O(log k log log n + log n) using 1092 n+ 10921092 log(2) n +O(1) NOTs. In particular, for the case where k = O(1). our k-tonic inverter achieves asymptotically optimal linear size and logarithmic depth. Our construction improves all the parameters of the k-tonic inverter by Sato, Amano, and Maruoka [T. Sato, K. Amano, A. Maruoka, On the negation-limited circuit complexity of sorting and inverting k-tonic sequences, in: Proceedings of COCOON06: The 12th Annual International Computing and Combinatorics Conference, in: Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 4112, 2006. pp. 104-115]. We also give a construction of k-tonic sorters achieving linear size and logarithmic depth with 10921092 n + 109210921092 n + O(1) NOT gates for the case where k = O(1). The following question by Turan remains open: Is the size of any depth-O(log n) inverter with O(log n) NOT gates superlinear? (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
