Traditional approaches are based on the assumption that a pair of nodes is either \"connected\" or \"disconnected.\" These approaches are called connectivity-based topology control. In real environments, however, there are many intermittently connected wireless links called lossy links. Taking a succeeded lossy link as an advantage, we are able to construct more energy-efficient topologies. Toward this end, we propose a novel opportunity-based topology control. We show that opportunity-based topology control is a problem of NP-hard. To address this problem in a practical way, we design a fully distributed algorithm called CONREAP based on reliability theory. We prove that CONREAP has a guaranteed performance. The worst running time is O(vertical bar E vertical bar), where E is the link set of the original topology, and the space requirement for individual nodes is O(d), where d is the node degree. To evaluate the performance of CONREAP, we design and implement a prototype system consisting of 50 Berkeley Mica2 motes. We also conducted comprehensive simulations. Experimental results show that compared with the connectivity-based topology control algorithms, CONREAP can improve the energy efficiency of a network up to six times.", "paper_title": "Opportunity-Based Topology Control in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000273987100010"}
