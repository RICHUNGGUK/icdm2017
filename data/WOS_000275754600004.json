These multiple views of the data are often not directly comparable to one another, and thus a principled method for their integration is warranted. In this paper we develop a new algorithm to leverage information from multiple views for unsupervised clustering by constructing a custom kernel. We generate a multipartite graph (with the number of parts given by the number of views) that induces a kernel we then use for spectral clustering. Our algorithm can be seen as a generalization of co-clustering and spectral clustering and a relative of Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis. We demonstrate the algorithm on four data sets: an illustrative artificial data set, synthetic fMRI data, voxels from an fMRI study, and a collection of web pages. Finally, we compare its performance to common alternatives.", "paper_title": "Multi-view kernel construction", "paper_id": "WOS:000275754600004"}
