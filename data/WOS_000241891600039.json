The classic definition labeled a \"what\" pathway to process object information and a \"where\" pathway to process spatial information. In this paper, we propose a novel attention guidance model based on \"what\" and \"where\" information. Context-centered \"where\" information is used to control top-down attention, and guide bottom-up attention which is driven by \"what\" information. The procedure of top-down attention can be divided into two stages: pre-attention and focus attention. In the stage of pre-attention, \"where\" information can be used to provide prior knowledge of presence or absence of objects which decides whether search operation is followed. By integrating the result of focus attention with \"what\" information, attention is directed to the region that is most likely to contain the object and series of salient regions are detected. Results of experiment on natural images demonstrate its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "What and \"where\" information based attention guidance model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600039"}
