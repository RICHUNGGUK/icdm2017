Based on the pre-hand noise estimation, adaptive filtering is used in speech modulation spectra according to the noise conditions. The periodic structures in the amplitude spectra are kept against noise distortion. Since the amplitude spectral structures contain the information of fundamental frequency, which is the inverse of pitch period, ARSF algorithm is added into robust pitch detection to increase the accuracy. Compared with the conventional methods, experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the robustness of pitch detection against noise conditions with several types and SNRs.", "paper_title": "Robust speech spectra restoration against unspecific noise conditions for pitch detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000254605300009"}
