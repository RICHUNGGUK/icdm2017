First, we show that the security theorem of the improved ERabin scheme is not correct, and then provide a correct theorem for it. Second, we show that the security theorem of the F-FDHS scheme lacks an assumption. Finally, we present a way to modify the improved ERabin scheme and the F-FDHS scheme.", "paper_title": "Comments on the security proofs of some signature schemes based on factorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000244547000030"}
