Some stability criteria are obtained to ensure the global asymptotic/exponential stability of the equilibrium point of discrete-time impulsive CGNN by discrete-time Halanay inequality. It is shown that the discrete-time impulsive CGNN can achieve the global exponential stability of the impulse-free CGNN even if the impulses have enlarging effects on the states of neurons.
