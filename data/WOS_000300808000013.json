In order to cope with this difficulty, the decomposition-based classified ant colony optimization (D-CACO) method is proposed and analyzed in this paper. The D-CACO method comprises decomposition procedure and classified ant colony optimization algorithm. In the decomposition procedure, a large and complicate scheduling problem is decomposed into several subproblems and these subproblems are scheduled in sequence. The classified ACO algorithm then groups all of the operations of the subproblems and schedules them according to machine type. To test the effect of the method, a set of simulations are conducted on a virtual lab simulation platform. The test results show that the proposed D-CACO algorithm works efficiently in scheduling SWFS. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
