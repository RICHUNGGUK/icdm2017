With the development of higher data density and the faster data streaming, a hard-disk drive (HDD) is required to move faster with greater positioning accuracy. At this situation, even small mechanical vibration induced by seeking motion may result in error in data reading. According to the operational characteristics of HDD suspension, the present work is focused on the topology design of HDD suspension for the dynamic shock response problem. As a result of this research, several new topological structures of HDD suspension are obtained, which are largely different from previous work, and dynamic response under shock force and stability of passive structure are also improved.", "paper_title": "Topology design to improve HDD suspension dynamic characteristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000242613000008"}
