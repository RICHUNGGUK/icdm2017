The ADDLL can process the input clock frequency ranging from 333 MHz to 800 MHz (DDR3-667/800/1066/1600) by using Phase Detector (PD), Delay Control Delay Line (DCDL), Digital Loop Filter Controller (DLFC) and Delay Generator (DG). To achieve 1.6 Gb/s/pin operation, a novel DCDL scheme is employed. The DCDL has a small delay with a shunt capacitor based digitally controlled delay element. A split-control thermometer-code generator generates the control voltages used to set a current in the current-starved inverters. The testchip fabricated with a 40-nm CMOS process gives the ADDLL data rate of 667 Mbps-1.6 Gbps. Experimental results that show the power consumption is 1.87 mW at 1.1 V with active area is 0.0137 mm(2).", "paper_title": "A low-power, area-efficient all-digital delay-locked loop for DDR3 SDRAM controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000346238500020"}
