We consider networks with n wireless nodes {v(1), v(2),......,v(n)} (randomly or arbitrarily) distributed in a square region B (a) with a side-length a. We randomly choose n (s) node as the source nodes of n (s) multicast sessions. For each source node v (i) , we randomly select k points and the closest k nodes to these points as destination nodes of this multicast session. We derive achievable lower bounds and some upper bounds on both throughput capacity and transport capacity for both unicast sessions and multicast sessions. We found that the asymptotic capacity depends on the size a of the deployment region, and it often has three regimes.", "paper_title": "Impact of deployment size on the asymptotic capacity for wireless ad hoc networks under Gaussian channel model", "paper_id": "WOS:000289730300001"}
