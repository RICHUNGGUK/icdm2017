Engineering data contains the experiences and know-how of experts. Data mining technique is useful to extract knowledge or information from the accumulated existing data. This paper presents a machine learning method based on genetic programming (GP), which can be one of the components for the realization of data mining. ne paper deals with linear models of GP for regression or approximation problems when the given learning samples are not sufficient.", "paper_title": "Data analysis and utilization method based on genetic programming in ship design", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100127"}
