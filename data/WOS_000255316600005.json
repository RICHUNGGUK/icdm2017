Typically, a buying agent's decision involves a large variety of constraints that may involve attributes of a very same item as well as attributes of different, multiple items. In this paper we present iBundler, an agent-aware service offered to buying agents to help them determine the optimal bundle of received offers based oil their business rules. In this way, buying agents are relieved with the burden of solving too hard a problem and concentrate oil strategic issues. iBundler is intended as a negotiation service for buying agents and its a winner determination service for reverse combinatorial auctions with side constraints. Furthermore, we assess the computational cost added by employing agent technology in the development of iBundler to characterise the type of negotiation scenarios that it can acceptably handle.
