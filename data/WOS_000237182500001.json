Here we study the possibility of generating graphs with high edge expansion as random lifts. Along the way, we introduce the method of e-nets into the study of random structures. This enables us to improve (slightly) the known bounds for the edge expansion of regular graphs.", "paper_title": "Random lifts of graphs: Edge expansion", "paper_id": "WOS:000237182500001"}
