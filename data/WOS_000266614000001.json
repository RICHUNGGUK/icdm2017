Consequently several languages have been created for the execution of business processes, making it possible to define new and more complex services or business processes which are implemented for example by means of Web service composition. Nevertheless, these kinds of languages are not suitable for use in the early stages of the development process of information systems. Special methodologies or techniques are therefore necessary to allow systems analysts to understand services from a business point of view, while facilitating the design and development of Web service composition. In this paper, we present a service-oriented approach to information system development that starts by identifying, through business modeling, the services required by the customers of a business, to make it possible to create a Web service composition model. This model will facilitate the transformation to specific languages for business process execution, thereby reducing the development efforts made in service-oriented applications. The method proposed is illustrated by means of a Web application for the management of medical images, which we have taken as a case study.", "paper_title": "TOWARDS A SERVICE-ORIENTED MDA-BASED APPROACH TO THE ALIGNMENT OF BUSINESS PROCESSES WITH IT SYSTEMS: FROM THE BUSINESS MODEL TO A WEB SERVICE COMPOSITION MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000266614000001"}
