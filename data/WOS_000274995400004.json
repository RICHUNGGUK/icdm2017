The results indicate that fill generated using rule-based and CMP-aware model-based methods can have a significant impact on parasitic capacitance, interconnect planarization, and individual path delay variation. Crosstalk-induced delay and noise are significantly reduced in the grounded-fill cases, and designs with floating fill also experience a reduction in average crosstalk-induced delay and noise, which is in contrast to the predictions of previous studies on small-scale interconnect structures. When crosstalk effects are included in the analysis, the observed delay behavior is significantly different from the delay modeled without considering crosstalk effects. Consequently, crosstalk-induced delay and noise must be simultaneously considered in addition to parasitic capacitance and interconnect planarization when developing future fill generation methods.", "paper_title": "Crosstalk-Induced Delay, Noise, and Interconnect Planarization Implications of Fill Metal in Nanoscale Process Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000274995400004"}
