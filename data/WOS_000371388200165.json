Paving the way for smart world, Internet of Things (IoT) connects everything in the smart world. Motivated by achieving a sustainable smart world, this paper discusses various technologies and issues regarding green IoT, which further reduces the energy consumption of IoT. Particularly, an overview regarding IoT and green IoT is performed first. Then, the hot green information and communications technologies (ICTs) (e.g., green radio frequency identification, green wireless sensor network, green cloud computing, green machine to machine, and green data center) enabling green IoT are studied, and general green ICT principles are summarized. Furthermore, the latest developments and future vision about sensor cloud, which is a novel paradigm in green IoT, are reviewed and introduced, respectively. Finally, future research directions and open problems about green IoT are presented. Our work targets to be an enlightening and latest guidance for research with respect to green IoT and smart world.", "paper_title": "Green Internet of Things for Smart World", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200165"}
