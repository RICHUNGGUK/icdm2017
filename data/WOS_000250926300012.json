We present an efficient algorithm to solve this problem for strings over arbitrarily ordered alphabets in O(n log n) time, where n is the ending position of the first square. We also note that the same technique yields an O(n center dot(|Sigma(n)|+log n))-time algorithm for general alphabets, where |Sigma(n)| is the number of different symbols in the first n positions of the input string. (This is faster than the previously fastest method for general alphabets when |Sigma(n)| = o(log(2) n).) Finally, we present a simple algorithm for a dynamic version of the problem over general alphabets in which we are initially given a squarefree string, followed by a series of updates, and the objective is to determine after each update if the resulting string is still squarefree.", "paper_title": "Online and dynamic recognition of squarefree strings", "paper_id": "WOS:000250926300012"}
