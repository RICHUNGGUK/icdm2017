As a result, power supply noise (PSN) plays a greater role in sub-100 nm technologies and creates signal integrity issues. It is vital to consider supply voltage noise effects: 1) during design validation to apply sufficient guardbands to critical paths, and 2) during path delay test to ensure the performance and reliability of the chip. In this paper, a novel layout-aware pattern generation procedure is proposed to maximize PSN effects on critical paths considering the impact of local voltage drop. The proposed pattern generation and validation flow is implemented on the ITC'99 b19 benchmark. Experimental results for both wire-bond and flip-chip packaging styles are presented. Results demonstrate that our proposed method is fast, significantly increases switching around the functionally testable critical paths, and induces large voltage drop on cells placed on the critical paths which results in increased path delay. The proposed method eliminates the very time consuming pattern validation phase that is practised in industry.", "paper_title": "Layout-Aware Critical Path Delay Test Under Maximum Power Supply Noise Effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000297336500012"}
