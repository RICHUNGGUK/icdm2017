Initial materials-based coarse segmentations, generated using the Dual-Energy Index (DEL), are refined by partitioning at automatically detected regions. Partitioning is guided by a novel random forest based quality metric, trained to recognise high-quality, single-object segments. A second novel segmentation quality measure is presented for quantifying the quality of full segmentations based on the random forest metric of the constituent parts and the error in the number of objects segmented. In a comparative evaluation between the proposed approach and three state-of-the-art volumetric segmentation techniques designed for single-energy CT data (two region-growing [1,2] and one graph-based [3]) our method is shown to outperform both region-growing methods in terms of segmentation quality and speed. Although the graph-based approach generates more accurate partitions, it is characterised by high processing times and is significantly outperformed by the proposed method in this regard. The observations made in this study indicate that the proposed segmentation technique is well-suited to the baggage security-screening domain, where the demand for computational efficiency is paramount to maximise throughput (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
