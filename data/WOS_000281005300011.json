We understand as global methods the ones concerned with the aim of constructing a model for the whole problem space using the totality of the available observations. Local methods focus into sub regions of the space, possibly using an appropriately selected subset of the sample. In the proposed method, the sample is first divided in local cells by using a Vector Quantization unsupervised algorithm, the LBG (Linde-Buzo-Gray). In a second stage, the generated assemblage of much easier problems is locally solved with a scheme inspired by Bayes' rule. Four classification methods were implemented for comparison purposes with the proposed scheme: Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ); Feedforward Neural Networks: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors. These four methods and the proposed scheme were implemented in eleven datasets, two controlled experiments, plus nine public available datasets from the UCI repository. The proposed method has shown a quite competitive performance when compared to these classical and largely used classifiers. Our method is simple concerning understanding and implementation and is based on very intuitive concepts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
