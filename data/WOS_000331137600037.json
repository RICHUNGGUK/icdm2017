Also the existence and uniqueness of the solution for a class of fuzzy Caputo fractional differential equation with initial value is studied, and an analytical solution of FCFDE is obtained. The related theorems and properties are proved in detail and the method is illustrated by solving some examples.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy fractional differential equations under generalized fuzzy Caputo derivative", "paper_id": "WOS:000331137600037"}
