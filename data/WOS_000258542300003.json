It has been shown that a power control mechanism with distributed fixed-step control algorithm using a single bit can maintain the received carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR) within a desired range in long-term fading channels. However, as far as the short-term fading is concerned, whether such a power control algorithm remains convergent is not clear. In this work, a simple received CIR model is adopted to derive the condition that ensures system stability for short-term fading channels. The bounds of the received CIR are also obtained. Furthermore, the effects of the power control step size and the time required for convergence are also analyzed.
