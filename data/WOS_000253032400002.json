Based on the Globus Toolkit and other open technology and standards, the DataMiningGrid system provides tools and services facilitating the grid-enabling of data mining applications without any intervention on the application side. Critical features of the system include flexibility, extensibility, scalability, efficiency, conceptual simplicity and ease of use. The system has been developed and evaluated on the basis of a diverse set of use cases from different sectors in science and technology.
