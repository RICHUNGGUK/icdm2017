The new technique is designated to continuously and automatically detect quality drifts on various manufacturing processes and then induce the common root cause. The proposed technique consists of a fast, incremental algorithm that can process extremely high dimensional data and handle more than one root-cause at the same time. Application of such a methodology consists of an on-line machine learning system that investigates and monitors the behavior of manufacturing product routes.", "paper_title": "Automatic discovery of the root causes for quality drift in high dimensionality manufacturing processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000308820200034"}
