The external electric field has an effect on the dynamic behavior of the neural system, affecting the generation and conduction of neural information. Based on the Ermentrout model, a modified Ermentrout model under the external electric field is established. From the membrane potential curve and spike frequency curve both changing with time and the onset spike frequency curve changing with the input signal, the changes of the adaptability and the requirements met by the external electric field for the adaptive model are given. The research results suggest a functional role for the external electric field in the excitability of biological nervous system and pathogenesis of several neurological diseases.
