In this paper, we determine the polyphenyl chains with minimum and maximum Wiener indices among all the polyphenyl chains with h hexagons, and the tree-like polyphenyl system with maximum Wiener index. Moreover, explicit formulas for the Wiener indices of extremal polyphenyl chains are obtained.", "paper_title": "Tree-like polyphenyl systems with extremal Wiener indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000265624300007"}
