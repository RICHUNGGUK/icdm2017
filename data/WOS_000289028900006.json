We propose in this sense a brief literature review of the PDPTW, present our approach to give a satisfying solution to the m-PDPTW minimizing the compromise between total travel cost and total tardiness time.", "paper_title": "Multi-Objective Optimization for the m-PDPTW: Aggregation Method With Use of Genetic Algorithm and Lower Bounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000289028900006"}
