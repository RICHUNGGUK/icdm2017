The proposed circuit allows the tuning gain to be lowered by deploying the coarse/fine frequency tuning whilst maintaining wide frequency coverage. The small signal model of the proposed delay stage and the circuit operation are discussed in this paper. The time-variant analysis presented permits accurate prediction of the frequency tuning characteristic and the results have been verified by simulation. The phase noise analysis is also discussed in detail to provide better insight to the noise that is contributed by each transistor. The calculated results agreed well with that of the simulations.", "paper_title": "Design and frequency/phase-noise analysis of a 10-GHz CMOS ring oscillator with coarse and fine frequency tuning", "paper_id": "WOS:000238267700003"}
