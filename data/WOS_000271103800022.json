The numerical aspects of and difficulties in obtaining the nonlinear Fourier (i.e., PIST) spectrum of a physical data set are also addressed. In particular, an improved bracketing of the \"spectral eigenvalues\" (i.e.. the +/- 1 crossings of the Floquet discriminant) and a new root-finding algorithm for computing the latter are proposed Finally, if is shown how the PIST can be used to gain insightful information about the phenomenon soliton-induced acoustic resonances, by computing the nonlinear Fourier spectrum of a data set from a simulation of internal solitary wave generation and propagation in the Yellow Sea (C) 2009 IMACS Published by Elsevier B.V.
