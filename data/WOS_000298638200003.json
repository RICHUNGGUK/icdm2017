In particular, we show how the frequency response G(sigma) = d - C(A - sigma I)(-1)b in the single input case can be computed more efficiently than with other state-of-the-art methods. We also provide a backward stability analysis of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Note on Shifted Hessenberg Systems and Frequency Response Computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000298638200003"}
