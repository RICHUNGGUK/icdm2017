The Self Organizing feature Maps (SOM) are extended to the Multi SOM approach, and the Neural Gas is extended to a Multi Neural Gas. Some common cluster analysis coefficients (Silhouette Coefficient, Cap Statistics, Calinski-Harabasz Coefficient) have been adapted for the new paradigms. Both new neural clustering methods are described and evaluated briefly using exemplary data sets.", "paper_title": "Using multi-SOMs and multi-neural-gas as neural classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623700020"}
