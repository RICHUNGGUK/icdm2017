However, their use in plane-wave calculations for extended systems remains limited by poor convergence behavior regarding Brillouin-zone sampling and by a high overall computational cost. We present a computational approach that achieves quadratic convergence of exchange integrals with respect to Brillouin zone discretization, while using a compact representation of the exchange operator during non-self-consistent iterations. The computational cost is mitigated by an efficient parallel implementation. The method is applied to computations of Hartree-Fock and hybrid OFT (PBE0) band structures and structural parameters for bulk silicon and diamond. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
