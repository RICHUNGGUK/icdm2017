Current theories focus on strain-induced fluid flow for the primary means of mechanotransduction. To examine the influence of age-related cortical rarefaction on lacunocanalicular fluid characteristics, coupled fluid flow and mechanical computational models of bone specimens representing young, mid-age and aged samples were derived artificially from the same original micro-computed tomography image. data. Simulated mechanical loading was applied to the bone models to induce pressure-driven interstitial fluid flow. Results demonstrated a decrease in pore pressure and fluid velocity magnitudes with age as a result of increased cortical porosity. Mean canal separation, as opposed to canal size, was implicated as a primary factor affecting age-related fluid dynamics. Future investigations through refinement of the model may implicate fluid stasis or inadequate nutrient transport experienced by osteocytes as a key factor in the initiation of cortical remodelling events.", "paper_title": "Influence of cortical canal architecture on lacunocanalicular pore pressure and fluid flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000257669100005"}
