These allow the exact evaluation (up to computer truncation and rounding errors) of integrals of polynomials with two general types of logarithmic weights, and also with the corresponding nonlogarithmic weights. The recurrence coefficients for the related nonclassical orthogonal polynomials with logarithmic weight functions can also be obtained. Tests of accuracy on various platforms are presented. The routines are usable from Fortran, C, and C++ programs conforming to any of at least six international programming-language standards.", "paper_title": "Algorithm 867: QUADLOG - A package of routines for generating Gauss-related quadrature for two classes of logarithmic weight functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000248947800005"}
