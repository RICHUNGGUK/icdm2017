We present the Method of Pair Comparisons with the study of its properties from the point of view of representational measurement theory and scaling theory. From the first point of view it is impossible to differentiate two types of representations and therefore, the distinction has to be done in terms of the type of task that the subjects perform. The conclusion establishes some differences and relationships between the task of making judgments of proportion and judgments of distance.", "paper_title": "The pairwise comparison model: The multiplicative and the additive approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000237084600009"}
