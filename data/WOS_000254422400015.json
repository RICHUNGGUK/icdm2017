The findings reveal the proxied error-correction term has a long memory component that theoretically should affect hedging effectiveness. When the FIEC model empirical conditions are satisfied, the FIEC-BEKK hedging strategy outperforms the OLS benchmark out of sample in terms of both variance reduction and hedger utility. A bootstrap exercise indicates that the variance reduction is statistically significant. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
