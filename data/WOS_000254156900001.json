Of late, it has been used in different approaches to tune subdivision algorithms to handle the so-called hybrid shapes. For this the shape charts are computed numerically. In this paper, symmetries of shape charts are analyzed that can be used to simplify the computations and to reduce the computation costs significantly. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
