To combat speed degradation due to scaling of supply voltage, various HBD filters are implemented as unfolded structures. The designs are synthesized in 65 nm CMOS technology with low-power and three threshold options, both as single-V-T and as dual-V-T. A sub-V-T energy model is applied to characterize the designs in the sub-V-T domain. Simulation results show that the unfolded by two and four architectures are the most energy efficient for throughput requirements between 250 k samples/s, and 2 M samples/s. By the selection of optimum architectures and standard cells, at the required throughput the simulated minimum energy dissipation for the required throughput per output sample is 164 0 and 205 0, with single supply voltage of 260 mV.
