The WOA writes data through distributed control flow logic rather than using a read-write paradigm or a centralised message hub which allows tasks to be partitioned at a fine-grained level without suffering from excessive communication overheads on distributed systems. In this paper we provide formal assignment results for software benchmarks partitioned using the WOA and previous execution paradigms for distributed heterogeneous architectures along with bounds and complexity information to demonstrate the robust performance improvements possible with the WOA.
