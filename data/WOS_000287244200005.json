This is suboptimal because packets can have different effects on system performance. We define slack as a key measure for characterizing a packet's relative importance. Aergia introduces new router prioritization policies that exploit interfering packets' available slack to improve overall system performance and fairness.", "paper_title": "AERGIA: A NETWORK-ON-CHIP EXPLOITING PACKET LATENCY SLACK", "paper_id": "WOS:000287244200005"}
