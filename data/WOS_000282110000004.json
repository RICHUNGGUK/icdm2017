Because of the different semantics of SQL compared with other procedural languages, the conventional coverage criteria for testing are not directly applicable. This paper presents a criterion specifically tailored for SQL queries (SQLFpc). It is based on Masking Modified Condition Decision Coverage (MCDC) or Full Predicate Coverage and takes into account a wide range of the syntax and semantics of SQL, including selection, joining, grouping, aggregations, subqueries, case expressions and null values. The criterion assesses the coverage of the test data in relation to the query that is executed and it is expressed as a set of rules that are automatically generated and efficiently evaluated against a test database. The use of the criterion is illustrated in a case study, which includes complex queries.
