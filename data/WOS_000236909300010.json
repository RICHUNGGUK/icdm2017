It is a fundamentally important practical and theoretical problem to compare the relative strengths of these models and to see how they relate to each other. Recently, Coron et al. [8] proved that one can securely instantiate a random oracle in the ideal cipher model. In this paper, we investigate if it is possible to instantiate an ideal block cipher in the random oracle model, which is a considerably more challenging question. We conjecture that the Luby-Rackoff construction [19] with a sufficient number of rounds should suffice to show this implication. This does not follow from the famous Luby-Rackoff result [19] showing that 4 rounds are enough to turn a pseudorandom function into a pseudorandom permutation, since the results of the intermediate rounds are known to everybody. As a paxtial step toward resolving this conjecture, we show that random oracles imply ideal ciphers in the honest-but-curious model, where all the participants are assumed to follow the protocol, but keep all their intermediate results. Namely, we show that the Luby-Rackoff construction with a superlogarithmic number of rounds can be used to instantiate the ideal block cipher in any honest-but-curious cryptosystem, and result in a similar honest-but-curious cryptosystem in the random oracle model. We also show that securely instantiating the ideal cipher using the Luby-Rackoff construction with upto a logarithmic number of rounds is equivalent in the honest-but-curious and malicious models.", "paper_title": "On the relation between the ideal cipher and the random oracle models", "paper_id": "WOS:000236909300010"}
