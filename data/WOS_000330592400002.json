Then, how do we make identical copies of the card while keeping its color secret? A partial solution has been devised: using a number of additional black and red cards, Niemi and Renvall proposed an excellent protocol which can copy a face-down card while allowing only a small probability of revealing its color. In contrast, this paper shows the nonexistence of a perfect solution, namely, the impossibility of copying a face-down card with perfect secrecy. To prove such an impossibility result, we construct a rigorous mathematical model of card-based cryptographic protocols; giving this general computational model is the main result of this paper.", "paper_title": "A formalization of card-based cryptographic protocols via abstract machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000330592400002"}
