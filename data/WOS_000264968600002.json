However, if plausibility tests that supervise multiple components are used, then a component can be ready before all tests supervising the component have been evaluated. Based on test results, this paper contributes with conditions on when a component is ready. The conditions on readiness are given for both centralized and distributed systems and are here applied to the distributed diagnostic system in an automotive vehicle. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
