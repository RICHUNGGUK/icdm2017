In this field the goal for diagnostic reasoning is assessing causes of observed conditions in order to make informed choices about treatment. In order to design a diagnostic reasoning method we merge ideas from a hypothetic-deductive method and the Domino model. In this setting, we introduce the so called Hypothetic-Deductive-Domino (HD-D) algorithm. In addition, a multi-agent approach is presented, which takes advantage of the HD-D algorithm for illuminating different standpoints in a diagnostic reasoning and assessment process, and for reaching a well-founded conclusion. This multi-agent approach is based on the so called Observer and Validating agents. The Observer agents are supported by a deductive inference process and the Validating agents are supported by an abductive inference process. The knowledge bases of these agents are captured by a class of possibilistic logic programs. Hence, these agents are able to deal with qualitative information. The approach is illustrated by a real scenario from diagnosing dementia diseases.", "paper_title": "Agent-Based Reasoning in Medical Planning and Diagnosis Combining Multiple Strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000332124600006"}
