Recently, the standby-sparing scheme that uses a primary processor and a spare processor has been exploited to provide fault tolerance while keeping the energy consumption under control through DVS and DPM techniques. In this paper, we consider the standby-sparing technique for fixed-priority periodic real-time tasks. We propose a dual queue mechanism through which the executions of backup tasks are maximally delayed, as well as online algorithms to manage energy consumption. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides energy savings over time-redundancy based techniques while offering reliability improvements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
