However, good case bases are difficult to come by. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for automatically mining a high-quality case base from a raw case set that can preserve and sometimes even improve the competence of case-based reasoning. In this paper, we analyze two major problems in previous case-mining algorithms. The first problem is caused by noisy cases such that the nearest neighbor cases of a problem may not provide correct solutions. The second problem is caused by uneven case distribution, such that similar problems may have dissimilar solutions. To solve these problems, we develop a theoretical framework for the error bound in case-based reasoning, and propose a novel case-base mining algorithm guided by the theoretical results that returns a high-quality case base from raw data efficiently. We support our theory and algorithm with extensive empirical evaluation using different benchmark data sets. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
