There are a wide range of important applications including face recognition, action recognition, clustering, visual tracking, and motion grouping and segmentation. The increased popularity of matrix manifolds is due partly to the need to characterize image features in non-Euclidean spaces. Matrix manifolds provide rigorous formulations allowing patterns to be naturally expressed and classified in a particular parameter space. This paper gives an overview of common matrix manifolds employed in computer vision and presents a summary of related applications. Researchers in computer vision should find this survey beneficial due to the overview of matrix manifolds, the discussion as well as the collective references. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
