It provides features that are invariant under monotonically increasing intensity transformations. Therefore, it is exploited as a key ingredient of various computer vision problems, in particular for illumination-robust optic flow models. However, despite being extensively applied, its underlying mathematical foundations are not well understood so far. The goal of our paper is to provide these missing insights, and in this way to generalise the concept of the census transform. To this end, we transfer the inherently discrete transform to the continuous setting and embed it into a variational framework for optic flow estimation. This uncovers two important properties: the strong reliance on local extrema and the induced anisotropy of the data term by acting along isolines of the image. These new findings open the door to generalisations of the census transform that are not obvious in the discrete formulation. To illustrate this, we introduce and analyse second order census models that are based on thresholding the second order directional derivatives. Last but not least, we constitute links of census-based approaches to established data terms such as gradient constancy, Hessian constancy, and Laplacian constancy. We confirm our findings by means of experiments.", "paper_title": "Mathematical Foundations and Generalisations of the Census Transform for Robust Optic Flow Computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000353205200005"}
