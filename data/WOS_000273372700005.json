The design of low complexity and high performance detection algorithms capable of accurately demultiplexing the transmitted signals is challenging. In this technical survey, we introduce the state-of-the-art MIMO detection techniques. These techniques are divided into three categories, viz. linear detection (LD), decision-feedback detection (DFD), and tree-search detection (TSD). Also, we introduce the lattice basis reduction techniques that obtain a more orthogonal channel matrix over which the detection is done. Detailed discussions on the advantages and drawbacks of each detection algorithm are also introduced. Furthermore, several recent author contributions related to MIMO detection are revisited throughout this survey.", "paper_title": "Detection Techniques for MIMO Multiplexing: A Comparative Review", "paper_id": "WOS:000273372700005"}
