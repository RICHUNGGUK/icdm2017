The desired motion is given as a series of acceleration functions in respective time intervals. The constraints of the optimisation are the available acceleration limit of axes, such as the table axes, the upper bounds to velocity and displacement of each axis and the avoidance of singular point areas of the robot, as defined by its manufacturer. The optimisation criterion is minimum total work for the motion. A genetic algorithm was used to solve the problem. The fitness function of the genetic algorithm calls a kinematics and dynamics simulation model of the robotic installation constructed in Matlab (TM), in order to compute the work consumed and to check possible violation of constraints. Examples of straight line and circular movement are given to prove the concept. Results are encouraging, yet demand on Computing power is high. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
