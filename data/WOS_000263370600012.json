The velocity and vorticity are respectively divided into two parts: one is the velocity and vorticity without the influence of the immersed boundary, and the other is the corrected velocity and the corrected vorticity derived from the influence of the immersed boundary. The corrected velocity is obtained from the multi-direct forcing to ensure the well satisfaction of the no-slip boundary condition at the immersed boundary. The corrected vorticity is derived from the vorticity transport equation. The third-order Runge-Kutta for time stepping, the fourth-order finite difference scheme for spatial derivatives and the fourth-order discretized Poisson for solving velocity are applied in present flow solver. Three cases including decaying vortices, flow past a stationary circular cylinder and an in-line oscillating cylinder in a fluid at rest are conducted to validate the method proposed in this paper. And the results of the simulations show good agreements with previous numerical and experimental results. This indicates the validity and the accuracy of present immersed boundary method based on vorticity-velocity formulations. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
