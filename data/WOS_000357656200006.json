In this paper, efficient distributed coverage hole repair algorithms are proposed taking density of the nodes in the post deployment scenario. The proposed algorithms consider limited mobility of the nodes and can select the mobile nodes based on their degree of coverage overlapping. In order to repair coverage holes of the network, nodes with higher degree of density are moved to maintain uniform network density without increasing the coverage degree of the neighbors of a mobile node. Simulation results show that the energy consumption due to mobility of nodes is least as compared to other similar protocols of the Wireless Sensor Networks. Besides, it is observed that substantial amount of coverage overlapping can be minimized and percentage of coverage of the holes can be maximized.", "paper_title": "HORA: A Distributed Coverage Hole Repair Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000357656200006"}
