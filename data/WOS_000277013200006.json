The algorithm, (CORBFN)-R-2, promotes a cooperative-competitive environment where each individual represents a radial basis function (RBF) and the entire population is responsible for the final solution. The proposal considers, in order to measure the credit assignment of an individual, three factors: contribution to the output of the complete RBFN, local error and overlapping. In addition, to decide the operators' application probability over an RBF, the algorithm uses a Fuzzy Rule Based System. It must be highlighted that the evolutionary algorithm considers a distance measure which deals, without loss of information, with differences between nominal features which are very usual in classification problems. The precision and complexity of the network obtained by the algorithm are compared with those obtained by different soft computing methods through statistical tests. This study shows that (CORBFN)-R-2 obtains RBFNs with an appropriate balance between accuracy and simplicity, outperforming the other methods considered.", "paper_title": "(CORBFN)-R-2: an evolutionary cooperative-competitive RBFN design algorithm for classification problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000277013200006"}
