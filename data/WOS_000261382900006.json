The fundamental difficulty of this approach arises from the lack of full enumeration of all relaxations inside a RG cell as L >= 3. This study develops a simple sampling algorithm to sample the relaxations and applies this algorithm to the RG calculations for L = 3,4, and 8. As the fixed point analysis shows, increasing L does not lead the resultant height probabilities toward the exact solution.", "paper_title": "CELL-TO-SITE RENORMALIZATION GROUP STUDY OF A SANDPILE", "paper_id": "WOS:000261382900006"}
