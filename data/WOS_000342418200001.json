This paper reviews the image resizing methods proposed in recent years, gives a detailed comparison on their performance, and reveals the main challenges raised in several important issues such as preserving an important region, minimizing distortions, and improving efficiency. Furthermore, this paper discusses the research trends and points out the possible hotspots in this field. We believe this survey can give some guidance for researchers from relevant research areas, offering them an overall and novel view.", "paper_title": "A survey for image resizing", "paper_id": "WOS:000342418200001"}
