Despite this progress, service reliability, testing, and verification techniques aren't mature enough to support dependable and trustworthy computing. To address SOA dependability and trustworthiness issues, the authors propose an open framework that implements group testing to enhance test efficiency. The framework identifies and eliminates test cases with overlapping coverage. It also ranks newly added test cases and reranks existing test cases using updated coverage relationships and recent test results. A case study demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in reducing testing effort while maintaining effectiveness.", "paper_title": "On testing and evaluating service-oriented software", "paper_id": "WOS:000258294500011"}
