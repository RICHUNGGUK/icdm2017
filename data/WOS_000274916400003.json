The study was conducted using manufacturing companies located in the Northern region of Malaysia. Hierarchical multiple regressions were applied to test the hypotheses developed for the study. It was found that operational and strategic information exchange is significantly related to supply chain performance. The impact of strategic information exchange is greater as opposed to operational information exchange. Information quality does not moderate the relationship between both operational and strategic information exchange and supply chain performance. Nonetheless, this study provides evidence that both strategic information exchange and operational information exchange are required to enhance supply chain performance. As such supply chain partners should effectively exchange strategic information as the impact is greater on performance.", "paper_title": "INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND SUPPLY CHAIN PERFORMANCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000274916400003"}
