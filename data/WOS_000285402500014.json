The renin inhibitors under study are characterized by known bound to the receptor crystal structures possessing a great variety of pharmacophore groups and a wide range of IC50 values. Linear regression models were derived to relate the docking scoring function and pIC(50) values of renin inhibitors under study. The developed derived models are seeking to be helpful for the rational design of new, more potent renin inhibitors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
