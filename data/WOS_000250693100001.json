It uses a new approach for counting models of instances with low density. This allows us to assume the adding of more 2-clauses than in previous algorithms. The algorithm achieves a running time of O(1.6423\") in the worst case which improves the current best bound of O(1.6737\") by Dahllof et al. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
