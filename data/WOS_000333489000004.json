Goal-driven security requirements engineering approaches, such as Secure Tropos, have been proposed as a suitable paradigm for elicitation of security requirements and their analysis on both a social and a technical dimension. Nevertheless, goal-driven security requirements engineering methodologies are not appropriately tailored to the specific demands of SPL, while on the other hand specific proposals of SPL engineering have traditionally ignored security requirements. This paper presents work that fills this gap by proposing \"SecureTropos-SPL\" framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
