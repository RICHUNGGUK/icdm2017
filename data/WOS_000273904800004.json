While checking whether a set of patterns occurs in a string is solvable in polynomial time, this implication problem is well known to be intractable. Here we consider a version of the problem when patterns in the set are required to be disjoint. We show that for such a version of the problem the situation is reversed: checking whether a set of patterns occurs in a string is NP-complete, but the implication problem is solvable in polynomial time.
