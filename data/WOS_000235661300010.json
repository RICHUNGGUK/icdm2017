Despite its importance, a non-trivial approximation algorithm for the problem eluded researchers for a long time. Remarkably, a succession of papers with ever improved performance ratios have been written in the last couple of years. We review some of the approaches that have been used to design approximation algorithms for this problem, and we also present some of the known results about the hardness of approximating the optimum solution for the k-median problem.", "paper_title": "Approximation algorithms for the k-median problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000235661300010"}
