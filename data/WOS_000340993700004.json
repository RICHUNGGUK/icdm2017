The proposed scaling method adjusts the avatar and determines a standardized apparel size according to the user's measurements, prepares the collision mesh and the physics simulation, with a total of 1 s preprocessing time. The real-time motion filters prevent unnatural artifacts due to the noise from depth sensor or self-occluded body parts. We apply bone splitting to realistically render the body parts near the joints. All components are integrated efficiently to keep the frame rate higher than previous works while not sacrificing realism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
