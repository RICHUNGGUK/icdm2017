Digital models, incorporating the properties of real rock, are first generated, then physically replicated as layers of resin or aluminium (200 mm x 200 mm) encapsulated between transparent plates as a flowcell. This configuration enables the geometry to be permeated with fluid and fluid motion visualised using particle image velocimetry. Fluid velocity fields are then computed using well-tested cross-correlation techniques.", "paper_title": "A machine vision system for quantifying velocity fields in complex rock models", "paper_id": "WOS:000235369200002"}
