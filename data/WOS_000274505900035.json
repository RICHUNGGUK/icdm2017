By applying the method to the binary sequences with three-valued autocorrelation, we construct new quaternary sequences with three-valued autocorrelation, which are balanced or almost balanced. In particular, we construct new balanced quaternary sequences whose autocorrelations are three-valued and have out-of-phase magnitude 2, when their periods are N = p(m) - 1 and N equivalent to 2 (mod 4) for any odd prime p and any odd integer m. Their out-of-phase autocorrelation magnitude is the known optimal value for N not equal 2,4, 8, and 16.", "paper_title": "New Quaternary Sequences with Even Period and Three-Valued Autocorrelation", "paper_id": "WOS:000274505900035"}
