We propose three such improvements, two directly relating to the limit of advisor network size by either setting a maximum size for a buyer's advisor network or setting a minimum trustworthiness threshold for agents to be accepted into that advisor network, and a third which uses an advisor referral system in combination with one of the first two network-limiting techniques. We provide experimental results in defence of our approach for two distinct trust modeling systems, and show how these optimizations can improve, sometimes significantly, the accuracy of different trust models (in the context of electronic marketplaces). We believe that the proposed techniques will be very useful for trust researchers seeking to improve the accuracy of their own trust models by setting the size and composition of advisor networks.
