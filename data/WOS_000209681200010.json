The accuracy of passive tracking is severely degraded by wireless propagation impairments such as multipath, clutter, and non line-of-sight conditions, especially in indoor environments. These impairments can be alleviated by exploiting the multiple sensing and smart processing of radar signals. In this letter, we aim to illustrate the dependence of sensor topologies, waveform processing methods, and tracking algorithm parameters on SR performance. A case study involving both monostatic and multistatic ultra-wideband SRs for indoor environments is presented by jointly considering the wireless medium, ranging technique, and tracking algorithm.", "paper_title": "Sensor Radar Networks for Indoor Tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681200010"}
