The OWL API is closely aligned with the OWL 2 structural specification. It supports parsing and rendering in the syntaxes defined in the W3C specification (Functional Syntax, RDF/XML, OWL/XML and the Manchester OWL Syntax); manipulation of ontological structures; and the use of reasoning engines. The reference implementation of the OWL API, written in Java, includes validators for the various OWL 2 profiles - OWL 2 QL, OWL 2 EL and OWL 2 RL. The OWL API has widespread usage in a variety of tools and applications.", "paper_title": "The OWL API: A Java API for OWL ontologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000209436400003"}
