As the discipline grows and it use becomes widely accepted, there is a need to align it with traditional forensic sciences and move towards strengthening an accreditation regime for the discipline. This paper examines the origins of science and scientific method to form the core premises for establishing criteria to assess digital forensics as a science and hence justifying the basis for standards and accreditation.
