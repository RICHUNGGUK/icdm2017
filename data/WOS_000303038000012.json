The alignment of individual P-weiVs calculated separately for the ligand and the protein gives the initial orientation of a given ligand conformation relative to an active site; these initial orientations are then ranked by simple energy functions, including solvation, Because we are using three-dimensional orthogonal vectors to be aligned, only four orientations of ligand positions are possible for each ligand conformation, which reduces the search space dramatically. We found that the performance of P-weiV compared favorably to the use of principle moment of inertia (PMI) as implemented in LigandFit when we tested the abilities of the two approaches to correctly predict 205 protein-ligand complex data sets from the PDBBind database. P-weiV correctly predicted the alignment of ligands (within rmsd of 2.5 angstrom) with 57.6% reliability (118/205) for the top 10 ranked conformations and with 74.1% reliability (152/205) for the top 50 ranked conformations of Catalyst-generated conformers, as compared to 22.9% (47/205) and 31.2% (64/205), respectively, in the case of PMI with the same conformer set.", "paper_title": "Ligand Aligning Method for Molecular Docking: Alignment of Property-Weighted Vectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000303038000012"}
