The usage data is extracted on two occasions from the portal's database: at survey completion (T1) and twenty-two months later (T2). Framework for this study is C-TAM-TPB (Combined Technology Acceptance Model and Theory of Planned Behavior). 919 usable responses from teachers are obtained. Based on the observed use data at T1, four types of portal users are distinguished: 'new' (N = 37), 'light' (N = 641), 'medium' (N = 201), and 'heavy' (N = 40). Path analyses show that all predictor variables in C-TAM-TPB influence teachers' portal acceptance, but their significance level varies depending on the user type. The strongest predictors of behavioral intention to use the portal are attitude ('new') and perceived usefulness ('light', 'medium' and 'heavy'), with variance explained ranging from .39 ('medium') to .71 ('heavy'). The observed use data show that the portal is primarily used to search for and download material, rather than for sharing material or information. The use data at 12 show that teachers become more efficient in their search behavior and that the majority of the teachers use the portal more frequently. Guidelines are proposed to policymakers and school boards aiming to introduce a similar technology to teachers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
