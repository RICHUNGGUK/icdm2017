He argues that a good impact measure works better when citations are concentrated rather than spread out over articles. The author also presents theoretical evidence that the g-index and the R-index can be close to the square root of the total number of citations, whereas this is not the case for the A-index. Here the author confirms an assertion of De Visscher.", "paper_title": "Remarks on the paper by A. De Visscher, \"what does the g-index really measure?\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000308888400017"}
