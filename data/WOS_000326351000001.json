Specifically, arterial tissue was investigated during experimental research and parameter estimation studies, due to medical, scientific and socio-economic importance of soft tissue research. Using analytical formulations for specimens under combined inflation/extension/torsion on thick-walled cylindrical tubes, in vitro experiments were carried out with fresh sheep arterial segments, and parameter estimation procedures were carried out on experimental data. Model restrictions were pointed out using outcomes from parameter estimation. Needs for further studies that can be developed are discussed.", "paper_title": "Experimental Parameter Estimation Method for Nonlinear Viscoelastic Composite Material Models: An Application on Arterial Tissue", "paper_id": "WOS:000326351000001"}
