We present here a R package devoted to a recently developed model, EcoTroph. This model enables the analysis of aquatic ecological networks and the related impacts of fisheries. It was available through a plug-in in the well-known Ecopath with Ecosim software or through implementations in Excel sheets. The R package we developed simplifies the access to the EcoTroph model and offers a new interfacing between two widely used software, Ecopath and R.", "paper_title": "An Introduction to the EcoTroph R Package: Analyzing Aquatic Ecosystem Trophic Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000321944400011"}
