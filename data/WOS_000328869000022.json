Specific inverse links examined include the normal, Student-t, slash and the variance gamma links. The threshold latent approach to represent the binary system as a linear state space model is considered. Using a Bayesian paradigm, an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is introduced for parameter estimation. The proposed methods are illustrated with real data sets. Empirical results showed that the slash inverse link fits better over the usual inverse probit link. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
