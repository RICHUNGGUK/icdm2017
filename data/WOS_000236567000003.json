The main idea behind UNFIR is to expand the modeling capacity of the FIR methodology allowing it to work with classical fuzzy rules. On the one hand, UNFIR is able to automatically construct fuzzy rules starting from a set of pattern rules obtained by FIR. On the other hand, UNFIR affords the prediction of systems behavior by using a mixed pattern/fuzzy inference system that takes advantage or the uncertainty inherent to the data. The pattern rule base that the FIR methodology generates can be very large, obstructing the prediction process and reducing its efficiency. The new methodology preserves as much as possible the knowledge of the pattern rules in a compact fuzzy rule base. In this process some precision is lost but the robustness is considerably increased. The performance of UNFIR methodology as a systems' prediction tool is also studied in this work. Three different applications are used For this purpose, i.e., a linear system, a non-linear system and an industrial process. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
