The angles of the contour are characterized through local entropy produced by a rotationally symmetric smoothing. The proposed scheme uses a punctual multi-scale approach in which only the candidates are analyzed in higher scales. To preserve the angle-entropy relationship in higher scales, we propose a smoothing kernel which presents special features that ensure its steepness in every scale. It is built from the sum of two Gaussians with different openings resembling center-surround receptive fields. The outputs of the proposed method are confronted to a ground-truth found in the literature, and to popular boundary based corner detectors that used the same set of images. Results reveal that the proposed detector performs extremely well.", "paper_title": "Smoothing: A natural way to detect contour features", "paper_id": "WOS:000337156500032"}
