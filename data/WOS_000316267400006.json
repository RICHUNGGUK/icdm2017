A brief introduction to the DBA area and major term definitions are given. The related research and standardization efforts are presented. Justification that EPONs can be used on the aggregation network is provided, based on their evolution and related research proposals. Focus is given to the Long Reach-Passive Optical Networks (LR-PONs) and their limitations which show the need for a non-polling, midterm DBA scheme for next-generation EPONs. The challenges arising, because of this new approach, are discussed along with possible solutions. Finally, this work proposes the EMDBA algorithm which is able to overcome the discussed issues. The correct operation of this algorithm is confirmed by a set of simulations using OMNet++ framework, and the outcome results show that EMDBA performance is satisfactory in terms of delay and service differentiation.", "paper_title": "A midterm DBA algorithm for quality of service on aggregation layer EPON networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000316267400006"}
