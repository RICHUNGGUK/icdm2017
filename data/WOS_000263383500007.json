It can partition the training samples space by means of constructing the spheres with the minimum volume covering all training samples of each pattern class in high-dimensional feature space. However, the decision rule of the traditional sphere-structured support vector machines cannot assign ambiguous sample points such as some encircled by more than two spheres to valid class labels. Therefore, the traditional sphere-structured support vector machines is insufficient for obtaining the better classification performance. In this article, we propose a novel decision rule applied to the traditional sphere-structured support vector machines. This new decision rule significantly improves the performance of labeling ambiguous points. Experimental results of seven real datasets show the traditional sphere-structured support vector machines based on this new decision rule can not only acquire the better classification accuracies than the traditional sphere-structured support vector machines but also achieve the comparable performance to the classical support vector machines.", "paper_title": "Applying a novel decision rule to the sphere-structured support vector machines algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000263383500007"}
