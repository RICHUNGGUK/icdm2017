This article describes an agent-based methodology, for addressing both real-time and decentralised manufacturing decision-making challenges. At the manufacturing levels of production and processes, the agents employ a mechanism to generate local alternatives as well as a message exchange procedure to build decision trees, which are traversed and evaluated via user-defined objective functions. The generic structure used in the approach allows in a wide range the application of production system configurations. The real-time information, required for monitoring the system status and for generating valid alternatives, is obtained through integration with the existing information systems. An application to the textile industry is presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "An agent-based methodology for manufacturing decision making: a textile case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000304463700005"}
