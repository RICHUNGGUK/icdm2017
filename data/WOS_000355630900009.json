Two players and , playing first, alternately mark or subdivide an edge of which is not yet marked nor subdivided. The game ends when all the edges of are marked or subdivided and results in a new graph . The purpose of is to minimize the domination number of while tries to maximize it. If both and play according to their optimal strategies, is well defined. We call this number the game domination subdivision number of and denote it by . In this paper we initiate the study of the game domination subdivision number of a graph and present sharp bounds on the game domination subdivision number of a tree.", "paper_title": "Game domination subdivision number of a graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000355630900009"}
