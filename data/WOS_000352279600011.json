We propose a multiobjective filter design to estimate state variables from noisy measurements for nonlinear signal systems, and we focus our effort on achieving optimal concurrent performance for H-2 and H-infinity filtering. In general, it is difficult to solve the multiobjective (MO) H-2/H-infinity fuzzy filter problem directly, and we therefore propose an indirect approach tominimize the upper bounds and transform the MOH2/H-infinity filtering problem in to a linear matrix inequality (LMI)-constrained multiobjective problem (MOP). In addition, we propose an LMI-based multiobjective evolution algorithm to efficiently find Pareto optimal solutions for the MOP of multiobjective fuzzy filter design for nonlinear stochastic signal processing. Furthermore, for comparison, we also suggest the MOH2/H-infinity filter design problem based on the weighted sum method. Our proposed indirect method can be widely employed to practically address the MO filter design problem in nonlinear signal processing. Finally, a trajectory estimation of reentry vehicle by radar is provided to illustrate the design procedure of the Pareto MO optimal filter.", "paper_title": "Pareto Optimal Filter Design for Nonlinear Stochastic Fuzzy Systems via Multiobjective H-2/H-infinity Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000352279600011"}
