We formalize the well-known says operator as a conditional normal modality and, by considering some specific ombinations of access control axioms, we define four access control logics, namely, Cond(ACL)(UC), Cond(ACL)(U4), Cond(ACL)(IC) and Cond(ACL)(I4). Such logics integrate access control logics with intuitionistic conditional logics and provide a natural formulation of Boolean principals. The well-known 'speaks for' operator introduced in the logic ABLP is defined on the top of the says modality. We provide a Kripke model semantics for the logics and we prove that their axiomatization is sound and complete with respect to the semantics. Also, we develop sound, complete, cut-free sequent calculi for them. For the logic Cond(ACL)(UC), which (as concerns atomic principals) is slightly stronger than the logic ICL recently introduced by Garg and Abadi, we also provide a terminating sequent calculus, thus proving that the logic is decidable and that validity in Cond(ACL)(UC) is in PSPACE.", "paper_title": "Logics in access control: a conditional approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000339921000002"}
