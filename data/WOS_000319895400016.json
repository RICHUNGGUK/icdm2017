In cooperative scenario, ADELIN improves its reliability of data packet transmission further by forwarding node redundancy, which wastes the limited energy and bandwidth of nodes. In this paper, the IPool-ADELIN protocol is proposed and shown to help reduce energy consumption. In IPool-ADELIN, by overhearing the data transmissions, the IPool node not only relays the data packets, which are not implicitly acknowledged, but also does local link maintenance when the BER (Bit Error Rate) of the monitored link is high. The results of mathematical analysis and simulations show that IPool-ADELIN has a higher data delivery ratio and lower energy consumption.
