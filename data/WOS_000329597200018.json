The proposed FDI system is based on the multiple model approach and utilizes dynamic neural networks (DNNs) to accomplish this goal. Towards this end, multiple DNNs are constructed to learn the nonlinear dynamics of the aircraft jet engine. Each DNN corresponds to a specific operating mode of the healthy engine or the faulty condition of the jet engine. Using residuals obtained by comparing each network output with the measured jet engine output and by invoking a properly selected threshold for each network, reliable criteria are established for detecting and isolating faults in the jet engine components. The fault diagnosis task consists of determining the time as well as the location of a fault occurrence subject to presence of unmodeled dynamics, disturbances, and measurement noise. Simulation results presented demonstrate and illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed dynamic neural network-based FDI strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
