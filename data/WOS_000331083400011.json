Our suggestion firstly builds a user's emotion profile in terms of the personality, mood and emotion by analysing the user's activities in social network. This subsequently builds an Emotional Relationship Matrix (ERM) which represents the depth of the emotional relationship based on the emotion profile. From our proposal, the more elaborate services based on the current user's emotional state can be provided to users. By considering emotional aspects in a social network, we can effectively answer which users or media contents will show the best results for inducing users' emotional states. From the experiments, we verified that message containing emotional words and users' relationship in a social network has significant correlations.", "paper_title": "Affective social network-happiness inducing social media platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000331083400011"}
