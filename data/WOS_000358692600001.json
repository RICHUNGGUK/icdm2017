In this paper, we present a new method of constructing a KDM secure asymmetric encryption scheme with the notation of hybrid encryption in the standard model; although the notation of hybrid encryption was thought as no help to get rid of dependencies between messages and the secret key. Our result can also be seen as a partial instantiation for a previously well-known KDM secure asymmetric encryption scheme based on random oracle. As we know, this has never been carried out before. And our result indicates a new cryptographic application for the primitive of lossy trapdoor function. Throughout the paper, our main idea is to archive KDM security by making use of both leakage-resilience and auxiliary-input security properties.
