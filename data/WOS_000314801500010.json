This is done in the context of augmented solvers that consider in their definition the presence of a discontinuous bed. In order to guarantee a constant energy state a proper integral approach of the bed source term is presented. This approach is systematically assessed via a series of steady test cases and Riemann problems including the resonance regime. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
