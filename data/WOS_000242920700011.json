However, real systems often involve several process dependencies, and failure to take these into consideration can lead to serious underestimation of the performance measures. We consider herein a single server queueing system with a Markov renewal process (MRP) for its arrival process and a general service time distribution, and derive the distribution function and correlation coefficient of the departure process. Since the departure process also often corresponds to an arrival process in downstream queues, the results obtained here can be used to derive a better approximation of the performance measures of a non-product form general queueing network.
