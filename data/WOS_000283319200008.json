This study specifically examines the interaction role of emotions in relationship quality (i.e. a higher-order construct composed of commitment, satisfaction and trust). We hypothesise that emotions will exert a direct effect on relationship quality, but will also moderate the relationship between its components. An empirical survey is used to test the hypotheses. Data are collected from a total of 408 users of online music services from the UK, Germany and Denmark. The results provide strong support for the proposals that, on the one hand, satisfaction and trust lead customers towards developing high commitment to online music services; and, on the other hand, emotions are important quasi-moderators to engage in online service relationships. The results of this study could help online music service providers (a) to create a successful business model; and (b) to determine the main drivers of online loyalty.", "paper_title": "Connection between customer emotions and relationship quality in online music services", "paper_id": "WOS:000283319200008"}
