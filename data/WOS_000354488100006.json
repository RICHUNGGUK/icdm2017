The proposed model is calibrated and validated using the data collected from 22 bus stops in Auckland and compared against the MLR model based on five different performance measures namely: mean error, mean absolute error, root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, and R-2 value. The proposed GEP-based approach shows prospects to estimate BDT more accurately and overcome some of the issues associated with the MLR method, including the restrictions to stick with a predefined model form and the need to satisfy assumptions made on multicollinearity, homoscedasticity, and the normality of random error, which are often difficult to satisfy in real world applications.", "paper_title": "Bus Dwell Time Modeling Using Gene Expression Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000354488100006"}
