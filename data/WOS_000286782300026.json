In this article, we compare five different species of RBFs: Gaussians, hyperbolic secant (sech's), inverse quadratics, multiquadrics and inverse multiquadrics. We show that the corresponding cardinal functions for a uniform, unbounded grid are all approximated by the same function: C(X) similar to (1/(rho))sin(pi X)/sinh (pi X/rho) for some constant rho(alpha) which depends on the inverse width parameter (\"shape parameter\") alpha of the RBF and also on the RBF species. The error in this approximation is exponentially small in 1/alpha for sech's and inverse quadratics and exponentially small in 1/alpha(2) for Gaussians; the error is proportional to alpha(4) for multiquadrics and inverse multiquadrics. The error in all cases is small even for alpha similar to O(1). These results generalize to higher dimensions. The Gaussian RBF cardinal functions in any number of dimensions d are, without approximation, the tensor product of one dimensional Gaussian cardinal functions: C-d(x(1), x(2)..., x(d)) = Pi(d)(j=1) C(x(j)). For other RBF species, we show that the two-dimensional cardinal functions are well approximated by the products of one-dimensional cardinal functions; again the error goes to zero as a alpha -> 0. The near-identity of the cardinal functions implies that all five species of RBF interpolants are (almost) the same, despite the great differences in the RBF phi's themselves. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
