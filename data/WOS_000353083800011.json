The validity of the finite difference based code was checked by comparing the bound state energies of various two dimensional systems with appropriate boundary conditions with analytic solutions or the results obtained by COMSOL software, which uses the finite element method, and a very good agreement was found. The energy dispersion relation calculated for artificial graphene structure shows massless Dirac particles, characteristic for real graphene. Therefore, artificial graphene-like structures have properties similar to those of real graphene, and are tailorable by appropriate structure engineering. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
