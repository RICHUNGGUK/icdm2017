Recent improved, modified, and adaptive WDAs are examined in this paper. Various applications of WDA are described briefly including the vehicle routing problem, economic load dispatch problem, economic and emission dispatch problem, optimal data aggregation tree in wireless networks, reactive power dispatch problem service selection, and reservoir operation.", "paper_title": "Water Drop Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000346911500003"}
