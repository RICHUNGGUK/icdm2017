We proposed and implemented a notation-based motion choreography system, LabanChoreographer version 0.1. Given the user specified movement notations, it will firstly perform Laban-based motion retrieval to find the most similar motions from a motion capture database notated with Labanotation, and snap together these retrieved motion clips into a continuous rough motion sequence that match the input Laban sequence as much as possible. Secondly, Laban-based motion editing algorithm is employed to semiautomatically revise and refine this candidate motion sequence such that the resulting motion data can best approximate the desired motion in the user's mind. The choreographer is able to move flexibly back and forth between Labanotations and its rapid-prototyped motion data. It well supports the iterative and interactive development of movement ideas at a conceptual level.", "paper_title": "Implementation of a notation-based motion choreography system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900054"}
