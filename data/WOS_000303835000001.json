The guest editors and contributors to this Special Issue are economists. Why is this so? In recent years, there has been a growing dialogue between economists and computer scientists, to our mutual benefit. The Special Issue is devoted to nine papers in which economists survey aspects of the field of agent-based computational economics models, and in some cases report on new findings in several areas of application. As such, we hope it has something to offer both computer scientists and economists.", "paper_title": "The special issue: agent-based computational economics-overview", "paper_id": "WOS:000303835000001"}
