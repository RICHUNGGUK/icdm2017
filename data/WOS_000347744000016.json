The system is used in the game service industry for solving the knowledge-sharing issues of game design, such as sharing design knowledge from various fields and enhancing a developer's design ability. GDMKSS possesses the functions of establishment, publication, notice, storage, dissemination, sharing and feedback. Analyzed by learning achievements, the experimental group using GDMKSS has a rather more significant effect on learning achievements than the control group with lectures in a traditional classroom. After evaluating the learning motivation and learning achievement by questionnaire survey, the experiment results indicate that (1) perceived easiness to use can positively predict perceived usefulness of learners and (2) perceived easiness to use and perceived usefulness can positively predict learning motivation of learning achievement. Perceived usefulness is the key factor in learners' motivation being guided through the learning process of the system.", "paper_title": "Design and Evaluation of Learning Motivation, and Achievement on Mobile Knowledge Sharing System for Game Design Course Acceptance", "paper_id": "WOS:000347744000016"}
