This naturally leads to a probabilistic algorithm for computing the gcd of several integers, with probability 6/pi(2) + o(1), via just one gcd of two numbers with about the same size as the initial data ( namely the above linear combinations). This algorithm can be repeated to achieve any desired confidence level.", "paper_title": "GCD of random linear combinations", "paper_id": "WOS:000240060500010"}
