Based on the finite time Lyapunov stability theory, some finite-time H(infinity) performance criterions are derived. Then the state-feedback control law is designed and the structure of such a controller is investigated. Furthermore, It is shown that the H(infinity) controller can also make the closed-loop system satisfy finite-time H(infinity) performance for nonlinear homogeneous systems. An example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented results.", "paper_title": "Finite-time disturbance attenuation of nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000272033000019"}
