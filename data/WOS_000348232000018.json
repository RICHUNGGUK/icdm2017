We propose the development of parallel architectures based on data-driven scheduling. Data-driven scheduling enforces only a partial ordering as dictated by the true data dependencies, which is the minimum synchronization possible. This is very beneficial for parallel processing because it enables it to exploit the maximum possible parallelism. We provide architectural support for data-driven execution for the Data-Driven Multithreading (DDM) model. In the past, DDM has been evaluated mostly in the form of virtual machines. The main contribution of this work is the development of a highly efficient hardware support for data-driven execution and its integration into a multicore system with eight cores on a Virtex-6 FPGA. The DDM semantics make barriers and cache coherence unnecessary, which reduces the synchronization latencies significantly and makes the cache simpler. The performance evaluation has shown that the support for data-driven execution is very efficient with negligible overheads. Our prototype can support very small problem sizes (matrix 16 x 16) and ultra-lightweight threads (block of 4x4) that achieve speedups close to linear. Such results cannot be achieved by software-based systems.", "paper_title": "Architectural Support for Data-Driven Execution", "paper_id": "WOS:000348232000018"}
