This paper discusses the multicast routing problem with multiple QoS constraints, which may deal with the delay, bandwidth and cost inetrics, and describes a network model for researching the Ad Hoc network QoS multicast routing problem. It presents an Entropy-based stability QoS Multicast Routing protocol in ad hoc network (EQMR). The key idea of EQMR algorithm is to construct the new metric-entropy and select the stability path with the help of entropy metric to reduce the number of route reconstruction so as to provide QoS guarantee in the ad hoc network. In this paper, the proof of correctness and complexity analysis of the EQMR are also given. The simulation results show that the proposed approach and parameters provide ail accurate and efficient method of estimating and evaluating the route stability in dynamic mobile networks.", "paper_title": "An entropy-based stability QoS multicast routing protocol in ad hoc network", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300022"}
