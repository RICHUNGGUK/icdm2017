The pheromone quantum of manufacturing cell is calculated inversely proportional to the cost, which can guarantee a minimal cost to process the orders. This approach has the capacity for optimization model to automatically find efficient routing paths for processing orders and to reduce communication overhead which exists in contract net protocol in shop floor control system. A prototype system is developed, and experiments confirm that pheromone-based coordination approach has excellent control performance and adaptability to disturbances in shop floor.", "paper_title": "Pheromone-based coordination for manufacturing system control", "paper_id": "WOS:000304160600030"}
