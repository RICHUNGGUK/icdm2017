Recently, we proposed a method to estimate two-dimensional (2-D) object motion from a sequence of slowly rotating X-ray projection views, which we called deformation from orbiting views (DOVs). In this method, we model the motion as a time varying deformation of a static prior of the anatomy. We then optimize the parameters of the motion model by maximizing the similarity between the modeled and actual projection views. This paper extends the method to full three-dimensional (3-D) motion and cone-beam projection views. We address several practical issues for using a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scanner that is integrated in a radiotherapy system, such as the effects of Compton scatter and the limited gantry rotation for one breathing cycle. We also present simulation and phantom results to illustrate the performance of this method.", "paper_title": "Estimating 3-D respiratory motion from orbiting views by tomographic image registration", "paper_id": "WOS:000243914200002"}
