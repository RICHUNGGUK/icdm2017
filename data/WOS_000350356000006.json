This predictive controller design allows one to characterize the performance of the controlled converter, while providing sufficient conditions for local stability for a class of power converters. Simulation and experimental results on a buck dc-dc converter and a two-level dc-ac inverter are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposal.", "paper_title": "Predictive Control of Power Converters: Designs With Guaranteed Performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000350356000006"}
