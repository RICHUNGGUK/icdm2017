If {d(1), d(2),..., d(w)} is allowed to be a multiset, then the resulting minimum I is called the strong w-Rabin number of W. In this article, we show that both the w-Rabin number and the strong w-Rabin number of a k-dimensional folded hypercube are equal to k/2 for 1 <= w <= k/2 - 1, and k/2 + 1 for k/2 <= 5 w <= k + 1, where k >= 5. Each path obtained is shortest or second shortest. The results of this paper also solve an open problem raised by Liaw and Chang.
