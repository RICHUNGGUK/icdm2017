Chem. Inf Model doi:10.1021/ci300074v] details extensions to the STAR File [Hall J. Chem. Inf Comput. Sci. 1991, 31, 326-333] syntax that will improve the exchange and archiving of electronic data. This paper describes a dictionary definition language (DDLm) for defining STAR File data items in a domain dictionary. A dictionary that defines the ontology and vocabulary of a discipline is built with DDLm, which is itself implemented in STAR, and is extensible and machine parsable. The DDLm is semantically rich and highly specific; provides strong data typing, data enumerations; and ranges, enables relationship keys between data items, and uses imbedded methods' Written in dREL [Spadaccini et, al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. doi:10.1021/ci300076w] for data validation and evaluation and for refining data definitions. It promotes the modular, definition of the discipline ontology and reuse through the ability to import definitions from other local and remote dictionaries, thus encouraging the sharing of data dictionaries within and across domains.", "paper_title": "DDLm: A New Dictionary Definition Language", "paper_id": "WOS:000308254200002"}
