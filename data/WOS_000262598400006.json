This approach utilizes the characteristics of concentric circles' tangent lines to locate the center of these circles, and finds the geometric constraints for calibration based on the orthogonality formed by a point on the circle and the two intersected points of the circle with the line through the center of the circle. The entire process requires no conic equation fitting and no metric measurement of the test pattern, which is very flexible to implement.", "paper_title": "EFFECTIVE AND AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION USING CONCENTRIC CIRCLES", "paper_id": "WOS:000262598400006"}
