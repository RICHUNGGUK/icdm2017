Therefore, controlled operation of power systems is very critical and of utmost importance in order to achieve stable power system. Naturally, this paves ways for implementing fast, efficient and reliable control algorithms. Robustness and efficiency of power system controllers can be improved by using complimentary paradigms of intelligent systems; neural networks, fuzzy logic and bio-inspired optimization algorithms. Difficulties encountered in designing controls for nonlinear, dynamic and uncertain systems can be easily tackled by using intrinsic observability property of various intelligent systems. The other advantage of intelligent system is lesser modeling error, which leads to efficient control loop. Intelligent controllers have been successfully applied to enhance operation and control of power system. This paper reviews and summarizes implementation of intelligent controllers at the generator end of power systems, during the past decade. Few proposals are also given for further investigation in the realm discussed in this paper.", "paper_title": "CONTROL OF POWER SYSTEM STABILITY - REVIEWED SOLUTIONS BASED ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000310118200010"}
