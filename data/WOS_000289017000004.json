Key pre-distribution is commonly used to establish key sharing among sensor nodes. In this paper. we investigate an attack probability-based deterministic key pre-distribution method for non-uniform sensor deployment aiming mainly at preserving the integrity of the network to ensure the functionality of sensor networks. We first design a model for group-based deployment to estimate the attack probability of each deployment group. The proposed model further considers the motion of the adversaries and the location of the data sink to meet the practical situation. Based on this attack model, a deterministic key pre-distribution mechanism for group-based deployment is proposed. To evaluate the proposed method, the issues of memory overhead, communication overhead, and the fraction of total communication compromised after adversaries launch node capture attacks analytically and empirically. Simulation results show that our approach is superior than some known methods.", "paper_title": "An application-driven attack probability-based deterministic pairwise key pre-distribution scheme for non-uniformly deployed sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000289017000004"}
