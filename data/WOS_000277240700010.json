(Formal Aspects Comput (FACS) 19:159-189, 2007). The dynamic frames approach is a promising solution to this problem. However, the approach is formalized in the context of an idealized logical framework. In particular, it is not clear the solution is suitable for use within a program verifier for a Java-like language based on verification condition generation and automated, first-order theorem proving. In this paper, we demonstrate that the dynamic frames approach can be integrated into an automatic verifier based on verification condition generation and automated theorem proving. The approach has been proven sound and has been implemented in a verifier prototype. The prototype has been used to prove correctness of several programming patterns considered challenging in related work.", "paper_title": "Automatic verification of Java programs with dynamic frames", "paper_id": "WOS:000277240700010"}
