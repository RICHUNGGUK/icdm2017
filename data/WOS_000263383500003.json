The reason is that sample patches employed as primary patterns of the tile set may not be well stitched if carelessly picked. In this paper, we introduce a robust approach that can stably generate an omega-tile set of high quality and pattern diversity. First, an extendable rule is introduced to increase the number of sample patches to vary the patterns in an omega-tile set. Second, in contrast to other concurrent techniques that randomly choose sample patches for tile construction, ours uses artificial immune system (AIS) to select the feasible patches from the input example. This operation ensures the quality of the whole tile set. Experimental results verify the high quality and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Robust tile-based texture synthesis using artificial immune system", "paper_id": "WOS:000263383500003"}
