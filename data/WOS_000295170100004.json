This study introduced weight coefficients to each GP linkage in a tree in order to create a new weighted genetic programming (WGP) approach. Two distinct advantages of the proposed WGP include (1) balancing the influences of the two front input branches and (2) incorporating weights throughout generated formulas. Resulting formulas contain a certain quantity of optimized functions and weights. Genetic algorithms are employed to accomplish WGP optimization of function selection and proper weighting tasks. Case studies presented herein highlight a high-strength concrete reference study. Results showed that the proposed WGP not only improves GP in terms of introduced weight coefficients, but also provides both accurate results and formula outputs.", "paper_title": "Predicting high-strength concrete parameters using weighted genetic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000295170100004"}
