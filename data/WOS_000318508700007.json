We then survey the available databases for Arabic bank check processing research. The state of the art in the different phases of Arabic bank check processing is surveyed (i.e., pre-processing, check analysis and segmentation, features extraction, and legal and courtesy amounts recognition). The open issues for future research are stated and areas that need improvements are presented. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first survey of Arabic bank check processing.", "paper_title": "Arabic Bank Check Processing: State of the Art", "paper_id": "WOS:000318508700007"}
