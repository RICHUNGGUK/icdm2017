In order to deal with the linguistic term sets that are not uniformly and symmetrically distributed, the numerical scale model has been developed to generalize the 2-tuple linguistic modeling. In the numerical scale model, the key task of the 2-tuple based models is the definition of a numerical scale function that establishes a one to one mapping between the linguistic information and numerical values. In this paper, we propose a consistency-driven automatic methodology to set interval numerical scales of 2-tuple linguistic term sets in the decision making problems with linguistic preference relations. This consistency-driven methodology is based on a natural premise regarding the consistency of preference relations. If linguistic preference relations provided by experts are of acceptable consistency, the corresponding transformed numerical preference relations by the established interval numerical scale are also consistent. Compared with the existing approach based on canonical characteristic values, the consistency-driven methodology provides a new way to set the interval numerical scale without the need of the semantics defined by interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Meanwhile, interval multiplicative preference relations are used in the pairwise comparisons method and the presented theory can be utilized in the pairwise comparisons method as it provides a novel approach to automatic construct interval multiplicative preference relations. Finally, we present the framework for the use of the consistency-driven automatic methodology in linguistic group decision making problems and two numerical examples are given to illustrate the feasibility and validity of this proposal.", "paper_title": "Consistency-Driven Automatic Methodology to Set Interval Numerical Scales of 2-Tuple Linguistic Term Sets and Its Use in the Linguistic GDM With Preference Relation", "paper_id": "WOS:000351467400015"}
