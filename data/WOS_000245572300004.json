The approach takes advantage of both the component-based software development and the efficient execution of parallel simulation models. The use of components improves the software life cycle and facilitates the development, maintenance and evolution of the simulator kernel, which can be adapted to different execution scenarios. Data dependencies among simulation models are resolved automatically by means of a novel algorithm, releasing the programmer from this tedious task and, as a result, making the development process easier. This work introduces the main features of the simulator kernel, describing concepts and the model on which it is based. Some preliminary results are shown that anticipate the feasibility and suitability of the proposal.
