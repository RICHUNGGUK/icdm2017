A successful smart meeting system relies on various technologies, ranging from devices and algorithms to architecture. This article presents a condensed survey of existing research and technologies, including smart meeting system architecture, meeting capture, meeting recognition, semantic processing, and evaluation methods. It aims at providing an overview of underlying technologies to help understand the key design issues of such systems. This article also describes various open issues as possible ways to extend the capabilities of current smart meeting systems.", "paper_title": "Smart Meeting Systems: A Survey of State-of-the-Art and Open Issues", "paper_id": "WOS:000275118300003"}
