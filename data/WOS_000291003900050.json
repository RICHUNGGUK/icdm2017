They generalize the previous constructions of optimal FHS sets using m-sequences and produce new optimal FHS sets that cannot be produced by the earlier constructions. By choosing appropriate d-form functions with difference-balanced property, both constructions lead to FHSs with large linear complexity. In addition, one of the proposed constructions gives new optimal parameters of FHS sets.", "paper_title": "New Constructions for Optimal Sets of Frequency-Hopping Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000291003900050"}
