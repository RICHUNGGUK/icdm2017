Ratliff and Rosenthal [Operations Research 31(3) (1983) 507-521] show that the special design of the warehouse and use of one picker lead to a polynomially solvable case. We address the multiobjective version of this special case and investigate the properties of the nondominated points. We develop an exact algorithm that finds any nondominated point and present an illustrative example. Finally we conduct a computational test and report the results.", "paper_title": "A Pseudo-Polynomial Time Algorithm for a Special Multiobjective Order Picking Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000362479800009"}
