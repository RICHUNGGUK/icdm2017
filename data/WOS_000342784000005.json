Recently, many cryptographic schemes using pairings of composite order group were proposed. Miller's algorithm is used to compute pairings, and the time of computing the pairings depends on the cost of calculating the Miller loop. As a method of speeding up calculations of the pairings of prime order, the number of iterations of the Miller loop can be reduced by choosing a prime order of low Hamming weight. However, it is difficult to choose a particular composite order that can speed up the pairings of composite order. Kobayashi et al. proposed an efficient algorithm for computing Miller's algorithm by using a window method, called Window Miller's algorithm. We can compute scalar multiplication of points on elliptic curves by using a window hybrid binary-ternary form (w-HBTF). In this paper, we propose a Miller's algorithm that uses w-HBTF to compute Tate pairing efficiently. This algorithm needs a precomputation both of the points on an elliptic curve and rational functions. The proposed algorithm was implemented in Java on a PC and compared with Window Miller's Algorithm in terms of the time and memory needed to make their precomputed tables. We used the supersingular elliptic curve y(2) = x(3) + x with embedding degree 2 and a composite order of size of 2048-bit. We denote w as window width. The proposed algorithm with w = 6 = 2 . 3 was about 12.9% faster than Window Miller's Algorithm with w = 2 although the memory size of these algorithms is the same. Moreover, the proposed algorithm with w = 162 = 2 . 3(4) was about 12.2% faster than Window Miller's algorithm with w = 7.", "paper_title": "Efficient Algorithm for Tate Pairing of Composite Order", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784000005"}
