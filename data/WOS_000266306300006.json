As a result, the turnaround times of both the grid jobs and the owners' jobs are invariably delayed. To resolve this problem, the current study proposes a progressive multi-layer resource reconfiguration framework, designated as PMR-G, in which intra- and inter-site reconfiguration strategies are employed to adapt grid users' jobs dynamically to changes in the available CPU resources at each node. The experimental results show that PMR-G enables the idle CPU cycles of a resource to be fully exploited by grid users with minimum interference to the resource owner's jobs. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
