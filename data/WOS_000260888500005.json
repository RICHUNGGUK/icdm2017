However, several classification problems have more than two classes. One approach to deal with multiclass problems using binary classifiers is to decompose the multiclass problem into multiple binary sub-problems disposed in a binary tree. This approach requires a binary partition of the classes for each node of the tree, which defines the tree structure. This paper presents two algorithms to determine the tree structure taking into account information collected from the used dataset. This approach allows the tree structure to be determined automatically for any multiclass dataset.", "paper_title": "HIERARCHICAL DECOMPOSITION OF MULTICLASS PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000260888500005"}
