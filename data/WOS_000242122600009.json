This problem has applications wherever a population has to be distributed among a limited number of resources and the workload for each resource shall be balanced. We modify an existing clustering algorithm in this respect, present some empirical evaluation and discuss the results.", "paper_title": "Equi-sized, homogeneous partitioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600009"}
