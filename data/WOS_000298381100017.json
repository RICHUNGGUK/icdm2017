This paper proposes a novel decentralized semantic-aware metadata organization, called SmartStore, which exploits semantics of files' metadata to judiciously aggregate correlated files into semantic-aware groups by using information retrieval tools. The key idea of SmartStore is to limit the search scope of a complex metadata query to a single or a minimal number of semantically correlated groups and avoid or alleviate brute-force search in the entire system. The decentralized design of SmartStore can improve system scalability and reduce query latency for complex queries (including range and top-k queries). Moreover, it is also conducive to constructing semantic-aware caching, and conventional filename-based point query. We have implemented a prototype of SmartStore and extensive experiments based on real-world traces show that SmartStore significantly improves system scalability and reduces query latency over database approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the implementation of complex queries in large-scale file systems.", "paper_title": "Semantic-Aware Metadata Organization Paradigm in Next-Generation File Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000298381100017"}
