The proposed architecture incorporates maintenance elements such as operational reliability, maintenance economics, human factors in maintenance, maintenance program, and maintenance optimization in a virtual collaborative architecture. An analytical model is proposed to measure the relative performance of the proposed virtual collaborative architecture as well as that of the manufacturing enterprise. A numerical example is also presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A virtual collaborative maintenance architecture for manufacturing enterprises", "paper_id": "WOS:000259697900012"}
