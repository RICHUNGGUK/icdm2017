The conditional edge connectivity is the cardinality of the minimum edge cuts, if any, whose deletion disconnects and each component of has . We assume that is an edge set, is called edge extra-cut, if is not connected and each component of has more than vertices. The edge extraconnectivity is the cardinality of the minimum edge extra-cuts.
