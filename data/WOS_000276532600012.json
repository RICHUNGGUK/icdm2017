As an alternative for this limitation, Human Interaction Management (HIM) suggests a dynamic process modeling method based on Role Activity Diagram (RAD). However, the current process modeling method of HIM has two problems: lack of machine-processability and inexistence of platform-independently exchangeable form. To address these problems, this research proposes an OWL-based process modeling method based on RAD modeling of HIM. As the proposed modeling method provides machine-processability, platform-independence, and semantic interoperability to business process models, collaborative business can be performed more efficiently.
