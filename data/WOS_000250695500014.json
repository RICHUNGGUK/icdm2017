In this paper, a new model of camera lens distortion is presented, according to which lens distortion is governed by the coefficients of radial distortion and a transform from ideal image plane to real sensor array plane. The transform is determined by two angular parameters describing the pose of the real sensor array plane with respect to the ideal image plane and two linear parameters locating the real sensor array with respect to the optical axis. Experiments show that the new model has about the same correcting effect upon lens distortion as the conventional model including all the radial distortion, decentering distortion and prism distortion. Compared with the conventional model, the new model has fewer parameters to be calibrated and more explicit physical meaning. (c) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
