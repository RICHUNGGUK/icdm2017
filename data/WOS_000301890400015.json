As exact modeling of cloud centers is not feasible due to the nature of cloud centers and diversity of user requests, we describe a novel approximate analytical model for performance evaluation of cloud server farms and solve it to obtain accurate estimation of the complete probability distribution of the request response time and other important performance indicators. The model allows cloud operators to determine the relationship between the number of servers and input buffer size, on one side, and the performance indicators such as mean number of tasks in the system, blocking probability, and probability that a task will obtain immediate service, on the other.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of Cloud Computing Centers Using M/G/m/m plus r Queuing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000301890400015"}
