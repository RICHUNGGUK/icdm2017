We extend a result by Linial and Tarsi which characterizes permutations realizable on shuffle-exchange networks to any BPNs. A necessary condition for a BPN to be rearrangeable is given, and the rearrangeability of two families of BPNs are explored. Finally, we present a method which may help to tackle one kind of balanced matrix problems whose solution implies an answer to Benes conjecture. Hopefully, our treatment brings some new insight into the problem of permutation routing. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
