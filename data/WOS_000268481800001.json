It is especially the case in the field of software engineering which has traditionally been underdeveloped in some areas. The curriculum presented in this paper is oriented towards undergraduate students of informatics and engineering. The proposed approach takes into account integration trends in European educational area and requirements of the labour market. The aim of this paper is to discuss the body of knowledge that should be provided by a modern curriculum in software engineering at a master level. Also the techniques used in development and implementation of such curriculum at different universities will be described. The presented ideas are based on the experience gained in the 3 year TEMPUS(1) project \"Joint MSc Curriculum in Software Engineering\", which established joint master studies in software engineering. Over a three-year interval, the project managed to define a new and joint curriculum, create teaching materials and deliver the curriculum in two institutions.", "paper_title": "Development of a Modern Curriculum in Software Engineering at Master Level across Countries", "paper_id": "WOS:000268481800001"}
