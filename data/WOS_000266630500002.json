To address this problem, this paper proposes an optimal design method for VV&A schemes, which focuses VV&A on most critical aspects rather than selects most appropriate VV&A methods. Fuzzy failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is employed to assess the risk of a complex simulation system. In terms of the risk of each failure, its VV&A activities and cost are estimated, and then fuzzy linear regression analysis is used to construct the mathematical model for the relation between the risk and cost for each failure. Based on this model, fuzzy linear programming is adopted to construct the optimal model of the VV&A scheme for the simulation system. According to the optimal solution from the optimal model, the optimal VV&A scheme is found. This optimal method not only provides an effective means to estimate the overall cost that should be invested in VV&A, but also gives an approach to reasonable assign the cost to VV&A activities.", "paper_title": "An Optimal Design Method for Simulation Verification, Validation and Accreditation Schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000266630500002"}
