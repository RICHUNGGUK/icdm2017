However, it is still unclear about its performance in the solution of nonlinear systems analytically. Hence, this study proposes to analytically investigate its numerical characteristics for solving nonlinear systems. Design/methodology/approach - Two parameters are introduced to facilitate the basic analysis for nonlinear systems. One is the step degree of nonlinearity, which describes the stiffness change within a time step, and the other is the step degree of convergence, which describes the convergence error due to an iteration procedure. Findings - It is theoretically proved that the sub-family of WBZ-alpha method of -1 <= alpha < 0, beta = (1/4)(1 - alpha)(2) and gamma = (1/2) - alpha is unconditionally stable and has desired numerical dissipation for any nonlinear systems even with the presence of convergence error. These theoretical results are confirmed by numerical examples. Originality/value - This analytical study reveals that the performance of the WBZ-alpha method for nonlinear systems is in general the same as that for linear elastic systems.", "paper_title": "Investigation of WBZ-alpha method for solving nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000247569000010"}
