The eigenenergies and wavefunctions are obtained by solving Schrodinger's equation with an accurate potential energy distribution. The potential energy distribution is derived from the solution of Poisson's equation, which contains both depletion charge and free charge. The eigenenergies obtained from our model are compared with other two quantum-confinement models, which use flat-well approximation and parabola-well approximation as the potential energy distributions, respectively. And we point out the relationship between the eigenenergies and the potential energy distribution for the first time. Based on this model, the electron density with quantum confinement effects are derived, and threshold voltage is defined based on average electron density. After considering quantum confinement effects, the electron density becomes smaller while the threshold voltage becomes larger. The results show that this model is applicable from the subthreshold region to the stronginversion region in different channel doping conditions.", "paper_title": "A quantum-confinement model for surrounding-gate MOSFETS from subthreshold to strong-inversion regions", "paper_id": "WOS:000308814500020"}
