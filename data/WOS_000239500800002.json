While previous approaches to model learning rely on an independent source of training data, we show how a robot can induce action and sensor models without any well-calibrated feedback. Specifically, the only inputs to the ASAMI learning process are the data the robot would naturally have access to: its raw sensations and knowledge of its own action selections. From the perspective of developmental robotics, our robot's goal is to obtain self-consistent internal models, rather than to perform any externally defined tasks. Furthermore, the target function of each model-learning process comes from within the system, namely the most current version of another internal system model. Concretely realizing this model-learning methodology presents a number of challenges, and we introduce a broad class of settings in which solutions to these challenges are presented. ASAMI is fully implemented and tested, and empirical results validate our approach in a robotic testbed domain using a Sony Aibo ERS-7 robot.", "paper_title": "Towards autonomous sensor and actuator model induction on a mobile robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000239500800002"}
