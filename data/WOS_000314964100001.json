Specifically, by applying relay-selection and phase-rotation techniques, a diversity gain of four can be achieved. In addition, a symbol error rate (SER) performance analysis with closed form expression and power allocation are investigated and compared with simulation results. The results show that theoretical SER curves are close to the simulation results. In addition, a code rate of the proposed scheme is two times higher than ordinary cooperative communications. The computer simulation results also show a significant probability of error improvement of about 2.8 dB over the conventional decode-and-forward protocol.", "paper_title": "On the Performance of Quasiorthogonal STBC with Relay Selection and Phase Rotation Techniques for Decode and Forward Cooperative Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000314964100001"}
