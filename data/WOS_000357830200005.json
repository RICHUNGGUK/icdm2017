In order to resolve the complexity and ambiguity problems caused by a large number of human objects, we propose a Group Interaction Zone (GIZ) to detect meaningful groups in a scene to effectively handle noisy information. Two novel features, Group Interaction Energy (GIE) feature and Attraction and Repulsion Features, are proposed to better describe group activities within a GIZ. We demonstrate the performance of our method in two ways by (i) comparing the performance of the proposed method with the previous methods and (ii) analyzing the influence of the proposed features and GIZ-based meaningful group detection on group activity recognition using public datasets.", "paper_title": "Group Activity Recognition with Group Interaction Zone Based on Relative Distance Between Human Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000357830200005"}
