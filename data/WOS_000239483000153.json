Concern about its integrative control strategy is increasing, owing to the features of uncertain and nonlinear as well as parameters coupling and time-variation for three parts of water flux, hydroturbine and generator. A cascade-connected self-adaptive fuzzy-neural network control strategy is proposed, which the former controller uses a self-tuning fuzzy algorithm with the intelligent weight function rulers, the latter adopts a self-adaptive neural network controller based on dynamical coupling characteristics of controlled plants. By comparison with traditional RID control, simulation results have shown that this hydrogenerator system appears good robustness against load disturbance and system parameters uncertainty.", "paper_title": "Robust control for AC-excited hydrogenerator system using adaptive fuzzy-neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000153"}
