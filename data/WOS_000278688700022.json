To solve this problem, video transcoding has become an important topic. When. original motion vectors are available in the compressed domain, it becomes possible to save computational cost by utilizing the known. information. Although many fast motion. re-estimation approaches have been proposed, such as average approach (A A), area-weighted-average (AWA) and median approach (MA), they are not suitable to convert an existing video to various kinds of resolutions. On the other hand, these reuse schemes may introduce quality degradation due to the reconstruction errors. In this paper, we propose a method to address this problem. First, we introduce a distance-trimmed filter (DTF) that improves accuracy of estimated motion vectors (MVs). Then we embed Kalman filter, which considers the correlation of motion characteristics of neighbor blocks in temporal and spatial domain, to improve the accuracy of estimated MVs for fast downscaling algorithms. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method provides an effective improvement, of performance for arbitrary video downscaling.", "paper_title": "MOTION VECTOR RE-ESTIMATION FOR VIDEO TRANSCODING WITH ARBITRARY VIDEO DOWNSIZING", "paper_id": "WOS:000278688700022"}
