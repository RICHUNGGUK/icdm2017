The first one is largely based on the first principle modelling approach and considers the main yeast physiological mechanisms. The model accurately predicts the fermentation kinetics of more than 80% of a large number of experiments performed with 20 wine yeast strains, 69 musts and different fermentation conditions. Thanks to the wide domain of validity of the model, a simulator based on this model coupled to a thermal model was developed to help winemakers to optimize tank management. It predicts the end of the fermentation and changes in the rate of fermentation but furthermore includes an optimization module based on fuzzy logic which allows, via temperature profiles and nitrogen addition strategies, to decrease the duration of fermentation and the energy requirements at winery scale according to user specifications. The objective of the second modelling approach is the development of a mathematical model of the fermentation process including some minority by-products known as characteristic flavour compounds. It refers to metabolic engineering and accounts for the intracellular behaviour of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by using approaches like the metabolic flux analysis (MFA) and the elementary flux modes (EFMs). A state of the art describes the application of these methods in the restrained field of winemaking/fermentation conditions and underlines the potential of such approaches.", "paper_title": "Two modelling approaches of winemaking: first principle and metabolic engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000284958800003"}
