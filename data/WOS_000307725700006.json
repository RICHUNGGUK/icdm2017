Each of these groups of devices have a different set of requirements according to their intended use and applications but most of them share two main requirements: QoS support to satisfy applications' demands and power saving functionality to achieve an operating time according to users' expectations. IEEE 802.11e defines two centralized solutions in order to address these problems: Hybrid Coordination Channel Access (HCCA) for QoS and Scheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery (S-APSD) for power saving. The focus of our work in this paper is the analysis and evaluation of a proposed centralized scheduler that makes use of both aforementioned IEEE 802.11e QoS and power saving solutions. Our contributions are as follows: (i) Design and analytical modeling of a proposed centralized scheduler (DRA) that maximizes the minimum distance between the resource allocations with pseudo-polynomial complexity, (ii) Extensive performance evaluation of the QoS and power saving benefits of the Distribution proposal (DRA) as compared to a generic Grouping one (GRA), and (iii) Evaluation of the complexity and scalability of the proposal to assess its feasibility in practice.
