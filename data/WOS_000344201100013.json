This paper presents an automated and effective approach for the verification of information flow control for business process models. Building on the concept of place-based non-interference and declassification, the core contribution of this paper is the application of Petri net reachability to detect places in which information leaks occur. Such a feature allows for the use of state-of-the-art tool support to model-check business process models and detect leaks. We show that the approach is sound and complete, and present the Anica tool to identify leaks. An extensive evaluation comprising over 550 industrial process models is carried out and shows that information flow analysis of process models can be done in milliseconds. This motivates a tight integration of business process modeling and non-interference checking. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
