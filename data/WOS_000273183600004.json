It is well known in electromagnetism that when linear coherent waves meet they interfere without interactions. Linear waves also scatter through local optical structures without exchanging any power with guided and anti-guided modes of these structures. When a focusing Kerr nonlinearity is present, linearly inhibited phenomena, which break these rules, are shown to exist. Our studies were performed with Silica glass and semiconductor AlGaAs nonlinear planar modulated waveguides, excited by ultra-short pulses in the near infrared spectral regime. (C) 2009 IMACS.
