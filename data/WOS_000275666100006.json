Web2OHS provides omnibearing homecare and patientcare services for medical staff and caregivers, which are capable of assisting families, physicians, and nurses to obtain patients' physiological information using healthcare sensors, as well as monitor their behaviors using monitoring-based services. Web2OHS is a three-tier architecture that consists of Web2OHS clients, the Web2.0-based Patientcare Service Platform (WPSP), and the Medicine-based Active Database (MADB). Users can interact with Web2OHS using various appliances and retrieve the latest physiological and monitoring data using really simple syndication (RSS) and the proposed ALS services. The WPSP supports Web2.0-based applications, including blog-like monitoring services, monitoring-based RSS services, a real-time interaction services, and ALS services. The MADB provides a well-designed database, which stores physiological information, clinical information, digital imaging and communications in medicine image files, and monitoring frames. All of the delivered messages are based on extensible markup language and the Health Level 7 protocol. The proposed Web2OHS can support medical informatics and is compatible with related medical information systems.", "paper_title": "Web2OHS: A Web2.0-Based Omnibearing Homecare System", "paper_id": "WOS:000275666100006"}
