The governing equations are solved by a finite difference technique based on the marker-and-cell philosophy. A staggered grid is employed and marker particles are used to represent the fluid free surface. Full details for the approximation of the free surface stress conditions are given. The resultant code is validated and convergence is demonstrated. Numerical simulations of the extrudate swell and flow through a planar 4:1 contraction for various values of the Deborah number are presented.
