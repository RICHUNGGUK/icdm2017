However, there are still many challenges and difficulties when moving from the SON concept to practical implementation. In this context, this paper first provides a general formulation of the automated optimisation problem and a detailed description of the main challenges and difficulties ahead. Then, a generic multi-cell multi-objective self-optimisation methodology based on genetic algorithms is proposed. The proposed framework is formulated in detail for a joint coverage and overlap optimisation problem in a multi-cell scenario. A case study using real measurements of a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System network deployed in a medium-size European city is presented to illustrate the proposed methodology. In the presented case study, the pilot power, antenna tilt and antenna azimuth of the different cells are optimised according to certain cell coverage and cell overlap targets. Results reveal that the genetic-based approach is able to provide optimised solutions that efficiently achieve the desired targets accounting for inter-cell coupling effects.
