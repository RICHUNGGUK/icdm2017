This article describes: (1) a selection of bitboard techniques including an introduction to bitboards and bitwise operations, (2) a classification scheme that distinguishes filter, query and update methods, and (3) a sampling of bitboard algorithms for a range of games other than chess, with notes on their performance and practical application.", "paper_title": "BITBOARD METHODS FOR GAMES", "paper_id": "WOS:000347515200001"}
