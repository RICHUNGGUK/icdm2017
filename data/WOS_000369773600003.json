Here, eight new families of distributions are introduced. These distributions are motivated as models for the stress of a system consisting of components working in parallel/series and each component has a fixed number of sub -components working in parallel/series. Mathematical properties and estimation procedures are derived for one of the families of distributions. A real data application shows superior performance of a three-parameter distribution (performance assessed with respect to Kolmogorov Smirnov statistics, AIC values, BIC values, CAIC values, AICc values, HQC values, probability-probability plots, quantile-quantile plots and density plots) versus thirty one other distributions, each having at least three parameters.", "paper_title": "COMPOUND GEOMETRIC AND POISSON MODELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000369773600003"}
