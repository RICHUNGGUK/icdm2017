We then propose some interesting challenges for symbol recognition research in the present years, including symbol spotting methods, recognition procedures for complex symbols, and a systematic approach to performance evaluation of symbol recognition methods.", "paper_title": "Musings on symbol recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036000003"}
