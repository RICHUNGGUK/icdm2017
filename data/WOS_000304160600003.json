It mainly consists of parallel mechanism of three dimensional moving platform, serial rotational mechanism of two degrees of freedom and the elastic polishing tool system. The active compliant control and passive conformity of polishing tool are provided by a pneumatic servo system and a spring, respectively. Considering the contradiction between the machining quality and efficiency, the optimization model of process parameters is found according to different machining requirements, namely single objective optimization and multi-objective optimization, which provide a choice of parameters as a basis for the operators in practice. Many polishing experiments are conducted to collect the data samples. The genetic algorithm integrated with artificial neural network is used for researching for the optimal process parameters in term of the various optimization objectives. This research also lays the foundation for further establishing polishing expert system.", "paper_title": "Process optimization of the serial-parallel hybrid polishing machine tool based on artificial neural network and genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000304160600003"}
