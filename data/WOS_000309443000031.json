The system contains purpose-built web-based software to facilitate accurate near-real time data collection by clinicians throughout the complex care settings traversed by patients. Tools are included to facilitate pre-defined and bespoke data review with graphical dashboards showing performance metrics and other aggregate data. The software was designed collaboratively by health care professionals and engineers, and is accessible via the hospital intranet using desktop or laptop computers and wireless mobile devices. Stroke Nav is being routinely used in two hospitals, with over 1400 patients registered, and is now being introduced in other hospitals. The system is delivering benefits in relation to multidisciplinary communication, knowledge management, patient safety, clinical audit and service performance. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
