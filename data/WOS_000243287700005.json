A priori knowledge about tumors described by radiology experts for different types of MR1 are very helpful to guide a automatic and a precise segmentation. However, the terminology used by radiology experts are variable in term of image signal. In order to benefit of these descriptions, we propose to modellize them by fuzzy models. One fuzzy model is built for one type of MR1 sequence. The segmentation is finally based on a fusion of different fuzzy information obtained from different types of MRI images. Our algorithm consists of four stages: the registration of multispectral MR images, the creation of fuzzy models describing the characteristics of tumor, the fusion based on fuzzy fusion operators and the adjustment by fuzzy region growing based on fuzzy connecting. The comparison between the obtained results and the hand-tracings of a radiology expert shows that the proposed algorithm is efficient. An average probability of correct detection 96% and an average probability of false detection 5% are obtained through studies of four patients. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
