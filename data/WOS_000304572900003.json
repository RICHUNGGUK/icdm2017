However, to measure the variation of the pixel amplitudes, it is necessary to store the previous frame using a large frame memory. To downscale the frame memory, block truncation coding (BTC) is commonly employed due to the simplicity of its implementation, even if some visual artifacts may occur for image blocks with high frequency components. In this paper, we present a multimode-multilevel BTC (MBTC) technique that improves performance while maintaining simplicity. To improve the visual quality, we uniquely determine the quantization level and coding mode of each block according to the distribution of the luminance and chrominance amplitudes. For a compression ratio of 6:1, the proposed method demonstrates higher coding efficiency and overdrive performance by up to 3.81 dB in the PSNR compared to other methods.", "paper_title": "Implementation of Multimode-Multilevel Block Truncation Coding for LCD Overdrive", "paper_id": "WOS:000304572900003"}
