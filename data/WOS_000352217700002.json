Low contrast results in the difficulty for carrying out basic local feature (e.g., interest points and edges) detection algorithms, which are necessary procedures in some computer vision applications. Hence, increasing contrast of degraded images is very important since it is helpful in finding more distinct features from haze images. However, few single image haze removal methods can simultaneously achieve clear visibility, sufficiently high contrast, and simplicity. In this paper, we propose an intuitive and effective method, called the depth-based contrast stretching transform (DCST), to simultaneously obtain clear visibility and enhance contrast of a single haze gray image. The DCST stretches the contrast of haze images based on the coarse depth layers of scenes. Our method is simple and almost real time and can be extended to color images. We analyze in detail that the image stretched by the DCST has a higher local contrast than the image recovered via the physical-based model. Experiments demonstrate that images stretched by the DCST have excellent visibility and contrast compared with a few existing algorithms. Compelling performance is also presented by comparing the proposed method with other representative methods in the application of local feature detection.", "paper_title": "Single image haze removal via depth-based contrast stretching transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000352217700002"}
