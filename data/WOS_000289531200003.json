A sample of 5749 structures was analyzed and classified according to the 56 elements encountered. Fifteen metals (Na, Mg, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Mo, Cd, W, Hg) are involved in almost half of the structures, with each metal figuring in more than 100 structures. We analyzed this subsample in more detail by computing the amino acid residues occurring within a coordination sphere of 5 angstrom centered on the element, and using methods of cluster analysis to group the elements. The analyses undertaken here are able to distinguish between real components of proteins and elements inserted by artefacts of the crystallization process or experimental techniques.", "paper_title": "Metals in proteins: cluster analysis studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000289531200003"}
