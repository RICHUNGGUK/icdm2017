An optimal solution for such a graph G is an algorithm that completes the task of moving a tower of any given number of disks from S to D in a minimal number of disk moves. In this article we present an algorithm which solves the problem for two infinite families of graphs, and prove its optimality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first optimality proof for an infinite family of graphs. Furthermore, we present a unified algorithm that solves the problem for a wider family of graphs and conjecture its optimality.", "paper_title": "On an Infinite Family of Solvable Hanoi Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000265882300013"}
