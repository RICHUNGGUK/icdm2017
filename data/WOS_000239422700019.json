Back, Petre and Porres have extended these action systems to continuous action systems, which can be. used to model hybrid systems. In this paper we define a refinement relation, and develop practical data refinement rules for continuous action systems. The meaning of continuous action systems is expressed in terms of a mapping from continuous action systems to action systems. First, we present a new mapping from continuous act ion systems to action systems, such that Back's definition of trace refinement is correct with respect to it. Second, we present a stream semantics that is compatible with the trace semantics, but is preferable to it because it is more general. Although action system trace refinement rules are applicable to continuous action systems with a stream semantics, they are not complete. Finally, we introduce a new data refinement rule that is valid with respect to the stream semantics and can be used to prove refinements that are not possible in the trace semantics, and we analyse the completeness of our new rule in conjunction with the existing trace refinement rules.", "paper_title": "Continuous action system refinement", "paper_id": "WOS:000239422700019"}
