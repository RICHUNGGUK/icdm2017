Let KaS dagger a\"e (n) be a semialgebraic set. The truncated K-moment problem (TKMP) is: How can one check if a tms y admits a K-measure mu (a nonnegative Borel measure supported in K) such that for every alpha? This paper proposes a semidefinite programming (SDP) approach for solving TKMP. When K is compact, we get the following results: whether a tms admits a K-measure or not can be checked via solving a sequence of SDP problems; when y admits no K-measure, a certificate for the nonexistence can be found; when y admits one, a representing measure for y can be obtained from solving the SDP problems under some necessary and some sufficient conditions. Moreover, we also propose a practical SDP method for finding flat extensions, which in our numerical experiments always found a finitely atomic representing measure when it exists.", "paper_title": "A Semidefinite Approach for Truncated K-Moment Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000310338700004"}
