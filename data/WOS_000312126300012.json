The Lagrange-Euler equation is used to derive a mathematical model of the helicopter flight dynamics. To handle the complex faults of the helicopter flight system, a model reference-based self-repairing control law is proposed using quantum control techniques, which can improve the helicopter's self-repairing and control precision. In addition, a fuzzy feedforward compensation controller is designed to improve the anti-disturbance performance. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed intelligent self-repairing controller.", "paper_title": "Fault Self-repairing Flight Control of a Small Helicopter via Fuzzy Feedforward and Quantum Control Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000312126300012"}
