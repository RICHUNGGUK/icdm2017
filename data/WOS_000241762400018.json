Incorporation of modem delay-sensitive applications has made the task even harder. The traditional Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning techniques are not applicable on MANETs because such networks are highly dynamic in nature. The available QoS provisioning algorithms are either not efficient or are embedded into routing protocols adding a high computation and communication load. In this paper, we propose a Network State Adaptive QoS provision algorithm (NETSAQ) that works with many underlying routing protocol. It ensures the QoS provisioning according to the high level policy. NETSAQ is simple to implement yet minimizes the degradation of the best effort traffic at a considerable level. Our simulation results show that NETSAQ adapts well in MANET environments where multiple services are contending for limited resources.", "paper_title": "NETSAQ: Network state adaptive QoS provisioning for MANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762400018"}
