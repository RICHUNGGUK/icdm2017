Supervised learning algorithms such as support vector machine are currently the most accurate methods. The position-specific score matrices (PSSMs) contain wealthy information about the evolutionary relationship of proteins. However, the PSSMs often have different lengths, which are difficult to be used by machine-learning methods. In this study, a simple, fast and powerful method is presented for protein remote homology detection, which combines support vector machine with auto-cross covariance transformation. The PSSMs are converted into a series of fixed-length vectors by auto-cross covariance transformation and these vectors are then input to a support vector machine classifier for remote homology detection. The sequence-order effects can be effectively captured by this scheme. Experiments are performed on well-established datasets, and the remote homology is simulated at the superfamily and the fold level, respectively. The results show that the proposed method, referred to as ACCRe, is comparable or even better than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection performance, and its time complexity is superior to those of other profile-based SVM methods. The auto-cross covariance transformation provides a novel way for the usage of evolutionary information, which can be widely used for protein-level studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
