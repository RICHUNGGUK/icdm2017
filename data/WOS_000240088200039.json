A gene's expression level is local conserved if it is expressed with the similar abundance only on a subset of conditions instead of on all the conditions. A subset of genes which are simultaneously local conserved across the same subset of samples form an LC-Cluster, where the samples correspond to some phenotype and the genes suggest all candidates related to the phenotype. Two efficient algorithms, namely FALCONER and E-FALCONER, are proposed to mine the complete set of maximal LC-Clusters. The test results from both real and synthetic datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our approaches.", "paper_title": "Mining maximal local conserved gene clusters from microarray data", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200039"}
