Design/methodology/approach - In the method, elastic beams and their fracture are modelled according to FEM by using nonlinear Timoshenko beam elements and cohesive crack model. Additionally, the beam elements are used to tie the discrete elements together. The contact forces between the colliding beams are calculated by using the DEM. Findings - Three numerical examples are given to verify the method. Further, the method is applied to model the failure process of a floating ice beam against an inclined structure. Based on the comparison of the experiments and the simulation, a good agreement between the results is observed. Originality/value - In the context of combined FEM-DEM, the two, novel features presented in this paper are: the use of Timoshenko finite element beams with damping to calculate internal forces and to combine the discrete elements; and the bending failure by the cohesive crack approach while simultaneously keeping track of the position of the neutral axis of the beam.", "paper_title": "2D combined finite-discrete element method to model multi-fracture of beam structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000269477800002"}
