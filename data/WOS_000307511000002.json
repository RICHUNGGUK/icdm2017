A possible application of these methods to a model of perception is given by considering a psychophysical law as the solution of an Euler-Lagrange equation. A general class of Lagrangians is identified by requiring the measurability of prothetic continua on interval scales. The associated Hamiltonian (the energy of the process) is tentatively connected with neurophysiological aspects. As an example of the suggested approach a particular choice of the Lagrangian, that is a sufficient condition to obtain classical psychophysical laws, while accounting for psychophysical adaptation and the stationarity of neuronal activity, is used to explore a possible relation between a behavioral law and a neuroelectrical ,response based on the Naka-Rushton model.", "paper_title": "A variational approach to behavioral and neuroelectrical laws", "paper_id": "WOS:000307511000002"}
