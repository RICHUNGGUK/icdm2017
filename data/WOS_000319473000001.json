Timing errors are detected using razor flip-flops on critical-paths, and the error-rate feedback is used to control a dynamic voltage scaling control loop. In place of conventional razor error correction by replay, we propose a new approach to bound the magnitude of intermittent timing errors at the circuit level. A timing guard-band is created by shaping the path delay distribution such that the critical paths correspond to a group of least-significant bit registers. These end-points are ensured to be critical by modifying the topology of the final stage carry-merge adder, and by using tool-based device sizing. Hence, timing violations lead to weakly correlated logical errors of small magnitude in a mean-squared-error sense. We examine this approach in an finite-impulse response (FIR) filter and a 2-D discrete cosine transform implementation, in 32-nm CMOS. Power saving compared to a conventional design at iso-frequency is 21%-23% at the typical corner, while retaining a voltage guard-band to protect against fast transient changes in switching activity and supply noise. The impact on minimum clock period is small (16%-20%), as it does not necessitate the use of ripple-carry adders and also requires only a bare minimum of additional design effort.", "paper_title": "Circuit-Level Timing Error Tolerance for Low-Power DSP Filters and Transforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000319473000001"}
