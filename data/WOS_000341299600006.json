In this paper we present a method to improve accuracy and robustness against rotation of GLCM features for image classification. In our approach co-occurrences are computed through digital circles as an alternative to the standard four directions. We use discrete Fourier transform normalisation to convert rotation dependent features into rotation invariant ones. We tested our method on four different datasets of natural and synthetic images. Experimental results show that our approach is more accurate and robust against rotation than the standard GLCM features. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.
