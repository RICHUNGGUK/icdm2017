Without any relevant restriction, the proposed approach was conceived as a potential powerful tool for decision making problems where basic information has been modeled by means of valued binary preference relations. In fact, assuming that each decision maker is able to consistently manage intensity values for preferences is a strong assumption even when there are few alternatives being involved (if the number of alternatives is large, the same criticism applies to crisp preferences). Any representation tool, as the one proposed by the authors, will in principle play a key role in order to help decision makers to understand their preference structure. In this paper we introduce an alternative approach in order to avoid certain complexity issues of the initial proposal, allowing a close representation easier to be obtained in practice.", "paper_title": "AN ALGORITHMIC APPROACH TO PREFERENCE REPRESENTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000269866900002"}
