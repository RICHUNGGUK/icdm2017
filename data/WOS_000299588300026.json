Recently, Huang et al. first constructed an identity-based SDVS scheme (HYWS) in a stronger security model with non-interactive proof of knowledge, which holds the security properties of unforgeability, non-transferability, non-delegatability, and privacy of signer's identity. In this paper, we show that their scheme does not provide the claimed properties. Our analysis indicates that HYWS scheme neither resist on the designated verifier signature forgery nor provide simulation indistinguishability, which violates the security properties of unforgeability, non-delegatability and non-transferability.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis of Strong Designated Verifier Signature Scheme with Non-delegatability and Non-transferability", "paper_id": "WOS:000299588300026"}
