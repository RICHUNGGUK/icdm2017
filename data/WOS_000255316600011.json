However, due to for example limited computation resources, the search for the set of minimal diagnoses is ill some applications focused oil to the smaller set of diagnoses with minimal cardinality. The key contribution in this paper is an algorithm that calculates the diagnoses with minimal cardinality in,I distributed system. The algorithm is constructed Such that the computationally intensive tasks are distributed to the different units in the distributed system, and thereby reduces the need for it powerful central diagnostic unit.
