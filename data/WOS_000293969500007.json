In this paper, we describe an architecture for personalized video adaptation and presentation for mobile applications which is guided by automatically generated annotations. By including this annotation information, more intelligent adaptation techniques can be realized which primarily reduce the quality of unimportant regions in case a bit rate reduction is necessary. Furthermore, a presentation layer is added to enable advanced multimedia viewers to adequately present the interesting parts of a video in case the user wants to zoom in. This architecture is the result of collaborative research done in the EU FP6 IST INTERMEDIA project.", "paper_title": "Annotation based personalized adaptation and presentation of videos for mobile applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000293969500007"}
