We illustrate several applications, review the literature and list some open problems, and present a general model that includes the one-dimensional carousel storage location problem as well as other well-known combinatorial optimization problems as special cases.", "paper_title": "One-Dimensional Carousel Storage Problems: Applications, Review and Generalizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000276169700001"}
