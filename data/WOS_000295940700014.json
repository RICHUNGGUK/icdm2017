We express Delta V as V(eff) - V(int), where V(eff) corresponds to zero free space, V(eff) = molecular mass/density. V(int) is the intrinsic gas phase molecular volume. We demonstrate that V(int) can be appropriately defined as the volume enclosed by the 0.003 au contour of the molecule's electronic density; this produces packing coefficients that have the range and average value found crystallographically. Measured impact sensitivities show an overall tendency to increase as Delta V becomes larger. For nitramines, the dependence upon Delta V is rather weak; we interpret this as indicating that a single overriding factor dominates their initiation mechanism, e.g., N-NO(2) rupture. (An analogous situation appears to hold for many organic azides.) In addition to the conceptual significance of identifying Delta V as a factor in impact sensitivity, the present results allow rough estimates of relative sensitivities that are not known.", "paper_title": "Sensitivity and the available free space per molecule in the unit cell", "paper_id": "WOS:000295940700014"}
