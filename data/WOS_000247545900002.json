Testing these converters with accuracy and at low cost represents a big challenge because the observability and controllability of these blocks is reduced and the test operation requires a lot of time and expensive analogue instruments. A new design-for-test technique called 'analogue network of converters' is presented. This technique aims at testing a set of analogue-to-digital converters and digital-to-analogue converters in a fully digital setup (using a low-cost digital tester). The proposed method relies on a novel processing of the harmonic distortion generated by the converters and requires an extremely simple additional circuitry and interconnects.", "paper_title": "Fully digital test solution for a set of ADCs and DACs embedded in a SIP or SOC", "paper_id": "WOS:000247545900002"}
