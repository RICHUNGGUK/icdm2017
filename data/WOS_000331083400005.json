In particular, we propose a method to employ a user's half-blink information for more efficient interaction. Since the interaction is achieved using a user's gaze and half-blinks, the proposed system can create a more efficient computing environment. In addition, the proposed system can be quite helpful to those who have difficulties in using their hands for conventional interaction methods. The experimental results present the robustness and efficiency of the proposed system.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of an augmented reality system using gaze interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000331083400005"}
