In this paper, we present a stereo based pedestrian detection system by fusing the depth and color data provided by a stereo vision camera on a moving platform. The proposed method uses an adaptive window for region of interest (ROI) generation using dense depth map. The extracted candidates are then applied to a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature descriptor to refine ROIs and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify them into pedestrian and non-pedestrian classes. The system is tested on a stereo based DAS dataset and results show that our system is able to detect pedestrians with different scales and illumination conditions and in presence of partial occlusion.", "paper_title": "Stereo-based region of interest generation for real-time pedestrian detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000348938300001"}
