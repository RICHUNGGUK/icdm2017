Our system draws inspiration from a traditional illustration workflow: The user first sketches rough 'masses' of the object, as ellipses, to define an initial abstract pose that can then be refined with more detailed contours as desired. The system is made robust to partial or inaccurate sketches using a reduced-dimensionality model of pose space learnt from a labelled collection of photos. Throughout the composition process, interactive visual feedback is provided to guide the user. Finally, the user's partial or complete sketch, complemented with appearance requirements, is used to constrain the automatic synthesis of a novel, high-quality, realistic image.", "paper_title": "Interactive Sketch-Driven Image Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000368341800010"}
