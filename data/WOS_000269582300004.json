A potential shortcoming of spectral methods, namely the handling of the complex geometries encountered in global stability analysis, has been dealt with successfully in past works by the development of spectral-element methods on unstructured meshes. The present contribution shows that a certain degree of regularity of the geometry may be exploited in order to build a global stability analysis approach based on a regular spectral rectangular grid in curvilinear coordinates and conformal mappings. The derivation of the stability linear operator in curvilinear coordinates is presented along with the discretisation method. Unlike common practice to the solution of the same problem, the matrix discretising the eigenvalue problem is formed and stored. Subspace iteration and massive parallelisation are used in order to recover a wide window of its leading Ritz system. The method is applied to two external flows, both of which are lifting bodies with separation occurring just downstream of the leading edge. Specifically the flow configurations are a NACA 0015 airfoil, and an ellipse of aspect ratio 8 chosen to closely approximate the geometry of the airfoil. Both flow configurations are at an angle of attack of 18, with a Reynolds number based on the chord length of 200. The results of the stability analysis for both geometries are presented and illustrate analogous features. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
