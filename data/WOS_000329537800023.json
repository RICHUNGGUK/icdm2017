In this paper, a hierarchical representation of contexts for CGRA called HOC is proposed to satisfy the above requirements. In HCC, the contexts are constructed in a hierarchical fashion to thoroughly eliminate the repetitive portions of the contexts, not only reducing the overall contexts storage size, but also alleviating the contexts transportation overhead. The fast context-indexing mechanism is proposed in HOC to achieve high configuration speed, since the hierarchically organized contexts can be located and accessed conveniently. HOC has been verified in a reconfigurable processor called REMUS_HP. Owing to HOC, when implementing H.264 decoding on REMUS_HP, 76.67% of the overall contexts are reduced compared with the traditional non-hierarchical one; and the configuration speed is averagely 23x increased compared with the latest reported optimized configuration mechanism on Virtex-4 FX60. REMUS_HP is implemented on a 48.9 mm(2) silicon with TSMC 65 nm technology. Simulation shows that 1920 x 1088@30 fps could be achieved for H.264 high-profile decoding when exploiting a 200 MHz working frequency. Compared with the high performance version of XPP, the performance is 181% boosted.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical representation of on-chip context to reduce reconfiguration time and implementation area for coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000329537800023"}
