LMI-based delay-independent and -dependent stability conditions are derived to guarantee the system stability using Lyapunov-based technique. It can be seen that some existing stability analysis approaches require high computational demand to solve the solution due to the large number of stability conditions. Consequently, feasible solution may not be obtained with the use of numerical methods due to the limitation of the computer, system especially for complicated fuzzy systems with a large number of rules. In this paper, under a particular system formulation, the number of stability conditions can be reduced to alleviate the computational demand on searching for the solution. Furthermore, the stability conditions offer a larger upper bound of time delay compared with some existing approaches. LMI-based performance conditions are also derived to guarantee the system performance. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the merits of the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "Computational effective stability conditions for time-delay fuzzy systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000255333600008"}
