We describe the process of direct numerical simulation (DNS) used to determine the jet flow properties in the turbulent region, and combine with the Howes Williams and Hawkings method to obtain far field sound at desired locations. Further, the described method is applied to simulate a Reynolds number 2500, Mach number 0.83 jet, while matching conditions are created experimentally inside a low pressure tank. The mean flow results of the DNS are seen to correspond well with our experimental results, and to be compatible with those published in the literature. The far sound field method is shown to match perfectly with the near sound field obtained by DNS, and sound pressure levels and directivity matches those obtained by us experimentally, and compatible with experimental results previously published.
