It follows a backward selection search, but several features are discarded in the same step. The method proposed is compared with two SVM based methods, obtaining a smaller set of features with a similar accuracy.", "paper_title": "Functional networks and analysis of variance for feature selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900123"}
