Organizations must define their own processes to meet the requirements of CMMI. A friendly, unambiguous process modeling language and tool are thus very important for organizations to define, verify, and validate the processes. Nevertheless, hardly has any research yet been done on how to embed CMMI process area goals into process definition stage to satisfy organization process improvement. In this research, we propose a UML-based approach to define, verify, and validate an organization's process. Our approach can also be applied to a process learning environment for students and project members. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
