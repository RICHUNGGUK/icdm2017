Since realistic environments are difficult to simulate, its hard to predict how control algorithms will react to real world conditions such as varied lighting, weather, and obstacles like trees and wires. This paper introduces a methodic approach to developing UAV missions. A scaled down urban environment provides a facility to perform testing and evaluation (T&E) on control algorithms before flight. A UAV platform and test site allow the tuned control algorithms to be verified and validated (V&V) in real world flights. The resulting design methodology reduces risk in the development of UAV missions.", "paper_title": "Testing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Missions in a Scaled Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000264484900017"}
