A network communication channel is assumed to be existing between the plant and the fault detection filter, and three types of incomplete measurements which typically appear in a network environment are simultaneously addressed, including measurement quantisation effect, signal transmission delay and data packet dropout. A mathematical model is presented to account for those issues in a unified form. Based on that, a full-order fault detection filter is designed such that the residual system is asymptotically stable and preserves a guaranteed performance. A sufficient condition of the existence of the fault detection filter is obtained and all the results are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities, which can be readily solved via standard numerical software. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the usefulness of the developed theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Fault detection with network communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000280248000004"}
