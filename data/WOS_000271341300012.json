The PDES tasks or applications are modeled as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), in which the simulation resources consist of three critical factors, simulation hosting machine (SHM), simulation service (SS) and simulation data (SD) in Grid environment. By solving the model we attempt to obtain an optimized triangular matching of the simulation resources on Grid, so that it can support the PDES activities better. We name the algorithm of solving the model Triangular Pyramid Scheduling (TPS). The PDES DAG is divided into three basic graph structures: Sequential structure, Fork structure, and join structure. The TIPS algorithm is developed based on these graph structures. The simulation results show that TPS algorithm can reduce the makespan and congestion, improve the simulation efficiency, and increase the resource utilization efficiency, compared to the existing algorithms.
