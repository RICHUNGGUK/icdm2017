Integrating information system research, particularly the paradigm of task-technology fit and the platform-application dichotomy, and theories from media psychology and human-computer interaction, we theorize the fit between the content applications and the media platform as the key determinant of user evaluation and acceptance of digital media convergence. We empirically tested our theory in the context of mobile video entertainment services. Specifically, we hypothesize that both the duration of the video content (i.e., the characteristic of the content) and the attentional constraint of the mobile media platform (i.e., the characteristic of the media platform) jointly determine users' attentional involvement (i.e., reflecting the fit) in the video content. Such involvement in turn influences users' emotional enjoyment and satisfaction with the mobile video entertainment service. The empirical results support most of our hypotheses. Two key findings are: (1) in the case of media convergence, the attentional constraint of the target media platform significantly influences user experience during content delivery that may lead to the rejection of media convergence; and (2) the duration of the content interacts with both the attentional constraint of the media platform and the type of interruptions from the environment in determining attentional involvement and emotional enjoyment. We discuss the theoretical contributions and practical implications from our empirical findings.", "paper_title": "Will mobile video become the killer application for 3G mobile Internet? a model of media convergence acceptance", "paper_id": "WOS:000278179800008"}
