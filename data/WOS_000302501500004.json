In this scheme, to uniquely identify the local environment and associated processes involving three-dimensional (3D) motion of an atom or atoms, space around a central atom is divided into 3D rectangular boxes. The dimensions and the number of 3D boxes are determined by the accuracy with which a process needs to be identified and a process is described as the central atom moving to a neighboring vacant box accompanied by the motion of any other atom or atoms in its surrounding boxes. As a test of this method to we apply it to examine the decay of 3D Cu islands on the Cu(100) and to the surface diffusion of a Cu monomer and a dimer on Cu(111) and compare the results and computational efficiency to those available in the literature.
