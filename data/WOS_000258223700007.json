While an underdetermined biseptic solution to this problem has appeared previously, we make several advances in this paper Most notably, we cast the problem as a constrained minimization and introduce a novel quadratic energy funtional whose absolute minimum of zero is achieved for bicubic polynomials. This means that for the regular 4-valent case, we reproduce the bicubic B-splines. In other cases, the resulting surfaces are aesthetically well behaved. We extend our constrained minimization frame work to handle the case of input mesh with boundary.", "paper_title": "G(2) tensor product splines over extraordinary vertices", "paper_id": "WOS:000258223700007"}
