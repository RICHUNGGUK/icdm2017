This design methodology consists of simulation, optimization and decision making. Within this work a framework is presented in which modelling, multi-objective optimization and multi criteria decision making techniques are used to design an engineering system. Due to the complexity of the designed system a three-step design process is suggested. In the first step multi-objective optimization using genetic algorithm is used. In the second step a multi attribute decision making process based on linguistic variables is suggested in order to facilitate the designer to express the preferences. In the last step the fine tuning of selected few variants are performed. This methodology is named as progressive design methodology. The method is applied as a case study to design a permanent magnet brushless DC motor drive and the results are compared with experimental values.", "paper_title": "Progressive design methodology for complex engineering systems based on multiobjective genetic algorithms and linguistic decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000263545300002"}
