Unfortunately, traceroute is not free of inaccuracies. In this poster, we present our ongoing work to address the inaccuracy caused by third-party addresses We discuss the impact of third-party addresses on traceroute applications and present a novel active probing technique able to identify such addresses in traceroute traces. Filially, we detail preliminary results suggesting how this phenomenon has been largely underestimated.", "paper_title": "Detecting Third-party Addresses in Traceroute IP Paths", "paper_id": "WOS:000309217600025"}
