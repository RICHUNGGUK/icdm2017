A mixed-integer linear program is proposed to model the problem of finding optimal evacuation routes. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total evacuation time and the number of casualties, simultaneously. A traffic simulation package is used to explicitly incorporate the traffic flow dynamics into our model in order to generate solutions which are consistent with the dynamics of traffic network. Due to the long running time of CPLEX, a Tabu search algorithm is designed that finds evacuation routes for transit vehicles. Computational experiments demonstrate that the solutions found are of high-quality. Numerical experiments are conducted using the transportation network of the city of Forth Worth, TX to illustrate the modeling procedure and solution approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
