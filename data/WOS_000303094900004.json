In this paper, we propose a region-based error concealment method that exploits encoding modes, inter-view and intra-view correlations of stereoscopic video sequences. Based on the statistical analysis of the encoding modes of the surrounding macroblocks (MBs) and of the spatially corresponding MB in the neighboring frame, the lost MBs are classified into three types: (1) smooth MBs, (2) regular motion MBs and (3) irregular motion MBs. Following the classification, corresponding operations, including direct replacement, quarter-pixel motion and disparity compensation, and bilateral error concealment with adjustable weights, are applied to reconstruct the smooth MBs, regular motion MBs and irregular motion MBs, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other existing error concealment methods for stereoscopic video transmission in terms of both objective and subjective evaluations.
