Heterogeneous reasoning is, in its most general form, reasoning that employs representations drawn from multiple representational forms. Of particular importance, and the principal focus of the architecture, is heterogeneous reasoning which employs one or more forms of graphical representation, perhaps in combination with sentences ( of English or another language, whether natural or scientific). Graphical representations include diagrams, pictures, layouts, blueprints, flowcharts, graphs, maps, tables, spreadsheets, animations, video, and 3D models. By `an application that supports heterogeneous reasoning' we mean an application that allows users to construct, record, edit, and replay a process of reasoning using multiple representations so that the structure of the reasoning is maintained and the informational dependencies and justifications of the individual steps of the reasoning can be recorded.", "paper_title": "A computational architecture for heterogeneous reasoning", "paper_id": "WOS:000249393800001"}
