We use the concepts of satisfactoriness as well as multiobjective optimization at the upper level and a measurement function at the lower level, to develop an interactive method for solving such a problem. The final solution of the proposed method is always efficient to the upper level when the lower level achieves satisfaction. It may be more significant in practice since bilevel programming problem is hierarchical, and the upper level decision making is in the dominant position. Finally, an illustrative numerical example is given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.
