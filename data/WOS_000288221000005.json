The main operations that we consider are: reversals which involve inverting the order of a sublist, transpositions which involve interchanging subchains (sublists), and edge-swaps which are a special case and involve interchanging two consecutive edges. When each of the given polygon has also been assigned a direction we say that the polygon is signed. In this case any edge involved in a reversal changes direction. We show that a star-shaped polygon can be convexified using O(n(2)) edge-swaps, while maintaining simplicity and that this is tight in the worst case. We show that determining whether a signed polygon P can be transformed to one that has rotational or mirror symmetry with P, using transpositions can modify a polygon to fit inside a rectangle is weakly NP-complete. Finally we given an O(n log n) time algorithm to compute the maximum endpoint distance for an oriented chain.", "paper_title": "COMPUTING SIGNED PERMUTATIONS OF POLYGONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288221000005"}
