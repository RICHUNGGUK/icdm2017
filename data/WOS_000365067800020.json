The proposed methodology is based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and considers not only the intensity levels, but also the coordinates of voxels inside the so-defined spatial Gaussian functions. The model parameters are obtained according to a maximum likelihood criterion employing the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. First, an averaged control subject image is computed to obtain a threshold-based mask that selects only the voxels inside the skull. Then, the GMM is obtained for the DaTSCAN-SPECT database, performing space quantization by populating it with Gaussian kernels whose linear combination approximates the image intensity. According to a probability threshold that measures the weight of each kernel or \"cluster\" in the striatum area, the voxels in the non-specific region are intensity-normalized by removing clusters whose likelihood is negligible.
