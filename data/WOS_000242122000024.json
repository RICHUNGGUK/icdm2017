Although the rules can be relatively easily generalized to other variable types, the generalization can result in a computationally expensive algorithm generating a prohibitive number of redundant rules of little significance. This danger especially applies to quantitative and ordinal variables. This paper presents and verifies an alternative approach to the quantitative and ordinal association rule mining. In this approach, quantitative or ordinal variables are not immediately transformed into a set of binary variables. Instead, it applies simple arithmetic operations in order to construct the cedents and searches for areas of increased association which are finally decomposed into conjunctions of literals. This scenario outputs rules that do not syntactically differentiate from classical association rules.", "paper_title": "Quantitative and ordinal association rules mining (QAR mining)", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000024"}
