In this paper, a type of fuzzy inverse minimum spanning tree problem is introduced from a LAN reconstruction problem, where the weights of edges are assumed to be fuzzy variables. The concept of fuzzy alpha-minimum spanning tree is initialized, and subsequently a fuzzy a-minimum spanning tree model and a credibility maximization model are presented to formulate the problem according to different decision criteria. In order to solve the two fuzzy models, a fuzzy simulation for computing credibility is designed and then embedded into a genetic algorithm to produce some hybrid intelligent algorithms. Finally, some computational examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Models for inverse minimum spanning tree problem with fuzzy edge weights", "paper_id": "WOS:000343806200047"}
