However, they can also cause microcracks, cavities and other defects forcing fracture. Numerous damage models are reported in the literature to describe the behavior. In this article, a damage model will be developed from different theories and will be used to describe the creep crack growth behavior of Waspaloy at 973 K. Material parameters for this model are adjusted to uniaxial creep and tensile tests. The calculated creep crack growth curves match very well with the experimental ones supporting the model.
