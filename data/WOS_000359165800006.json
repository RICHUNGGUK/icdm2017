Taking into account the unknown structure of the continuous nonlinearity, the Weierstrass approximation theorem is introduced to simplify the nonlinearity. Then a stochastic gradient algorithm and a particle swarm optimization algorithm are proposed to estimate all the unknown parameters of the Hammerstein system. The applicability of the approaches is illustrated by a simulation example. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
