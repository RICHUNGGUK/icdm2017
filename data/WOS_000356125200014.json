The time-varying characteristic of transition probabilities is considered as a polytope description. The saturations occurred in the sensor outputs are handled by a decomposition approach. By constructing a stochastic multiple Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions for the existence of an observer-based controller with nonlinear feedback terms are derived, such that the closed-loop systems are stochastically stable and satisfy a given l(2)-l(infinity) performance index. A linear matrix inequality approach is presented for designing such an observer-based l(2)-l(infinity) controller. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness and potential of the developed theoretical results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
