We show that for linear resource cost functions the price of anarchy is exactly 3+root 5/2 approximate to 2.618 for weighted congestion games and exactly 2.5 for unweighted congestion games. We show that for resource cost functions that are polynomials of degree d the price of anarchy is d(Theta(d)). Our results also hold for mixed strategies. In particular, these results apply to atomic routing games where the traffic demand from a source to a destination must be satisfied by choosing a single path between source and destination.", "paper_title": "THE PRICE OF ROUTING UNSPLITTABLE FLOW", "paper_id": "WOS:000315579100007"}
