Face images of a single-object class are more similar than those of different-object classes. The projection length of a test image vector on the direction of a training image vector can measure the similarity of the two images. But the decision cannot be made by only a training image which is the most similar to the test one, the mean image vector of each class also contributes to the final classification. Thus, the decision of the proposed vector projection classification (VPC) algorithm is ruled in favor of the maximum combination projection length. To address the partial occlusion problem in face recognition, we propose a local vector projection classification (LVPC) algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed VPC and LVPC approaches are efficient and outperform some existing approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
