In order to increase the robustness of the control algorithm, image moments were chosen to be the visual features which describe the objects from the image. A visual predictive architecture is designed to solve tasks addressed to robot manipulators with an eye-in-hand configuration. An implementation of the proposed architecture is done so that the capabilities of a 6 d.o.f robot manipulator are extended. The results of different experiments conducted with two types of image moments based controllers (proportional and predictive with reference trajectory) are presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Predictive control architecture for real-time image moments based servoing of robot manipulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000341501800023"}
