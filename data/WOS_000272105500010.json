Design/methodology/approach - The NNRPIM shape-function construction is briefly presented, as are the dynamic equations and the mode superposition method is used in the forced vibration analysis. Several benchmark examples of two-dimensional and plate bending problems are solved and compared with the three-dimensional NNRPIM formulation. The obtained results are compared with the available exact solutions and the finite element method (FEM) solutions. Findings - The developed NNRPIM approach is a good alternative to the FEM for the solution of dynamic problems, once the obtained results with the EFGM shows a high similarity with the obtained FEM results and for the majority of the studied examples the NNRPIM, results are more close to the exact solution results. Research limitations/implications - Comparing the FEM and the NNRPIM, the computational cost of the NNRPIM is higher. Originality/value - The paper demonstrates extension of the NNRPIM to the dynamic analysis of two-dimensional, three-dimensional and bending plate problems. The elimination of the shear-locking phenomenon in the NNRPIM plate bending formulation. The various solved examples prove a high convergence rate and accuracy of the NNRPIM.", "paper_title": "The natural neighbour radial point interpolation method: dynamic applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000272105500010"}
