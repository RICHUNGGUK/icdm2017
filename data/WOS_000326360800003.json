The present study investigated how speech pause length influences how listeners ascribe emotional states to the speaker. Emotionally neutral Hungarian speech samples were taken, and speech pauses were systematically manipulated to create five variants of all passages. Hungarian and Austrian participants rated the emotionality of these passages by indicating on a 1-6 point scale how angry, sad, disgusted, happy, surprised, scared, positive, and heated the speaker could have been. The data reveal that the length of silent pauses influences listeners in attributing emotional states to the speaker. Our findings argue that pauses play a relevant role in ascribing emotions and that this phenomenon might be partly independent of language. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
