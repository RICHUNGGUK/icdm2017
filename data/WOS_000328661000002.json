This article concerns the following problem: given tau(i), G and G(0), find an upper bound on the degree d of a polynomial solution P(chi), if it exists. In the presented approach the problem is reduced to constructing a univariate polynomial for which d is a root. The authors formulate a sufficient condition under which such a polynomial exists. Using this condition, they give an effective bound on d, for instance, for all difference equations of the form G(P(chi-a), P(chi-a-1), P(chi-a-2)) + G(0)(chi) = 0 with quadratic G. and all difference equations of the form G(P(chi), P(chi-tau)) + G(0)(chi) = 0 with G having an arbitrary degree.
