The HARVEY code successfully addresses key challenges that can hinder effective solution of image-based hemodynamics on contemporary supercomputers, such as limited memory capacity and bandwidth, flexible load balancing, and scalability. This work is the first demonstration of large fluid dynamics simulations of the aortofemoral region of the circulatory system at resolutions as small as 10 mu m.
