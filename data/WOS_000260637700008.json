In this paper, a sequential local least squares imputation (SLLSimpute) method is proposed to solve this problem. It estimates missing values sequentially from the gene containing the fewest missing values and partially utilizes these estimated values. In addition, an automatic parameter selection algorithm, which can generate an appropriate number of neighboring genes for each target gene, is presented for parameter estimation. Experimental results confirmed that SLLSimpute method exhibited better estimation ability compared with other currently used imputation methods. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
