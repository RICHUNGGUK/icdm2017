The problem considered here is single-class routing to one/multiple sinks with lifetime maximization as the objective. The formulation to correct the routing paths is not heuristic and takes its theoretical basis from a macroscopic model, that is, based on a set of partial differential equations iteratively solved by the Gauss-Seidel method. We then theoretically investigate the convergence of GSC. Furthermore, an initial value estimation algorithm is presented to alleviate the long-path problem during the delivery of the first several packets, thus accelerating the convergence of GSC. Simulation results show that GSC effectively achieves load balancing, particularly for regions of interest with holes.", "paper_title": "Gauss-Seidel Correction Algorithm: A Macroscopic Model-Derived Routing Algorithm for WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000329134500009"}
