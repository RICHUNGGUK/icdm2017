Adaptation is urgent at decadal (\"near-term\") horizons, when projections of stressors and vulnerability are typically more reliable but climate internal variability may preclude actionable insights. A case study of at-risk power production suggests that informed decisions are still possible.", "paper_title": "Climate Adaptation Informatics: Water Stress on Power Production", "paper_id": "WOS:000364229600009"}
