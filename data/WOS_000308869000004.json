With regard to data mining, it has been applied to legal databases, as well as to law enforcement. We survey forensic applications of data mining to fraud and otherwise to crime intelligence or investigation. Traditionally a field separate from AI and Law, the two are now coming together. Success has been achieved especially in unravelling networks and in detecting fraud.", "paper_title": "AN OVERVIEW OF DATA MINING FOR COMBATING CRIME", "paper_id": "WOS:000308869000004"}
