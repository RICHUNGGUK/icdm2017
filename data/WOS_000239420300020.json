One of the key factors in this kind of application is represented by the ability to rapidly deliver game events among the various players over the network. Employing in this context Mirrored Game Server architectures and adapting RED (Random Early Detection) techniques borrowed from network queuing management, we are able to show sensible benefits in upholding interactivity and scalability, whilst preserving game state consistency and game evolution fluency at the player's side.", "paper_title": "Interactivity-loss avoidance in event delivery synchronization for mirrored game architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000239420300020"}
