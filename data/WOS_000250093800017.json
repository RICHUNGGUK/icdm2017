The Grobner base is a powerful tool based on ideal theory. Using the Grobner base, we can obtain the solutions of the HB equation. However, its computation is very time-consuming when the equation has equivalent different solutions based on symmetries of the system. We show that invariants enable to transpose the equivalent different solutions to a unique solution. The bifurcation diagram of the invariant is simpler than the original bifurcation diagram, and its computation is considerably decreased. Further, we can obtain the relation among the amplitudes of each frequency component using the invariants. We propose a method for finding the circuit parameters using the amplitude relation.", "paper_title": "Efficient applications of invariants to harmonic balance equation using Grobner base", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093800017"}
