Firstly, the T-S model-based fuzzy systems are approximated by T-S fuzzy model-based discrete systems with parameter uncertainties. Then a sufficient condition on the existence of a sampled-data fuzzy controller for the fuzzy systems is formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities which are proposed in some symmetrical form. So the proposed fuzzy control design approach will be less conservative. And some problems in the existing literature can be solved. Finally, a simulation example is discussed to show the effectiveness of the obtained fuzzy control design approach in this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
