It is based on Negative Selection, which was originally designed for anomaly detection and dichotomic classification. In our earlier work we described M-NSA algorithm that can be applied in multi-class classification problems. Trying to improve classification accuracy of M-NSA we propose a new version of this algorithm, called MINSA, where refinement of receptors set is applied. The accuracy of MINSA was tested in an experimental way with the use of benchmark data sets. The experiments confirmed that direction of changes introduced in MINSA improves its accuracy in comparison to M-NSA. Comparison with other methods of classification is also shown in the paper.
