The low-rank textures capture geometrically meaningful structures in an image, which encompass conventional local features such as edges and corners as well as many kinds of regular, symmetric patterns ubiquitous in urban environments and man-made objects. Our approach to finding these low-rank textures leverages the recent breakthroughs in convex optimization that enable robust recovery of a high-dimensional low-rank matrix despite gross sparse errors. In the case of planar regions with significant affine or projective deformation, our method can accurately recover both the intrinsic low-rank texture and the unknown transformation, and hence both the geometry and appearance of the associated planar region in 3D. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that this new technique works effectively for many regular and near-regular patterns or objects that are approximately low-rank, such as symmetrical patterns, building facades, printed text, and human faces.", "paper_title": "TILT: Transform Invariant Low-Rank Textures", "paper_id": "WOS:000303525200001"}
