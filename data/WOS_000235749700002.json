A reliable and practical docking method for investigation of AChE ligands was established by the comparison of two widely used docking programs, FlexX and GOLD. In our hands, we had more luck using GOLD than FlexX in reproducing the experimental poses of known ligands (RMSD < 1.5 angstrom). GOLD fitness values of known ligands were also in good agreement with their activities. In the present GOLD docking protocol, (-)-MEP seemed to bind with the enzyme catalytic site in an open-gate conformation through strong hydrophobic interactions and a hydrogen bond. Virtual screening of a potential candidate compound library suggested that the most promising 15 bis-MEP derivatives on the list were mainly derived from (-)-MEP with conformations of (S,S) and (SR,RS) and with a 2- to 7-carbon linkage. Although there are still no biological results to confirm the predictive power of this method, the current study could provide an alternate tool for structural optimization of (-)-MEP as new AChE inhibitors.", "paper_title": "Investigation of the binding mode of (-)-meptazinol and bis-meptazinol derivatives on acetylcholinesterase using a molecular docking method", "paper_id": "WOS:000235749700002"}
