It uses OptQuest, a commercial implementation of scatter search developed by OptTek Systems, Inc., to provide starting points for any gradient-based local solver for nonlinear programming (NLP) problems. This solver seeks a local solution from a subset of these points, holding discrete variables fixed. The procedure is motivated by our desire to combine the superior accuracy and feasibility-seeking behavior of gradient-based local NLP solvers with the global optimization abilities of OptQuest. Computational results include 155 smooth NLP and mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP) problems due to Floudas et al. (1999), most with both linear and nonlinear constraints, coded in the GAMS modeling language. Some are quite large for global optimization, with over 100 variables and 100 constraints. Global solutions to almost all problems are found in a small number of local solver calls, often one or two.", "paper_title": "Scatter search and local NLP solvers: A multistart framework for global optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000248990800003"}
