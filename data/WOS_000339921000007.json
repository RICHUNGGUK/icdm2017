This notion has more natural properties than the usual relativization. For instance, van Lambalgen's theorem holds for uniform Kurtz randomness but not for (the usual relativization of) Kurtz randomness. Another advantage is that lowness for uniform Kurtz randomness has many characterizations, such as those via complexity, martingales, Kurtz tt-traceability and Kurtz dimensional measure.", "paper_title": "Uniform Kurtz randomness", "paper_id": "WOS:000339921000007"}
