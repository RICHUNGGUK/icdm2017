This structure is developed with the aim of capturing some types of independencies that cannot be represented with previous structures. This capability leads to improvements in memory space and computation time during inference. This paper describes a learning algorithm for building RPTs from probability distributions. The experimental analysis shows the proper behavior of the algorithm: it produces RPTs encoding good approximations of the original probability distributions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
