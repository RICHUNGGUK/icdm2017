Images are particularly good subjects for massive parallel implementations on GPU. Thus, the processing time can be improved for computer vision and image/video processing algorithms. However, GPGPU has a fairly complex integration process in a framework and they evolve very rapidly. In this paper, we present a framework that provides all the desired primitives related to GPGPU-based image processing algorithms, which makes it easy and straightforward for the user to exploit. The proposed framework is object-oriented, and it utilizes design patterns. The user can benefit from all the advantages of object-oriented programming, such as code reusability/extensibility, flexibility, information hiding, and complexity hiding. This makes it possible to rapidly integrate new technologies and functionality as they appear.", "paper_title": "Object oriented framework for real-time image processing on GPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000337156500044"}
