This project focuses on application-specific middleware components to \"gridenable\" large-scale nanoscience and chemistry applications, including those that require the coupling of multiple applications. Many of the mechanisms the authors describe are application-area agnostic and can be applied to other disciplines, such as weather and climate simulations, multiresolution simulation in life sciences, and other complex systems.", "paper_title": "Coupled-Simulation e-Science Support in the NAREGI Grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000260722700012"}
