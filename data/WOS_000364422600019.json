However, its source separation performance degrades when one signal can also be described well with the bases for the interfering source signals. In this paper, we propose a discriminative NMF (DNMF) algorithm which exploits the reconstruction error for the interfering signals as well as the target signal based on target bases. The objective function for training the bases is constructed so as to yield high reconstruction error for the interfering source signals while guaranteeing low reconstruction error for the target source signals. Experiments show that the proposed method outperformed the standard NMF and another DNMF method in terms of both the perceptual evaluation of speech quality score and signal-to-distortion ratio in various noisy environments.", "paper_title": "Target Source Separation Based on Discriminative Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Incorporating Cross-Reconstruction Error", "paper_id": "WOS:000364422600019"}
