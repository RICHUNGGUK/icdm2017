This library implements a minimal, openly-documented protocol meant to replace and improve on existing schemes for connecting digital musical instruments and other interactive systems, bringing clarified, strong semantics to system messaging and description. We use automated discovery and message translation instead of imposed system-representation standards to approach \"plug-and-play\" usability without sacrificing design flexibility. System modularity is encouraged, and data are transported between peers without centralized servers.", "paper_title": "Distributed tools for interactive design of heterogeneous signal networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000358214100015"}
