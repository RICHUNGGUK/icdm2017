In that paper the watermark information is embedded in the phase of the DFT coefficients. But this kind of PSK based watermarking scheme is very vulnerable to the phase perturbation attack, when some noise is added on the phase of the DFT coefficients, the watermark can't be correctly extracted anymore, while the quality degradation of the attacked watermarked image is visually acceptable.", "paper_title": "Attacking phase shift keying based watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000243703300037"}
