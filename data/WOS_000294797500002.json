The objective of this method is to obtain a good quality image of the full-scale concentration distribution of solid/gas flow. A new image reconstruction algorithm fused the dual modality images is developed and evaluated.", "paper_title": "IMAGE FUSION OF DUAL-MODAL TOMOGRAPHY (ELECTRICAL CAPACITANCE AND OPTICAL) FOR SOLID/GAS FLOW", "paper_id": "WOS:000294797500002"}
