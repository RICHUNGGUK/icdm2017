The sliding surfaces for the T-S fuzzy system are proposed by using a Lyapunov function and a fuzzy Lyapunov function, respectively. And we design the variable structure controllers such that the global T-S fuzzy system confined on the sliding surfaces is asymptotically stable. Two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. (C 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
