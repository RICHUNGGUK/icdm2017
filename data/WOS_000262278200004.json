Existing studies provide different approaches to the multi-criteria Grid workflow scheduling problem, and address different variants of the problem. A profound understanding of the problem's nature can be an important step towards more generic scheduling approaches. Based on the related work and on our own experience, we propose several novel taxonomies of the problem, considering five facets: workflow model, scheduling criteria, scheduling process, resource model, and task model. We make a survey of the existing related work, and classify it according to the proposed taxonomies, identifying the most common use cases and the areas that have not been sufficiently explored yet.
