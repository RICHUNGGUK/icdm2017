Creativity is regarded as one important source adding supplemental value to the consumer's overall product experience. It also plays a pivotal role in achieving the synergy between both instrumental and hedonic qualities via a comprehensive ergonomic design process, which is superior to what is achieved via the traditional ergonomic design process only considering functionality and usability. This article focuses on website creativity, as compared to previous studies that have mainly dealt with issues regarding traditional hardware product creativity. The authors review relevant literature on creativity, product creativity, website development, consumer behaviour, and measurement tools for creativity, and appraise the salient differences between traditional hardware products and websites. The overall conclusion drawn from the review and appraisal is that web technology has potentially more creativity components and opportunities than do traditional hardware products. By addressing both pragmatic and hedonic design requirements, a creative website should become more attractive, appealing, and thus promote positive user experience and be more commercially competitive.", "paper_title": "User-based assessment of website creativity: a review and appraisal", "paper_id": "WOS:000302789400006"}
