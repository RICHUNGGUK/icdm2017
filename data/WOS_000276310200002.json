These may be expressed in terms of infinite, but row-finite, matrices, which may also be considered as endomorphisms of C[x]. This leads us to consider endomorphisms in more general spaces, and these in turn may be expressed in terms of generalizations of the ladder-operators familiar in physics.", "paper_title": "Ladder Operators and Endomorphisms in Combinatorial Physics", "paper_id": "WOS:000276310200002"}
