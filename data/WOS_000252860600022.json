In order to allow the treatment of irregularly shaped geometries, the discontinuous Galerkin method is formulated on unstructured tetrahedral meshes. The domain decomposition strategy takes the form of a Schwarz-type algorithm where a continuity condition on the incoming characteristic variables is imposed at the interfaces between neighboring subdomains. A multifrontal sparse direct solver is used at the subdomain level. The resulting domain decomposition strategy can be viewed as a hybrid iterative/direct solution method for the large, sparse and complex coefficients algebraic system resulting from the discretization of the time-harmonic Maxwell equations by a discontinuous Galerkin method.
