In comparison with conventional coherent receiving method, the trigger receiving algorithm needs neither local template nor correlation operation, thus both circuit complexity and power consumption are drastically reduced. Based on the proposed algorithm, a fully integrated transceiver was implemented in a 0.18 mu m CMOS process. It occupies an area of 0.44 mm(2) and achieves a maximum chip rate of 40 Mbps with 7mW energy consumption provided by a 1.8V power supply.", "paper_title": "A LOW-POWER UWB TRANSCEIVER BY USE OF TRIGGER RECEIVING METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000283497100015"}
