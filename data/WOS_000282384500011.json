To this effect, an algorithm has been devised to identify the distant repeats in a pair of protein sequences by essentially using the scores of PAM (Percent Accepted Mutation) matrices. The proposed algorithm will be of much use to researchers involved in the comparative study of various organisms based on the amino-acid repeats in protein sequences. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
