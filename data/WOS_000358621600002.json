We here present an interpolation rule and an iterative algorithm for the reconstruction of images from these graphs. This is especially important if graphs have been manipulated for information processing. One such manipulation is averaging the graphs of a single syndrome, another one building a composite face from the features of various individuals. In reconstructions of averaged graphs of genetic syndromes, the patients' identities are suppressed, while the properties of the syndromes are emphasized. These reconstructions from average graphs have a much better quality than averaged images.", "paper_title": "Reconstruction of images from Gabor graphs with applications in facial image processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000358621600002"}
