Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) allows physicians to detect early stages of the disease, and functional brain images have been proved to be very useful in this task. This paper presents a new CAD system that consists of three stages: voxel selection, feature extraction and classification. Voxels are selected in terms of their significance, by using Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon U-Test. Then, Factor Analysis is proposed to carry out the feature reduction step, by extracting common factors and factor loadings from the selected voxels. Finally, a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained to perform clustering of the input images. Two different databases are considered for testing the proposed methods: the first one, consists of 96 Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images from the \"Virgen de las Nieves\" Hospital in Granada, Spain, and a 196 Positron Emission Tomography (PET) database from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The proposed method achieves accuracy results of up to 93.7% and 92.9% for SPECT and PET images respectively, and reports benefits over recently reported methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
