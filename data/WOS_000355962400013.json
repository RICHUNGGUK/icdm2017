To display images without unwanted artifacts, a Retinex-based tone mapping method is proposed in this paper. We present the weighted edge-preserving smooth filter to estimate a smoother illumination, and a mixed tone mapping function is employed to adjust the illumination component to obtain a more pleasing image. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher contrast and richer details as compared with previous mapping methods.", "paper_title": "A Weighted Edge-Preserving Smooth Filter for High Dynamic Range Image Display", "paper_id": "WOS:000355962400013"}
