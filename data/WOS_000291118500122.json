The two integrated methods are the local fisher discriminant analysis (LFDA) and the supporting vector machine (SVM), respectively. In the proposed LFDA_SVM, the LFDA is employed as a feature extraction tool for dimensionality reduction in order to further improve the diagnostic accuracy of the standard SVM algorithm. The effectiveness of the LFDA_SVM has been rigorously evaluated against the hepatitis dataset, a benchmark dataset, from UCI Machine Learning Database in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity respectively. In addition, the proposed LFDA_SVM has been compared with three existing methods including the SVM based on principle component analysis (PCA_SVM), the SVM based on fisher discriminant analysis (FDA_SVM) and the standard SVM in terms of their classification accuracy. Experimental results have demonstrated that the LFDA_SVM greatly outperforms other three methods. The best classification accuracy (96.77%) obtained by the LFDA_SVM is much higher than that of the compared ones. Promisingly, the proposed LFDA_SVM might serve as a new candidate of powerful methods for diagnosing hepatitis with excellent performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
