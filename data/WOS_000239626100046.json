Software agents are one of the building blocks of ambient intelligence and pervasive computing. In this paper, we use a structured overlay network as the decentralized service repository system for improved efficiency. We present an agent-based services composition framework for ubiquitous media, through a combination of the respective merits of agent and service-oriented to enables dynamic and efficient delivery of media composite services. We advocate that a service-centric context promotes media applications that allow service adaptability, deal with service availability, and support on-the-fly service composition. Finally, we present an example of our system in the context of streaming video playback involving a series of transcoding services and a mobile client.", "paper_title": "Agent-based services composition framework for ubiquitous media", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100046"}
