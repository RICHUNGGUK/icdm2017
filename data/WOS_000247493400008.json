This approach embeds messages in the LSB plane of the carrier image randomly via a chaotic system, then makes a dynamic compensation on the stego-image. Even when the embedding ratio is near 100%, such dynamic compensation can lead SPA steganalysis to an incorrect judgment review because of getting a very small estimate value close to 0. Moreover, the initial value of the chaotic system and the selection parameters of the compensation can be used to improve the security of steganography approach. Experimental results show that this method can also resist some others steganalysis methods, such as RS analysis, DIH method, and various improved versions of SPA and RS steganalysis.", "paper_title": "A LSB steganography approach against pixels sample pairs steganalysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000247493400008"}
