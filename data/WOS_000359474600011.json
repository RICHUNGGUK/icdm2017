In the proposed scheme, a sequence of the closed caption text and that of the ASR hypothesis by the baseline system are aligned. Then, a set of dedicated classifiers is designed and trained to select the correct one among them or reject both. It is demonstrated that the classifiers can effectively filter the usable data for acoustic model training. The scheme realizes automatic training of the acoustic model with an increased amount of data. A significant improvement in the ASR accuracy is achieved from the baseline system and also in comparison with the conventional method of lightly supervised training based on simple matching.", "paper_title": "Automatic Lecture Transcription Based on Discriminative Data Selection for Lightly Supervised Acoustic Model Training", "paper_id": "WOS:000359474600011"}
