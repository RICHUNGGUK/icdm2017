Yet companies hesitate to use p2p algorithms to build new applications. Due to the decentralized nature of such a p2p system the carrier does not know anything about the current size, performance, and stability of its application. In this paper, we present an entirely distributed and scalable algorithm to monitor a running p2p network. The snapshot of the system enables a telecommunication carrier to gather information about the current performance parameters of the running system as well as to react to discovered errors.
