To obtain security in these sorts of networks, it is crucial to enable message encryption and authentication features among sensor nodes. This thing could be performed using keys agreed upon by communicating nodes. Nonetheless, acquiring such key agreement in distributed sensor networks becomes extremely intricate due to resource constraints. Up to now, there are many key agreement schemes proposed wired and wireless networks of which key predistribution schemes are considered to be the fittest solutions. Based on this observation, in this paper, we propose a key predistribution scheme relying on sensor nodes' unique identifiers. Our scheme exhibits several noteworthy properties: direct pairwise key establishment permission with explicit key authentication, high resiliency against information-theoretic security attack (node capture attack). We also present a detailed security and performance analysis of our scheme in terms of node capture attack, memory usage, communication overhead, and computational overhead.", "paper_title": "An efficient ID-based bilinear key predistribution scheme for distributed sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241591300027"}
