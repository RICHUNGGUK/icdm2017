The surrounding porous medium of the pile is described by Biot's poro-elastic theory, while the pile embedded in the porous medium is treated as a beam and described by a beam vibration theory. Using the Hankel transformation method, the fundamental solution for a half-space porous medium subjected to a horizontal circular patch load is established. According to the fictitious pile methodology, the second kind of Fredholm integral equation for the pile is established in terms of the obtained fundamental solution and free wave field. The solution of the integral equation yields the dynamic response of the pile to plane SH waves. Numerical results indicate that the parameters of the porous medium, the pile and incident waves have considerable influences on the dynamic response of the pile and the porous medium.
