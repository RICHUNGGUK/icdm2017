The core of this new combination model is based on a consensus (cost) function derived from the recent information Theory based variation of information criterion, proposed by Meila, and allowing to quantify the amount of information that is lost or gained in changing from one clustering to another. In this case, the resulting consensus energy-based segmentation fusion model can be efficiently optimized by exploiting an iterative steepest local energy descent strategy combined with a connectivity constraint. This new framework of segmentation combination, relying on the fusion of inaccurate, quickly and roughly calculated, spatial clustering results, emerges as an appealing alternative to the use of complex segmentation models existing nowadays. Experiments on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset show that the proposed fusion framework compares favorably to previous techniques in terms of reliability scores. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
