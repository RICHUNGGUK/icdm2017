Recent studies of Langmuir (free) evaporation of GaAs(001) have been reviewed. Running Ga droplets are observed, and the motion is predicted and shown to slow and stop near a characteristic temperature. Striking bursts of \"daughter\" droplet nucleation accompany the coalescence of large \"parent\" droplets. These observations imply that evaporation and surface morphology are intimately connected, suggesting a new approach for the self-assembly and positioning of nanostructures on patterned surfaces.", "paper_title": "Ga droplet surface dynamics during Langmuir evaporation of GaAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000301500600003"}
