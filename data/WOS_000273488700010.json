The systems under consideration are described by functional differential equations, with norm bounded time varying nonlinear uncertainties in the \"state\" and norm bounded time varying quasi-linear uncertainties in the delayed \"state\" and in the difference operator. The stability analysis is performed via the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach. Sufficient delay dependent conditions for robust stability are given in terms of the existence of positive definite solutions of LMIs.", "paper_title": "ON DELAY-DEPENDENT ROBUST STABILITY UNDER MODEL TRANSFORMATION OF SOME NEUTRAL SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000273488700010"}
