The CSIT mismatch is modeled as Gaussian random variables, whose variances decay as a power of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A special focus is placed on the large-SNR decay of the error and outage probabilities when power control with long-term power constraints is used. Without explicitly characterizing the corresponding power allocation algorithms, we derive the outage exponent as a function of the system parameters, including the CSIT noise variance exponent and the exponent of the peak power constraint. It is shown that CSIT, even if noisy, is always beneficial and leads to important gains in terms of exponents.", "paper_title": "Coded Modulation With Mismatched CSIT Over MIMO Block-Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000283449000017"}
