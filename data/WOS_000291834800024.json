We show that the characteristic functions of the edge-weighted Voronoi regions are the minimizers (may not unique) of the proposed energy at each iteration. We propose a narrow banding algorithm to accelerate the implementation, which makes the proposed method very fast. We generalize the CVT segmentation to hand intensity inhomogeneous and texture segmentation by incorporating the global and local image information into the energy functional. Compared with other approaches such as level set method, the experimental results in this paper have shown that our approach greatly improves the calculation efficiency without losing segmentation accuracy.
