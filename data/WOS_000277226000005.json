In this paper, we benefit from this property in modeling delta reasoning. Indeed p-adics give a possibility to extract significant information, in particular significant delta-changes and furthermore, to preserve this hierarchical structure in the process of performing various operations on the data. Hence, we can create p-adic neural networks operating on hierarchical strings of information. In this paper, an algorithm of random learning of p-adic neural networks is applied to the problem of detection of changes in streams of video information such as shot boundaries.", "paper_title": "Significance Delta Reasoning with p-Adic Neural Networks: Application to Shot Change Detection in Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000277226000005"}
