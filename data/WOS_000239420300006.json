However, due to the limitation of mobile devices, there is a need to develop new technologies to facilitate the browsing of large pictures on the small screen. In this paper, we propose a set of novel approaches which are able to aid or automate common image browsing tasks on mobile devices. All of these approaches are based on an image attention model which is employed to illustrate the information structure within an image. An efficient algorithm to generate the optimal browsing path based on the information foraging theory is presented. Experimental evaluations of the proposed mechanism indicate that our approach is an effective way for viewing large images on small displays.", "paper_title": "Browsing large pictures under limited display sizes", "paper_id": "WOS:000239420300006"}
