This work also provides an evaluation based on simulations of LFR and Diffuse Update ALgorithm (DUAL), one of the most popular loop-free distance-vector algorithms, which is part of CISCO's widely used Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP). The simulations are performed on dynamic scenarios based on both real-world and controlled instances. The simulations show that LFR is always the best choice in terms of memory requirements, while in terms of messages sent LFR outperforms DUAL on real-world networks, whereas DUAL is the best choice on controlled scenarios.
