At the same time, the acutely restricted and cost-sensitive nature of RFID tags rules out simple reuse of traditional security/privacy solutions and calls for a new generation of extremely lightweight identification and authentication protocols. This article describes a universally composable security framework designed especially for RFID applications. We adopt RFID-specific setup, communication, and concurrency assumptions in a model that guarantees strong security, privacy, and availability properties. In particular, the framework supports modular deployment, which is most appropriate for ubiquitous applications. We also describe a set of simple, efficient, secure, and anonymous (untraceable) RFID identification and authentication protocols that instantiate the proposed framework. These protocols involve minimal interaction between tags and readers and place only a small computational load on the tag, and a light computational burden on the back-end server. We show that our protocols are provably secure within the proposed framework.", "paper_title": "Universally Composable RFID Identification and Authentication Protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000266818800002"}
