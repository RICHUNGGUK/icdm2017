Severe problems such as I/O contentions in those large-scale platforms pose an unprecedented challenge. Prior studies primarily considered I/O bandwidth as a major performance bottleneck. However, our work reveals that in many cases the fundamental cause of I/O contentions is the inefficiency of OS schedulers. Particularly, the modern system is not aware of this fact and thus suffers from poor I/O performance, especially for datacenter servers. Based on our findings, we propose a new software-based scheduling approach, WiseThrottling, to reduce I/O contention. WiseThrottling performs asynchronous and self-adjustment scheduling for concurrent tasks. We evaluate our approach across a wide range of C/OpenMP/MapReduce workloads on a 64-core server in Dawning Cluster datacenter. The experimental results exhibit that WiseThrottling is effective for reducing the I/O bottleneck and it can improve the overall system performance by up to 207 %.", "paper_title": "WiseThrottling: a new asynchronous task scheduler for mitigating I/O bottleneck in large-scale datacenter servers", "paper_id": "WOS:000358668000014"}
