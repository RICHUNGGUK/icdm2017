Unlike the uniform white screen for the conventional projection display, the surround surfaces are usually colored with the random patterns. Herewith, the existed display technologies always failed on these surfaces due to the disability of the color reproduction. In order that the projection display can also obtain an expected rendering even on the patterned surfaces, a novel color reproduction framework was developed in this paper. This framework was focused on the achievement of the calorimetric color reproduction of the input image and composed of three processes: at first, the colorimetric characterization was accomplished to define the characterization color space and describe the workflow of the color reproduction based on the configuration of the projector-camera system. Then, the reproduction objective was tailored according to the original color of the input image and the reflectance of the surface. Finally, the desired input image was predicted and projected onto the surface to reconstruct the objective image. Several ISO images and printed screens were used to validate the performance of the developed framework. The experimental results demonstrated that the expected objectives could be properly achieved on various projection surfaces for different test images.
