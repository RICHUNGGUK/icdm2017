A number of new issues arise in this setting that are not present in the usual settings of group key establishment where unique user identities are assumed to be publicly available. After detailing the security model, we give a two-round solution in the random oracle model. As main technical tool we introduce a notion of attribute-based signcryption, which may be of independent interest. We show that the type of signcryption needed can be realized through the encrypt-then-sign paradigm. Further, we discuss additional guarantees of the proposed protocol, that can be interpreted in terms of deniability and privacy.", "paper_title": "ATTRIBUTE-BASED GROUP KEY ESTABLISHMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000280383000006"}
