Our approach is based on the calculation of \"energy\" per direction of the image, thus obtaining the \"energy spectrum on slope\" (theta). This exhibits local maxima at the points where theta equals the slopes of linear or quasi-linear segments within the image, yet it is not affected by their position within it. The process thus outlined has certain advantages as regards its efficiency of linear structure detection, compared to the Radon and Hough transforms. It was motivated by the study of astrophysical images (solar dynamic radio spectra) which necessitated the introduction of a method for fast extraction of \"drifting structures\", since they appear as linear or quasi-linear segments on these spectra.
