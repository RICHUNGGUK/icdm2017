In this context, robustness is quantified in terms of the likelihood of intraoperative collisions and of joint limit violations. The proposed approach provides a more accurate and complete formulation than existing deterministic approaches in addressing uncertainty at the task level. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the dexterity of robotic arms can be quantified as a cross-entropy term. The resulting planning problem is rendered as a chance-constrained entropy maximization problem seeking a plan with the least susceptibility toward uncertainty at the task level, while maximizing the dexterity ( cross-entropy term). By such treatment of uncertainty at the task level, spatial uncertainty pertaining to mismatches between the patient-specific anatomical model and that of the actual intraoperative situation is also indirectly addressed. As a solution method, the unscented transform is adopted to efficiently transform the resulting chance-constrained entropy maximization problem into a constrained nonlinear program without resorting to computationally expensive particle-based methods.", "paper_title": "A Chance-Constrained Programming Approach to Preoperative Planning of Robotic Cardiac Surgery Under Task-Level Uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000351091200024"}
