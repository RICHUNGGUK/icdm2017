In 1980 Katchalski and Lewis showed that there exists a constant k, independent of F, such that if each three members of F are met by a line, then a \"large\" subfamily G subset of F, with |F\\G| <= k, is met by a line. In this paper we obtain a higher-dimensional analogue containing the Katchalski-Lewis result. Also we give two constructions of families of pairwise disjoint translates of the unit ball in R-3 which answer some related questions.", "paper_title": "The Katchalski-Lewis transversal problem in R-n", "paper_id": "WOS:000244888300002"}
