Large & J.F. Kolen. 1994. Resonance and the perception of musical meter. Connection Science, 6, 177--208) suggests that the perception of rhythm arises as a result of auditory neural populations responding to the structure of the incoming auditory stimulus. Here, we examine the extent to which the responses of a computational model of neural resonance relate to the range of tapping behaviours associated with human polyrhythm perception. The principal findings of the tests suggest that: (a) the model is able to mirror all the different modes of human tapping behaviour, for reasonably justified settings and (b) the non-linear resonance feature of the model has clear advantages over linear oscillator models in addressing human tapping behaviours related to polyrhythm perception.", "paper_title": "Testing a Computational Model of Rhythm Perception Using Polyrhythmic Stimuli", "paper_id": "WOS:000317241800004"}
