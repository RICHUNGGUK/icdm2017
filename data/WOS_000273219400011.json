The SLN is constructed from the given suspicious webpage and its associated webpages. Since reasoning of the SLN can discover implicit relations among webpages, the true association relations between a phishing webpage and its target are acquired via reasoning. Afterwards, by analysis of the relations. the suspicious webpage can be identified as phishing or not based on the predefined rules, and its target can be discovered if it is phishing. Our test dataset consists of 1000 phishing pages selected from PhishTank, and 1000 legitimate webpages. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields a false negative rate of 16.6% on the phishing pages and a false positive rate of 13.8% on the legitimate pages. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
