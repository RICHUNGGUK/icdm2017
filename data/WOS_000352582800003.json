However, the isolation and identification of many of the multiple chemical structures of all APs is a very challenging task because of their similar physicochemical properties. In this work, the co-elution of the isomers present in technical mixtures and using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to quadrupole mass spectrometry was resolved using multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares algorithm. The mass spectrum of each resolved compound was compared with the theoretical mass spectrum obtained from the literature, in order to assign the appropriate identification of each isomer. Two commercial mixtures were studied; in one of them, 34 compounds were resolved, and in the second mixture, 40 compounds were resolved. The relative abundances of the compounds were also calculated in both mixtures. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. In this work, the co-elution of the alkylphenol isomers using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to quadrupole mass spectrometry (GCxGC-qMS) was resolved in two commercial mixtures using Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) algorithm. 34 and 40 compounds were resolved. The relative abundances of the compounds were also calculated in both mixtures. This approach provides a tool to resolve and identify many complex mixtures and may enable the estimation of ecotoxicological features of emerging pollutants when mass spectrum is available.", "paper_title": "Resolution and identification of co-eluting alkylphenols in comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry by multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares", "paper_id": "WOS:000352582800003"}
