Bilevel decision making may involve uncertain parameters which appear either in the objective functions or constraints of the leader or the follower or both. Furthermore, the leader and the follower may have multiple conflict decision objectives that should be optimized simultaneously. This study proposes an approximation Kth-best approach to solve the fuzzy multi-objective bilevel problem. Two case based examples further illustrate how to use the approach to solve industrial decision problems.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy multi-objective bilevel decision making by an approximation Kth-best approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000256265400002"}
