However, in order to realize commercial advertising over VANET, proper incentives and security mechanisms must be taken into consideration due to the existence of selfish and/or malicious users in the real-world scenario. In this paper, we propose a secure incentive scheme for VANET advertising systems based on one-way hash chains. We also analyze the advertisement propagation behavior in our VANET advertising system using a mathematical model.", "paper_title": "Securing one-way hash chain based incentive mechanism for vehicular ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000339877700034"}
