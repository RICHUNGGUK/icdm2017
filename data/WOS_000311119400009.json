The aim is to find optimal prices for each journey for each level of unsold seats by using probabilistic dynamic programming. Conjoint analysis is used to identify the consumer behavior in case of price changes to the current product, namely journey. The optimal policies show the necessity of applying dynamic pricing policy instead of fixed pricing and the diversification of optimal policies under different conditions.", "paper_title": "A Dynamic Pricing Model for a Maritime Transportation Service Provider", "paper_id": "WOS:000311119400009"}
