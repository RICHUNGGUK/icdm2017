In our framework, the start and end points of meaningful gesture segments are detected automatically by the intensity of the EMG signals. A decision tree and multistream hidden Markov models are utilized as decision-level fusion to get the final results. For sign language recognition (SLR), experimental results on the classification of 72 Chinese Sign Language (CSL) words demonstrate the complementary functionality of the ACC and EMG sensors and the effectiveness of our framework. Additionally, the recognition of 40 CSL sentences is implemented to evaluate our framework for continuous SLR. For gesture-based control, a real-time interactive system is built as a virtual Rubik's cube game using 18 kinds of hand gestures as control commands. While ten subjects play the game, the performance is also examined in user-specific and user-independent classification. Our proposed framework facilitates intelligent and natural control in gesture-based interaction.", "paper_title": "A Framework for Hand Gesture Recognition Based on Accelerometer and EMG Sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000296017400003"}
