The paper first shows that the basic pipeline optimization problem for asynchronous circuits is NP-complete. Then, it presents an efficient branch and bound algorithm that finds the optimal pipeline configuration. The experimental results on a few scalable system models demonstrate that this algorithm is computationally feasible for moderately sized models.", "paper_title": "Pipeline optimization for asynchronous circuits: Complexity analysis and an efficient optimal algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000235623300001"}
