We adopt an autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) process to model the temporal correlation of the channels. Based on the ARMA process, the Hopfield neural network is adopted as an auxiliary system, the auxiliary system allows the particle filtering select fitted size of trajectories, and we further propose to obtain soft multiuser detection from the particle filtering and the auxiliary system. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "A novel blind multiuser detection model over flat fast fading channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300015"}
