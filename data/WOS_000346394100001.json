A new algorithm is introduced that combines the add-subtract scalar multiplication algorithm with the MOF representation to speed-up the EGG scalar multiplication. The implementation of the algorithm produces an efficient parallel method that improves the computation time. The proposed method is an efficient EGG scalar multiplication that achieves a 90% speed-up compared to the existing methods.", "paper_title": "Parallel Method for Computing Elliptic Curve Scalar Multiplication Based on MOF", "paper_id": "WOS:000346394100001"}
