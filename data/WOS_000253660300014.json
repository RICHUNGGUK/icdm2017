The simulations were performed with explicit TIP3P water and Mg2+ ions. Four different crystal structures of COMT, with and without different ligands, were used. These simulations are among the most extensive of their kind and as such served as a stability test for such simulations. On the methodological side we found that the initial energy minimization procedure may be a crucial step: particular hydrogen bonds may break, and this can initiate an irreversible loss of protein structure that becomes observable in longer time scales of the order of tens of nanoseconds. This has important implications for both molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics-molecular mechanics simulations.", "paper_title": "Molecular dynamics simulations of the enzyme Catechol-O-Methyltransferase: methodological issues", "paper_id": "WOS:000253660300014"}
