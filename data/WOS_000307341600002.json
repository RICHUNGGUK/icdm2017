Traditionally, information about displacements and strains in the materials is carried out from these tests using physical devices such as strain gauges or other transducers. Although these devices provide accurate and robust measurements in a wide range of situations, they are limited to obtaining measurements in a single point of the material and in a single direction of the movement, thus, the global behavior of the material cannot be analyzed. The proposed technique consists of the integration of a calibration process with a block-matching algorithm to measure displacements from images. This algorithm uses the similarity between regions in the images to extract the 2D vector displacement field from each point, and to quantify the strain on the surface of the material. The proposed algorithm has been designed to measure displacements from real images of material surfaces taken during strength tests, and it has the advantages of being robust with long-range displacements, of performing the analysis on the image space domain (avoiding the problems related to the use of Fourier Transforms), and of measurements in long sequences related to a real point of the material and not to a pixel position.", "paper_title": "Optical Analysis of Strength Tests Based on Block-Matching Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000307341600002"}
