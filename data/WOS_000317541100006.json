The model operates on various wavelengths of light, and applies simple optical operations to different wavelengths simultaneously. We have defined time and size complexity measures on the w-machine, and we have provided upper bounds on the complexity of the w-machine to compute any languages. We have provided upper bounds on the complexity of w-machines computing any language, and w-machines computing the same languages as given Boolean circuits and given Turing machines. We have also provided upper bounds and lower bound on the complexity of Boolean circuits and Turing machines computing the same languages as given w-machines.", "paper_title": "An Optical Wavelength-Based Computational Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000317541100006"}
