In particular, this study gives a novel viewpoint that a consecutive hierarchical template matching could be regarded as a transition of a hierarchical finite state machine, and then it proposes a novel method considering the transitions between the internal nodes of the hierarchical template tree. The proposed method is verified by applying it to pedestrian silhouette detection.", "paper_title": "Internal-to-internal transition method for consecutive hierarchical template matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000337943100006"}
