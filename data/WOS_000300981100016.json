On the other hand, in order to support node mobility, scalable routing strategies have been designed and these protocols try to consider the path duration in order to respect some QoS constraints and to reduce the route discovery procedures. Often energy saving and path duration and stability can be two contrasting efforts and trying to satisfy both of them can be very difficult. In this paper, a novel routing strategy is proposed. This proposed approach tries to account for link stability and for minimum drain rate energy consumption. In order to verify the correctness of the proposed solution a biobjective optimization formulation has been designed and a novel routing protocol called Link-stAbility and Energy aware Routing protocols (LAER) is proposed. This novel routing scheme has been compared with other three protocols: PERRA, GPSR, and E-GPSR. The protocol performance has been evaluated in terms of Data Packet Delivery Ratio, Normalized Control Overhead, Link duration, Nodes lifetime, and Average energy consumption.", "paper_title": "Link-Stability and Energy Aware Routing Protocol in Distributed Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000300981100016"}
