Galbraith et al. (J Cryptol 24(3): 446-469, 2011) showed that point multiplication exploiting the 2-dimensional GLV method on a large class of curves over F-p2 was faster than the standard method on general elliptic curves over F-p, and left as an open problem to study the case of 4-dimensional GLV on special curves (e.g., j (E) = 0) over F-p2. We study the above problem in this paper. We show how to get the 4-dimensional GLV decomposition with proper decomposed coefficients, and thus reduce the number of doublings for point multiplication on these curves to only a quarter. The resulting implementation shows that the 4-dimensional GLV method on a GLS curve runs in about 0.78 the time of the 2-dimensional GLV method on the same curve and in between 0.78 - 0.87 the time of the 2-dimensional GLV method using the standard method over F-p. In particular, our implementation reduces by up to 27% the time of the previously fastest implementation of point multiplication on x86-64 processors due to Longa and Gebotys (CHES2010).", "paper_title": "Implementing the 4-dimensional GLV method on GLS elliptic curves with j-invariant 0", "paper_id": "WOS:000303512400004"}
