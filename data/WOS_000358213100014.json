A uniform iterative approach is developed to match and find the corresponding patches in different exposure images, which are then fused in each iteration. Our approach does not need to align the input multiple exposure images before the fusion process. Considering that the pixel values are affected by various exposure time, we design a new patch-based energy function that will be optimized to improve the matching accuracy. An efficient patch-based exposure fusion approach using the random walker algorithm is developed to preserve the moving objects from the input multiple exposure images. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first patch-based exposure fusion work to preserve the moving objects of dynamic scenes that does not need the registration process of different exposure images. Experimental results of moving scenes demonstrate that our algorithm achieves visually pleasing fusion results without ghosting artifacts, while the results produced by the state-of-the-art exposure fusion and tone mapping algorithms exhibit different levels of ghosting artifacts.", "paper_title": "Robust Match Fusion Using Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000358213100014"}
