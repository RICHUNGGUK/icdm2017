Because direct computation of the solution becomes difficult in this situation, many authors have alternatively approximated the solution by the solution of a closely defined well posed problem. In this paper, we demonstrate this process of regularization for nonautonomous ill-posed problems including the backward heat equation with a time-dependent diffusion coefficient. In the process, we provide two different approximate well posed models and numerically compare convergence rates of their solutions to a known solution of the original ill-posed problem.", "paper_title": "Numerical estimates for the regularization of nonautonomous ill-posed problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000365771900009"}
