However, few methods can realize incremental learning. On the other hand, most prototype classifiers need users to predetermine the number of prototypes; an improper prototype number might undermine the classification performance. To deal with these issues, in the paper we propose an online supervised algorithm named Incremental Learning Vector Quantization (ILVQ) for classification tasks. The proposed method has three contributions. (1) By designing an insertion policy, ILVQ incrementally learns new prototypes, including both between-class incremental learning and within-class incremental learning. (2) By employing an adaptive threshold scheme, ILVQ automatically learns the number of prototypes needed for each class dynamically according to the distribution of training data. Therefore, unlike most current prototype classifiers, ILVQ needs no prior knowledge of the number of prototypes or their initial value. (3) A technique for removing useless prototypes is used to eliminate noise interrupted into the input data. Results of experiments show that the proposed ILVQ can accommodate the incremental data environment and provide good recognition performance and storage efficiency.", "paper_title": "An incremental learning vector quantization algorithm for pattern classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000307552600014"}
