Design/methodology/approach - By using sinc collocation method in strip, the authors try to estimate a numerical solution for this kind of integral equation. Findings - Some numerical results support the accuracy and efficiency of the stated method. Originality/value - The paper presents a method for solving first kind integral equations which are ill-posed.", "paper_title": "Convergence of sinc approximation for Fredholm integral equation with degenerate kernel", "paper_id": "WOS:000306446600014"}
