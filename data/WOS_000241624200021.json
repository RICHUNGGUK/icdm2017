With the maturing intranet and web technology, broadcasting algorithms, including pull-based and push-based broadcasting algorithms, it is feasible to send downward messages through web-based design by sending packets on a network. To avoid losing messages due to the traditional push-based method, companies adopt a pull-based algorithm to build up the broadcasting system. However, although the pull-based method can ensure that a message is received, it has a critical problem, the network is always congested. The push-based method can avoid congesting the network, but it needs a specific robust design to ensure that the message reaches its destination. Hence, adopting only a pull-based or a push-based broadcasting algorithm is no longer feasible especially not for a large-scaled company with complex network architecture. To ensure that every receiver will read downward messages thereby reducing the consumption of network bandwidth, this work proposes a robust web-based push- and pull-based broadcasting system for sending downward messages. This proposed system was successfully applied to a large-scaled company for a one-year period.", "paper_title": "Robust Web-based approach for broadcasting downward messages in a large-scaled company", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624200021"}
