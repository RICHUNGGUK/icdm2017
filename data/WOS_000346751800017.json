This study seeks to: (1) outline the rural (non-networked) water development decision process in a systematic way: (2) incorporate that process into a modeling tool in order to conduct consistent economic analysis of developments across a wide range of contexts, and (3) assess the performance and potential applications of this tool. We introduce AWARE, a recently developed Decision Support System, to provide a generalized model of the processes and constraints related to the advancement of rural water services. AWARE enables robust comparisons to be made across a wide range of social. economic, physical, technical and management approaches. We demonstrate that it performs adequately, and propose that, despite its generalized approach, it will be useful for informing both development strategies and field projects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
