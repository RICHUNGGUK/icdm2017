Contrary to this it seems, the human mind integrates sensor and language signals seamlessly, before signals are understood, at pre-conceptual level. Learning of conceptual contents of the surrounding world depends on language and vice versa. The paper describes a mathematical technique for such integration. It combines fuzzy dynamic logic with dual cognitive-language models. The paper briefly discusses relationships between the proposed mathematical technique, working of the mind and applications to understanding-based search engines.
