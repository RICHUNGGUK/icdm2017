Although there are few models reported for hypermeshes with uniform traffic pattern, no analytical model has been reported to deal with hot-spot traffic. Since many parallel applications exhibit non-uniform traffic patterns such as hot-spots, uniform traffic assumption is not always justifiable in practice. In this study, we propose a new analytical model to predict the mean message latency in wormhole-switched hypermeshes in the presence of hot-spot traffic. The proposed model can also calculate the mean latency under uniform traffic load when the hot-spot ratio is set to zero. Simulation results show the validity and the reasonable accuracy of the model even under heavy traffic loads and near saturation region. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
