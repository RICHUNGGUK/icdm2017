In particular, the joint maximization of the users' utilities and the base station's revenue is considered, while these hierarchical decision problems are matched to the framework of a generalized Stackelberg game. Also, an efficient iterative method is proposed that enables all the players to reach the variational equilibrium, i.e., the optimal solution of the game. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Autonomous Energy Harvesting Base Stations With Minimum Storage Requirements", "paper_id": "WOS:000377306800010"}
