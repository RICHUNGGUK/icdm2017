As with the relationship between software engineering and software, document engineering is concerned with principles, tools and processes that improve our ability to create, manage, and maintain documents (http://www.documentengineering.org). The ACM Symposium on Document Engineering is an annual meeting of researchers active in document engineering: it is sponsored by ACM by means of the ACM SIGWEB Special Interest Group. In this editorial, we first point to work carried out in the context of document engineering, which are directly related to multimedia tools and applications. We conclude with a summary of the papers presented in this special issue.", "paper_title": "Document engineering approaches toward scalable and structured multimedia, web and printable documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000266392800001"}
