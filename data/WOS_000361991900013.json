We present the first memoryless transition bus-encoding technique for power minimization, error-correction, and elimination of crosstalk simultaneously. To accomplish this, we generalize balanced sampling plans avoiding adjacent units, which are widely used in the statistical design of experiments. Optimal or asymptotically optimal constant weight codes eliminating each kind of crosstalk are constructed.", "paper_title": "Optimal low-power coding for error correction and crosstalk avoidance in on-chip data buses", "paper_id": "WOS:000361991900013"}
