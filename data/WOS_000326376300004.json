Consequentially, the increasing need for recommender services, from both individual users and groups of users, has arisen. In this paper, we present a new graph-based approach to a recommender system, called Folkommender, that can make recommendations most notably to groups of users. From rating information, we first model a signed graph that contains both positive and negative links between users and items. On this graph we examine two distinct random walks to separately quantify the degree to which a group of users would like or dislike items. We then employ a differential ranking approach for tailoring recommendations to the group. Our empirical evaluations on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed group recommendation method performs better than existing alternatives. We also demonstrate the feasibility of Folkommender for smartphones.", "paper_title": "Folkommender: a group recommender system based on a graph-based ranking algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000326376300004"}
