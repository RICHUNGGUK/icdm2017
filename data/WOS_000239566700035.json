Recent work has extended these techniques to hyperelliptic Jacobians, but one obstruction is the lack of explicit models of curves together with an efficiently computable endomorphism. In the case of hyperelliptic curves there are limited examples, most methods focusing on special CM curves or curves defined over a small field. In this article we describe three infinite families of curves which admit an efficiently computable endomorphism, and give algorithms for their efficient application.", "paper_title": "Efficiently computable endomorphisms for hyperelliptic curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566700035"}
