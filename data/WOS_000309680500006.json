We consider the Hamiltonicity game, the perfect matching game and the k-connectivity game. We prove that for p(n) >= polylog(n)/n the board G similar to G(n,p) is typically such that Maker can win these games asymptotically as fast as possible, i.e., within n + o(n), n/2 + o(n) and kn/2 + o(n) moves respectively.", "paper_title": "Fast Strategies In Maker-Breaker Games Played on Random Boards", "paper_id": "WOS:000309680500006"}
