Therefore the identification and characterization of the Value System of the network and its members is fundamental when attempting to improve the collaborative process. However the concept of Value System is not properly defined yet and there is not even an agreement in research community about its intuitive definition. Departing from a definition of value and evaluation, this paper proposes a formal conceptual model for Value Systems and discusses its application in the management of collaborative networks.", "paper_title": "A conceptual model of value systems in collaborative networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000277712400004"}
