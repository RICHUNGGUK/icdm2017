This paper addresses two special issues that arise in such an application. First, RCSP in this context is dynamic in the sense that arc costs are updated at each column-generation iteration, but constraints are not changed. Often, only a few arc costs are updated at an iteration. Second, RCSP must be solved subject to arcs that are forbidden or prescribed as corresponding binary variables are fixed to 0 or 1 by the branching rule. A reoptimizing algorithm for dealing with a few arc-cost changes and a method for dealing with fixed arcs are proposed and incorporated into a three-stage approach, specializing it for repeatedly solving the dynamic RCSP as a sub-problem in branch-and-price. Computational tests evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
