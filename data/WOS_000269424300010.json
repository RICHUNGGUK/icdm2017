We have found that the computational speed of two-dimensional (2D) tissue simulations with a single commercially available GPU is about 30 times faster than with a single 2.0 GHz Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Opteron processor. We have also simulated wave conduction in the three-dimensional (3D) anatomic heart with GPUs where we found the computational speed with a single GPU is 1.6 times slower than with a 32-central processing unit (CPU) Opteron cluster. However, a cluster with two or four GPUs is faster than the CPU-based cluster. These results demonstrate that a commodity personal computer is able to perform a whole heart simulation of electrical wave conduction within times that enable the investigators to interact more easily with their simulations.", "paper_title": "Acceleration of cardiac tissue simulation with graphic processing units", "paper_id": "WOS:000269424300010"}
