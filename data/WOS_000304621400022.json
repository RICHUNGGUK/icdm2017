For geometric structure, the substituent position and axial Cl ligand change the configuration of the iron porphyrin obviously. The ortho-substituents prefer making the phenyls perpendicular to the porphyrin ring; the axial chloride draws the central Fe ion similar to 0.500 out of the porphyrin plane toward the ligand. With regard to electronic properties, it is found that E-LUMO could be related to the catalytic activity. The electron-withdrawing group always lowers the energies of both frontier orbitals, while the electron-donating one heightens them simultaneously, but they affect the E-HOMO and E-LUMO in the same sequence, -NO2 < -Cl < -H < -OH < -OCH3. The substituent effects on the central Fe ion were explored by calculating NBO charge distribution, spin density and natural electron configuration.", "paper_title": "Substituent effects on geometric and electronic properties of iron tetraphenylporphyrin: a DFT investigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000304621400022"}
