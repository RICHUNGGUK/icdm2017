Recently, fluorous methods are also enabling purification of biomolecules such as peptides, oligosaccharides, and oligonucleotides assembled by traditional solid-phase synthesis. Apart from synthetic applications, fluorous chemistry is also providing solutions for critical problems in proteomics and microarray chip technology. This review highlights selected recent advances that underscore the impact of fluorous separation methods in organic and bioorganic chemistry.", "paper_title": "Recent applications of fluorous separation methods in organic and bioorganic chemistry", "paper_id": "WOS:000240789100002"}
