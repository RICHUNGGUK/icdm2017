We obtained a high correlation coefficient between the IF 2006 and h-index 2006. The rating of journals starting from the h-index may represent a complementary alternative to the rating based on the IF. The h-index rating proposes a categorization of journals making it possible to create classes of journals with the same h-index.", "paper_title": "Comparative Analysis between Impact Factor and h-Index for Psychiatry Journals", "paper_id": "WOS:000291915900001"}
