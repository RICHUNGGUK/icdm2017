Causal connection between banding artifact and transmission errors has been demonstrated previously. Two controller design approaches were suggested for reducing banding artifact. The proposed designs were based on the internal model principle and H-infinity robust control theories, both have two degree of freedom control structure. The controllers were implemented on a monochrome laser printer, for which latent images are formed on a cylindrical photoconductor drum. Experimental results showed significant reduction in the measured velocity error for the photoconcluctor drum as well as noticeable banding reduction on the printed images. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
