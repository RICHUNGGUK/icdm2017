The CAVLC encodes levels of nonzero-valued coefficients. Then indicates their positions with run-before which is number of zeros preceding each nonzero coefficient in scan order. In H.264, the run_before is coded using lookup tables depending on number of zero-valued coefficients that have not been coded. This paper presents in improved run-before coding method which encodes run-before using tables taking both zero-valued and nonzero-valued coefficients into consideration. Simulation results report that the proposed method yields an average of 4.40% bit rate reduction for run_before coding over H.264 baseline profile with intra-only coding structure. It corresponds to 0.52% bit rate saving over total bit rate on average.", "paper_title": "An Improved Run_before Coding for H.264 CAVLC", "paper_id": "WOS:000274537100027"}
