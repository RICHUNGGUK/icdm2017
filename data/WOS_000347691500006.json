The theory of integrity constraints is largely a theory over relations. To make data processing more efficient, SQL permits database states to be partial bags that can accommodate incomplete and duplicate information. Integrity constraints, however, interact differently on partial bags than on the idealized special case of relations. In this current paper, we study the implication problem of the combined class of general cardinality constraints and not-null constraints on partial bags. We investigate structural properties of Armstrong tables for general cardinality constraints and not-null constraints, and prove exact conditions for their existence. For the fragment of general max-cardinality constraints, unary min-cardinality constraints and not-null constraints we show that the effort for constructing Armstrong tables is precisely exponential. For the same fragment we provide an axiomatic characterization of the implication problem. The major tool for establishing our results is the Hajnal and Szemer,di theorem on the equitable colorings of graphs.", "paper_title": "Constructing Armstrong tables for general cardinality constraints and not-null constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000347691500006"}
