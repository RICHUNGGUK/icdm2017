Prototypes consist of mathematical expressions and are encoded as derivation trees. The devised system is able to cope with classification problems in which the number of prototypes is not a priori known. The approach has been tested on several problems and the results compared with those obtained by other genetic programming based approaches previously proposed.", "paper_title": "Looking for prototypes by genetic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000240262900016"}
