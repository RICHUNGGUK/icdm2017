In this paper, a new relaxation approach to weighted graph matching is proposed, by which a new matching algorithm, named alternate iteration algorithm, is designed. It is proved that the algorithm proposed is locally convergent. Experiments are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A New Approach to Weighted Graph Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000269648000010"}
