The Decisional DNA is a domain-independent, standard and flexible knowledge representation structure that allows its domains to acquire, store, and share experiential knowledge and formal decision events in an explicit way. We apply this approach to our current work-SmartBike, a sensor-equipped bicycle built under the concept of Internet of Things. By using Decisional DNA and machine learning algorithms, the SmartBike is able to distinguish its user's patterns based on past riding data. The presented conceptual approach demonstrates how Decisional DNA can be applied to the Internet of Things and bring to them intelligence required by forthcoming semantic networks.", "paper_title": "Applying Decisional DNA to Internet of Things: The Concept and Initial Case Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000351767400007"}
