In this paper, we consider chemical trees (with maximum degree at most 4) with a given order and number of pendent vertices and determine the extremal trees with the minimum general Randic index for arbitrary or among this class of trees. For alpha > 1 we also give a sharp lower bound of the general Randic index for general trees (without degree restriction) with a given order and number of pendent vertices.", "paper_title": "Minimum general Randic index on chemical trees with given order and number of pendent vertices", "paper_id": "WOS:000259765200024"}
