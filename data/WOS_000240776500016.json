An exact imaging method based on the inverse Fourier transform of the affine group is presented. A Wiener filter is designed in the affine group Fourier transform domain to minimize wideband clutter range-Doppler reflectivity. The Wiener filter is then used to form an operator to precondition transmitted waveforms to reject clutter. Alternatively, the imaging and clutter rejection methods are equivalently re-expressed to perform clutter suppression upon reception. These methods are coupled with noise suppression upon reception. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. Our study shows that the framework introduced in this paper can address the joint design of receive and transmit processing, design of clutter rejecting waveforms, suppression of noise, and reduction of computational complexity in receive processing.", "paper_title": "Wideband extended range-Doppler imaging and waveform design in the presence of clutter and noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000240776500016"}
