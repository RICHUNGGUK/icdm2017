State-of-the-art researches prove that the use of users' behavior information helps to improve query recommendation performance. Instead of finding the most similar terms previous users queried, we focus on how to detect users' actual information need based on their search behaviors. The key idea of this paper is that although the clicked documents are not always relevant to users' queries, the snippets which lead them to the click most probably meet their information needs. Based on analysis into large-scale practical search behavior log data, two snippet click behavior models are constructed and corresponding query recommendation algorithms are proposed. Experimental results based on two widely-used commercial search engines' click-through data prove that the proposed algorithms outperform practical recommendation methods of these two search engines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that snippet click models are proposed for query recommendation task. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
