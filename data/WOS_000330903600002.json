We review 50 studies that measured CE in people with epilepsy. Most showed cortical hyperexcitability, which can be corrected with anti-epileptic drug treatment. Several studies showed that decrease of CE after epilepsy surgery is predictive of good seizure outcome. CE is a potential biomarker for epilepsy. Clinical application may include outcome prediction of drug treatment and epilepsy surgery.", "paper_title": "CORTICAL EXCITABILITY AS A POTENTIAL CLINICAL MARKER OF EPILEPSY: A REVIEW OF THE CLINICAL APPLICATION OF TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000330903600002"}
