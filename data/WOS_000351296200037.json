Thus, it is possible that more agents are committed to monitor the same phenomenon in the same environment. Redundancy of sensors and agents is needed, for instance, in real world applications in order to mitigate the risk of faults and threats. One of the possible side effects produced by redundancy is that agents, observing the same phenomenon, could provide discordant opinions. Indeed, solid mechanisms for reaching an agreement among these agents and produce a shared consensus on the same observations are needed. This paper proposes an approach to integrate a fuzzy-based consensus model into a Situation Awareness framework. The main idea is to consider intelligent agents as experts claiming their opinions (preferences) on a phenomenon of interest. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
