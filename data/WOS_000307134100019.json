In a high dimensional space, bicluster patterns to be recognized can be considered to be linear geometrical structures. We can use the Hough transform (HT) to find sub-biclusters which correspond to the linear structures in column-pair spaces. Then a hypergraph model is built to merge the sub-biclusters into larger ones. Experiments on simulated and real biological data show that the HGBC algorithm proposed here can combine the sub-biclusters efficiently and provide more accurate classification results compared with existing biclustering methods.
