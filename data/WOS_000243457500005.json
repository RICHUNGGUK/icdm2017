AnyBody is capable of analyzing the musculoskeletal system of humans or other creatures as rigid-body systems. The paper introduces the main features of the system; in particular, the inverse dynamic analysis that resolves the fundamental indeterminacy of the muscle configuration. In addition to the musculoskeletal system, a model can comprise external objects, loads, and motion specifications, thereby providing a complete set of the boundary conditions for a given task. The paper also describes the basic ideas of structured model development in AnyBody. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
