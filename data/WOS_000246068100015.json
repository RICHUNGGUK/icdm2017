Based on XML and VRML technology, the implement method of product data sharing and integration is also discussed. A general type net-based collaborative product design support system called CoDesign Space is designed, and the system architecture and realization method are presented. The CoDesign Space system has a flexible and extendable three-tier B/S architecture. Meanwhile, the system can satisfy the requirements of geographically dispersed collaborative design in many ways by integrating several collaborative design support tools that can be used independently.", "paper_title": "CoDesign Space: a collaborative design support system in a network environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000246068100015"}
