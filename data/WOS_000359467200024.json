The conventional algorithms, DEMON and LOFAR, respectively target each type of signal, but do not consider the other type of signal also present in the practical environment. Thus when features from two types of signals are presented at the same time, analysis results may cause confusion. In this paper, we propose an integrated analysis algorithm for underwater signals using the modulation spectrogram domain. The proposed domain presents the visual difference between the different types of signal, and therefore can prevent confusion that would otherwise be feasible. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is more efficient than multiband DEMON in terms of computation complexity, while in colored ambient noise environment, it has similar performance to conventional DEMON and LOFAR. We prove the validity of the proposed algorithm through the relevant experiments with synthesized signal and actual underwater recordings.", "paper_title": "Underwater Radiated Signal Analysis in the Modulation Spectrogram Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000359467200024"}
