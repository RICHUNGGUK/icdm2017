Control of the substrate concentration in the bioreactor medium is especially necessary because of the substrate inhibition phenomenon. Moreover in order to maintain the dissolved oxygen content in an appropriate range, the biomass concentration should not exceed a set level. To maintain the biomass concentration in the desired range the universal mathematical model of a continuous bioprocess with impulsive state feedback control is formulated in the article. By discussing the dynamic properties of the model including the existence and stability of the periodic solution, the choice of suitable operating conditions for continuous culture systems can be simplified, offering the possibility of establishing general and more systematic operations and control strategies based on the counteraction of the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of the bioreactor dynamics. The article also presents and discusses aspects of the bioprocess optimization. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
