The stability and the accuracy of the formulation have been studied for several applications, including the degenerated cases where one dimension is strongly reduced to represent an embedded bar. The rigid inclusions have been modelled by increasing their elastic modulus. On the other hand thin inclusions with elastic modulus reduced to nearly zero can accurately model crack problems. In all analysed cases, the obtained results have shown that this simple strategy is reliable and can be applied to complex stress analysis problems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
