In this paper we study the turning mechanism of stratospheric airships including the generated forces and the key parameters for steady turning. We compare and analyze the different driven-characteristics between aerodynamic control surfaces and vectored thrust in turning. We design a composite control combining aerodynamic control surfaces and vectored thrust according to different dynamic pressure conditions, to achieve coordinated turning under high or low airspeed situations.", "paper_title": "Turning mechanism and composite control of stratospheric airships", "paper_id": "WOS:000310834300006"}
