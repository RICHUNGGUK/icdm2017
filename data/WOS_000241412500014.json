A different form, AN(n), of such graphs, proposed by Youhou and dubbed alternating group networks, has been shown to possess advantages over AG(n). For example, AN(n) has a node degree that is smaller by a factor of about 2 while maintaining a diameter comparable to that of AG(n), is maximally fault-tolerant, and shares some of the positive structural attributes of the well-known star graph. In this paper, we characterize the distance between any two nodes in AN(n) and present an optimal (shortest-path) routing algorithm for this class of networks.", "paper_title": "Internode distance and optimal routing in a class of alternating group networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241412500014"}
