Experimental vs. predicted morphologies/face indices of fenoxycarb crystals are presented. Atomic-scale surface structures of the crystalline particles, derived from experimentally indexed single crystals, are also modelled. Single crystals of fenoxycarb exhibit a platelet-like morphology which closely matches predicted morphologies. The solvent choice does not significantly influence either morphology or crystal habit. The crystal morphology is dominated by the {0 0 1} faces, featuring weakly interacting aliphatic or aromatic groups at their surfaces. Two distinct modes of interaction of a FC molecule in the crystal can be observed, which appear to be principal factors governing the microscopic shape of the crystal: the relatively strong collateral and the much weaker perpendicular bonding. Both forcefield-based and quantum-chemical calculations predict that the aromatic and aliphatic terminated {0 0 1} faces have comparably high stability as a consequence of weak intermolecular bonding. Thus we predict that the most developed {0 0 1} surfaces of fenoxycarb crystals should be terminated randomly, favouring neither aliphatic nor aromatic termination. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
