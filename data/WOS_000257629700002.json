The grids are generated by introducing an auxiliary independent variable tau and finding a grid deformation map, t = circle dot(tau), that maps an equidistant grid {tau(j)} to a non-equidistant grid in the original independent variable, {t(j)}. An optimal deformation map Theta is determined by a variational approach. Finally, we investigate the cost of the solution procedure and compare it to the cost of using equidistant grids. We show that it' the principal error function is non-constant, an adaptive method is always more efficient than a non-adaptive method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
