In our work, a virtual cloud resource allocation model VCRAM-U (Utility-based Virtual Cloud Resource Allocation Model) is proposed. In our model, the problem of virtual cloud resources allocation is abstracted as a utility-maximization problem, taking tradeoffs between the utility of the data center and the performance of the applications into account, and maximizing the utility on the premise of meet user's performance. We design a local decision algorithm and a global decision algorithm to solve our model. Experimental results show that the virtual cloud resources can be managed and allocated efficiently by our model and algorithms. In addition, our model can get a higher utility of the data center compared with other models.", "paper_title": "Utility-based Virtual Cloud Resource Allocation Model and Algorithm in Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000366968000018"}
