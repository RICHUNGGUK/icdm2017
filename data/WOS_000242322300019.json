Design/methodology/approach - This language may represent an ecological model, written in a formal mathematical structure. Findings - The paper presents and develops recognoscitive and generative grammars of sentences (flow equations) together with a synonymy relationship, which characterize the L(MT) language. Originality/value - Provides a discussion of modelling of language.", "paper_title": "Regular grammars of L(M-T): a language for ecological systems modelling (II)", "paper_id": "WOS:000242322300019"}
