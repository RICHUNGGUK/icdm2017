To this end, image structure is captured using local co-occurrence statistics and is incorporated to the enhancement algorithm in a sequential fashion using the particle filtering technique. In this context, the reconstruction process is modeled using a dynamical system with multiple states and its evolution is guided by the prior density describing the image structure. Towards optimal exploration of the image geometry, an evaluation process of the state of the system is performed at each iteration. The resulting framework explores optimally spatial dependencies between image content towards variable bandwidth image reconstruction. Promising results using additive noise models demonstrate the potentials of such an explicit modeling of the geometry.", "paper_title": "Image Reconstruction Using Particle Filters and Multiple Hypotheses Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000276815900006"}
