We show that our strategy is effective in enhancing the synchronizability of the mobile agent network, i.e., the region of power density for which the network can achieve synchronization is enlarged as compared to the fast-switching case. In addition, the influence of the controlling parameter on network evolution is studied by assessing the convergence time.", "paper_title": "Velocity Adaptation for Synchronizing a Mobile Agent Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000297859500019"}
