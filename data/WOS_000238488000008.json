An algorithm is presented that finds a minimum-cost solution for this problem in O(nlogn) time, provided that the points in S and T are restricted to lie on a line and the cost function delta is the L-1 metric. This algorithm runs in linear time, if S and T are presorted. This improves the previously best-known O(n(2))-time algorithm for this problem.", "paper_title": "An O(n log n)-time algorithm for the restriction scaffold assignment problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000238488000008"}
