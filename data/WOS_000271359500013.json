The proposed approach is based on the decomposition of the production system into elementary modules in order to reduce the control design computational complexity. In this context a, two levels control structure is proposed. At the local level, a surplus-based principle is adopted to regulate the production flow for each module according to the distributed structure. The proposed control methodology decides how to adjust the production rate in order to avoid system overloading and eliminate machine starvation or blocking. In this context, the local control law is synthesized by using the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems. At the high level, a supervisory controller is designed to improve the overall system performances. A supervisor provides an additive component for each local controller when the overall system performances deviate from their acceptable domains (degraded mode). This is done by combining both local and global information into a unified formalism by using aggregation operators and according to fuzzy interval representation of the desired objectives. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed methodology is validated with simulation examples. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
