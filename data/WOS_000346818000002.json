As more and more video monitoring equipments are installed in public places for public security and management, researches become urgent to learn the crowd behavior patterns through the trajectories obtained by the intelligent video surveillance technology. In this paper, the FCM (Fuzzy c-means) algorithm is adopted to cluster the source points and sink points of trajectories that are deemed as critical points into several groups, and then the trajectory clusters can be acquired. The feature information statistical histogram for each trajectory cluster which contains the motion information will be built after refining them with Hausdorff distances. Eventually, the local motion coherence between test trajectories and refined trajectory clusters will be used to judge whether they are abnormal. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
