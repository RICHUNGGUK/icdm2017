The construction site is characteristic of difficult geological conditions and is rich in groundwater, and the control of groundwater flow in the surrounding rocks of the underground caverns becomes one of the key technological issues. This case study presents a systematic performance assessment of the seepage control system designed for the underground caverns by finite element numerical modeling, with particular concerns on geological characterization of the site and quantitative determination of the excavation-induced variation in hydraulic conductivity of the surrounding rock masses. The significant influence of the excavation-induced permeability variation on the seepage field in the surrounding rocks and the overall behaviors of the seepage control system are comprehensively illustrated by the numerical results, and the optimized design parameters are suggested for the drainage system. The methodology presented in this study is useful for understanding the performance of the seepage control system widely deployed in underground powerhouse engineering. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
