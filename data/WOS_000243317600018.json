The only knowledge the guesser has about the source and the correlated side information is that the joint source is one among a family. A notion of redundancy is first defined and a new divergence quantity that measures this redundancy is identified. This divergence quantity shares the Pythagorean property with the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Good guessing strategies that minimize the supremum redundancy (over the family) are then identified. The min-sup value measures the richness of the uncertainty set. The min-sup redundancies for two examples-the families of discrete memoryless sources and finite-state arbitrarily varying sources-are then determined.", "paper_title": "Guessing under source uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000243317600018"}
