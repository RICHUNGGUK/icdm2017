The constructive algorithm consists of two parts: a sub-algorithm to construct best heterogeneous component neural networks with negative correlation learning dynamically (CBHNN), and a sub-algorithm to construct heterogeneous NNE with trained heterogeneous neural networks incrementally (CHNNE). The experiment results showe that HNNE is better than the traditional homological NNE method.", "paper_title": "A constructive algorithm for training heterogeneous neural network ensemble", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500057"}
