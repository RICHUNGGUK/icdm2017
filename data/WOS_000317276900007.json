In the correlation matrix of canonical correlation analysis (CCA), we present an approach that substitutes the percentage bend correlation and the winsorized correlation in place of the widely employed the Pearson correlation. Moreover, we employ the FCH, RFCH, and RMVN estimators to estimate the covariance matrix in the CCA. We conduct a simulation study and employ real data with the objective of comparing the performance of the different estimators for canonical vectors and correlation with that of our proposed approaches. The breakdown plots and independent tests are employed as differentiating criteria of the robustness and performance of the estimators. Based on our computational and real data studies, we propose suggestions and guidelines on the practical implications of our findings.", "paper_title": "A comparative study for robust canonical correlation methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000317276900007"}
