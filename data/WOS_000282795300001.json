Int J Intell Syst 2010;25:1-30), we develop various generalized intuitionistic fuzzy point aggregation operators, such as the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy point weighted averaging (GIFPWA) operators, generalized intuitionistic fuzzy point ordered weighted averaging (GIFPOWA) operators, and generalized intuitionistic fuzzy point hybrid averaging (GIFPHA) operators, which can control the certainty degrees of the aggregated arguments with some parameters. Furthermore, we study the properties and special cases of our operators.
