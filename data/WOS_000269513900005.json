The performance of a degradation model depends strongly on the appropriateness of the model describing a product's degradation path. In this paper, motivated by laser data, we propose a general linear degradation path in which the unit-to-unit variation of all test units can be considered simultaneously with the time-dependent structure in degradation paths. Based on the proposed degradation model, we first derive an implicit expression of a product's lifetime distribution, and its corresponding mean-time-to-failure (MTTF). By using the profile likelihood approach, maximum likelihood estimation of parameters, a product's MTTF, and their confidence intervals can be obtained easily. In addition, laser degradation data are used to illustrate the proposed procedure. Furthermore, we also address the effects of model mis-specification on the prediction of the product's MTTF. It shows that the effect of the model mis-specification on the predictions of a product's MTTF is not critical under the case of large samples. However, when the sample size and the termination time are not large enough, a simulation study shows that these effects are not negligible.", "paper_title": "Mis-Specification Analysis of Linear Degradation Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000269513900005"}
