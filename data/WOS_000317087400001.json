The algorithm is general enough to include as special cases several classical algorithms developed in information theory and probability theory. We present four results. First, using the sum-product algorithm we show that the variable sets involved in an acyclic factorization satisfy a relation that is a natural generalization of probability-theoretic independence. Second, we show that for the Boolean semiring the sum-product algorithm reduces to a classical algorithm of database theory. Third, we present some methods to reduce the amount of computation required by the sum-product algorithm. Fourth, we show that with a slight modification the sum-product algorithm can be used to evaluate a general sum-product expression.", "paper_title": "THE SUM-PRODUCT ALGORITHM: ALGEBRAIC INDEPENDENCE AND COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000317087400001"}
