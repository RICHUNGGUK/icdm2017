Our approach attempts to improve throughput by means of the Expected Transmission Count (ETX) metric and chooses routes with minimum interference among them by using a modified version of the Con-elation Factor (CF). The ETX metric represents the expected total number of transmissions (including retransmissions) required to successfully deliver a packet to the destination node. ETX allows finding high-throughput paths on a multi-hop wireless network. ETX incorporates the effects of link loss ratios, asymmetry in the loss ratios between the two directions of each link, and the interference among the successive links of a path. The radio interference when using multiple simultaneous routes can greatly degrade the network performance. The CF is determined using neighbor information, allowing to find routes with minimum interference among them. Our simulation results show that the proposed high throughput low coupling Multipath extension to the Dynamic Source Routing (HTLC-MeDSR) protocol improves Quality of Service (QoS) metrics like throughput, delay, packet loss and energy efficiency in comparison with our preliminar Multipath extension to the Dynamic Source Routing (MeDSR) protocol.", "paper_title": "High Throughput Low Coupling Multipath Routing for Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352333400001"}
