Qual. Technol. 22 (1990), pp. 173186]. Using simulation, we investigate and compare the in-control and out-of-control performances of the competing charts in terms of the average run length measure. The in-control and out-of-control performances of the competing charts deteriorate significantly if the estimated parameters are used with control limits intended for known parameters, especially when only a few Phase I samples are used to estimate the parameters. We recommend the use of the MC1 chart over that of the MCUSUM chart if the parameters are estimated from a small number of Phase I samples.", "paper_title": "The performance of multivariate CUSUM control charts with estimated parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000317276900008"}
