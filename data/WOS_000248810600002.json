Higher order vagueness is widely considered a necessary component of any theory of vagueness, but it is not so well known that it too is competently modelled by Type n Fuzzy sets. In this paper we explore the fuzzy representation of higher order vagueness with respect to spatial phenomena. Initially we relate the arguments on philosophical vagueness to Type n Fuzzy sets. As an example, we move on to an empirical generation of spatial Type 2 Fuzzy sets examining the spatial extent of mountain peaks in Scotland. We show that the Type 2 Fuzzy sets can be populated by using alternative parameterisations of a peak detection algorithm. Further ambiguities could also be explored using other parameters of this and other algorithms. We show some novel answers to interrogations of the mountain peaks of Scotland. The conclusion of this work is that higher order vagueness can be populated for Type 2 and higher fuzzy sets. It does not follow that it is always necessary to examine these higher order uncertainties, but a possible advantage in terms of the results of spatial inquiry is demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Higher order vagueness in geographical information: Empirical geographical population of type n fuzzy sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000248810600002"}
