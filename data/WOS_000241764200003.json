For this system, a problem is given by the description of a patient and a solution is a set of therapeutic decisions. Given a target problem, KASIMIR provides several suggestions of solutions, based on several justified adaptations of source cases. Such adaptation processes are based on adaptation knowledge. The acquisition of this kind of knowledge from experts is presented in this paper. It is shown how the decomposition of adaptation processes by introduction of intermediate problems can highlight simple and generalizable adaptation steps. Moreover, some adaptation knowledge units that are generalized from those acquired for KASIMIR are presented. This knowledge can be instantiated in other case-based decision support systems, in particular in medicine.", "paper_title": "Adaptation knowledge acquisition: A case study for case-based decision support in oncology", "paper_id": "WOS:000241764200003"}
