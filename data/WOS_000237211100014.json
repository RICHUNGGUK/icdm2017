However, control, management and optimization schemes are provided in a static and basic way. Network control and management schemes using an autonomy based technology offer a new way to master quality of service, security and mobility management. This new paradigm allows a dynamic and intelligent control of the equipment in a local manner, a global network control in a cooperative manner, a more powerful network management, and a better guaranty of all vital functionalities like end to end quality of service and security. In this paper, we provide a way to implement such a paradigm through the use of the agent and multi agent concept. A testbed of an architecture based on autonomous network equipment has been developed. This autonomous architecture is able to optimize the quality of service through the networks.", "paper_title": "Autonomous network equipments", "paper_id": "WOS:000237211100014"}
