Most clustering approaches for data sets are the crisp ones, which cannot be well suitable to the fuzzy case. In this paper, the authors explore a single pass approach to fuzzy possibilistic clustering over large data set. The basic idea of the proposed approach (weighted fuzzy-possibilistic c-means, WFPCM) is to use a modified possibilistic c-means (PCM) algorithm to cluster the weighted data points and centroids with one data segment as a unit. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets show that WFPCM can save significant memory usage when comparing with the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm and the possibilistic c-means (PCM) algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is of an excellent immunity to noise and can avoid splitting or merging the exact clusters into some inaccurate clusters, and ensures the integrity and purity of the natural classes.", "paper_title": "Weighted Fuzzy-Possibilistic C-Means Over Large Data Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000314401200004"}
