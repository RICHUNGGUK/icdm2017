The decidability result is obtained by importing into the context of model-checking problems some techniques developed for the combination of decision procedures for the satisfiability of constraints. The general decidability result is then specialized for checking properties of particular interest, such as liveness and safety, and, for the latter case, a more optimized algorithm has been proposed.", "paper_title": "A Decidability Result for the Model Checking of Infinite-State Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000298108400001"}
