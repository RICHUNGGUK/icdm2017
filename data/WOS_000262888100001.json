In circumstances where the members of the decision making team are uncertain in determining and defining the decision making criteria, fuzzy theory provides a proper tool to encounter with such uncertainties. However, if decision makers cannot reach an agreement on the method of defining linguistic variables based on the fuzzy sets, the interval-valued fuzzy set theory can provide a more accurate modeling. In this paper the interval-valued fuzzy TOPSIS method is presented aiming at solving MCDM problems in which the weights of criteria are unequal, using interval-valued fuzzy sets concepts.
