The paper investigates how the behavior of these operators can be described in a prioritized propositional logic language, namely possibilistic logic. The case of binary-valued criteria, which amounts to providing a logical description of the fuzzy measure underlying the integral, is first considered. The general case of a Sugeno integral when critersia are valued on a discrete scale is then studied. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
