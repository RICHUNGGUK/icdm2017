Segmentation is performed using Expectation-Maximization (EM) with Maximization of Posterior Marginals (MPM) Bayesian algorithm. This algorithm segments the 3D image using neighboring pixels based on a Markov Random Field (MRF) model. In this system, the embedded processor controls a custom circuit which performs the MPM and portions of the EM algorithm. The embedded processor completes the EM algorithm and also controls image data transmission between host computer and on-board memory. The whole system has been implemented on Xilinx Virtex 6 FPGA and achieved over 100 times processing improvement compared to standard desktop computer. Three new techniques were the key to achieve this speed: Pipelined computational cores, sixteen parallel data paths and a novel memory interface for maximizing the external memory bandwidth.", "paper_title": "3D EM/MPM Image Segmentation Using an FPGA Embedded Design Implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000362575300008"}
