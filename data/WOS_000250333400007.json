The first uses macro components based on a large, fixed number of underlying, Galois Field arithmetic units in parallel to minimise the computation time. The second is an area efficient approach based on a small, variable number of underlying components. Both architectures are prototyped on an FPGA. Timing results for each architecture with various different design. parameters are presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
