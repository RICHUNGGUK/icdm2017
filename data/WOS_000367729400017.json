The performance of transportation systems is of crucial importance for individual mobility, commerce, and for the economic growth of all nations. In recent years modern society has been facing more traffic jams, higher fuel prices, and an increase in CO2 emissions. It is imperative to improve the safety and efficiency of transportation. Developing a sustainable intelligent transportation system requires the seamless integration and interoperability with emerging technologies such as connected vehicles, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things. In this article we present and discuss some of the integration challenges that must be addressed to enable an intelligent transportation system to address issues facing the transportation sector such as high fuel prices, high levels of CO2 emissions, increasing traffic congestion, and improved road safety.", "paper_title": "INTEGRATION CHALLENGES OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS WITH CONNECTED VEHICLE, CLOUD COMPUTING, AND INTERNET OF THINGS TECHNOLOGIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000367729400017"}
