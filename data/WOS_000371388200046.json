A majority of researchers working on robot grasping and object manipulation tend to utilize commercially available robot manipulators equipped with various end effectors for experimental studies. However, commercially available robotic grippers are often expensive and are not easy to modify for specific purposes. To extend the choice of robotic end effectors freely available to researchers and educators, we present an open-source low-cost three-finger robotic gripper platform for research and educational purposes. The 3-D design model of the gripper is presented and manufactured with a minimal number of 3-D-printed components and an off-the-shelf servo actuator. An underactuated finger and gear train mechanism, with an overall gripper assembly design, are described in detail, followed by illustrations and a discussion of the gripper grasping performance and possible gripper platform modifications. The presented open-source gripper platform computer-aided design model is released for downloading on the authors research lab website (www.alaris.kz) and can be utilized by robotics researchers and educators as a design platform to build their own robotic end effector solutions for research and educational purposes.", "paper_title": "A Low-Cost Open-Source 3-D-Printed Three-Finger Gripper Platform for Research and Educational Purposes", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200046"}
