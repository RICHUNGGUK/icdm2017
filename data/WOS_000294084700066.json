A lot of information both offline or online is easily acquired, exacerbating the problem of information overload. Novelty mining detects documents/sentences that contain novel or new information and presents those results directly to users (Tang, Tsai, & Chen, 2010). Many methods and algorithms for novelty mining have previously been studied, but none have compared and discussed the impact of term weighting on the evaluation measures. This paper performed experiments to recommend the best term weighting function for both document and sentence-level novelty mining. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
