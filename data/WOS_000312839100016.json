A lot of time synchronization protocols have been proposed for terrestrial Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). However, none of them can be directly applied to Underwater Sensor Networks (UWSNs). A synchronization algorithm for UWSNs must consider additional factors such as long propagation delays from the use of acoustic communication and sensor node mobility. These unique challenges make the accuracy of synchronization procedures for UWSNs even more critical. Time synchronization solutions specifically designed for UWSNs are needed to satisfy these new requirements. This paper proposes Mobi-Sync, a novel time synchronization scheme for mobile underwater sensor networks. Mobi-Sync distinguishes itself from previous approaches for terrestrial WSN by considering spatial correlation among the mobility patterns of neighboring UWSNs nodes. This enables Mobi-Sync to accurately estimate the long dynamic propagation delays. Simulation results show that Mobi-Sync outperforms existing schemes in both accuracy and energy efficiency.", "paper_title": "Mobi-Sync: Efficient Time Synchronization for Mobile Underwater Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000312839100016"}
