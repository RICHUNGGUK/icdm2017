To enhance the frequency stability, we use a new class of Vackar voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) in the PLL. The Vackar VCO achieves a low phase noise performance by effectively suppressing the AM-PM conversion. To properly align the locking range with the output of the VCO, a divider with wide locking range is realized by the current-mode logic (CML) D-flip-flops with tunable load. For spur reduction, an enhanced charge-pump structure is used to reject transient current glitches. With good static and dynamic current matching achieved in the charge pump, the reference spur is suppressed down to -50 dBc. The designed PLL is implemented in a 65 nm RFCMOS process, and the measurement demonstrates a low phase noise signal up to 17 GHz. The in-band phase noise (at 1 MHz offset) and out-band phase noise (at 50 MHz offset) are -103.6 and -126.8 dBc/Hz, respectively. The PLL consumes 50.7 mW and occupies a chip area of 0.9 mm(2).", "paper_title": "A low phase noise PLL using Vackar VCO and a wide-locking range tunable divider for V-band signal generation in 65-nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000320888500009"}
