The construction is based on modified \"Brown-Baker-Katseff sequences\" (Brown et al. in Acta Inform. 18:207-225, 1982) using only two types of rectangles. In addition, we present an online algorithm with competitive ratio for packing instances of this type.", "paper_title": "Improved Lower Bound for Online Strip Packing", "paper_id": "WOS:000348448100004"}
