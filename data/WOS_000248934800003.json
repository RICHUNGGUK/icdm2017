As the existing P2P computing platforms are limited due to the lack of support for various computational models, this paper proposes a workflow management mechanism to support task dependency in parallel programs while increasing computing efficiency. In general, task dependency leads to a serious performance degradation for failed task re-execution because of volatile peers. Therefore, it results in low dependability. Here, dependability is defined as a comparison of the actual performance with task failures to the theoretical one without failure on a P2P computing platform. Redundant task dispatch and a ruintime optimization method are proposed to guarantee high dependability even with highly volatile peers. Large-scale simulation results indicate that the computing platform efficiently solves the problem of P2P computing due to volatile peers. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
