There is a great interest in the definition of molecular mechanisms related to the activity and substrate recognition of these complex multi-domain enzymes. The active site relies at the interface between the C-terminal catalytic domain and the beta-propeller domain, whose N-terminal region acts as a bridge to the hydrolase domain. In MP, the N-terminal extension is characterized by a structurally conserved alpha 1-helix, which is known to affect thermal stability and thermal dependence of the catalytic activity. In the present contribution, results from hundreds nanosecond all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, along with analyses of the networks of cross-correlated motions of a member of the AAP subfamily are discussed. The MD investigation identifies a tunnel that from the surrounding of the N-terminal alpha 1-helix bring to the catalytic site. This cavity seems to be regulated by conformational changes of the alpha 1-helix itself during the dynamics. The evidence here provided can be a useful guide for a better understanding of the mechanistic aspects related to AAP activity, but also for drug design purposes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
