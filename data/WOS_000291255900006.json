To reduce power consumption while maintaining high performance, a fully feedforward architecture with a comprehensive system-level design is implemented. As a key building block, a novel power efficient current mirror operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) with a fast-settling less-error switched-capacitor common-mode feedback (SC CMFB) circuit is introduced, and the effects of both gain nonlinearity and 1/f noise of OTA are discussed. A new method to determine the voltage gain of an OTA is also proposed. The bottom terminal parasitic effect of poly-insulator-poly (PIP) capacitors is considered. About an extra 20% of capacitance is added to the total capacitance load. A power and area efficient resonator is adopted to realize a coefficient of 1/90 for 50% power and 75% area reduction compared with conventional designs. The chip is implemented in a low cost 0.35 mu m complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process. The total power consumption is 20 mu W with a 1.5 V supply, and the measured dynamic range (DR) is 95 dB over a 1 kHz bandwidth. Experimental results show that a high figure-of-merit (FOM) is achieved for the designed modulator in comparison with those from the literature.", "paper_title": "A 20 mu W 95 dB dynamic range 4th-order Delta-Sigma modulator with novel power efficient operational transconductance amplifier and resonator", "paper_id": "WOS:000291255900006"}
