The studied apparel manufacturing system is a precise handicraft profession which involves a great amount of labor-intensive processes. To consider human performance, the apparel manufacturing system is constructed as a fuzzy multistate network, termed apparel manufacturing network (AMN). The workload state of a workstation in the AMN is defined by three fuzzy membership functions: \"under-normal-workload\", \"normal-workload\", and \"over-normal-workload\". Hence, the workload of a workstation is fuzzy multistate and the workstation-reliability is measured by three fuzzy membership functions. Subsequently, the system reliability is evaluated in terms of all workstation-reliabilities, and is derived by fuzzy intersection. The reliability analysis can help the production manager to understand the demand satisfaction of the AMN. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
