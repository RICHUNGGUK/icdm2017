The preview information is conveyed to the controller, via an encoder and a finite capacity channel. In this article, we present an example where we design a remote preview system by means of an additive, white and Gaussian channel. The example is followed by a summary of our recent results on general performance bounds, which we use to prove optimality of the design method.", "paper_title": "Disturbance attenuation bounds in the presence of a remote preview", "paper_id": "WOS:000237323000019"}
