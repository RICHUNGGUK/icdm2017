We present an algorithm for automatic digitization of the seismograms as an inversion problem that forms an interactive program using Matlab GUI. The program integrates automatic digitization with manual digitization and users can easily switch between the two modalities and carry out different combinations for the optimal results. Several examples about applying the interactive program are given to illustrate the merits of the method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
