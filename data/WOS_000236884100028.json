Although existing standards deal with syntactic issues they are primitive for the maintenance of VE while the processes are fulfilled in the untrusted and dynamic environment of the Web. In this paper, we investigate the problems of maintenance and propose a generic model that can be used for the automation purposes of monitoring and management. The mechanism we propose models the process of the Virtual Enterprise and the perspective of process manager. Thus, it automates the maintenance according to predefined configurations.", "paper_title": "On automating networked enterprise management", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884100028"}
