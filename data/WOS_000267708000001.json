The program implements the coarsened exact matching (CEM) algorithm, described below. CEM may be used alone or in combination with any existing matching method. This algorithm, and its statistical properties, are described in Iacus, King, and Porro (2008).", "paper_title": "cem: Software for Coarsened Exact Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000267708000001"}
