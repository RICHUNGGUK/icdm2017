This problem can be interpreted as looking for a minimum number of locations of policemen, guards, cameras or other sensors, that can observe a network of streets, corridors, tunnels, tubes, etc. We show that the problem is strongly NP-complete even for a set of segments with a cubic graph structure, but in P for tree structures.
