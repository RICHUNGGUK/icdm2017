Trellis decoding techniques based on Maximum A Posteriori (M. P) estimators are often used to minimize the error rate on the estimated sequence. If the number of symbols and/or bits transmitted is known by the decoder, termination constraints can be incorporated in the decoding process. All the paths in the trellis which do not lead to a valid sequence length are suppressed. This correspondence presents an analytic method to assess the expected error resilience of a VLC when trellis decoding with a sequence length constraint is used. The approach is based on the computation, for a given code, of the amount of information brought by the constraint. It is then shown that this quantity is not significantly altered by appropriate trellis states aggregation. This proves that the performance obtained by running a length-constrained Viterbi decoder on aggregated state models approaches the one obtained with the bit/symbol trellis, with a significantly reduced complexity. It is then shown that the complexity can be further decreased by projecting the state model on two state models of reduced size.", "paper_title": "Synchronization recovery and state model reduction for soft decoding of variable length codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000243317600026"}
