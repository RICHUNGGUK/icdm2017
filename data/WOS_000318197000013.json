The construction process was designed based on the elementary algebra; the error-correcting performance of the quantum codes was analyzed based on the relationship between the parity-check matrix and the minimum distance of the classical linear codes; the encoding and decoding network was constructed based on the stabilizer. This method is simple, straightforward and easy to implement by computers. Theoretical results show that the method is helpful for the construction of a class of quantum codes.", "paper_title": "Construction of punctured and extended quantum codes over GF(2)", "paper_id": "WOS:000318197000013"}
