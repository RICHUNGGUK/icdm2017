A simulation model using system dynamics approach is proposed to study the behaviors and relationships within the supply chain and to determine the impact of the supply, demand and price interactions. The proposed model yields an insight into the overall agricultural system, taking into account the influence of import quota policies. The purpose of this study is to develop a multi-objective model identifying the best import quota policy for Tehran Municipality Organization of Fruits and Vegetables. The multiple objectives are considered to be price mean, price variation and markup. Key conclusions were reached on how to conduct the multi-objective analysis with the aim of import quota policy making. The multi-objective analysis provides not a single solution but a complete non-dominated set of alternatives as potential compromise solutions among multiple objectives. A close examination of surface and contour plots reveals informative trade-offs. The obtained Pareto frontier contour plots assist decision makers to develop quick import quota policies by presenting a range of choice available to decision makers and providing them with the trade-off information among multiple objectives effectively.
