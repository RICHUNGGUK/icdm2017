Firstly, the chain codes are converted into the binary stream, independent on the input chain code. Then, the compression is done using three modes: RLE0, LZ77(0) and COPY. RLE0 compresses the runs of the 0-bits, LZ77(0) is a simplified version of LZ77 and handles the repetitions within the bit stream, whilst COPY is an escape mode used, when the other two methods are unsuccessful. This method has been tested on the Freeman chain code in eight and four directions, the Vertex chain code, the Three OrThogonal chain code, and the Normalized angle difference chain code. The experiments confirmed better compression ratios on various benchmark datasets in comparison to the state-of-the-art lossless chain code compression methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
