Existing known binary GCPs only have even-lengths in the form of 2(alpha)10(beta)26(gamma) (where alpha, beta, gamma are nonnegative integers). To fill the gap left by the odd-lengths, we investigate the optimal odd-length binary (OB) pairs, which display the closest correlation property to that of GCPs. Our criteria of closeness is that each pair has the maximum possible zero-correlation zone (ZCZ) width and minimum possible out-of-zone aperiodic autocorrelation sums. Such optimal pairs are called optimal OB Z-complementary pairs (OB-ZCP) in this paper. We show that each optimal OB-ZCP has maximum ZCZ width of (N + 1)/2, and minimum out-of-zone aperiodic sum magnitude of 2, where N denotes the sequence length (odd). Systematic constructions of such optimal OP-ZCPs are proposed by insertion and deletion of certain binary GCPs, which settle the 2011 Li-Fan-Tang-Tu open problem positively. The proposed optimal OB-ZCPs may serve as a replacement for GCPs in many engineering applications, where odd sequence lengths are preferred. In addition, they give rise to a new family of base-two almost difference families, which are useful in studying partially balanced incomplete block design.", "paper_title": "Optimal Odd-Length Binary Z-Complementary Pairs", "paper_id": "WOS:000342415600045"}
