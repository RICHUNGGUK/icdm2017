The calculated structural parameters and simulated electronic absorption and IR spectra are compared with the X-ray crystallography structures and the experimentally observed electronic absorption and IR spectra of the similar molecules, and good agreement between the calculated and experimental results is found. The substitution of the methoxyl or methylthio groups at the nonperipheral positions of the phthalocyanine ring has obvious effects on the molecular structure and spectroscopic properties of the metal-free phthalocyanine. Nonperipheral substitution has a more significant influence than peripheral substitution. The substitution effect increases with an increase in the number of substituents. The methylthio group shows more significant influence than the methoxyl group, despite the stronger electron-donating property of the methoxyl group than the methylthio group. The octa-methylthio-substituted metal-free phthalocyanine compounds have nonplanar structures whose low-lying occupied molecular orbitals and electronic absorption spectra are significantly changed by the substituents. The present systematical study will be helpful for understanding the relationship between structures and properties in phthalocyanine compounds and designing phthalocyanines with typical properties.
