The nature of the walking surface itself also has a strong affect on an appropriate gait. Much work is currently underway in improving humanoid walking gaits by dealing with sloping, debris-filled, or otherwise unstable surfaces. Travel on slippery surfaces such as ice, for example, greatly increases the potential speed of a human, but reduces stability. Humans can compensate for this lack of stability through the adaptation of footwear such as skates, and the development of gaits that allow fast but controlled travel on such footwear. This paper describes the development of a gait to allow a small humanoid robot to propel itself on ice skates across a smooth surface, and includes work with both ice skates and inline skates. The new gait described in this paper relies entirely on motion in the frontal plane to propel the robot, and allows the robot to traverse indoor and outdoor ice surfaces more stably than a classic inverted pendulum-based walking gait when using the same skates. This work is demonstrated using Jennifer, a modified Robotis DARwIn-OP humanoid robot with 20 degrees of freedom. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
