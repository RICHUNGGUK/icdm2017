It is shown that George and Veeramani's fuzzy pseudo-metric can be characterized by a family of compatible ordinary pseudo-metrics called pseudo-metric chain in this paper. Then, two kinds of many-valued topological structures-fuzzifying topology and fuzzifying uniformity-are generated by this fuzzy pseudo-metric, and their properties are also investigated.
