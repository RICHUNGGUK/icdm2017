The development of search engines such as personalized and topic-sensitive search intensifies the need of quick rank algorithms. In this paper, a link based rank called ExpRank is proposed. It can converge quickly and reserve the fundamental features of PageRank. Experimental results comparing with PageRank on real dataset are also discussed.", "paper_title": "A quick rank based on Web structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500143"}
