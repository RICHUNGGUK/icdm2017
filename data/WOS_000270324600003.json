It is important to find the optimal spaced seed that achieves the highest search sensitivity. For some simple distributions of the similarities, the seed optimization problem was proved to be not NP-hard. On the other hand, no polynomial time algorithm has been found despite the extensive researches in the literature. In this article we examine the hardness of the seed optimization problem by a polynomial time reduction from the optimal Golomb ruler design problem, which is a well-known difficult (but not NP-hard) problem in combinatorial design.
