A short description of human motion models used for ball-catching is followed by a more detailed study of a teleoperation platform on which to conduct experiments. Also, a pilot study using minimum jerk theory to explain user input behavior in teleoperated catching is presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
