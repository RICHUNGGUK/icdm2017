The coupled transport equations were solved using a novel parallel-multigrid numerical approach with high computational efficiency that has enabled the investigation of dendrite growth with realistic alloy values of Lewis number similar to 10(4) and Prandtl number similar to 10(-2). The detailed dendrite tip shape and character were compared with widely recognized analytical approaches to show validity, and shown to be highly dependent on undercooling, solute concentration and Lewis number. In a relatively low flow velocity regime, variations in the ratio of growth selection parameter with and without convection agreed well with theory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
