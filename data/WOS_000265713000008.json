For certain important examples, such as m-PSK constellations over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, within a prime power, it is shown that this capacity coincides with the Shannon capacity; i.e., there is no loss in capacity using group codes. (This had previously been known for binary-linear codes used over binary-input output-symmetric memoryless channels.) On the other hand, a counterexample involving a three-dimensional geometrically uniform constellation is presented in which the use of Abelian group codes leads to a loss in capacity. The error exponent of the average group code is determined, and it is shown to be bounded away from the random-coding error exponent, at low rates, for finite Abelian groups not admitting Galois field structure.", "paper_title": "The Capacity of Finite Abelian Group Codes Over Symmetric Memoryless Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000265713000008"}
