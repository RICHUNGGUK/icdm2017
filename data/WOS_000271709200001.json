Firstly, it is D(2)(Sigma(1)(1))-complete to determine whether the omega-language of a given Turing machine is countably infinite, where D(2)(E(1)(1)) is the class of 2-differences of Sigma(1)(1)-sets. Secondly, it is Sigma(1)(1)-complete to determine whether the omega-language of a given Turing machine is uncountable. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
