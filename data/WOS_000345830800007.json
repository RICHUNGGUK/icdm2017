We propose an equational approach to this problem by considering an augmented network containing the arguments and attacks of all systems to be merged and then associating a numerical weight to each of the components of the augmented network. The weights are calculated based on how the components are perceived by the agents associated with the systems being merged. The resulting weighted network is then used to define a system of equations, one for each argument, a solution of which corresponds to the overall level of acceptance of the arguments within the community.", "paper_title": "An equational approach to the merging of argumentation networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345830800007"}
