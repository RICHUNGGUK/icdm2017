This paper addresses the problem of creating a simulation of a tactile sensor as well as its implementation in a simulation environment. The simulated tactile sensor model utilizes collision detection and response methods using soft contacts as well as a full friction description. The tactile element is created based on a geometry enabling the creation of a variety of different shape tactile sensors. The tactile sensor element can be used to detect touch against triangularized geometries. This independence in shape enables the use of the sensor model for various applications, ranging from regular tactile sensors to more complex geometries as the human hand which makes it possible to explore human-like touch. The developed tactile sensor model is implemented within OpenGRASP and is available in the open-source plugin. The model has been validated through several experiments ranging from physical properties verification to testing on robot grasping applications. This simulated sensor can provide researchers with a valuable tool for robotic grasping research, especially in cases where the real sensors are not accurate enough yet. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
