In addition to the well-known problems encountered when integrating heterogeneous sources, the dynamic Grid environment introduces new challenges. This paper discusses the problem of data source discovery, i.e. the selection of the most useful data sources for a given information demand out of a possibly very large set of candidates. We introduce the concept of data source utility and emphasize the pivotal role of semantic correspondences or schema matches for utility. Different variants of concrete utility measures used in an advanced Grid data source registry are presented.
