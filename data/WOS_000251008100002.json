Under easily verified conditions, exponential stability is obtained when the delay is finite, while asymptotic stability is obtained when the delay is infinite. Moreover, the stability obtained is robust. The only condition for the delay term is continuity. The results obtained here improve and extend to those in the literature. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
