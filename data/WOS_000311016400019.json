The GC at the attribute, alternative and global levels is constructed based on IBSs. Subjective weights of experts, weights of attributes, and utilities of experts for assessment grades are extended to intervals. Hereinto, the former two can be characterized by four kinds of relevant constraints, and combined with the constraints to be incorporated into the optimization problems for the GC. Also, utilities of experts for assessment grades with the consistent combination of relevant constraints and their intrinsic constraint contribute to the GC. Further, a strategy for experts to renew assessments is designed to improve the GC. A preferentially developed industry selection problem is solved by the proposed method to demonstrate its detailed implementation process, and its validity and applicability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
