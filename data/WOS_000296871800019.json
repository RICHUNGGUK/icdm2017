The key feature of such HRSCs is the integration between the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) and the external heat exchangers. This paper presents a rigorous mathematical programming model, a linear approximation, and a two-stage algorithm for optimizing the design of integrated HRSGs and HRSCs, simultaneously considering the HRSG together with the heat recovery steam network and the intensive steam cycle variables. A detailed application of the methodology is described for an integrated gasification combined cycle plant with CO2 capture and results for other interesting plants are reported. A significant efficiency gain is obtained with respect to usual practice designs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
