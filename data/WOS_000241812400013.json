We discuss issues related to organization, technology, and curricula considerations. In addition, we analyze the modes of cooperation that have been chosen in the students' work on creative problem solving tasks and conclude that for complex learning scenarios successful collaboration and peer tutoring in advanced learning support environments is possible, but requires careful preparation and planning. Further we draw conclusions on possible wider implications for such approaches in the emerging common European Area of Higher Education in the frame of the Bologna process.", "paper_title": "Is there a way to e-Bologna?
