From a user's perspective, however, certificate acquisition is time-consuming and public/private key management is non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a security infrastructure for grid applications, in which users are authenticated using passwords. Our infrastructure allows a user to perform single sign-on based only on a password, without requiring a public key infrastructure. Moreover, hosting servers in our infrastructure are not required to have public key certificates. Nevertheless, our infrastructure supports essential grid security services, such as mutual authentication and delegation, using public key cryptographic techniques without incurring significant additional overheads in comparison with existing approaches.", "paper_title": "User-friendly and certificate-free grid security infrastructure", "paper_id": "WOS:000290963800001"}
