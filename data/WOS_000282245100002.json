However, in general, mismatches between the training data and input data significantly degrade recognition accuracy. Various acoustic model adaptation techniques using a few input utterances have been employed to overcome this problem. In this article, we survey these adaptation techniques, including maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR), and eigenvoice. We also present a schematic view called the adaptation pyramid to illustrate how these methods relate to each other.", "paper_title": "Acoustic Model Adaptation for Speech Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000282245100002"}
