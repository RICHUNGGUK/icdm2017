As traffic often changes from time to time, the problem of grooming dynamic traffic is of great practical value. In this article, we discuss the dynamic grooming of traffic in star and tree networks. A genetic algorithm (GA) based approach is proposed to support arbitrary dynamic traffic patterns, which minimizes the number of ADMs and wavelengths. To evaluate the algorithm, tighter bounds are derived. Computer simulation results show that our algorithm is efficient in reducing both the number of ADMs and wavelengths in tree and star networks.", "paper_title": "Grooming of dynamic traffic in WDM star and tree networks using a genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000252925700003"}
