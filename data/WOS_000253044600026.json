In all these architectures, the main application executes on the microprocessors, while the FPGAs handle kernels with long execution times but that lend themselves to hardware implementations. The authors' research revealed that HPRCs can achieve up to four orders of magnitude improvement in performance, up to three orders of magnitude reduction in power consumption, and a two orders of magnitude savings. in cost and size requirements.", "paper_title": "The promise of high-performance reconfigurable computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000253044600026"}
