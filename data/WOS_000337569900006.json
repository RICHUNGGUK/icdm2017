Pushing this notion further, the motivation of this paper is to demonstrate how an agent-based model of a political process can be designed only using the stakeholders' own descriptions and observation results. The simulation reproduces the discussions among the stakeholders and their subsequent decisions and is able to react to changes in their general settings. The simulation outcomes are also produced in text format so that they are easily understandable to stakeholders and other users. The simulation can be used to explore different sets of rules for the decision processes and their results.", "paper_title": "Using stakeholders' narratives to build an agent-based simulation of a political process", "paper_id": "WOS:000337569900006"}
