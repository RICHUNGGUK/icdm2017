Constitutive models including both concrete cracking and post-peak response of the materials were implemented. Likewise, the time-dependent behavior of the materials has been considered to model the sequential construction process. In order to validate the results obtained by the model, an experimental campaign (from the literature) was used. The comparison of the experimental results to those numerically obtained was satisfactory. The AES is already in use in several Spanish precast concrete factories for the optimization of bridges constructed with precast - prestressed concrete girders. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
