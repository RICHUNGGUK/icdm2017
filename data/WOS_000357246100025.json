Dynamic texture (DT) is essential for understanding the video sequences with spatio-temporal similarities. This paper presents a powerful tool called dynamic fractal analysis to DT description and classification, which integrates rich description of DT with strong robustness to environmental changes. The proposed dynamic fractal spectrum (DFS) for DT sequences is composed of two components. The first one is a volumetric dynamic fractal spectrum component (V-DFS) that captures the stochastic self-similarities of DT sequences by treating them as 3D volumes; the second one is a multi-slice dynamic fractal spectrum component (S-DFS) that encodes fractal structures of repetitive DT patterns on 2D slices along different views of the 3D volume. To fully exploit various types of dynamic patterns in DT, five measurements of DT pixels are collected for the analysis on DT sequences from different perspectives. We evaluated our method on four publicly available benchmark datasets. All the experimental results have demonstrated the excellent performance of our method in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
