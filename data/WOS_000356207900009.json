We introduce here a scientific gateway for computing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data. Based on a distributed workflow using the Web Processing Service (WPS) standard, the gateway aims to be completely interoperable with other standardized tools. The availability of this gateway may help researchers to acquire knowledge of land cover changes more efficiently over very large spatial and temporal extents, which is especially important in the context of Armenia for which timely decision-making is needed.
