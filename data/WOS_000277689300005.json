Nevertheless, many of these organizations either have not clearly formulated the goals they want to achieve through their website or do not know to what extent their website contributes to satisfying these goals. This paper presents a model based on Analytic Network Process (ANP) aimed at helping organization managers to verify if their website contents are appropriate for satisfying the goals they have established. This analysis is achieved by studying the relationships among the goals established for the website, website contents, and potential users grouped into segments. The model was applied to a study case, analyzing the website of a foundation pertaining to a major banking institution in Spain.", "paper_title": "ANALYSIS OF THE ALIGNMENT OF COMPANY GOALS TO WEB CONTENT USING ANP", "paper_id": "WOS:000277689300005"}
