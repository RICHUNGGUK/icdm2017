This utilizes technique from the fields of acoustic, image, and video analysis, for information on news story title, newsman and scene identification. The goal is to construct a compact yet meaningful abstraction of broadcast TV-news, allowing users to browse through large amounts of data in a non-linear fashion with flexibility and efficiency. By adding acoustic analysis, a news program can be partitioned into news and commercial clips, with 90% accuracy on a data set of 400 It TV-news recorded off the air from July 2005 to August 2006. By applying speaker identification and/ or image detection techniques, each news stories can be segmented with a better accuracy of 95.92%. On-screen captions or subtitles are recognized by OCR techniques to produce the text title of each news stories. The extracted title words can be used to link or to navigate more related news contents on the WWW. In cooperation with facial and scene analysis and recognition techniques, OCR results can provide users with multimodal query on specific news stories. Some experimental results are presented and discussed for the system reliability, performance evaluation and comparison.
