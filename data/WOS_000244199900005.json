In a first phase, a number of impact cases are randomly generated, varying the values of the parameters which define the impact problem (radius, length and velocity of the projectile; thickness of the protection). After simulation of each case using a finite element code, the above-mentioned parameters and the results of the simulation (residual velocity and residual mass of the projectile) are used as input and output data to train and validate a neural network. In addition, the number of training cases needed to arrive at a given predictive error is studied. The results are satisfactory, this alternative providing a highly recommended option for armour design tasks, due to its simplicity of handling, low computational cost and efficiency.", "paper_title": "Prediction of the response under impact of steel armours using a multilayer perceptron", "paper_id": "WOS:000244199900005"}
