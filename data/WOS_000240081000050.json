In this paper we present a localization method without on-body sensor (LWOS). The basic idea is that when a person is standing between a pair of transceivers, the human body will attenuate the received signal. From the detected attenuation of Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), LWOS can detect and localize people directly utilizing the wireless communication in WSNs. No additional sensor is needed and users do not need to wear a sensor node any more. A signal-shielding device is used at the transmitter side to minify the interference of RSSI variability from multi-path effects. Experiment results show a good capability of localizing a single user in an indoor environment.", "paper_title": "LWOS: A localization method without on-body sensor in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000050"}
