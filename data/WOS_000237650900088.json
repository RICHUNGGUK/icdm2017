Our protocol is suitable for mobile payment systems where the customer cannot communicate with the issuer due to the absence of Internet access with her mobile device and the costs of implementing other mechanisms of communication between both of them are high. However, our proposal illustrates how a portable device equipped with a short range link (such Bluetooth, Infrared or Wi-Fi) and low computational power should be enough to interact with a vendor machine in order to buy goods in a secure way.", "paper_title": "Payment in a kiosk centric model with mobile and low computational power devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900088"}
