The proposed method takes full advantage of meshfree methods, therefore, no mesh generation and mesh recreation are involved. Meanwhile, compared with the variational multiscale finite element method, a strong assumption, that is, the fine scale vanishes identically over the element boundaries although non-zero within the elements, is not needed. Subsequently two problems which have an available analytical solution of their own are solved to analyze the convergence behaviour of the proposed method. Finally a 2D Burgers' equation having large Re is solved and the results have also been compared with the ones computed by two other methods. The numerical results show that the proposed method can indeed obtain accurate numerical results for 2D Burgers' equation having large Re, which does not refer to the choice of a proper stabilization parameter.
