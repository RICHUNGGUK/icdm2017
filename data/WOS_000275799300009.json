We consider a two-step interference mitigation scheme exploiting the spectrum characteristic of the interference source and channel noise. Good channels without IEEE 802.11 x based wireless local area networks (WLAN) interference are first estimated by considering wideband characteristic of WLAN. Then, channel noise and interference from other Bluetooth devices in good channels are, respectively, mitigated by PC and AFH based on narrowband characteristic of Bluetooth. The performance of the proposed scheme is verified by computer simulation. Simulation results show that the proposed mitigation scheme significantly outperforms conventional schemes.
