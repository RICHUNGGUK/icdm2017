Bone density (quality) is a variable that plays a decisive role in achieving predictable osseointegration and long-term survival of implants. The magnitudes of ultimate occlusal load, which generate ultimate von Mises stress at the critical point of peri-implant area for the spectrum of implants inserted into mandible with four different bone qualities (Lekholm and Zarb classification), were calculated. Geometric models of mandible segment were generated from computed tomography images and analysed with osseointegrated cylindrical implants of various dimensions. Occlusal loads were applied in their natural direction. All materials were assumed to be linearly elastic and isotropic. The investigation suggests that an implant's ultimate occlusal load indicates its load-carrying capacity. As a result, bone loss can be predicted, and viable implants can be selected by comparing the values of their ultimate occlusal load in different clinical conditions.", "paper_title": "FE study of bone quality effect on load-carrying ability of dental implants", "paper_id": "WOS:000337531300001"}
