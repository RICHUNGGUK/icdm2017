At the same time, it has been shown that a 1D string representation of local protein structure retains a degree of structural information. This type of representation can be a powerful tool for protein structure comparison and classification, given the arsenal of sequence comparison tools developed by computational biology. However, in order to do so, there is a need to first understand how much information is contained in various possible 1D representations of protein structure. Results: Here we describe the use of a particular structure fragment library, denoted here as KL-strings, for the 1D representation of protein structure. Using KL-strings, we develop an infrastructure for comparing protein structures with a 1D representation. This study focuses on the added value gained from such a description. We show the new local structure language adds resolution to the traditional three-state (helix, strand and coil) secondary structure description, and provides a high degree of accuracy in recognizing structural similarities when used with a pairwise alignment benchmark. The results of this study have immediate applications towards fast structure recognition, and for fold prediction and classification.", "paper_title": "Using an alignment of fragment strings for comparing protein structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000243992400034"}
