A discussion on proper division of the number of member groups for the purpose of existence of a single integral feasible self-stress mode has been explicitly given. The unilateral properties of the stresses in cables and struts are taken into account. Evaluation of the stability for the structure is also considered. Three numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness in searching initial feasible self-stress mode for tensegrity grid structures. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
