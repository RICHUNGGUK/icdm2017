The networks constructed by Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations have attracted great interests because of their short round-trip delays and wide bandwidths. A challenging problem is to develop a simple and efficient packet routing algorithm for the LEO satellite constellation network. This paper presents a SpiderWeb Topological Network (SWTN) and a distributed packet routing algorithm for the LEO satellite constellation network based on the SWTN. The algorithm gives the minimum propagation delay paths with low computational complexity and requires no routing tables, which is practical for on-board processing. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated through simulations.", "paper_title": "Packet routing algorithm for polar orbit LEO satellite constellation network", "paper_id": "WOS:000236156800007"}
