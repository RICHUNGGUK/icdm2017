A mathematical and computational approach to the cosmological N-body problem is described, with performance and scalability measured up to 256k (2(18)) processors. We present error analysis and scientific application results from a series of more than ten 69 billion (4096(3)) particle cosmological simulations, accounting for 4x10(20) floating point operations. These results include the first simulations using the new constraints on the standard model of cosmology from the Planck satellite.
