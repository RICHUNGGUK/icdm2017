The new test combines a finite set of affine invariant test statistics for MVN through an improved Bonferroni method. The usefulness of such an approach is illustrated by a multiple test including the Mardia and BHEP (Baringhaus-Henze-Epps-Pulley) tests that are among the most recommended procedures for testing MVN. A simulation study carried out for a wide range of alternative distributions, in order to analyze the finite sample power behavior of the proposed multiple test procedure, indicates that the new test demonstrates a good overall performance against other highly recommended MVN tests.
