Although the fractal dimension can be used as an image object descriptor, a multiscale approach, such as multiscale fractal dimension (MFD), increases the amount of information extracted from an object. MFD provides a curve which describes object complexity along the scale. However, this curve presents much redundant information, which could be discarded without loss in performance. Thus, it is necessary the use of a descriptor technique to analyze this curve and also to reduce the dimensionality of these data by selecting its meaningful descriptors. This paper shows a comparative study among different techniques for MFD descriptors generation. It compares the use of well-known and state-of-the-art descriptors, such as Fourier, Wavelet, Polynomial Approximation (PA), Functional Data Analysis (FDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX), kernel PCA, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), geometrical and statistical features. The descriptors are evaluated in a classification experiment using Linear Discriminant Analysis over the descriptors computed from MFD curves from two data sets: generic shapes and rotated fish contours. Results indicate that PCA, FDA, PA and Wavelet Approximation provide the best MFD descriptors for recognition and classification tasks. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
