We present an XSLT converter that converts from one workflow language to another and enables the interoperation between different workflow languages. We discuss strategies for choosing the optimal service from several semantically equivalent Web services in a Grid application. The dynamic selection of Web services involves discovering a set of semantically equivalent services by filtering the available services based on metadata, and selecting an optimal service based on real-time data and/or historical data recorded during prior executions. Finally, we describe the framework and implementation of the workflow portal which aggregates different components of the project using Java portlets.
