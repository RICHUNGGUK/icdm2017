After introducing the idea of preference-oriented (PO) execution, we formally define the concept of PO-optimality. For fully-loaded systems (with 100% utilization), we first propose a PO-optimal scheduler, namely ASAP-Ensured Earliest Deadline (SEED), by focusing on ASAP tasks where the optimality of ALAP tasks' preference is achieved implicitly due to the harmonicity of the PO-optimal schedules for such systems. Then, for under-utilized systems (with less than 100% utilization), we show the discrepancies between different PO-optimal schedules. By extending SEED, we propose a generalized Preference-Oriented Earliest Deadline (POED) scheduler that can obtain a PO-optimal schedule for any schedulable task set. The application of the POED scheduler in a dual-processor fault-tolerant system is further illustrated. We evaluate the proposed PO-optimal schedulers through extensive simulations. The results show that, comparing to that of the well-known EDF scheduler, the scheduling overheads of SEED and POED are higher (but still manageable) due to the additional consideration of tasks' preferences. However, SEED and POED can achieve the preference-oriented execution objectives in a more successful way than EDF. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
