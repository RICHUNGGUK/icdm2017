Three scalar fields are first computed on the input mesh. Then, the intersections of their isocontours with one another are used to construct the highly regular mesh result. The proposed algorithm uses the N-symmetry direction field to guide the edge orientation. Size control is achieved by using a density function on the surface. All user requirements are incorporated into an energy optimization framework of the scalar fields, and then the isocontours of the generated scalar fields are used to construct a high quality result that satisfies all requirements. The experimental results show that the proposed method can successfully handle various user requirements and complex shapes.", "paper_title": "Controllable highly regular triangulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000290941000008"}
