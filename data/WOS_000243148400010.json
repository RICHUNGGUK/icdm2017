The common used similarity measuring method-Euclidean distance cannot always express the exact similarity. In this paper, a novel adaptive self-organized maps based oil bidirectional approximate reasoning (ASOM BAR) is proposed to improve the competitive and cooperative process based on the similarity measuring. Unlike the SOM, the proposed ASOMBAR employs the novel fuzzy similarity distance and fuzzy matching criterion to replace the Euclidean distance and original matching criterion, respectively. The fuzzy similarity distance describes the similarity relation more precisely than the Euclidean distance does. The fuzzy matching criterion pays more attention oil the large weighted elements and less emphasis oil the small weighted elements. Moreover, the new compatible topological neighborhood is also modified basing on the new fuzzy similarity distance and fuzzy matching criterion. Since the ASOMBAR network is self-organizing, the weights of the networks change adaptively according to the input changes. Compared with the well-known growing neural gas (GNG) and SOM, ASOMBAR (when lambda >= 0.5) converges quicker to a smaller distortion error. An information filtering example is used to show the effectiveness of ASOMBAR. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
