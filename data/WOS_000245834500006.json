An example of an ETF science gateway effort is the Neutron Science TeraGrid Gateway (NSTG). The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) resource provider effort (ORNL-RP) now in operation is bridging the gap between a large-scale experimental community and the TeraGrid as a large-scale national cyberinfrastructure. Of particular importance here is the collaboration with the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at ORNL. The U.S. Department of Energy's SNS (http://www.sns.gov/) at ORNL will be commissioned in the spring of 2006 as the world's brightest source of neutrons. Neutron science users can run experiments, generate datasets, perform data reduction, analysis, visualize results, collaborate with remotes users, and archive long-term data in repositories with curation services. The ORNL-RP and the SNS data analysis group have spent 18 months developing and exploring user requirements, including the creation of prototypical services such as a facility portal, data, and application execution services. We describe results from these efforts and discuss implications for science gateway creation. Finally, we show incorporation into implementation planning for the NSTG and SNS architectures. The plan is for a primarily portal-based user interaction supported by a service-oriented architecture for functional implementation.
