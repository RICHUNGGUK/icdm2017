In many cases it is able to circumvent the problem of stagnation. No modification of the original algorithm is required. It is simply used as a software component. Thus the new scheme can be easily implemented to accelerate a fixed point algorithm maximizing some objective function. Some practical examples and simulations are presented to show its ability to accelerate EM-type algorithms converging slowly.", "paper_title": "Parabolic acceleration of the EM algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000262439800004"}
