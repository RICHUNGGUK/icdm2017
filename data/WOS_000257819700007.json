Literature in this domain falls into two main, distinct categories: (1) algorithms or protocols, and (2) application-centric system design. A striking observation is that references across these two categories are minimal, and superficial at best. We argue that this is not accidental, and is the result of three main flaws in the former category of work. Going forward, an application-driven, bottom- up approach is required for meaningful articulation and subsequent solution of any networking issues in WSNs.", "paper_title": "Censor networks: A critique of \"Sensor Networks\" from a systems perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000257819700007"}
