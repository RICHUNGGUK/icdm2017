We call it Kansei Mediation. It is a multimedia communication concept that can cope with non-verbal, emotional and Kansei information. We introduce the distinction between the concepts of Kansei Communication and Kansei Media. We then develop a theory of communication (i.e. Kansei Mediation) as a combination of both. Based on recent results from brain research the proposed concept of Kansei Mediation is developed and discussed. The biased preference towards consciousness in established communication theories is critically reviewed and the relationship to pre- and unconscious brain processes explored. There are two tenets of the Kansei Mediation communication theory: (1) communication based on connected unconciousness, and (2) Satori as the ultimate form of experience.", "paper_title": "Forms and theories of communication: from multimedia to Kansei Mediation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236078600011"}
