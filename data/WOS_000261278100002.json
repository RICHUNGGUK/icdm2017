This approach also helps designers to calibrate and tune the parameters of the system before the actual implementation, and in response to user feedback. In this work we provide a dynamic systems interpretation of the coupling of internal states involved in speed-dependent automatic zooming, and test our implementation oil a text browser oil a Pocket PC instrumented with a tilt sensor. We illustrate simulated and experimental results Of the use of the proposed coupled navigation and zooming interface using tilt and touch screen input. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
