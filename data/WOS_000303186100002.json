Indeed, certain types of singular configurations are usually avoided because of the associated loss of stiffness. These undesirable singularities are direct singularities, in which actuators cannot balance external loads. By contrast, inverse singularities do not cause this loss of stiffness. With appropriate design, the 6-RUS manipulator can be operated in a workspace with no direct singularities but which does contain some inverse ones. In this paper, a methodology for calculating the stiffness matrix of parallel manipulators is presented. Applied to the 6-RUS manipulator, it is demonstrated that inverse singularities are much stiffer than non-singular configurations. In addition, an approach to motion planning is devised which makes use of inverse singularities to obtain stiffer trajectories. Results show a significant improvement in the stiffness along the trajectory. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
