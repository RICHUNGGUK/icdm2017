It computes firstly the epsilon-SVR hyper-plane of a small training sample set and the distances d of all samples to the hyperplane, then deletes the samples not in field epsilon <= d <= d(max) and searches SVs gradually in the scope epsilon <= d <= d(max), and trains step-by-step the final epsilon-SVR. Finally, it analyzes the time complexity of the algorithm, and verifies its convergence in the theory and tests its efficiency by the simulation.", "paper_title": "ALGORITHM OF epsilon-SVR BASED ON A LARGE-SCALE SAMPLE SET: STEP-BY-STEP SEARCH", "paper_id": "WOS:000288802400002"}
