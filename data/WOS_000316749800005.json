This research's focus is to study the possible impact of two different teaching approaches to the acquisition of initial reading skills. By using cognitive modeling, we are hoping to observe through computer simulation the problem solving and decision-making tasks involved in decoding a simple musical score. Our model intends to capture a novice initial coordination of music reading and motor operations on a piano keyboard. As such, it does not aim at modelling advanced sight-reading skills. The paper introduces the Middle-C and Intervallic methods followed by a description of an ACT-R cognitive model and simulation results upon learning with each of the reading methods. Inspection of the simulation results reveals differences in terms of declarative memory and cognitive processing demands. In particular, the Intervallic method requires a larger number of declarative knowledge related to notes, and more execution planning than the Middle-C method.
