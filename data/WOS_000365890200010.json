Virtual identity of millions of users is present at various web-based Social Networking Sites (SNSs) such as Myspace, Facebook, and Twitter. Interactions through SNSs have become a part of our daily practices, which eventually leaves a big trail of behavioral pattern in virtual domain. In this paper, the authors examined the feasibility of person identification using such social network activities as behavioral biometrics. Experimentation includes extraction of a number of idiosyncratic features from SNSs and analysis of their performance as novel social behavioral biometric features.", "paper_title": "Social Behavioral Biometrics: An Emerging Trend", "paper_id": "WOS:000365890200010"}
