The method extends the box algorithm, is easy to implement, and converges quickly to the complete set of nondominated points. Because the method maintains, at any point in time, a diverse set of nondominated points, it is ideally suited for fast approximation of the efficient frontier. In addition, we present several enhancements of the well-known. epsilon-constraint, augmented weighted Tchebycheff, and perpendicular search methods. An extensive computational study, using instances from different classes of combinatorial optimization problems, demonstrates the efficacy of the balanced box method.", "paper_title": "A Criterion Space Search Algorithm for Biobjective Integer Programming: The Balanced Box Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000366057400010"}
