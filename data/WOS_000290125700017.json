This letter employs a technique that combines a projected Jacobi method with a parallel dual-type method to solve the distributed state estimation with constraints problems. Via numerous tests, this letter demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed method on the IEEE 118-bus with four subsystems in a PC network.", "paper_title": "An Experiment for Estimating Accurate States in Distributed Power Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125700017"}
