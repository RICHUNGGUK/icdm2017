The proposed unified dual-field multiplier uses the LSB-first bit-serial architecture for multiplication in GF(P) and GF(2(k)) other than the Montgomery multiplication algorithm, which has been employed by most existing dual-field multipliers. The proposed unified dual-field multiplier costs little space and time complexities. The new multiplier is scalable for operands of any size while other existing dual-field multipliers are only scalable for operands with multiples of m. Furthermore, the proposed multiplier has simplicity, regularity, modularity and concurrency and is very suitable to be implement in VLSI.", "paper_title": "Unified dual-field multiplier in GF(P) and GF(2(k))", "paper_id": "WOS:000267560200001"}
