The optimal linear precoder satisfies a fixed-point equation as a function of the channel and the input constellation. For non-Gaussian inputs, a nondiagonal precoding matrix in general increases the information transmission rate, even for parallel noninteracting channels. Whenever precoding is precluded, the optimal power allocation policy also satisfies a fixed-point equation; we put forth a generalization of the mercury/waterfilling algorithm, previously proposed for parallel noninterfering channels, in which the mercury level accounts not only for the non-Gaussian input distributions, but also for the interference among inputs.", "paper_title": "MIMO Gaussian Channels With Arbitrary Inputs: Optimal Precoding and Power Allocation", "paper_id": "WOS:000275561000013"}
