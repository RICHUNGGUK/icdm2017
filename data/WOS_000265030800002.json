CI develops a coherent set of fundamental theories and denotational mathematics, which form the foundation for most information and knowledge based science and engineering disciplines such as computer science, cognitive science, neuropsychology, systems science, cybernetics, software engineering, knowledge engineering, and computational intelligence. This paper reviews the central doctrine of CI and its applications. The theoretical framework of CI is described on the architecture of CI and its denotational mathematic means. A set of theories and formal models of CI is presented in order to explore the natural and computational intelligence. A wide range of applications of CI are described in the areas of cognitive computers, cognitive properties of knowledge, simulations of human cognitive behaviors, cognitive complexity of software, autonomous agent systems, and computational intelligence.", "paper_title": "A Doctrine of Cognitive Informatics (CI)", "paper_id": "WOS:000265030800002"}
