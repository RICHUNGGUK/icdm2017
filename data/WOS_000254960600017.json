The core idea of the developed scheme is to unite the advantages of the wavenumber-extended optimized scheme and M-AUSMPW+/MLP schemes by predicting a physical distribution of flow variables more accurately in multi-space dimensions. The wavenumber-extended optimization procedure for the finite volume approach based on the conservative requirement is newly proposed for accuracy enhancement, which is required to capture the acoustic portion of the solution in the smooth region. Furthermore, the new distinguishing mechanism which is based on the Gibbs phenomenon in discontinuity, between continuous and discontinuous regions is introduced to eliminate the excessive numerical dissipation in the continuous region by the restricted application of MLP according to the decision of the distinguishing function. To investigate the effectiveness of the developed method, a sequence of benchmark simulations such as spherical wave propagation, nonlinear wave propagation, shock tube problem and vortex preservation test problem are executed. Also, throughout more realistic shock-vortex interaction and muzzle blast flow problems, the utility of the new method for aeroacoustic applications is verified by comparing with the previous numerical or experimental results.
