Comtraces are congruence classes of step sequences, where the congruence relation is defined from two relations simultaneity and serializability on events. They also showed that comtraces correspond to some class of labeled stratified order structures, but left open the question of what class of labeled stratified orders represents comtraces. In this work, we proposed a class of labeled stratified order structures that captures exactly the comtrace notion. Our main technical contributions are representation theorems showing that comtrace quotient monoid, combined dependency graph (Kleijn and Koutny 2008) and our labeled stratified order structure characterization are three different and yet equivalent ways to represent comtraces.
