However, the computational demands are so high that they prohibit researchers with limited computational resources from haplotyping large-scale sequence data. Results: Our graphics processing unit based software delivers haplotyping and imputation accuracies comparable to competing programs at a fraction of the computational cost and peak memory demand.", "paper_title": "Mendel-GPU: haplotyping and genotype imputation on graphics processing units", "paper_id": "WOS:000311303500016"}
