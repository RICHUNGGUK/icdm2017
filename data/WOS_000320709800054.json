We then use projective KS sets to characterize all graphs for which the chromatic number is strictly larger than the quantum chromatic number. Here, the quantum chromatic number is defined via a nonlocal game based on graph coloring. We further show that from any graph with separation between these two quantities, one can construct a classical channel for which entanglement assistance increases the one-shot zero-error capacity. As an example, we exhibit a new family of classical channels with an exponential increase.", "paper_title": "New Separations in Zero-Error Channel Capacity Through Projective Kochen-Specker Sets and Quantum Coloring", "paper_id": "WOS:000320709800054"}
