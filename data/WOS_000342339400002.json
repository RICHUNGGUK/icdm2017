Given a set of existing facilities and a set of clients, an OL query asks for a location to build a new facility that optimizes a certain cost metric (defined based on the distances between the clients and the facilities). Several techniques have been proposed to address OL queries, assuming that all clients and facilities reside in an space. In practice, however, movements between spatial locations are usually confined by the underlying road network, and hence, the actual distance between two locations can differ significantly from their distance. Motivated by the deficiency of the existing techniques, this paper presents a comprehensive study on OL queries in road networks. We propose a unified framework that addresses three variants of OL queries that find important applications in practice, and we instantiate the framework with several novel query processing algorithms. We further extend our framework to efficiently monitor the OLs when locations for facilities and/or clients have been updated. Our dynamic update methods lead to efficient answering of continuous optimal location queries. We demonstrate the efficiency of our solutions through extensive experiments with large real data.", "paper_title": "Dynamic monitoring of optimal locations in road network databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000342339400002"}
