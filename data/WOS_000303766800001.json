These communication paradigms promise to change and redefine, in a reasonably short period of time, the most common way of our everyday living. The continuous advances in the field of Wireless Sensor Networks and their direct application in Smart Spaces are clear examples of it. However, in order for this kind of new generation infrastructures to have a large-scale dissemination, there are still some open issues to tackle. In this way, this paper presents nSOM, a service-oriented framework based on sensor network design that provides internetworking services with the Internet cloud. This lightweight middleware architecture implements an agent-based virtual sensor service approach which is a compact semantic knowledge management scheme based on a dynamic composition model.", "paper_title": "Pervasive Smart Spaces and Environments: A Service-Oriented Middleware Architecture for Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000303766800001"}
