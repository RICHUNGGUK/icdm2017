The Extensible Markup Language (XML) has become a de-facto standard for data modeling and exchange in recent years. Efforts on modeling imprecision and representing such data in XML have not been fully developed. In this paper, an XML based fuzzy data representation and querying system is presented. Complex and imprecise data are represented using a fuzzy extension of XML. The representation forms the basis for a system which enables fuzzy querying on XML documents using XQuery, a XML query language. The system also enables restructuring of XML Schemas through merging of elements of the XML documents. By using this feature of the system, application specific XML Schema and XML documents can be generated from the existing documents.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy data representation and querying in XML database", "paper_id": "WOS:000256307200004"}
