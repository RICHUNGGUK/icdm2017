A nonlinear feedback controller is designed to achieve finite-time function projective synchronization. Some novel and useful finite-time function projective synchronization criteria are derived based on finite-time stability theory. And another controller is designed to ensure function projective synchronization of complex multi-links networks with time-varying delay. Finally, illustrative examples are given to show the feasibility of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Finite-Time Function Projective Synchronization in Complex Multi-links Networks with Time-Varying Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000347684700005"}
