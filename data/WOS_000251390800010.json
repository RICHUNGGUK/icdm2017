Because special domains are required in those applications, Bittner and Urban constructed interpolating divergence-free multi-wavelets based on cubic Hermite splines in 2005. In this paper, we construct interpolating curl-free multi-wavelets and give two wavelet estimates for a class of vector Besov spaces.", "paper_title": "Interpolatory curl-free wavelets and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000251390800010"}
