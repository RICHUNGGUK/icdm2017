In recent years, many researchers have paid more and more attention to this application of image fractal coding. In this paper, a new statistical method, based on kernel density estimation, is used for analyzing fractal coding parameters. The fractal signatures are then extracted for texture image retrieval. Experimental results show that the proposed method not only has higher retrieval rate but also faster retrieval speed than existing method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
