The inherent dynamic and large-scale characteristics of grid environments make their resource discovery a challenging task. In recent years, different approaches have been proposed for resource discovery, attempting to tackle the challenges of grid environments and improve the efficiency. Being aware of these challenges and approaches is worthwhile in order to choose an appropriate approach according to the application in different organizations. This study reviews the most important factors that should be considered and challenges to be tackled in order to develop an efficient grid resource discovery system.", "paper_title": "THE EFFICIENCY CHALLENGES OF RESOURCE DISCOVERY IN GRID ENVIRONMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000343712400005"}
