In comparison with the conventional ontology, the event ontology represents knowledge with a higher granularity. For event classes, non-classified relations are more important such as cause-effect relation and follow relation, and there are certain associative strengths between them, called event class influence factor. In this paper, we propose a method of event ontology reasoning based on event class influence factors. After introducing event, event class and event ontology model, we illustrate some related theorems and inferences. The experimental results show that the method proposed has a certain significance for analyzing event scenarios and pre-warning disasters.", "paper_title": "Event ontology reasoning based on event class influence factors", "paper_id": "WOS:000209203600005"}
