In ReALE we replace the rezoning phase of classical ALE method by a rezone where we allow the connectivity between cells of the mesh to change where rezoned grid is a polygonal mesh. Nevertheless, the ability of pure Lagrangian method to deal with multi-material problem, where mesh is aligned with material interfaces, is lost. In this work we have implemented MOF interface reconstruction on polygonal mesh in ReALE framework. This leads to a formulation that recover the Lagrangian features of following material and material interface that we lose using standard ALE methods with fixed connectivity. Some numerical examples, are used to clearly illustrate the robustness and accuracy of the new method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
