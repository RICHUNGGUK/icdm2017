Especially, optical communication offers huge bandwidth and makes it possible to build communication networks of very high bandwidth. However, contention of shared channels may be challenging. In this paper we examine the problem setup called h-relation routing on complete networks under so-called OCPC or 1-collision assumption. We present some simple and robust communication algorithms and study their efficiency, analytically and experimentally. The analyses and experiments show that if there is enough parallel slackness, then routing is work-optimal, and the amortized routing cost per packet is a small constant. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
