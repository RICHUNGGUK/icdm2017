Some of the main advantages and properties of the new operator are studied. Moreover, in the situations where the given arguments about all the attribute weights, the attribute values and the expert weights are expressed in the form of linguistic labels variables, we develop an approach based on the IUPLHAA operator for multiple attribute group decision making with uncertain pure linguistic environment. Finally, an illustrative example is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its feasibility and practicality.", "paper_title": "Induced Uncertain Pure Linguistic Hybrid Averaging Aggregation Operator and Its Application to Group Decision Making", "paper_id": "WOS:000363225700007"}
