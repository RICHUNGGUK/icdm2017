Traditionally, item scores are estimated by averaging all the ratings with equal weights. To improve the accuracy of estimated item scores, user reputation [a.k.a., user reputation (UR)] is incorporated. The existing algorithms on UR, however, have underplayed the role of topics in rating systems. In this paper, we first reveal that UR is topic-biased from our empirical investigation. However, existing algorithms cannot capture this characteristic in rating systems. To address this issue, we propose a topic-biased model (TBM) to estimate UR in terms of different topics as well as item scores. With TBM, we develop six topic-biased algorithms, which are subsequently evaluated with experiments using both real-world and synthetic data sets. Results of the experiments demonstrate that the topic-biased algorithms effectively estimate UR across different topics and produce more robust item scores than previous reputation-based algorithms, leading to potentially more robust rating systems.", "paper_title": "A topic-biased user reputation model in rating systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000359548100004"}
