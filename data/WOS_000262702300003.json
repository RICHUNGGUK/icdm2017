Recently, a seam based approach for content-aware image resizing was proposed by Avidan and Shamir. Their results are impressive, but because the method uses dynamic programming many times, it is slow. In this paper, we present a more efficient algorithm for seam based content-aware image resizing, which searches seams through establishing the matching relation between adjacent rows or columns. We give a linear algorithm to find the optimal matches within a weighted bipartite graph composed of the pixels in adjacent rows or columns. Therefore, our method is fast (e.g. our method needs only about 100 ms to reduce a 768 x 1024 image's width to 1/3 while Avidan and Shamir's method needs 12 s). This supports immediate image resizing whereas Avidan and Shamir's method requires a more costly pre-processing step to enable subsequent real-time processing. A fast method such as the one proposed will be also needed for future real-time video resizing applications.", "paper_title": "Real-time content-aware image resizing", "paper_id": "WOS:000262702300003"}
