In this paper, technology mapping and cell merger algorithms for asynchronous threshold networks are introduced. The cell merger problem is a restricted form of technology mapping where only adjacent cells are merged. The two algorithms can each target either delay or area, or a combined delay-area cost function. Experiments were performed on substantial industrial design examples (DES and GCD circuits) that had already been optimized by an existing commercial asynchronous synthesis tool flow. Average delay improvements of 31.6% for basic technology mapping and 29.6% for basic cell merger were obtained. Average area improvements of 9.5 % for basic technology mapping and 8.5 % for basic cell merger were also obtained. Additional experiments were performed on the largest MCNC combinational benchmarks with similar results. Finally, targeting a hybrid cost function, area minimization under specified hard timing constraints, a further area reduction of up to 10.7% on average in technology mapping was recovered without compromising the overall system performance. The new algorithms are the first systematic and general mapping approach for asynchronous threshold networks, targeting delay or area, which preserve the timing- robustness properties of the initial unoptimized circuits.", "paper_title": "Technology mapping and cell merger for asynchronous threshold networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000254226000008"}
