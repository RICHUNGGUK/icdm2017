More precisely, if both parties are honest then they learn each other's identity, and if anyone is cheating then either both of them learn each other's identity or no one learns no information about the identity of the other. We propose a security model and a provably secure optimistic fair identification protocol.", "paper_title": "Fair identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884700004"}
