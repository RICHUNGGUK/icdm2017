The more restricted fragment obtained by dropping the finiteness predicate has been shown to have a solvable satisfiability problem in a previous paper, by establishing for it a small model property. We exploit the latter decision result for dealing also with the finiteness predicate (and therefore with the infiniteness predicate too) and prove a small witness-model property for MLSSPF, asserting that any model for a satisfiable formula Phi with m distinct variables of the fragment of our interest admits a finite representation bounded by c(m), where c is a suitable computable function. Since such candidate representations are finitely many, their number does not exceed a known bound, and it can be recognized algorithmically whether they indeed represent a(n infinite) model for the input formula, the decidability of the satisfiability problem for MLSSPF follows.
