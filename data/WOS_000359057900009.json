Design/methodology/approach - A comparison of partial least squares (linear model) and WarpPLS (non-linear model) has been run for each acceptation of technology model: TRA, TAM0, TAM1, TAM2, TAM3, UTAUT, UTAUT2. The data set collects the information of mobile internet users. Findings - The authors have concluded that UTAUT2 model obtains a better explanation power than the rest of technology acceptance models (TAMs) in the sample of mobile internet users. Furthermore, all models have a better explanation power using non-linear relationships than the traditional linear approach. Originality/value - The vast majority of research published to date with regard to the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) are based on structural equation models assuming linear relationships between variables. The originality of this study is that it incorporates non-linear relationships and compares the same models using both approaches.", "paper_title": "A comparison of the different versions of popular technology acceptance models A non-linear perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000359057900009"}
