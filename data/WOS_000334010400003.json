In this work, a computational geometry based approach for estimation of the treetops of a grove is implemented and tested. This approach is based on convex hull techniques to estimate the volume of a treetop from 3D raw laser data. The method shown here optimizes both the computational cost associated with the convex hull processing and the volume of stored information, which become crucial for in-field experimentation. Additionally, this work presents an analysis of how the localization of the range sensor used for treetop volume estimation, directly affects the information regarding such treetop. Thus, a mathematical and empirical analysis of treetop volume estimation using a GPS antenna and a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm is included, showing that the SLAM algorithm provides with a better estimation. The mathematical foundation of the proposal, as well as convergency tests and real-time experimentation results are also shown in this work. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
