It claims to combine the pros and limit the cons of the traditional Database Management Systems (DBMS) and Native XML Database (NXD). In this paper, we focus on XML data update management in XEnDB. Our aim is to preserve the conceptual semantic constraints and to avoid inconsistencies in XML data during update operations. In this current era when XML data interchange mostly occurs in a commercial setting, it is highly critical that data exchanged be correct at all times, and hence data integrity in XML data is paramount. To achieve our goal, we firstly classify different constraints in XML documents. Secondly, we transform these constraints into XML Schema with embedded SQL annotations. Thirdly, we propose a generic update methodology that utilizes the proposed schema. We then implement the method in one of the current XEnDB products. Since XEnDB has a Relational Model as the underlying data model, our update method uses the SQL/XML as a standard language. Finally, we also analyze the processing performance. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
