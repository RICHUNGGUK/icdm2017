Today, much of this information is represented and processed digitally. Digital image processing is any form of signal processing for which the input is an image, such as a photograph or video frame; the output of image processing may be either an image or a set of characteristics or parameters related to the image. In this context, implementation and evaluation of image processing algorithms are complex tasks that require highly technical and multidisciplinary skills. Graduate students are required to develop both practical and theoretical exercises to understand how an algorithm works; however, they have to learn in an individual manner without adequate support. This article presents an innovative Project-Based Learning approach to teach image processing algorithms using an FPGA-based tool as the main support. Thus, instead of learning heavy programming tasks and mathematical functions, students are led step by step through five phases and then allowed to experiment with different algorithms. This article evaluates the proposed tool and shows results with diverse algorithms. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
