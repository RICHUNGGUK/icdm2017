The life-time of such networks depends on battery power at each node. This paper presents a distributed fault-tolerant topology control algorithm for minimum energy consumption in multi-hop wireless networks. This algorithm is an extension of cone-based topology control algorithm [19, 12]. The main advantage of this algorithm is that each node decides on its power based on local information about the relative angle of its neighbors and as a result of these local decisions, a fault-tolerant connected network is formed on the nodes. It is done by preserving the connectivity of a network upon failing of, at most, k nodes (k is a constant) and simultaneously minimize the transmission power at each node to some extent. In addition, simulations are studied to support the effectiveness of this algorithm. Finally, it is shown how to extend this algorithm to 3-dimensions.", "paper_title": "Fault-tolerant and 3-dimensional distributed topology control algorithms in wireless multi-hop networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000236356500004"}
