For a graph class T, the F-DELETION problem takes as input a graph G and an integer k. The question is whether it is possible to delete at most k vertices from G such that the resulting graph belongs to F. Whether PERFECT DELETION is fixed-parameter tractable, and whether CHORDAL DELETION admits a polynomial kernel, when parameterized by k, have been stated as open questions in previous work. We show that PERFECT DELETION and WEAKLY CHORDAL DELETION are W[2]-hard when parameterized by k. In search of positive results, we study a restricted variant of the F-DELETION problem. In this restricted variant, the deleted vertices must be taken from a specified set X, and we parameterize by vertical bar X vertical bar. We show that for PERFECT DELETION and WEAKLY CHORDAL DELETION, although this restriction immediately ensures fixed-parameter tractability, it is not enough to yield polynomial kernels, unless NP subset of coNP/poly. On the positive side, for CHORDAL DELETION, the restriction enables us to obtain a kernel with O(vertical bar X vertical bar(4)) vertices. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
