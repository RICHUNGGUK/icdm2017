According to the definition of the qualitative features, the similarity values determined are based on conceptual neighbourhood diagrams or interval distances. An approximate matching algorithm between object descriptions is defined and applied to tile mosaic assembling and results of previous approaches are improved. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
