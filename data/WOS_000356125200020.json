In the method, a generalized model is proposed for bipolar auto-associative memory and establishing an exponential stable criteria of the networks. The model is of generality with considering time delay and introducing a tunable slope activation function, and can robustly recall the memorized external input patterns in an auto-associative way. Experimental verification demonstrates that the proposed method is more effective and generalized than other existing ones. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
