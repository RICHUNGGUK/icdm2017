However, the method is able to produce an overall planar view of any anatomical or real-life object, provided it is topologically compatible with the sphere (i.e. genus 0). It computes the shading of the original surface for rays casted from a nearby surrounding surface and unfolds this surface in a 2D plane, without introducing major distortions. The flat image consisting of the mapped shading results has the advantage that the sulci (i.e. the grooves characterizing the superficial brain geometry) of the cortical surface of the brain can be followed in their entirety, which facilitates the study and the recognition of their patterns. The new visualization method is integrated into a versatile medical image analysis environment. A first study to assess its usefulness has been accomplished and is also reported in this paper.", "paper_title": "A method to construct flat maps of the brain's surface and its application", "paper_id": "WOS:000240665500005"}
