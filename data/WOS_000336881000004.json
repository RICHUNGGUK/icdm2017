A term called 'response-time' in decision-making process has been defined in this study, which refers to a lead time in decision-making and its implementation. This paper contributes a methodology for decision-maker to study the decision-making process and identify a suitable decision-making approach, while considering critical factors such as decision automation levels, routing flexibility levels, and control strategies. Considering the complexity in modelling an FMS with routing flexibility levels, control strategies (sequencing and dispatching rules), and decision-making process with information system, computer simulation modelling has been employed to study the makespan performance. The results show that decision-making process with response-time for FMS control performs as good as with the real-time control when routing flexibility level is low. Furthermore, under some specific situations, it even outperforms the real-time control. This research gives insight to decision-maker to identify whether a decision system with response-time will be more suitable and economically justified, or real-time decision-making system is more appropriate.
