A key challenge posed by interactive narrative is devising effective director agent models that dynamically sequence story events according to players' actions and needs. In this paper, we describe a supervised machine-learning framework to model director agent strategies in an educational interactive narrative Crystal Island. Findings from two studies with human participants are reported. The first study utilized a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm where human \"wizards\" directed participants through Crystal Island's mystery storyline by dynamically controlling narrative events in the game environment. Interaction logs yielded training data for machine learning the conditional probabilities of a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) model of the human wizards' directorial actions. Results indicate that the DBN model achieved significantly higher precision and recall than naive Bayes and bigram model techniques. In the second study, the DBN director agent model was incorporated into the runtime version of Crystal Island, and its impact on students' narrative-centered learning experiences was investigated. Results indicate that machine-learning director agent strategies from human demonstrations yield models that positively shape players' narrative-centered learning and problem-solving experiences.", "paper_title": "A Supervised Learning Framework for Modeling Director Agent Strategies in Educational Interactive Narrative", "paper_id": "WOS:000337901800010"}
