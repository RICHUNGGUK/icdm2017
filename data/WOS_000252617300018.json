In this paper we propose a dissolve detection algorithm using the characteristics of edge in MPEG compressed video. Using the intensity change information of edge pixels obtained by Sobel edge detector, we detect the location of a dissolve and its precise duration. We also present a new reliable method to eliminate the false dissolves. The proposed algorithm is tested in various types of videos, and the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and robust.", "paper_title": "Dissolve detection using intensity change information of edge pixels", "paper_id": "WOS:000252617300018"}
