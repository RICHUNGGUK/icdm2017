One of the proposed approaches leverages on the separation of the identifier and the locator roles of IP addresses, leading to the LISP (Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol) protocol, currently under development at the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). Up to now, researches made on LISP have been rather theoretical, i.e., based on simulations/emulations often using Internet traffic traces. There is no work in the literature attempting to assess the state of its deployment and how this has evolved in recent years. This paper aims at bridging this gap by presenting a first measurement study on the existing worldwide LISP network (lisp4.net). Early results indicate that there is a steady growth of the LISP network but also that network manageability might receive a higher priority than performance in a large scale deployment.", "paper_title": "A First Measurement Look at the Deployment and Evolution of the Locator/ID Separation Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000323832900006"}
