In the present paper a novel reformulation of the elastodynamic equations for Hookean solids is proposed so that they contain the same unknowns as the Navier-Stokes equations, namely velocities and pressure. A separate equation for pressure correction is derived from the constitutive equation of the solid material. The system of equations for both media is discretised using the same method (finite volume on collocated grids) and the same iterative technique (SIMPLE algorithm) is employed for the pressure-velocity coupling. With this approach, the continuity of the velocity field at the interface is automatically satisfied. A special pressure correction procedure that enforces the compatibility of stresses at the interface is also developed. The new method is employed for the prediction of pressure wave propagation in an elastic tube. Computations were carried out with different meshes and time steps and compared with available analytic solutions as well as with numerical results obtained using the Flugge equations that describe the deformation of thin shells. For all cases examined the method showed very good performance. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
