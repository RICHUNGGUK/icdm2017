Using an ontology approach, a Configurable Information Service Platform is proposed for the development of IoT-based application. Based on an abstract information model, information encapsulating, composing, discomposing, transferring, tracing, and interacting in Product Lifecycle Management could be carried out. Combining ontology and representational state transfer (REST)-ful service, the platform provides an information support base both for data integration and intelligent interaction. A case study is given to verify the platform. It is shown that the platform provides a promising way to realize IoT application in semantic level.", "paper_title": "IoT-Based Configurable Information Service Platform for Product Lifecycle Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800070"}
