Furthermore, the field would greatly benefit from a better integration of this wealth of data with evolutionary concepts. Results: Here, we present MANTIS, a relational database for the analysis of (i) gains and losses of genes on specific branches of the metazoan phylogeny, (ii) reconstructed genome content of ancestral species and (iii) over- or under-representation of functions/processes and tissue specificity of gained, duplicated and lost genes. MANTIS estimates the most likely positions of gene losses on the true phylogeny using a maximum-likelihood function. A user-friendly interface and an extensive query system allow to investigate questions pertaining to gene identity, phylogenetic mapping and function/expression parameters.", "paper_title": "MANTIS: a phylogenetic framework for multi-species genome comparisons", "paper_id": "WOS:000252498500001"}
