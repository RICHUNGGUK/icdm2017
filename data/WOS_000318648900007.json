The proposed algorithm performs subspace division of the signal space by using the total least squares method to use all available degrees of freedom in the system. The algorithm also uses the minimum mean square error as a criterion to maximize the sum rate of the system. Simulation results indicate that the sum rate of the proposed algorithm outperforms the sum rates of previous works in the context of a network with uncoordinated interference. The performance levels of these algorithms are also compared for different uncoordinated interference strengths. Almost the same trend is obtained for the sum rate performance.", "paper_title": "Distributed Interference Alignment Algorithm for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Networks with Uncoordinated Interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000318648900007"}
