However, the a\"\" (2)-norm employed by standard PCA is not robust to outliers. In this paper, we propose a kernel PCA method for fast and robust PCA, which we call Euler-PCA (e-PCA). In particular, our algorithm utilizes a robust dissimilarity measure based on the Euler representation of complex numbers. We show that Euler-PCA retains PCA's desirable properties while suppressing outliers. Moreover, we formulate Euler-PCA in an incremental learning framework which allows for efficient computation. In our experiments we apply Euler-PCA to three different computer vision applications for which our method performs comparably with other state-of-the-art approaches.", "paper_title": "Euler Principal Component Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000314719000007"}
