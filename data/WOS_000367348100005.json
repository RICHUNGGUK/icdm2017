Understanding the problem depends on identifying the essential mathematical structure of derivations. This is trivial in the case of context free grammar, where the parse structures are ordered trees; in the case of type logical categorial grammar, the parse structures are proof nets. However, with respect to multiplicatives intrinsic proof nets have not yet been given for displacement calculus, and proof nets for additives, which have applications to polymorphism, are not easy to characterise. Here we approach multiplicative-additive spurious ambiguity by means of the proof-theoretic technique of focalisation.", "paper_title": "Multiplicative-Additive Focusing for Parsing as Deduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000367348100005"}
