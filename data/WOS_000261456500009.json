There are two fluid systems in these phenomena, which are air flow (wind field) and dust particle flow, Due to the complex mechanism of two fluid systems and the interaction between them, few works have been done oil simulating these phenomena. In this paper, for the first time, we have simulated such two fluid phenomena under a unified framework by a Reynolds-average two-fluid model (RATFM) based on the Navier-Stokes equations. In RATFM, the air flow and dust particle flow are simulated accurately by two different Navier-Stokes equations, respectively. The interaction between two fluids is also simulated by introducing an interaction force. Then, a RATFM solver oil CPU is designed to achieve fast simulation. in addition, multiple scattering effects of the participating media are considered for realistic rendering. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
