The high number of possible candidates creates the necessity of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship models in order to guide the DNA polymerase inhibitors. In this work, we revised different computational studies for a very large and heterogeneous series of DNA polymerase inhibitors. First, we reviewed QSAR methods with different compounds to find out the structural requirements for DNA polymerase inhibitory activity. Last, we report a new LDA analysis with the different molecular descriptors calculated with DRAGON software.", "paper_title": "Review of QSAR for DNA Polymerase Inhibitors and New Models for Heterogeneous Series of Compounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000298590400004"}
