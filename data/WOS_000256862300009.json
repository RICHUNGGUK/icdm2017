To fully obtain diversity gain in the current MB-OFDM system when a time-domain spreading (TDS) is adopted, two consecutive OFDM symbols are designed to be cyclic shifted against each other. Simulation results indicate that the MB-OFDM system using additional frequency diversity outperforms conventional MB-OFDM system.", "paper_title": "Performance of multiband OFDM systems with extra diversity", "paper_id": "WOS:000256862300009"}
