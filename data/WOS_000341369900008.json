User performance concerns, for example the likelihood of user errors and time needed for a user to complete tasks, are important areas of consideration. For safety-critical systems it is vital that tools are available to support the analysis of such properties before expensive design commitment has been made. In this work, we give a unified formal verification framework for integrating two kinds of analysis: (1) predicting bounds for task-completion times via exhaustive state-space exploration, and (2) detecting user-error related design issues. The framework is based on a generic model of cognitively plausible behaviour that captures assumptions about cognitive behaviour decided through a process of interdisciplinary negotiation. Assumptions made in an analysis, including those relating to the performance consequences of users recovering from likely errors, are also investigated in this framework. We further present a novel way of exploring the consequences of cognitive mismatches, on both correctness and performance grounds. We illustrate our analysis approach with a realistic medical device scenario: programming an infusion pump. We explore an initial pump design and then two variations based on features found in real designs, illustrating how the approach identifies both timing and human error issues.", "paper_title": "Combining human error verification and timing analysis: a case study on an infusion pump", "paper_id": "WOS:000341369900008"}
