Since the sensors can only be arranged in the translational degrees of freedom (DOF) of the structure in the stateof-the-practice, a method based on the simplified finite element (FE) model which is able to avoid distinguishing the translational and rotational DOFs is presented. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and compare the different sensor placement techniques, the effective independence (EfI) method, EfI-DPR (the driving-point residue, DPR) and Uniform methods were employed. The calculation results show that the presented approach is easy in understanding and could be used practically by civil engineers. EfI method provides a more effective method for optimal sensor placement than other ones to identify the vibration characteristics of the studied building.", "paper_title": "Sensor placement optimisation for Dalian international trade mansion focusing on application demands", "paper_id": "WOS:000345236900003"}
