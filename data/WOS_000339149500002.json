We describe the development of a multimodal pen-based system that enables creation of audio-enhanced paper photos and the application of this technology to two domains: older adults with aphasia working to regain expressive and receptive language after a stroke, and older adults wanting to interact with a family member of advanced age with memory loss. Our pen-based authoring software enables caregivers, both therapists and family members, to create audio-enhanced paper photos to encourage meaningful and emotionally appropriate interaction with the older adults they support. We examine the ways in which emotional information is embedded in audio-enhanced photos and how this approach addresses various aspects of emotional wellbeing in late adulthood.
