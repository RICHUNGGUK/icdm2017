How to effectively and efficiently calculate the energy consumption, particularly when moving from uni-core platform to multi-core platform, is a critical issue. Moreover, when taking the interdependency between power and temperature into account, the estimation of energy consumption becomes more challenging. In this paper, we present a closed-form analytical solution to calculate the system thermal steady-state energy consumption for a periodic voltage schedule on a multi-core platform, with the leakage/temperature dependency taken into consideration. Our experiments show that the proposed method can achieve an average speedup of over the existing related work, with a relative error no more than 1.5 %.", "paper_title": "Energy calculation for periodic multi-core scheduling in system thermal steady state with consideration of leakage and temperature dependency", "paper_id": "WOS:000357345600011"}
