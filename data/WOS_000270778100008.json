Previous techniques rely oil a periodic tiling of rocks and generate unrealistic repetitive patterns. In contrast, our approach relies on a modified cot-tier cube algorithm to generate a set of aperiodic tiles. We generalize the construction method so that the geometry of rocks should straddle corner cubes with a view to avoiding unrealistic gaps in the arrangement of rocks. Moreover, we propose an original technique to control the shape of rocks into contact by, computing the Voronoi cells using a parameterized anisotropic distance. Our method has been successfully used to generate landscapes and stone huts and walls with thousands of rocks piled together", "paper_title": "Procedural Generation of Rock Piles using Aperiodic Tiling", "paper_id": "WOS:000270778100008"}
