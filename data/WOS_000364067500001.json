To address this challenge, we propose an MR*-tree based indexing mechanism for supporting the fast and energy-efficient retrieval of spatial objects in mobile PowerPoint pages. Based on this, techniques are developed to support the operations when editing mobile PowerPoint pages. Prototype has been implemented for facilitating the operations of spatial objects when editing mobile PowerPoint pages. Experimental evaluations on computers, pads, and smart phones show the effectiveness and efficiency of this technique.", "paper_title": "MR*-Tree: Novel Indexing and Retrieving Mechanism for Spatial Objects in Mobile PowerPoint Pages", "paper_id": "WOS:000364067500001"}
