Our methodology is made up of two steps. Firstly, a Bayesian network lightfield descriptor (BLD) is built, based on graph model learning, to overcome the disadvantages of the existing view-based methods. The 3D object is put into the lightfield, multi-view images are obtained; then features of the new multi-view images are extracted. Based on the extracted features, a Bayesian network learning algorithm is used to construct the BLD. Secondly, the 3D object is efficiently retrieved, based on graph model matching and learning from relevant feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm has better performance and efficiency than the existing view-based methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
