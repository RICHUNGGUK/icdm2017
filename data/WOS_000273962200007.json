This article presents ways in which web search quality can be improved by a fuller use of Internet archive capabilities based around a scientific conference information retrieval system accustomed to accessing current and archived data. Verification of this application was then carried out on the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) conference portals. In the second part of this article, quality metrics are defined which allow monitoring of archive repository past web content. Metrics were then calculated for three \"mainstream\" generally accessible World Wide Web (WWW) portals. The article concludes by demonstrating the degree to which utilization of pastweb pages can significantly improve search-and-browse Internet quality.", "paper_title": "Quality Analysis of Domain-Dependent Internet Archives", "paper_id": "WOS:000273962200007"}
