Here, its advantages are analytically attested. A novel realization architecture is proposed that has higher performance and uses lower hardware resources In comparison to the other reported architectures. The Structure of the proposed active rule detection unit is scalable in terms of the number of inputs, the number of membership functions and their bit widths. The proposed architecture is flexible in term of membership function shape as well. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
