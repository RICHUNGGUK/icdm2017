Our tableau calculi are sound, complete, cut-free and have the analytic superformula property, thereby giving decision procedures for all of these logics. We also use our calculi to obtain complexity results for five of these logics. The complexity of the remaining logic was known.", "paper_title": "Clausal Tableaux for Multimodal Logics of Belief", "paper_id": "WOS:000269316800002"}
