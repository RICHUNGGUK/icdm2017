We prove that for q a prime power that is large enough and prime to 6, a fixed positive proportion of all genus 2 curves over the field with q elements can be parameterized by 3-radicals. This results in the existence of a deterministic encoding into these curves when q is congruent to 2 modulo 3. We extend this construction to parameterizations by l-radicals for small odd integers l, and make it explicit for l = 5.", "paper_title": "THE GEOMETRY OF SOME PARAMETERIZATIONS AND ENCODINGS", "paper_id": "WOS:000346108100006"}
