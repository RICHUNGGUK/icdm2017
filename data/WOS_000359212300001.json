However, the process of analyzing images through the use of one camera is very sensitive to neighboring environmental factors, such as illumination, background, and noise; thus, it is hard to guarantee precision. To extract proper information from images more precisely in visual sensor networks, this paper proposes an image-switching strategy where, among different types of installed cameras, the one camera best suited to neighboring circumstances is chosen. The proposed strategy is to first receive initial images as input data and then extract multiple features representing neighboring circumstances from the input images. Subsequently, it is to define the neighboring circumstances metric, which is the weighted sum of the extracted features, and to dynamically switch cameras to obtain images in accordance with the neighboring circumstances. The results of the experiment show that the proposed dynamic switching strategy reliably chooses, from among different cameras, the one camera that is best suited to the neighboring circumstances.", "paper_title": "A Multiple Feature-Based Image-Switching Strategy in Visual Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000359212300001"}
