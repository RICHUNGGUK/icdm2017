Many of the coloring problems model partitioning needs arising in compression-based computation of Jacobian and Hessian matrices using Algorithmic Differentiation. Several of the coloring problems also find important applications in many areas outside derivative computation, including frequency assignment in wireless networks, scheduling, facility location, and concurrency discovery and data movement operations in parallel and distributed computing. The presentation in this article includes a high-level description of the various coloring algorithms within a common design framework, a detailed treatment of the theory and efficient implementation of known as well as new vertex ordering techniques upon which the coloring algorithms rely, a discussion of the package's software design, and an illustration of its usage. The article also includes an extensive experimental study of the major algorithms in the package using real-world as well as synthetically generated graphs.", "paper_title": "ColPack: Software for Graph Coloring and Related Problems in Scientific Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000326289800001"}
