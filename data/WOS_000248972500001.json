Self-scheduling schemes, which are suitable for parallel loops with independent iterations on cluster computer system, they have been designed in the past. In this paper, we propose a new scheme that can adjust the scheduling parameter dynamically on an extremely heterogeneous PC-based cluster and Grid computing environments in order to improve system performance. A Grid computing environment consists of multiple PC-based clusters is constructed using Globus Toolkit and MPICH-G2 middleware. The experimental results show that our scheduling can result in higher performance than other similar schemes on Grid computing environments. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
