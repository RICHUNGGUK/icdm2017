It belongs to the family of distributions generated by the Gaussian hypergeometric function and it can be expressed as a generalized beta mixture of a geometric distribution. The introduction of a new parameter makes the model very suitable to fit the empiric distribution tails and the effect of infinite variance is not possible. Several examples show more accurate fits when the extended distribution is used and the results are compared with other biparametric extensions of the Yule distribution. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
