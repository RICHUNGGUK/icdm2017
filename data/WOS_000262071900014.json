Up to now most actions in the WWW are sorts of human-computer interaction, but the introduction of the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) changed the perception. The Internet will be seen as a great space of information and with the use of XML and following technologies like Web Services, Grid Computing and Semantic Web the difference between human-machine interaction and machine-machine interaction vanishes. This work investigates the usefulness of XML in the simulation domain and uses Web Service technology to build the SimASP framework for discrete event simulation (DES). (C) 2008 IMACS.
