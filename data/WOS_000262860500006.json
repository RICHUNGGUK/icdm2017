First of all, the INRS is introduced that can implement dynamical adjustments to the structure of a PN model and maintain its important behavioural properties. Subsequently, the formalisms of graph and set are incorporated to provide a formal representation of a RMS configuration. According to the hierarchy of RMS configuration, hierarchical design of PN models with an INRS approach is proposed. Using the proposed method, a modular PN model can be obtained. Such a PN model is not only reconfigurable but also valid, i.e. live, bounded (or safe), and reversible. A reconfigurable manufacturing cell serves as an example to illustrate the main principles and procedures of PN model design, applying the presented method.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical Petri net modelling of reconfigurable manufacturing systems with improved net rewriting systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000262860500006"}
