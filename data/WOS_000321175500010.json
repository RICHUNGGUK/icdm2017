We propose a set of methods to bridge this gap based on parallel transport frame. An improved bifurcation modeling method and two novel trifurcation modeling methods are developed based on 3D Bezier curve segments in order to ensure the continuous surface transition at furcations. In addition, a frame blending scheme is implemented to solve the twisting problem caused by frame mismatch of two successive furcations: A curvature based adaptive sampling scheme combined with a mesh quality guided frame tilting algorithm is developed to construct an evenly distributed, non-concave and self-intersection free surface mesh for vessels with distinct radius and high curvature. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methodology can generate vascular models with better mesh quality than previous methods in terms of surface mesh quality criteria. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
