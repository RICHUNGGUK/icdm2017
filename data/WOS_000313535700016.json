Simulation results show excellent multi-band characteristics for UWB wireless applications. Design/methodology/approach - A Hilbert curve-based fractal is optimised for self-replicating, space-filling and self-avoiding properties. In the proposed design, the Hilbert curve is applied to a rectangle as an initial iteration and maintained for the later iterations. Additionally, a Yagi-like strip is removed from the second iteration of the Hilbert patch and a hexagonal portion is removed from the substrate to achieve good optimization. The antenna feed is created through a micro-strip line with a feeding section. Finally, a partial ground plane technique is used for improved impedance matching characteristics. A finite element method (FEM) is used to simulate the modified Hilbert model with commercially available Ansoft HESS software. Findings - The proposed antenna is miniaturized (39 mm length x 30 mm width) and has multi-band characteristics. The simulation results show that the antenna has a reflection coefficient characteristic of < - 10 dB, a linear phase reflection coefficient, better than 65 percent radiation efficiency, 2.2-4 dBi antenna gain and nearly omni-directional radiation pattern properties over the UWB bandwidth (3.1-10.6 GHz). Originality/value - The antenna shows promising characteristics for the full 7.5 GHz UWB bandwidth. In addition, the performance is achieved by using laceration techniques on the Hilbert patch and substrate, respectively. A partial ground plane ensures impedance matching of 50 over full UWB bandwidth. The simulation analysis of the modified Hilbert fractal antenna design constitutes the main contribution of the paper.", "paper_title": "Modified Hilbert fractal geometry, multi-service, miniaturized patch antenna for UWB wireless communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000313535700016"}
