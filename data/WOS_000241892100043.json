Our study is based on our previous model that simulates the cancer-immune System competition activated by a tumor vaccine. In what follows, we show first results on effects of deconstructing the components of Triplex vaccine that are in very good agreement with in vivo results.", "paper_title": "Model deconstruction of an immunoprevention vaccine", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100043"}
