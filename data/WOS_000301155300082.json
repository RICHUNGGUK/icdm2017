Soft computing-based expert systems have been developed in the present work to predict specific energy consumption and stability margin of turning gait of a six-legged robot. Besides back-propagation neural network, three approaches based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system have been developed and their performances are compared with each other. Genetic algorithm-tuned multiple adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems are found to perform better than other approaches. This could be due to a more exhaustive search conducted by the genetic algorithm in place of back-propagation algorithm and the use of two separate adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems for two different outputs.
