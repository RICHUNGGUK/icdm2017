We present an algorithm that constructs the Morse-Smale complex in a series of sweeps through the data, identifying various components of the complex in a consistent manner. All components of the complex, both geometric and topological, are computed, providing a complete decomposition of the domain. Efficiency is maintained by representing the geometry of the complex in terms of point sets.", "paper_title": "Efficient computation of Morse-Smale complexes for three-dimensional scalar functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000250401100050"}
