To this aim an innovative analysis method inspired by the Chinese Go game is under design. The originality of the approach concerns the detection within system configurations of known patterns whose interpretations are well-known by expert Go players.", "paper_title": "Emergent spatial patterns in vegetable population dynamics: Towards pattern detection and interpretation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300040"}
