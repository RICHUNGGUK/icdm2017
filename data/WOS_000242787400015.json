We found drag reduction of a flexible fiber compared to a stiff one and the drag coefficient decreases with respect to the dimensionless fiber length within a certain range. The results are a starting point for the understanding of the role of flexibility in biological organisms in fluid flows. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
