REMUS-II consists of a mu PU (Micro-Processor Unit) and two RPUs (Reconfigurable Processor Unit), which are used to speeds up control-intensive tasks and data-intensive tasks respectively. The parallel computing capability and flexibility of REMUS-II makes itself an excellent candidate to process multimedia applications, which require a large amount of memory accesses. In this paper, we specifically optimize the data flow to deal with those performance-hazard and energy-hungry memory accessing in order to meet the bandwidth requirement of parallel computing. The RPU internal memory could work in multiple modes, like 2D-access mode and transformation mode, according to different multimedia access patterns. This novel design can improve the performance up to 26% compared to traditional on-chip memory. Meanwhile, the block buffer is implemented to optimize the off-chip data flow through reducing off-chip memory accesses, which reducing up to 43% compared to direct DDR access. Based on RTL simulation, REMUS-II can achieve 1080p@30 fps of H.264 High Profile@ Level 4 and High Level MPEG2 at 200 MHz clock frequency. The REMUS-II is implemented into 23.7 mm(2) silicon on TSMC 65 nm logic process with a 400 MHz maximum working frequency.", "paper_title": "Date Flow Optimization of Dynamically Coarse Grain Reconfigurable Architecture for Multimedia Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000300471900010"}
