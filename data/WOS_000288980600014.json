To achieve minimum weight design, inefficient material is gradually shifted from strong parts to weak parts of a structure until a state of uniform deformation prevails. By considering different truss structures, effects of seismic excitation, target ductility and buckling of the compression members on optimum topology are investigated. It is shown that the proposed method could lead to 60% less structural weight compared to optimization methods based on elastic behavior and equivalent static loads, and is efficient at controlling performance parameters under a design earthquake.
