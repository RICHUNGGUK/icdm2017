Following the algorithmic degree model [G. Liotta, F.P. Preparata, R. Tamassia, Robust proximity queries: an illustration of degree-driven algorithm design, SIAM J. Comput. 28 (3) (1998) 864-889], we show that the Voronoi diagram of a set of arbitrarily oriented segments can be constructed with degree 14 for certain k-gon metrics (e.g., k = 6, 8, 12). For rectilinear segments or segments with slope +1 or -1, the degree reduces to 2. The algorithm is easy to implement and finds applications in VLSI layout. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
