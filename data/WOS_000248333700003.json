In order to shorten the time-to-market for complex system-on-chips (SoC), the trade and reuse of silicon intellectual properties (SIPs) for fast IC design becomes a critical success factor for semiconductor IDM. In this research, intelligent mobile agents and fuzzy evaluation models are built into a knowledge services and trade platform (KSTP). The mobile agent behaviour model is used for knowledge acquisition and negotiations between sites of SIP providers, buyers and intermediators. The agent- based KSTP considers time, cost and precision of acquiring SIP information needed for SoC design and fabrication. For trade partner matching, fuzzy evaluation models are developed to consistently suggest suitable partners for trades under di. erent circumstances. The ultimate goal of the research is to enable autonomous, dynamic and collaborative SIP exchanges and trades in the global value chain of semiconductor industry.", "paper_title": "Developing silicon intellectual property E-trade mechanisms for system on chip design and integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000248333700003"}
