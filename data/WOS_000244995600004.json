To this end beam-shaped specimens are subjected to combined bending and torsional loading, leading to the formation of a spatially curved crack-surface. The experimental data contain the evolution of the load and of the strains at selected points in terms of the crack mouth opening displacement and the propagation of the crack surface.", "paper_title": "Validation of 3D crack propagation in plain concrete.
