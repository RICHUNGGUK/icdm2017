All arriving customers during stockout are lost. We derive the stationary distributions of the joint queue length (number of customers in the system) and on-hand inventory when lead times are random variables and can take various distributions. The derived stationary distributions are used to formulate long-run average performance measures and cost functions in some numerical examples.", "paper_title": "The M/M/1 queue with inventory, lost sale, and general lead times", "paper_id": "WOS:000323058700004"}
