This phenomenon, known as the \"performance anomaly\", is mainly due to the max-min throughput fairness of the CSMA/CA algorithm of the 802.11 MAC. The simple FIFO scheduling policy usually implemented in the AP also contributes to this problem. In order to overcome the performance anomaly, we propose the Deficit Transmission Time (DTT) scheduler. The aim of DTT is guaranteeing each station a fair medium usage in terms of transmission time. This feature, directly related to the proportional fairness concept, allows to ideally achieve exact isolation among the traffic flows addressed to different stations. DTT achieves this goal taking advantage of measurements of actual frame transmission times. Experiments carried out using a prototype implementation of DTT are compared with analogous tests performed with a classic FIFO queue of a commercial AP and a recently proposed traffic shaping scheme aimed at solving the same 802.11 performance anomaly.", "paper_title": "Providing air-time usage fairness in IEEE 802.11 networks with the deficit transmission time (DTT) scheduler", "paper_id": "WOS:000247529200005"}
