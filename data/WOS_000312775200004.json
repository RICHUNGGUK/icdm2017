Results show that, in a positive or negative balance, consumers rely on the majority's opinion in shaping recall and impression. In a neutral balance, where no dominant opinion is available, sequence effects influence recall and impression. The results provide evidence of a wrap effect: starting and concluding (wrapping) a set with positive (negative) reviews biases recall and impression toward the positive (negative) direction. In addition, wrapping is capable of generating an equally positive (negative) impression as positively (negatively) balanced sets. Review recall affects the attitude and intention toward the product indirectly through its effect on the reader's impression of the reviews.", "paper_title": "Balance and Sequence in Online Reviews: The Wrap Effect", "paper_id": "WOS:000312775200004"}
