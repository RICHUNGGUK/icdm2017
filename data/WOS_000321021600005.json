For a given tolerance epsilon > 0, the algorithm checks whether a planar projection of the given space curve is epsilon-rational and, in the affirmative case, generates a planar parametrization that is lifted to a space parametrization. This output rational space curve is of the same degree as the input curve, both have the same structure at infinity, and the Hausdorff distance between their real parts is finite. Moreover, in the examples we check that the distance is small. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
