This algorithm, which generalizes Propp and Wilson's simulation scheme, is based on the idea of coupling into and from the past. It improves on existing algorithms by relaxing the conditions on the kernel and by accelerating convergence, even in the simple case of finite order Markov chains. Although chains of variable or infinite order have been widely investigated for decades, their use in applied probability, from information theory to bio-informatics and linguistics, has recently led to considerable renewed interest.
