Later, Kueng et al. (2009a) presented a formal proof to validate Hsieh and Yu's argument. This paper aims to improve this mentioned result by showing that up to (n-f)-mutually independent fault-free Hamiltonian cycles can be embedded under the same condition. Let F denote the set of f faulty edges. If all faulty edges happen to be incident with an identical vertex s, i.e., the minimum degree of the survival graph Q (n) -F is equal to n-f, then Q (n) -F contains at most (n-f)-mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles starting from s. From such a point of view, the presented result is optimal. Thus, not only does our improvement increase the number of mutually independent fault-free Hamiltonian cycles by one, but also the optimality can be achieved.", "paper_title": "On the maximum number of fault-free mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles in the faulty hypercube", "paper_id": "WOS:000330590400009"}
