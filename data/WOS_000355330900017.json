By using a mode selection circuit, four modes of sampling rate are provided: Single channel at 333.3 MS/s, 2-channel at 666.7 MS/s, 3-channel at 1 GS/s and 6-channel at 2 GS/s. An on-chip delay-locked loop (DLL) uniformly generates six-phase clock with 20% duty cycle, and the timing errors are reduced to a tolerable range. In low sampling rate modes, the corresponding sampling switches and comparators in the idle sub-ADCs are shut down to save power consumption. Based on the 65-nm CMOS technology, the post-layout simulation results show that at 1.2V supply, the proposed ADC consumes 8.6, 10.9, 13.1 and 19.9mW under differerent modes. With an ENOB of 7.92, 7.34, 7.01 and 6.37 bit, this results in a FOM of 106.6, 100.9, 101.6 and 120.3 fJ/conversion-step respectively.", "paper_title": "An 8-Bit 0.333-2 GS/s Configurable Time-Interleaved SAR ADC in 65-nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000355330900017"}
