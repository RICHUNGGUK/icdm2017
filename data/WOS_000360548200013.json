However, quality of experience has attracted less attention in the design of smart space, which results in poor user satisfaction in actual design solutions. In this article, we propose a systematic method for augmenting smart space design, which allows the refinement of high-level user needs into the underlying design solution by leveraging an intermediate representation model, meeting nearly optimal user satisfaction including locality satisfaction, energy consumption satisfaction, QoS satisfaction, and human computer interaction satisfaction. Also, we present the design platform of smart space, which achieves the design flow combined with the space model and platform library. Finally, we use a home health care application to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our methodology.", "paper_title": "A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY FOR AUGMENTING QUALITY OF EXPERIENCE IN SMART SPACE DESIGN", "paper_id": "WOS:000360548200013"}
