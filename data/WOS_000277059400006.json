Different configurations have been compared between them by changing the dimensions of the micro-machined via-holes used for the ground connection, as well as their number and separation, to get the optimal electrical matching conditions. Wide-band matching and losses as low as 0.1-0.2 dB/mm have been obtained within the 40 GHz range, in agreement with the predicted behavior.", "paper_title": "Design, Technology and Test of Micro-Machined Coplanar Grounded Wave-Guides on Si Substrates", "paper_id": "WOS:000277059400006"}
