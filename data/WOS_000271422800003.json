In this paper we propose a simple and effective heuristic for large-scale instances of CFLP. The heuristic is based on a Lagrangean relaxation which is used to select a subset of \"promising\" variables forming the core problem and on a Branch-and-Cut algorithm that solves the core problem. Computational results on very large scale instances (up to 4 million variables) are reported.", "paper_title": "An effective heuristic for large-scale capacitated facility location problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000271422800003"}
