A lot of studies on recognizing objects based on invariable shapes have been explored, however, in reality, there are many objects with multiple configurations, which are very difficult to be recognized. We call this kind of problem as the recognition of multiple configurations of objects (RMCO). To achieve RMCO, firstly we obtain a shortest path (the Geodesic distance path) between two feature vectors in pre-shape spaces; along this obtained path, we can generate a series of data which can be used to recognize the observed objects by using shape space theories. In other words, we may augment the database content with very limited data to recognize more objects. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
