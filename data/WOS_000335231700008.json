Service convenience (SERVCON), a concept of benefit and related to customer satisfaction and retention, has received increasing attention and is now treated as an important factor in shopping behavior. Unfortunately, the literature on convenience has explored only traditional retailers. Thus, this research attempts to apply the results of marketing and information management (IM) research concerning customer service convenience with e-retailers. Based on a survey of 304 online shoppers (e-shoppers) in Taiwan, a 14-item e-commerce service convenience (EC-SERVCON) instrument was constructed. We then construct an EC-SERVCON managerial grid for managers to use in formulating strategy for improving service convenience. The instrument, findings, and implications of this study will be valuable to researchers and practitioners interested in designing, implementing, and managing e-commerce.", "paper_title": "Assessing and managing e-commerce service convenience", "paper_id": "WOS:000335231700008"}
