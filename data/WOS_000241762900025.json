A trajectory curve is constructed by circular trigonometric Hermite interpolation spline (CTHIS) and a profile curve is presented by C-2-continuous B-spline like interpolation spline (BSLIS). A piecewise interpolation spline surface is incorporated by the blending of CTHIS and BSLIS. In addition, scaling functions have been introduced to improve the flexibility of the model of the interpolation surfaces. On the basis of these results, some examples are given to show how the method is used to model some interesting surfaces.", "paper_title": "Geometric modeling for interpolation surfaces based on blended coordinate system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900025"}
