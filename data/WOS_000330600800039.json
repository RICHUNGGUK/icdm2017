Then, a hybrid Pareto-archived estimation of distribution algorithm (HPAEDA) is presented to solve the MOMIRCPSP-MS-RI. To be specific, the individual of the population is encoded as the activity-mode-priority-resource list (AMPRL), and a hybrid probability model is used to predict the most promising search area, and a Pareto archive is used to preserve the non-dominated solutions that have been explored, and another archive is used to preserve the solutions for updating the probability model. Moreover, specific sampling mechanism and updating mechanism for the probability model are both provided to track the most promising search area via the EDA-based evolutionary search. Finally, the modeling methodology and the HPAEDA are tested by an example of a video codec based on the H.261 image compression standard. Simulation results and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the modeling methodology and the proposed algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
