In this paper, we present the concept and design of a multi-task fuzzy inference processor (MtFIP). Earlier, a reconfigurable fuzzy inference chip (RcFIP) with 17 mega fuzzy logic inference per second (FLIPS) capable of supporting real-time context-switching has been proposed. High performance similar to that of the RcFIP is attainable by the MtFIP. Each task is handled by a RcFIP configured specific to the domain of the application. High flexibility is achieved by integrating several RcFIPs in the MtFIP. The compact architecture of the MtFIP allows for seamless online context-switching among multiple tasks. The hardware architecture of the MtFIP is described in details.", "paper_title": "A multi-context processor for real-time concurrent tasks fuzzy reasoning", "paper_id": "WOS:000312493200007"}
