Based on this representation, we can transform a DNA sequence to three unique binary sequences. The introduced system can be applied to characterize and compare the DNA sequences. In our method, the operators circle times and boolean AND are used to judge mutations. Moreover, based on the result of our coding method, we present a 3D graphical representation of DNA sequences. The 3D graphical representation avoids loss of information accompanying alternative 2D and 3D representation in which the curve standing for DNA overlaps and intersects itself. And this graph can reflect the characters of DNA sequence well.", "paper_title": "An improved binary representation of DNA sequences and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000265624300018"}
