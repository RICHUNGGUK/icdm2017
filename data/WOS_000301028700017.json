However, these methods may fail to track some desired solution curves due to the interference of the rotational equivalent solutions on a radially symmetric domain. We propose a rotational quotient procedure that applies extra constraints to standard continuation which overcomes this difficulty. We solve a time-independent nonlinear Schrodinger equation on a disk domain to demonstrate the functionality of the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
