The forgetting curve is applied to recognize the information difference between interview place and data sending place. Because an unstable or inaccessible Internet may exist, the proportional weighted method can be applied to calculate the confidence level of each questionnaire, and a higher confidence level is obtained for a shorter distance between the interview place and the data sending place. Some recommendations are also given for future survey studies when adopting iPads or other tablet computers.", "paper_title": "Enhancing Confidence in Computer-Assisted Survey for Geospatial Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000359612800001"}
