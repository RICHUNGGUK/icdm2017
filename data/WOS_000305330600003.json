This paper presents a novel radiance-based color calibration method to reduce the uncertainty of photo-consistency estimation across multiple cameras. The idea behind our method is to convert colors into a uniform radiometric color space in which multiple image data are corrected. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve comparable color calibration effect without adjusting camera parameters and is more robust than other existing method. Additionally, we obtain an auto-determined threshold for photo-consistency check, which will lead to a better performance than existing photo-consistency based reconstruction algorithms.", "paper_title": "Radiance-based color calibration for image-based modeling with multiple cameras", "paper_id": "WOS:000305330600003"}
