The reconfiguration graph of the k-colourings of G contains as its vertex set the k-colourings of G, and two colourings are joined by an edge if they differ in colour on just one vertex of G. We introduce a class of k-colourable graphs, which we call k-colour-dense graphs. We show that for each k-colour-dense graph G, the reconfiguration graph of the a\"\"-colourings of G is connected and has diameter O(|V|(2)), for all a\"\"a parts per thousand yenk+1. We show that this graph class contains the k-colourable chordal graphs and that it contains all chordal bipartite graphs when k=2. Moreover, we prove that for each ka parts per thousand yen2 there is a k-colourable chordal graph G whose reconfiguration graph of the (k+1)-colourings has diameter I similar to(|V|(2)).", "paper_title": "Reconfiguration graphs for vertex colourings of chordal and chordal bipartite graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000330209400011"}
