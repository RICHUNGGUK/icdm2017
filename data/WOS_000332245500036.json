First, we introduce the concepts of interval-valued T-fuzzy (implicative, positive implicative, MV, regular) filters with respect to a t-norm T on D[0, 1] and investigate their properties, and some equivalent characterizations of these generalized fuzzy filters are derived. Next, we introduce the concept of interval-valued T-fuzzy congruence relation on a residuated lattice, and the relation between interval-valued T-fuzzy congruences and interval-valued T-fuzzy filters are investigated. Finally, we construct a new residuated lattice which induced by interval-valued T -fuzzy congruences, the homomorphism theorem is given.", "paper_title": "Interval-valued T-fuzzy filters and interval-valued T-fuzzy congruences on residuated lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000332245500036"}
