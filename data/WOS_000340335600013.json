It aims at solving clustering problems with multiple cues. Most MKC methods usually extend existing clustering methods with a multiple kernel learning (MKL) setting. In this paper, we propose a novel MKC method that is different from those popular approaches. Centered kernel alignment an effective kernel evaluation measure is employed in order to unify the two tasks of clustering and MKL into a single optimization framework. To solve the formulated optimization problem, an efficient two-step iterative algorithm is developed. Experiments on several UCI datasets and face image datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our MKC algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
