In this paper, an improved stochastic middle multi-bits quantification algorithm based on Chebyshev map is proposed to enhance the ability of anti reconstruction a chaos system through reverse iteration and improve the performance of the generated sequence under precision restricted condition. The balance and correlation properties of the generated sequence are analyzed. The sequence is proved to be a binary Bernoulli sequence and the distribution of the differences between the amounts of 0 and 1 is analyzed. The side lobes of auto correlation and values of cross correlation are proved to obey normal distribution N (0, 1/N).", "paper_title": "A fast pseudo stochastic sequence quantification algorithm based on Chebyshev map and its application in data encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200111"}
