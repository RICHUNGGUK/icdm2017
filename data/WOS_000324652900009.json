Moreover, many real-world applications are now capable of producing continuous, unbounded data streams. During the recent years, new methods have been developed to find frequent patterns in uncertain databases; nevertheless, very limited work has been done in discovering frequent patterns in uncertain data streams. The current solutions for frequent pattern mining in uncertain streams take a FP-tree-based approach; however, recent studies have shown that FP-tree-based algorithms do not perform well in the presence of data uncertainty. In this paper, we propose two hyper-structure-based false-positive-oriented algorithms to efficiently mine frequent itemsets from streams of uncertain data. The first algorithm, UHS-Stream, is designed to find all frequent itemsets up to the current moment. The second algorithm, TFUHS-Stream, is designed to find frequent itemsets in an uncertain data stream in a time-fading manner. Experimental results show that the proposed hyper-structure-based algorithms outperform the existing tree-based algorithms in terms of accuracy, runtime, and memory usage.", "paper_title": "Hyper-structure mining of frequent patterns in uncertain data streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000324652900009"}
