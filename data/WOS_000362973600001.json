Here, input points are sampled according to density functions that are bounded by a sufficiently small smoothness parameter . For such inputs, we provide a general and systematic approach that allows designing linear-time approximation algorithms whose output is asymptotically optimal, both in expectation and with high probability. Applications of our framework include maximum matching, maximum TSP, and the classical problems of k-means clustering and bin packing. Apart from generalizing corresponding average-case analyses, our results extend and simplify a polynomial-time probable approximation scheme on multidimensional bin packing on -smooth instances, where is constant (Karger and Onak in Polynomial approximation schemes for smoothed and random instances of multidimensional packing problems, pp 1207-1216, 2007). Both techniques and applications of our rounding-based approach are orthogonal to the only other framework for smoothed analysis of Euclidean problems we are aware of (Blaser et al. in Algorithmica 66(2):397-418, 2013).", "paper_title": "A Quantization Framework for Smoothed Analysis of Euclidean Optimization Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000362973600001"}
