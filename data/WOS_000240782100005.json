This problem limits the impact of logical models for information retrieval because their full expressive power cannot be harnessed. In this paper we propose a method for producing logical document representations which goes further than other simplistic \"bag-of-words\" approaches. The suggested procedure adopts popular information retrieval heuristics, such as document length corrections and global term distribution. This work includes a report of several experiments applying partial document representations in the context of a propositional model of information retrieval. The benefits of this expressive framework, powered by the new logical indexing approach, become apparent in the evaluation. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
