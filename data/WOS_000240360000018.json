In its original form the CHAM is purely non-deterministic and thus only describes what reactions are possible but not how long it will take (in the average) before a certain reaction takes place or its probability. Such quantitative information is however often vital for \"real world\" applications such as systems biology or performance analysis. We propose a probabilistic version of the CHAM. We then define a linear operator semantics for the probabilistic CHAM which exploits a tensor product representation for distributions over possible solutions. Based on this we propose a novel approach towards comparing the expressive power of different calculi via their encoding in the probabilistic CHAM. We illustrate our approach by comparing the expressiveness of various Linda Languages.", "paper_title": "On a probabilistic Chemical Abstract Machine and the expressiveness of Linda languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000240360000018"}
