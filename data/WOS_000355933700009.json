We present a real-time virtual camera system that can create smooth camera motion. Similar systems are frequently benchmarked with the human operator as the best possible reference; however, we avoid a priori assumptions in our evaluations. Our main question is simply whether we can design algorithms to steer a virtual camera that can compete with the user experience for recordings from an expert operator with several years of experience? In this respect, we present two low-complexity servoing methods that are explored in two user studies. The results from the user studies give a promising answer to the question pursued. Furthermore, all components of the system meet the real-time requirements on commodity hardware. The growing capabilities of both hardware and network in mobile devices give us hope that this system can be deployed to mobile users in the near future. Moreover, the design of the presented system takes into account that services to concurrent users must be supported.", "paper_title": "The Cameraman Operating My Virtual Camera is Artificial: Can the Machine Be as Good as a Human?", "paper_id": "WOS:000355933700009"}
