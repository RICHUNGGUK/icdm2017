In this study, we verify through statistical and experimental methods that informative genes can be extracted from multiple microarray data integrated by the rank-based approach (briefly, integrated rank-based microarray data). First, after showing that a nonparametric technique can be used effectively as a scoring metric for rank-based microarray data, we prove that the scoring results from integrated rank-based microarray data are statistically significant. Next, through experimental comparisons, we show that the informative genes from integrated rank-based microarray data are statistically more significant than those of single-microarray data. In addition, by comparing the lists of informative genes extracted from experimental data, we show that the rankbased data integration method extracts more significant genes than the z-score-based normalization technique or the rank products technique. Public cancer microarray data were used for our experiments and the marker genes list from the CGAP database was used to compare the extracted genes. The GO database and the GSEA method were also used to analyze the functionalities of the extracted genes.", "paper_title": "Extraction of Informative Genes from Multiple Microarray Data Integrated by Rank-Based Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000289921900011"}
