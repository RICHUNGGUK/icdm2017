When multiple quantile regressions are considered, it is of great importance to share strength among them. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization method that explores the similarity among multiple quantile regressions by selecting a common subset of covariates to model multiple conditional quantiles simultaneously. The penalty we employ is a matrix norm that encourages sparsity in a column-wise fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using both simulations and an application of gene expression data analysis. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
