The small size and portability of nodes have made WSNs the perfect tool to easily monitor a person's health condition. In this type application, as well as in several other critical applications, reliability and mobility arc paramount. In this paper we propose a method, based on WSNs and mobile intra-body sensors, to accurately detect the fertile period or women on time and other applications based on intra-vaginal temperature monitoring. In addition, our proposal also introduces the proposal of intra-body micro-cameras to monitor the women's cervix, capable to detect related pathologies. To efficiently support this mobile multimedia application, guaranteeing reliability in a continuous monitoring mode, we make use ora new WSN paradigm based on mobility proxies.", "paper_title": "Mobile multimedia in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000300741500002"}
