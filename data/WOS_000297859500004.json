In this paper, we propose a Ring-based Energy Aware Routing (REAR) algorithm for wireless sensor networks which can achieve both energy balancing and energy efficiency for all sensor nodes. Our algorithm considers not only the hop number and distance but also the residual energy of the next hop node during routing process. Simulation results validate that our algorithm outperforms some other routing algorithms in the aspects of energy consumption and network lifetime etc.", "paper_title": "An Energy Efficient and Load Balancing Routing Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000297859500004"}
