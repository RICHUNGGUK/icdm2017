The optimization of WSN clustering is a natural way to suppress the funneling effect. WSN clusters involve the edge effect that was undervalued in existing techniques. We propose an optimal clustering routing protocol GreenOCR to reduce the detrimental influence of the funnel effect and minimize the energy consumption in WSNs. Our work focuses on the approximate unequal optimal clustering and dropping energy consumption arising from the edge effect. First, according to the data repeat rate among overlapped clusters, we estimate the actual data compression ratio to offset the negative influence of the edge effect and save WSN energy. Secondly, we reduce the issue of minimizing the total energy consumption in a WSN to a nonlinear programming (NLP). We have proved that this NLP problem is NP complete. Third, we turn over to exploring an approximate optimal clustering and propose an approximate optimal clustering algorithm. A GreenOCR enabled WSN clustering minimizes the energy consumption in the whole network and extends the lifetime of the WSN. The simulation experiment shows that GreenOCR outperforms its rivals in alleviating the funnel effect.", "paper_title": "GreenOCR: An Energy-Efficient Optimal Clustering Routing Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000359139700011"}
