A number of covering-set constructions, as well as some bounds, are given. In particular, optimal constructions are given for some cases involving small-magnitude errors. A problem of Stein is partially solved for these cases. Optimal packing sets and the corresponding error-correcting codes are also considered for some small-magnitude errors.", "paper_title": "Linear covering codes and error-correcting codes for limited-magnitude errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000339826100005"}
