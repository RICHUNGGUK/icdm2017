The mathematical model is a convection-diffusion equation with a nonlinear flux equation on the moving channel wall. The reactive transport is assumed to have dominant Peclet and Damkohler numbers, a phenomenon that often results in non-physical negative solutions. The scheme presented here is proven to be mass conservative in time and positive at all times for a small enough t. Reactive transport examples are simulated using this scheme for its validation, to show its convergence, and to compare it against the linear ALE-FCT scheme. The nonlinear ALE-FCT is shown to perform better than the linear ALE-FCT schemes for large time steps.
