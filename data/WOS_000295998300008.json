Experiments on three image datasets, comprising images of breast and lung nodules, showed that developing functions to evaluate the ranking quality allows improving retrieval performance. This approach produces significantly better results than those of other fitness function approaches, such as the traditional wrapper and than filter feature selection algorithms.
