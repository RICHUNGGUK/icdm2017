The pivotal role of AChE in apoptosome formation through the interactions with cytochrome c (Cyt c) was demonstrated in recent study. In order to investigate the proper binding conformation between the human AChE (hAChE) and human Cyt c (hCyt c), macro-molecular docking simulation was performed using DOT 2.0 program. The hCyt c was bound to peripheral anionic site (PAS) on hAChE and binding mode of the docked conformation was very similar to the reported crystal structure of the AChE and fasciculin-II (Fas-II) complex. Two 10 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to refine the binding mode of docked structure and to observe the differences of the binding conformations between the absent (Apo) and presence (Holo) of heme group. The key hydrogen bonding residues between hAChE and hCyt c proteins were found in Apo and Holo systems, as well as each Tyr341 and Trp286 residue of hAChE was participated in cation-pi (pi) interactions with Lys79 of hCyt c in Apo and Holo systems, respectively. From the present study, although the final structures of the Apo and Holo systems have similar binding pattern, several differences were investigated in flexibilities, interface interactions, and interface accessible surface areas. Based on these results, we were able to predict the reasonable binding conformation which is indispensable for apoptosome formation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
