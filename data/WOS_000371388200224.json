Industrial system is a novel scenario to apply WSNs. Industrial WSNs are the base to establish a supervisory control and data acquisition system with the benefits of extending the network boundaries and enhancing the network scalability of the WSNs. The integration of industrial systems, such as smart grids and social networks, is an important trend for new network technologies. In many application scenarios of industrial systems, WSNs are controlled by different authorities. The network nodes that belong to different domains can share the sensor data by standard protocols. Moreover, in an applications, scenario that has high security requirements, the nodes of social networking WSNs could belong to different security levels; thus, these data can be controlled only by specific types of users. Therefore, the cross-domain fine-grained data usage is the core problem for this approach. To address this problem, this paper focuses on the cross-domain fine-grained data usage control mechanism of social networking WSNs in industrial systems, which includes cross-domain fine-grained access control and fuzzy clustering for sensing data for efficient analysis. In addition, dynamic service composition is proposed for data usage. The simulation results verify the feasibility and data usage effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Cross-Domain Fine-Grained Data Usage Control Service for Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200224"}
