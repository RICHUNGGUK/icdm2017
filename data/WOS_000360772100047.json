We develop a solution based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for an effective management of the distribution network of a Turkish automotive manufacturer under centralized control. We provide a specific approach to address the two-echelon inventory control problem in its combinatorial and sequential behavior, dealing with a large number of specific properties that are considered in practice. Findings of the case study reveal that the use of the proposed inventory control system may provide substantial cost savings to the case company. We finally draw conclusions from the case study on the company's operational practices and illustrate opportunities for improvement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
