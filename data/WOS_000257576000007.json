The usual random forest (RF) variable importance (VI) index used to rank markers for variable selection is not optimal when applied to linkage data because of correlation between markers. We define new VI indices that borrow information from linked markers using the correlation structure inherent in IBD linkage data. Results: Using simulations, we find that the new VI indices in EMRF performed better than the original RF VI index and performed similarly or better than EM-HasemanElston regression LOD score for various genetic models. Moreover, tree size and markers subset size evaluated at each node are important considerations in RFs.", "paper_title": "EM-random forest and new measures of variable importance for multi-locus quantitative trait linkage analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000257576000007"}
