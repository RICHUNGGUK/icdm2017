Given a graph G = (V, E) and a positive integer k, the BANDWIDTH problem asks whether there exists a bijective function beta : {1.....vertical bar V vertical bar) -> V such that for every edge uv, is an element of E, vertical bar beta(-1) (u) - vertical bar beta(-1) (V) vertical bar <= k. It is known that under standard complexity assumptions, no algorithm for BANDWIDTH with running time of the form f (k)n(O(1)) exists, even when the input is restricted to trees. We initiate the search for classes of graphs where such algorithms do exist. We present an algorithm with running time n . 2(O(k log k)) for BANDWIDTH on AT-free graphs, a well-studied graph class that contains interval, permutation, and cocomparability graphs. Our result is the first non-trivial algorithm that shows fixed-parameter tractability of BANDWIDTH on a graph class on which the problem remains NP-complete. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
