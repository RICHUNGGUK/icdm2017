Fuzzy adaptive fusion algorithm is a powerful tool to make the actual value of the residual covariance consistent with its theoretical value. To overcome the defect of the dependence on the knowledge of the process and measurement noise statistics of Kalman filter, neural network is introduced, which has the ability to learn from examples and extract the statistical properties of the examples during the training sessions. The fusion system mainly consists of Kalman filters, ANFIS sensor confidence estimators (ASCEs) based on contextual information (CI) theory, knowledge base (KB) and track-to-track fusion algorithms. Experimental data are implemented to train ASCEs to obtain sensor confidence degree. Simulation results show that the algorithm can effectively adjust the system to adapt contextual changes and has strong fusion capability in resisting uncertain information. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
