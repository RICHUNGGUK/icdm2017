With respect to a given set of local encoding kernels defining a linear network code, we obtain refined versions of the Hamming bound, the Singleton bound, and the Gilbert-Varshamov bound for coherent network error correction. Similar to its classical counterpart, this refined Singleton bound is tight for linear network codes. The tightness of this refined bound is shown by two construction algorithms of linear network codes achieving this bound. These two algorithms illustrate different design methods: one makes use of existing network coding algorithms for error-free transmission and the other makes use of classical error-correcting codes. The implication of the tightness of the refined Singleton bound is that the sink nodes with higher maximum flow values can have higher error correction capabilities.", "paper_title": "Refined Coding Bounds and Code Constructions for Coherent Network Error Correction", "paper_id": "WOS:000287657200015"}
