The algorithm is capable of transforming very refined cell conductivity models into coarse block conductivity models for quick and accurate solution of the groundwater flow equation. Flow rate and hydraulic head gradient are the variables used to relate the outputs from the fine scale model to the outputs from the coarse scale model. The flows and gradients computed at the coarse scale blocks should match the average values of the corresponding quantities observed at the fine scale. The algorithm is geared towards its use in conjunction with finite-difference codes for the solution of the groundwater flow equation capable of handling full tensor hydraulic conductivities. The finite-difference formulation of the groundwater flow equation requires specifying the hydraulic conductivity at the block interface in order to compute the discharge crossing the interface. Most finite-difference codes take as input conductivities at the blocks and then perform some type of averaging to come up with the interblock conductivity. Typically the harmonic mean of the conductivities of neighboring blocks is used. We propose computing directly the interblock conductivity during the upscaling process thus avoiding the need to average already averaged (upscaled) values of adjacent blocks. This approach also circumvents the problem associated with averaging conductivity tensors when their principal directions are not aligned with the Cartesian axes. The proposed algorithm is successfully demonstrated in four synthetic examples with spatially isotropic, anisotropic and bimodal conductivities fields at the fine scale. The computer code is provided with explanation of the input parameters and output results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
