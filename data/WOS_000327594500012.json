In this paper, five families of three-weight ternary cyclic codes whose duals have two zeros are presented. The weight distributions of the five families of cyclic codes are settled. The duals of two families of the cyclic codes are optimal.", "paper_title": "Five Families of Three-Weight Ternary Cyclic Codes and Their Duals", "paper_id": "WOS:000327594500012"}
