The local nucleophilicity of the five molecules was investigated using Fukui function, while the global nucleophilicity was calculated from the ionization potential and electron affinity. The structures and coordination of the complexes were studied to identify the best match of the glycolipid crown ethers with cations. In general, it was found that the oxygen atoms pairs O2 and O3 (or O4 and O6) on the sugar ring are constrained from moving toward the cation, which results in a weaker O-cation coordination strength for the oxygen pair compared to the other oxygen atoms in the crown ether ring. The thermodynamic properties of the binding of the complexes and the exchange reaction in gas phase were evaluated. The cation selectivity pattern among the five molecules was in good agreement with the experiment.", "paper_title": "DFT study of glucose based glycolipid crown ethers and their complexes with alkali metal cations Na+ and K+", "paper_id": "WOS:000311400100009"}
