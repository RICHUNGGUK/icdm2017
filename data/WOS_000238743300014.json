General measures of deviation go beyond standard deviation in satisfying axioms that do not demand symmetry between ups and downs. The optimality conditions are applied to characterize the generalized ``master funds'' which elsewhere have been developed in extending classical portfolio theory beyond the case of standard deviation. The consequences are worked out for deviation based on conditional value-at-risk and its variants, in particular.", "paper_title": "Optimality conditions in portfolio analysis with general deviation measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000238743300014"}
