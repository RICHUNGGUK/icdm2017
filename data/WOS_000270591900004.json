Based on Galerkin's method, a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy PDS is first proposed to model an NPDS. Then, the T-S fuzzy PDS can be represented by a finite-dimensional T-S fuzzy subsystem in controlled mode and a coupled infinite-dimensional T-S fuzzy subsystem in residual mode. Therefore, the NPDS can be partitioned into a finite-dimensional T-S fuzzy slow state-space subsystem to be controlled and a coupled infinite-dimensional fast residual subsystem to be tolerated. Based on the small-gain theorem, a robust fuzzy observer-based controller is developed to tolerate the coupled residual subsystem to asymptotically stabilize the NPDS. Furthermore, based on the dissipative theory, an H(infinity) control design is proposed to attenuate the effects of external disturbances and measurement noises on the robust stabilization of NPDSs. The MATLAB linear matrix inequality toolbox can be employed to efficiently solve the optimal H(infinity) fuzzy observer-based control design problem of NPDSs. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the design procedure and confirm the performance of the proposed robust fuzzy observer-based control method for the perturbative NPDSs.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy State-Space Modeling and Robust Observer-Based Control Design for Nonlinear Partial Differential Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000270591900004"}
