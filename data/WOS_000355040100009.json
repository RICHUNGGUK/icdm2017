Adaptive planning and control has been a hot research topic and discussed a lot in the field of manufacturing. Adaptive auction logistics planning and control (ALPC) is urgently required at the ALC to support large trading volumes and shorten processing time. To solve real-life industrial challenges, this paper presents a generic system. architecture and its implementation along with the following dimensions. Firstly, a cloud-enabled platform for auction logistics center (CALC) is presented. It is proposed to implement efficient and effective ALPC, and to increase the flexibility in terms of execution of logistics operations and auction processes. Secondly, through the integration of loT (Internet of Things) and cloud computing technologies, the proposed CALC creates a ubiquitous environment at the ALC, and establishes auction logistics services for different key stakeholders. The adaptive ALPC can be achieved with real-time visibility and traceability. Finally, this study presents a prototype of CALC to verify the proposed methodology. The case study in this paper also shows the potential of CALC to streamline operating processes in auction logistics environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
