Design/methodology/approach - Real tracking data, collected from server's logs during 2006 and 2007 from South Korean satellite DMB providers, were analyzed according to users' age group, peak viewing time of programs, location usage and program duration. Further analysis with the previous literature led to inferences about strategic implications. Findings - The analysis revealed the current mobile TV usage patterns: widespread user age group, peak viewing time, high indoor usage and longer viewing time. These results shaped strategic implications, furthering and enhancing a personalized media experience. Research limitations/implications - The data set, collected from the subscription-based satellite DMB usage in South Korea, is well recognized as being a technological frontier. Further cultural comparison research work on mobile TV usage is required to validate the strategic implications for a wider cross cultural adoption. Practical implications - This research benefits the strategic planning of the mobile communications and entertainment content industries in decision-making regarding the improvement of hands-on experience for mobile TV users. Originality/value - The findings, based on the mobile TV real tracking data, collected in South Korea for over two years contrast to that of other countries, which only begin to experience the roll-out of a full commercial service. Consequently, the data presented here highlights an important role in understanding and shaping of the mobile TV phone market for other parts of the world.", "paper_title": "Mobile TV phone: current usage, issues, and strategic implications", "paper_id": "WOS:000261792500008"}
