The basic extracted frame of fuzzy infinite-state automaton is introduced by using neural networks. To the extracted fuzzy infinite-state automaton, this paper describes that it is equivalent to fuzzy finite-state automaton, and its convergence and stability on its hierarchy system will be discussed. Finally, the simulation is carried on and the simulation results show that the states of fuzzy infinite-state automaton converge to some stable states with extraction frame and training for weights what this paper provides at last. Finally, some problems of fuzzy infinite-state automaton and neural networks to be solved and development trends are discussed. These researches will not only extend further automata hierarchy, but also increase a new tool for application of fuzzy signal processing. It is an important base in the application of fuzzy automata theory.", "paper_title": "Theory research on a new type fuzzy automaton", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000001"}
