This paper proposes a new method to construct a developable surface possessing a given curve as the line of curvature of it. We analyze the necessary and sufficient conditions when the resulting developable surface is a cylinder, cone or tangent surface. Finally, we illustrate the convenience and efficiency of this method by some representative examples. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
