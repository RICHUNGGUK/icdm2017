It consists of engineering design, process planning, manufacturing, quality management, and storage and retrieval functions. Improving the decision quality in those fields give rise to complex combinatorial optimization problems, unfortunately, most of them fall into the class of NP-hard problems. Find a satisfactory solution in an acceptable time play important roles. Evolutionary techniques (ET) have turned out to be potent methods to solve such kind of optimization problems. flow to adapt evolutionary technique to the IMS is very challenging but frustrating. Many efforts have been made in order to give an efficient implementation of ET to optimize the specific problems in IMS. In this paper, we address four crucial issues in IMS, including design, planning, manufacturing, and distribution. Furthermore, some hot topics in these issues are selected to demonstrate the efficiency of ET's application, such as layout design (LID) problem, flexible job-shop scheduling problem (fJSP), multistage process planning (MPP) problem, and advanced planning and scheduling (APS) problem, First, we formulate a generalized mathematic models for all those problems; several evolutionary algorithms which adapt to the problems have been proposed; some test instances based oil the practical problems demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach.
