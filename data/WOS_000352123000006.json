An access is a lookup on a relation within a relational database, fixing values for a set of positions in the relation. For example, a transition can represent access to a Web form, where the user is restricted to filling in values for a particular set of fields. We look at verifying properties of a schema describing the possible accesses of such a system. We present a language where one can describe the properties of an access path and also specify additional restrictions on accesses that are enforced by the schema. Our main property language, AccLTL, is based on a first-order extension of linear-time temporal logic, interpreting access paths as sequences of relational structures. We also present a lower-level automaton model, A-automata, into which AccLTL specifications can compile. We show that AccLTL and A-automata can express static analysis problems related to \"querying with limited access patterns\" that have been studied in the database literature in the past, such as whether an access is relevant to answering a query and whether two queries are equivalent in the accessible data they can return. We prove decidability and complexity results for several restrictions and variants of AccLTL and explain which properties of paths can be expressed in each restriction.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Schemas with Access Restrictions", "paper_id": "WOS:000352123000006"}
