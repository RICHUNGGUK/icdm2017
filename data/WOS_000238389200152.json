This paper addresses the issue of capturing microstructural details and providing macro linkage by simulating two phenomena. ne first defines a suitable length scale such that numerical models are sufficient in detail and are appropriate in terms of computational time. The second is the feasibility using Cellular Automata (CA) as an additional technique that can be used in conjunction with a conventional Finite Elements (FE) representation to model material heterogeneity and related properties. This is done by identifying an abstract scale in between the micro and macro scales, termed the \"mesoscale\" to obtain a multi-scale CAFE modelling technique that utilises the CA technique to represent initial and evolving microstructural features at an appropriate length obtained using an oyerlying FE mesh.", "paper_title": "Multi-scale CAFE modelling for hot deformation of aluminium alloys", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200152"}
