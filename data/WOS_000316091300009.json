The pedestrian detection involved using a window of fixed size to extract the candidate region from left to right and top to bottom of the image, and performing feature extractions on the candidate region. Finally, our proposed cascade classifier completed the classification of the candidate region. The cascade-AdaBoost classifier has been successfully used in pedestrian detection. We have improved the initial setting method for the weights of the training samples in the AdaBoost classifier, so that the selected weak classifier would be able to focus on a higher detection rate other than accuracy. The proposed cascade classifier can automatically select the AdaBoost classifier or SVM to construct a cascade classifier according to the training samples, so as to effectively improve classification performance and reduce training time. In order to verify our proposed method, we have used our extracted database of pedestrian training samples, PETs database, INRIA database and MIT database. This completed the pedestrian detection experiment whose result was compared to those of the cascade-AdaBoost classifier and support vector machine. The result of the experiment showed that in a simple environment involving campus experimental image and PETs database, both our cascade classifier and other classifiers can attain good results, while in a complicated environment involving INRA and MIT database experiments, our cascade classifier had better results than those of other classifiers.
