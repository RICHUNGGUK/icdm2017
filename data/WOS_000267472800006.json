The vertices of the upper hemisphere, the ones of the lower hemisphere and at last the equatorial vertices are computed independently. The principle of the algorithm is based on duality and especially on the fact that the vertices of the preimage correspond to faces of the input set S or of its chords set S circle minus S boolean OR ((0,0,1)). It allows to go from one vertex to another by gift-wrapping until the whole region of interest has been explored. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
