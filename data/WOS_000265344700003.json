After making a finite volume discretization of the depth-averaged k-epsilon equations in conservative form, the q-r equations, that give stability to the process, are obtained. Wall and inlet boundary conditions for the turbulent equations and wall conditions for the hydrodynamic equations are discussed. A comparison between the k-epsilon and q-r models and some experimental results is made.
