Current research has investigated on the effect of single-line shield excavation on surrounding environments and tunneling for parallel-crossing or perpendicular down-crossing underground structures. However, minimal attention has been given to soil disturbances induced by multiline tunneling and complex overlapped interaction mechanics for adjacent structures, such as existing above-crossing and down-crossing subway tunnels. Few studies focus on oblique crossing construction and setting rules for the operation parameters of shield machines. Based on the Shanghai Railway transportation project and in situ monitoring data, the deformation analyses of existing subway tunnels induced by an earth pressure balance (EPB) shield during the process of above-overlapped and down-overlapped crossing tunnels with oblique angles are presented. The deformation analyses employ the three-dimensional finite element (3D FE) numerical simulation method, and the simplified analytical method. The analysis results from the theoretical methods are consistent with the monitoring data. The setting rules of multiline propulsion main parameters, including the earth pressure for cutting open, and the synchronized grouting, are also established. This study may provide a theoretical basis for the development of properly overlapped crossing schemes and geotechnical protective measures during multiline tunneling construction in soft soil.
