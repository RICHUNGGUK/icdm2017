While there are many techniques image segmentation, this work chooses the artificial neural network (ANN) since it is not very sensitive to noise. In order to reduce the processing time, the operator selects the region of interest where the neural network will identify the borders. Neighborhood and gradient search techniques are then employed to link the points and the left ventricle contour is traced. The present method has been efficient in detecting the left ventricle borders echocardiography images compared to those whose borders were delineated by the specialists. For good results, it is important to choose properly the areas to be analyzed and the central points of these areas.", "paper_title": "Artificial neural network: border detection in echocardiography", "paper_id": "WOS:000258842700001"}
