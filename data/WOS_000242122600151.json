The main interest of these services is to efficiently store and query the positions of moving objects. To achieve this goal, index structures are required. In this paper we propose a new index structure for moving objects in networks: NCO-Tree. It efficiently supports the Segment-Based tracking approaches and its optimization. We give the structure description, insertion and search algorithms, then evaluate it with experiment.", "paper_title": "NCO-Tree: A spatio-temporal access method for Segment-Based tracking of moving objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600151"}
