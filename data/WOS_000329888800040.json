This algorithm consists of two parts: the first part is the G&D part that combines Generative model and Discriminative model for tracking, and the second part is the View-Based model for target appearance that corrects the result of the G&D part if necessary. In GRID part, we use the Maximum Margin Projection (MMP) to construct a graph model to preserve both local geometrical and discriminant structures of the data manifold in low dimensions. Therefore, such discriminative subspace combined with traditional generative subspace can benefit from both models. In addition, we address the problem of learning maximum margin projection under the Spectral Regression (SR) which results in significant savings in computational time. To further solve the drift, an online learned sparsely represented view-based model of the target is complementary to the G&D part. When the result of G&D part is unreliable, the view-based model can rectify the result in order to avoid drifting. Experimental results on several challenging video sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
