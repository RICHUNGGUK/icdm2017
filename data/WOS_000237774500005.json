We therefore entertain the possibility that, whereas the average human user may provide sensible demonstrations from a human's perspective, these same demonstrations may be insufficient, incomplete, ambiguous, or otherwise \"flawed\" from the perspective of the training set needed by the learning algorithm to generalize properly. To address this issue, we present a system where the robot is modeled as a socially engaged and socially cognitive learner. We illustrate the merits of this approach through an example where the robot is able to correctly learn from \"flawed\" demonstrations by taking the visual perspective of the human instructor to clarify potential ambiguities.
