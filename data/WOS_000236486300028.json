We study and improve the inference algorithm in the variational Bayesian blind source separation model introduced by Valpola and Karhunen in 2002. As comparison methods we use extensions of the Kalman filter that are widely used inference methods in tracking and control theory. The results in stability, speed, and accuracy favour our method especially in difficult inference problems.", "paper_title": "State inference in variational Bayesian nonlinear state-space models", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300028"}
