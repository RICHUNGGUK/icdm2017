We also describe an exact method for solving it as well as a hybrid meta-heuristic procedure which is more adequate for medium and large-sized problems or in cases in which a quick solution is needed. As an application, we solve several problems based on data from the IBEX35 index and the Spanish Stock Exchange Interconnection System.", "paper_title": "Exact and heuristic procedures for solving the fuzzy portfolio selection problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000300290100002"}
