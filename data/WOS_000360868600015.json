Server virtualization aims to reduce the cost of service provisioning and improve fault tolerance, portability and security of virtualized services by sharing the resources amongst consolidated servers. Although designing applications based on multi-tier architecture brings benefits to service providers in terms of service flexibility, functionality, and reusability of software in comparison to traditional architecture, deploying multi-tier applications in virtualization environments faces many challenges. In addition to virtualization overhead and virtual machines interference, dynamic and unpredictable nature of submitted workloads makes the performance evaluation of virtualized multi-tier applications very complex task. In this article, we propose a novel analytical model based on queuing network to evaluate virtualized multi-tier applications. The efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated by using a series of in-depth experiments in different configurations to study the performance of multi-tier applications. The conducted experiments examine consolidation of RUBiS and Wikipedia tiers in different scenarios under both bursty and non-bursty workloads. We present the results based on quantitative and qualitative analyses that are useful for virtualized multi-tier applications deployment. The performance modeling and experimental results are in excellent agreement and confirm the efficiency of the proposed model to evaluate and analyze the performance of virtualized multi-tier applications.
