Design/methodology/approach - Short-time fourier transform (STFT) and S-transform algorithms were applied to analyze non-stationary signals originating from switching of capacitor banks in a power system. Findings - The S-transform showed possibilities of sharp localization of the basic component, and allowed improvement of tracking dynamism the transient components in comparison to STFT. Practical implications - S-transform is a better tool for the analysis of non-stationary waveforms in power systems and its properties can be used for diagnostic and power quality applications. Originality/value - The dynamic tracking of the changes in time and frequency of real-like signals originating from a power system are investigated in this paper.", "paper_title": "Analysis of non-stationary electric signals using the S-transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000264126000019"}
