A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach is developed with the underlying objective of profit maximization. Planning takes into account raw material acquisition and processing, storage and distribution of several products flowing through the network. Uncertainty is associated to the quantity and quality of the flow of products of the reverse network, which are directly affected by customers and sorting centers, respectively. The approach considers, by means of scenarios, the simultaneous integration of two important uncertainty sources, thus presenting an important modeling advantage, i.e. that of providing a better understanding of the CLSCs. The applicability of the formulation is tested with a real sized example of a Portuguese glass company. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
