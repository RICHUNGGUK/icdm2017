The proposed high performance hardware implementation of the hash functions used sponge construction which generates desired length digest, considering two key design metrics: throughput and power consumption. Firstly, this paper introduces unfolding transformation which increases the throughput of hash function and pipelining and parallelism design techniques which reduce the delay. Secondly, we propose a frequency trade-off technique which can give us a scope of frequency value for making a trade-off between low dynamic power consumption and high throughput. Finally, we use load-enable based clock gating scheme to eliminate wasted toggle rate of signals in the idle mode of hash encryption system. We demonstrated the proposed design techniques by using 45 nm CMOS technology at 10 MHz. The results show that we can achieve up to 47.97 times higher throughput, 6.31% delay reduction, and 13.65% dynamic power reduction.", "paper_title": "High Performance and Low Power Hardware Implementation for Cryptographic Hash Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000332976600001"}
