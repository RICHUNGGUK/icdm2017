Expert Systems are rule-based computer techniques designed to provide expertise in particular topics, where the rules are algorithms developed from previous knowledge and experience. The technique is tested on data recorded by the seismic network in Iceland. The statistics suggests that the ES is reasonably successful and provides appropriate initial input parameters for a more precise analysis, which leads to the success of the comprehensive Shear-Wave Analysis System (SWAS) for measuring shear-wave splitting.
