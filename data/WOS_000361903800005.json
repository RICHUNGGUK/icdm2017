The particular context requires constant spatial boundary conditions to be asymptotically matched by the interconnection signals along the string (e.g., to match supply to demand in steady state). Furthermore, the transient response associated with a step change in the spatial boundary condition must remain bounded across space in a string-length independent fashion. With this in mind, an infinite cascade abstraction is considered. A corresponding decentralized string-stability certificate for the desired behaviour is established in terms of the subsystem norms, via Lyapunov-type analysis of a two-dimensional model in Roesser form. Verification of the certificate implies uniformly bounded interconnection signals in response to the following system inputs: (i) a square-summable (across space) sequence of initial conditions; and (ii) a uniformly-bounded (across time) finite-energy input applied as the spatial boundary condition (e.g., finite duration on-off pulse). The decentralized nature of the certificate facilitates subsystem-by-subsystem design of local controllers that achieve string-stable behaviour overall. This application of the analysis is explored within the context of a scalable approach to the design of distributed distant-downstream controllers for the sections of an automated irrigation channel.", "paper_title": "Decentralized string-stability analysis for heterogeneous cascades subject to load-matching requirements", "paper_id": "WOS:000361903800005"}
