For a one-dimensional finite ad hoc network formed by n nodes uniformly and independently distributed in a closed interval [0, z] (z is an element of R+), we give a closed form expression for the probability that a connected one-dimensional finite ad hoc network becomes disconnected after removing a node. We also sketch a procedure of finding the exact formula for 2-connectivity in a one-dimensional ad hoc network.", "paper_title": "A note on the 2-connectivity in one-dimensional ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000286497800011"}
