Only a fraction of the explosive energy is efficiently consumed in the actual breakage and displacement of the rock mass, and the rest of the energy is spent in undesirable effects, such as ground vibrations. The prediction of induced ground vibrations across a fractured rock mass is of great concern to rock engineers in assessing the stability of rock slopes in open pit mines. The waveform superposition method was used in the Gol-E-Gohar iron mine to simulate the production blast seismograms based upon the single-hole shot vibration measurements carried out at a distance of 39 m from the blast. The simulated production blast seismograms were then used as input to predict particle velocity time histories of blast vibrations in the mine wall using the universal distinct element code (UDEC). Simulated time histories of particle velocity showed a good agreement with the measured production blast time histories. Displacements and peak particle velocities were determined at various points of the engineered slope. The maximum displacement at the crest of the nearest bench in the X and Y directions was 26 mm, which is acceptable in regard to open pit slope stability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
