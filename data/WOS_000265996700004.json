A direct velocity-pressure algorithm in primitive variables with a Neumann condition for the pressure is employed. The spatial discretization is made with finite central differences on a staggered grid. The pressure field is directly updated without any iteration. Numerical simulations were done for several Weissemberg numbers (We) and Grashof numbers (Gr). The numerical results show that for high Weissemberg numbers (We>7.4 x 10(-5)) and for ducts with aspect ratio 2:1 and 8:1, the secondary flow is restabilized with a stretched double vortex configuration. It is also observed that when the Grashof number is increased (Gr>17 x 10(-4)), the buoyancy force neutralizes the effects of the Coriolis force for ducts with aspect ratio 8:1.
