This difficulty calls for an analytic technique that is Simple, yet have enough details to capture user behavior and flexibly address a broad range of issues. This paper presents such a technique. It treats traffic equilibrium as a balance between an inflow controlled by users, and an outflow controlled by the network (link capacity, congestion avoidance, etc.). This decomposition is demonstrated with a surfing session model, and validated with a traffic trace and NS2 simulations. The technique's accessibility and breadth are illustrated through an analysis of several issues concerning the location, stability, robustness and dynamics of traffic equilibrium.
