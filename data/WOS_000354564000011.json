The author makes a case for conducting such investigations by articulating the potential contributions of advancing theoretical and practical understanding of information science in both physical and technological environments using these approaches. The author also offers a theoretical toolbox of conceptual underpinnings relevant to chronic disposition and situational priming to provide a general overview on how such investigations can be performed. It is hoped that the arguments and theoretical lenses put forth will inspire further research in the area.", "paper_title": "Enriching information science research through chronic disposition and situational priming: A short note for future research", "paper_id": "WOS:000354564000011"}
