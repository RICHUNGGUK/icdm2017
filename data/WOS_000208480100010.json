A 3-wheeled simple robot with limited degrees of freedom was designed. Our goal was to make the robot displaying emotions in music performance by performing expressive movements. These movements have been compiled and programmed based on literature about emotion in music, musicians' movements in expressive performances, and object shapes that convey different emotional intentions. The emotions happiness, anger, and sadness have been implemented in this way. General results from behavioral experiments show that emotional intentions can be synthesized, displayed and communicated by an artificial creature, also in constrained circumstances.", "paper_title": "Communication of musical expression by means of mobile robot gestures", "paper_id": "WOS:000208480100010"}
