Both types of tests can be represented as < s(1)v(1),s(2)v(2)>, where s(1) and s(2) are states, v(1) and v(2) and are primary input vectors. To facilitate the generation of a mixed test set that contains both broadside and skewed-load tests, this paper associates with s(2) a property that can be used for estimating whether a skewed-load or a broadside test is more likely to exist with s(2) in its second pattern. This paper uses this property for guiding a test generation procedure to consider only one of the two test types for most of the target faults.", "paper_title": "Generation of Mixed Test Sets for Transition Faults", "paper_id": "WOS:000306922400016"}
