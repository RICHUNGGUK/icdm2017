A sports video is hierarchically divided into temporal partitions namely, megaslots, slots, and semantic entities, namely concepts, and events. The proposed method extracts event sequence from video and classifies each sequence into a concept by sequential association mining. The extracted concepts and events within the concepts are selected according to their degree of importance to include those in the highlights. A parameter degree of abstraction is proposed, which gives a choice to the user about how concisely the extracted concepts should be produced for a specified highlight duration. We have successfully extracted highlights from recorded video of cricket match and compared our results with the manually-generated highlights by sports television channel.", "paper_title": "Semantic concept mining in cricket videos for automated highlight generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000275800200010"}
