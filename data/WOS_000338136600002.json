Adiabatic logic is an implementation of reversible logic in CMOS where the current flow through the circuit is controlled such that the energy dissipation due to switching and capacitor dissipation is minimized. Recent advances in dual-rail adiabatic logic show reduction in average and differential power, making this design methodology advantageous in applications where security is the primary design metric and operating frequency is slower, such as Smart Cards. In this paper, we present an algorithm for synthesis of adiabatic circuits in CMOS. Then, using the ESPRESSO heuristic for minimization of Boolean functions method on each output node, we reduce the size of the synthesized circuit. Our approach correlates the horizontal offsets in the permutation matrix with the necessary switches required for synthesis instead of using a library of equivalent functions. The synthesis results show that, on average, the proposed algorithm represents an improvement of 36% over the best known reversible designs with the optimized dual-rail cell libraries. Then, we present an adiabatic S-box which significantly reduces energy imbalance compared to previous benchmarks. The design is capable of forward encryption and reverse decryption with minimal overhead, allowing for efficient hardware reuse.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of Dual-Rail Adiabatic Logic for Low Power Security Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000338136600002"}
