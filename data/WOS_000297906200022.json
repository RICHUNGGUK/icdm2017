In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based learning scheme to conduct Graph Optimization for Dimensionality Reduction with Sparsity Constraints (GODRSC). Different from most of graph-based DR methods where graphs are generally constructed in advance, GODRSC aims to simultaneously seek a graph and a projection matrix preserving such a graph in one unified framework, resulting in an automatically updated graph. Moreover, by applying an l(1) regularizer, a sparse graph is achieved, which models the \"locality\" structure of data and contains natural discriminating information. Finally, extensive experiments on several publicly available UCI and face databases verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
