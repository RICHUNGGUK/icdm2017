This paper analyzes the security of matrix embedding against cryptanalytic attacks. The secrecy security of matrix embedding using information theory under the conditions of known-cover attack and chosen-stego attack is studied. After that, the unicity distance of the key, message equivocation and the relationship among wet ratio, embedding rate and key equivocation for the wet paper channel are given through analyzing the key model under the known-cover attack condition. Furthermore, an effective differential attack to matrix embedding under chosen-stego attack condition is proposed. The results of analysis show that the matrix embedding is not secure enough with respect to cryptographic secrecy against the stronger adversaries.", "paper_title": "Cryptographic Secrecy Analysis of Matrix Embedding", "paper_id": "WOS:000319191800005"}
