Our implementation is sound and complete with respect to the structural congruence for the calculus: two processes are equivalent if and only if they are mapped into graphs with the same normal form. Most importantly, the encoding allows the use of standard graph rewriting mechanisms for modelling the reduction semantics of the calculus.", "paper_title": "Graph rewriting for the pi-calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000248779300003"}
