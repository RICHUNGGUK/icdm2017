A kernelization algorithm, or simply a kernel, is a polynomial-time transformation that transforms any given parameterized instance to an equivalent instance of the same problem, with size and parameter bounded by a function of the parameter in the input. A kernel is polynomial if the size and parameter of the output are polynomially-bounded by the parameter of the input. In this paper we develop a framework which allows showing that a wide range of FPT problems do not have polynomial kernels. Our evidence relies on hypothesis made in the classical world (i.e. non-parametric complexity), and revolves around a new type of algorithm for classical decision problems, called a distillation algorithm, which is of independent interest. Using the notion of distillation algorithms, we develop a generic lower-bound engine that allows us to show that a variety of FPT problems, fulfilling certain criteria, cannot have polynomial kernels unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. These problems include k-PATH, k-CYCLE, k-EXACT CYCLE, k-SHORT CHEAP TOUR, k-GRAPH MINOR ORDER TEST, k-CUTWIDTH, k-SEARCH NUMBER, k-PATHWIDTH, k-TREEWIDTH. k-BRANCHWIDTH, and several optimization problems parameterized by treewidth and other structural parameters.
