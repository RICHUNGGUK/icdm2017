However, existing e-learning platforms have a limitation to provide multimedia learning objects on the web because of network traffic problems, which make it difficult to use a large amount of multimedia learning objects or a synchronous video streaming in e-learning. In this paper, we propose an adaptive QoS architecture to use the large amount of multimedia and realtime multimedia pedagogically for e-learning. First, we introduce the pedagogical issues and adaptive issues. And then we describe the adaptive strategies and architecture to support adaptive QoS. The purpose of this paper is to contribute towards understanding how to support adaptive QoS for service-oriented learning environments of e-learning.", "paper_title": "Adaptive QoS for using multimedia in e-learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000090"}
