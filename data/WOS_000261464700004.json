For any given integer k >= 1, a connected graph G is said to be conditional diameter k-saturated if D(P)(G) >= k and there does not exist any other connected graph G' with order vertical bar V(G')vertical bar = vertical bar V(G)vertical bar, size vertical bar E(G')vertical bar > vertical bar E(G)vertical bar, and conditional diameter D(P)(G') >= k. In this article, we obtain such conditional diameter saturated graphs for a number of properties P, generalizing the results obtained in (Ore, J Combin Theory 5(1968), 75-81) for the (standard) diameter D(G).
