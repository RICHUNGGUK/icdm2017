A common way of expressing such restrictions is in terms of an upper bound for the maximum available footprint area in gate equivalents (GE). For example, RFID tags conforming to standards EPC Class-1 Generation-2 and ISO/IEC 18000-6C can devote up to 4K GE to security functions. However, in most cases, algorithm designers are not hardware experts, nor they have any quantitative means to find out how much area their designs would occupy in a given technology. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by providing an estimate of the upper bound for the footprint area of any algorithm. Our approach takes into account the main components of such algorithms, namely, basic arithmetic/logic operations and additional hardware such as registers and multiplexers. We believe that our proposal can help designers in making informed decisions about what kind of algorithmic structures can be afforded for a target environment.", "paper_title": "An Estimator for the ASIC Footprint Area of Lightweight Cryptographic Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800036"}
