A cyber-crime investigation involves a potentially large number of individuals and groups who need to communicate, share and make decisions across many levels and boundaries. This paper presents an approach adopting elements of the Strategic Systems Thinking Framework (SST) by which conflicting information due to the unavoidable uncertainty can be captured and processed, in support of the investigation process. A formal description of this approach is proposed as a basis for developing a cyber-crime investigation support system. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
