According to the idea of prospect theory, reference points concerning attributes are first determined. Then, for the three formats of attribute aspirations, the calculation formulae of alternatives' gains/losses concerning attributes are given. By calculating each alternative's gain/loss, a gain-loss matrix is constructed. Further, using the value function from prospect theory and the simple additive weighting method, the overall prospect value of each alternative is calculated. Based on the obtained overall prospect values, a ranking of alternatives can be determined. Finally, a case study is given to illustrate the use of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTE DECISION MAKING WITH MULTIPLE FORMATS OF ATTRIBUTE ASPIRATIONS: A METHOD BASED ON PROSPECT THEORY", "paper_id": "WOS:000326678500004"}
