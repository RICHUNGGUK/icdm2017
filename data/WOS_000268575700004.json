A set of vertical wires of 0.20 mm diameter were positioned at a distance of 10 mm upstream from the leading edge of a concave surface of radius of curvature R = 1.0 in to pre-set the wavelength of the vortices so to obtain the most amplified wavelength Gortler vortices. Consequently, the wavelength of the vortices was set equal to the wire spacing and preserved downstream, In addition to the high shear regions near the wall, one positive peak at the head of the mushroom-like structures and two relatively weak negative peaks at the vicinity of the low-speed streaks are found in the iso-partial derivative u/partial derivative y contours. They are believed to be related to the formation of the inflectional point in the velocity profile across boundary layer. The occurrence of the inflection points in the spanwise distributions of streamwise velocity component u is associated with the appearance of the second peak of the partial derivative u/partial derivative z shear near the boundary layer edge. The nonlinear effect of Gortler instability is to increase the wall shear stress, and further enhancement beyond the turbulent values is due to the presence of secondary instability.", "paper_title": "Visualizing Shear Stress in Gortler Vortex Flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000268575700004"}
