In fact, flux leakage perturbs the field sensors as well as the homogeneity the sample area. This paper seeks to present a 3D finite element (FE) model of an RSST taking account a vector hysteresis model. The use of such model allows analyzing with accuracy the behavior of the system. Design/methodology/approach - A vector hysteresis model, which is based on a vectorization of the scalar Jiles-Atherton model, is incorporated in a 3D FE code, with vector formulation. Findings - The vector hysteresis model is validated by comparison with rotational results. A good agreement is observed between calculations and measurements. Originality/value - This paper shows that a classical scalar hysteresis model can be extended take into account the magnetic vector behaviour and can be included in a 3D FE code. methodology for the hysteresis including in the FE formulation is shown. This is useful for the and analysis of an RSST prototype, improving the measurement techniques.", "paper_title": "Analysis of a rotational single sheet tester using 3D finite element model taking into account hysteresis effect", "paper_id": "WOS:000249232200011"}
