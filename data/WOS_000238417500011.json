Multicast data is assumed to be layered cumulatively. The multicast tree constructed fulfills the QoS requirements imposed by heterogeneous receivers in terms of the layer of the data and its corresponding bandwidth, and consumes network resource as little as possible. Besides the general state information of the topology and the available bandwidth, two kinds of group-specific state information such as the distribution of multicast tree and the highest receivable layer of on-tree nodes are maintained at a router to calculate a feasible graft path to the multicast tree. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol obtains low routing message overhead, high success routing ratio and optimization usage of network bandwidth.", "paper_title": "Multicast routing protocol with heterogeneous and dynamic receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500011"}
