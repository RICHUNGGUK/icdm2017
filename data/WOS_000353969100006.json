This article proposes a dynamic feature modelling method for closed-loop machining process control of complex parts. A software platform is developed to include feature modelling software units with algorithms to represent and integrate geometric, machining, inspection and monitoring information and a service software unit with algorithms to update dynamic feature information and trigger online inspection. A multi-thread execution approach and a finite state machine method are adopted to support the execution and collaboration of multiple algorithms for dynamic feature modelling. A sharing memory approach is utilised for real-time communication between software units and the computer numerical control (CNC) kernel. The dynamic feature model is highly informative and can support autonomous decision-making and bidirectional information flow. By implementing the proposed dynamic feature modelling, a closed-loop process machining control including the integration of process planning, machining, inspection and monitoring for complex parts can be achieved.", "paper_title": "Dynamic feature modelling for closed-loop machining process control of complex parts", "paper_id": "WOS:000353969100006"}
