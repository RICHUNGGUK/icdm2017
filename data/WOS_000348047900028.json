First a chaotic feature and other features are calculated from each pixel intensity series. Then these features are combined to a chaotic feature vector. Therefore a video is modeled as a feature vector matrix. Next by the aid of bag of words framework, we explore the representation ability of the proposed chaotic feature vector. Finally we investigate recognition rate between different combinations of chaotic features. Experimental results show the merit of chaotic feature vector for pixel intensity series representation.", "paper_title": "Exploiting Chaotic Feature Vector for Dynamic Textures Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000348047900028"}
