Conventional self-organizing neural networks like recurrent variant of Self-Organizing Map provide clustering of input sequences in space and time but the identification of the sequence itself requires supervised recognition process, when such network is used, In our network called TICALM the recognition is expressed by speed of convergence of the network while processing either learned or an unknown signal. TICALM network capabilities are shown on an experiment with handwriting recognition.", "paper_title": "Self-organizing neural networks for signal recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100043"}
