Aiming at high retrieval performance, these systems frequently capture the user's notion of similarity through expressive image models and adaptive similarity measures. On the query side, image models can significantly differ in quality compared to those stored on the database side. Thus, similarity measures have to be robust against these individual quality changes in order to maintain high retrieval performance. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of the family of signature-based similarity measures in the context of content-based image retrieval. To this end, we introduce the generic concept of average precision stability, which measures the stability of a similarity measure with respect to changes in quality between the query and database side. In addition to the mathematical definition of average precision stability, we include a performance evaluation of the major signature-based similarity measures focusing on their stability with respect to querying image databases by examples of varying quality. Our performance evaluation on recent benchmark image databases reveals that the highest retrieval performance does not necessarily coincide with the highest stability.", "paper_title": "On stability of signature-based similarity measures for content-based image retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000338120700021"}
