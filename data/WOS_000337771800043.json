Such sudden switches in dependence structures are studied using Markov switching regular vine copulas. These copulas allow for asymmetric dependencies and tail dependencies in high dimensional data. Methods for fast maximum likelihood as well as Bayesian inference are developed. The algorithms are validated in simulations and applied to financial data. The results show that regime switches are present in the dependence structure and that regime switching models provide tools for the accurate description of inhomogeneity during times of crisis.
