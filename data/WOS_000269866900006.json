Linguistic attribute hierarchies are then introduced as a means of modelling the complex and often imprecise functional relationships between low-level attributes or measurements and high-level decision or classification variables. Within this framework we introduce linguistic decision trees as a tool for information aggregation in multi-attribute decision problems and describe the process of information propagation through a hierarchy of linked decision trees. In addition,we consider the ranking of different alternatives or examples based on their linguistic descriptions of a high-level utility variable. Finally, we discuss how linguistic decision trees embedded in attribute hierarchies can be learnt from data.", "paper_title": "MULTI-ATTRIBUTE DECISION MAKING BASED ON LABEL SEMANTICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000269866900006"}
