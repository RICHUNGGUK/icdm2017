To minimise the schedule's fuzzy makespan, we consider different ranking methods for fuzzy numbers. We then propose a cooperative coevolutionary algorithm with two different populations evolving the two components of a solution: machine assignment and task relative order. Additionally, we incorporate a specific local search method for each population. The resulting hybrid algorithm is then evaluated on existing benchmark instances, comparing favourably with the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results also serve to analyse the influence in the robustness of the resulting schedules of the chosen ranking method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
