Gaussian kernel of the proposed blind algorithm has the effect of cutting out the outliers on the difference between the desired level values and impulse-infected outputs. And also the proposed algorithm has relatively less sensitivity to channel eigenvalue ratio and has reduced computational complexity compared to the recently introduced correntropy algorithm. According to these characteristics, simulation results show that the proposed blind algorithm produces superior performance in multi-path communication channels corrupted with impulsive noise.", "paper_title": "Blind Signal Processing for Impulsive Noise Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000301401500005"}
