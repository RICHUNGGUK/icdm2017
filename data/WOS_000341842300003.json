Moreover, complex web applications can have thousands of linked web pages built using different technologies. As a result, the description of navigation maps has become more complex in recent years. This paper presents NMMp, a UML extension that: (i) provides an abstract vision of the navigation structure of the presentation tier of web applications, independently of architectural details or programming languages; (ii) can be automatically transformed into UML-WAE class diagrams, which can be easily integrated with the design of the other tiers of the web application; (iii) encourages the use of architectural and multitier design patterns; and (iv) has been developed according to OMG standards, thus facilitating its use with general purpose UML CASE tools in industry.", "paper_title": "NMMp: A Model-Driven UML Extension for the Description of Navigation Maps for Web Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000341842300003"}
