We propose a novel sequence representation, based on its fuzzy distances from optimal representative signal instances, called statemes. We also propose a novel modified clustering discriminant analysis algorithm minimizing the adopted criterion with respect to both the data projection matrix and the class representation, leading to the optimal discriminant sequence class representation in a low-dimensional space, respectively. Based on this representation, simple classification algorithms, such as the nearest subclass centroid, provide high classification accuracy. A three step iterative optimization procedure for choosing statemes, optimal discriminant subspace and optimal sequence class representation in the final decision space is proposed. The classification procedure is fast and accurate. The proposed method has been tested on a wide variety of multidimensional sequence classification problems, including handwritten character recognition, time series classification and human activity recognition, providing very satisfactory classification results.", "paper_title": "Multidimensional Sequence Classification Based on Fuzzy Distances and Discriminant Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000324934400011"}
