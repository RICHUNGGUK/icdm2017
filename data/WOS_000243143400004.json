In this paper, we present an overview of the key challenges that need to be addressed for the integration of benchmarking practices, techniques, and tools in emerging Grid computing infrastructures. We discuss the problems of performance representation, measurement, and interpretation in the context of Grid benchmarking, and propose the use of ontologies for organizing and describing benchmarking metrics. Finally, we present a survey of ongoing research efforts that develop benchmarks and benchmarking tools for the Grid.
