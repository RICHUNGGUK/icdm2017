When not bounded by a constant the depth-synchronization measure of an SCF grammar is at least logarithmic and at most linear with respect to the word length. Languages with linear depth-synchronization measure and languages with a depth-synchronization measure in between logarithmic and linear are proven to exist. This gives rise to a strict infinite hierarchy within the family of SCF (and ET0L) languages. Crown Copyright (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.
