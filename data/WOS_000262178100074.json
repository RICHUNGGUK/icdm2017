In this study, 304 years of annual natural runoff at the Sanmenxia station located in the Yellow River and the sunspot relative number are decomposed with the application of a Complex Morlet. According to the results of real part, modulus and second power of modulus, the annual runoff series at the Sanmenxia station has an obvious periodic oscillation on 90-100, 50-80, 35-50, 15-35, about 10, and less than 10-year scales. Also, there are obvious periodic variability with 60-90 years, 30-50 years and about 10 years. There are two centers of energy: one is about 1840-1850 oil 7-11-year scale and the other is about 1825-1925 on 60-70-year scale. From the wavelet variance, 3, 26, 46, 68 year periods are detected within a 100-year scale, and the 68-year period is the most significant. Similar analyses are conducted for the sunspot relative number within the same period 1700-2003. The sunspot series shows 11- and 60-year period variation, as well as eight energy centers. Then, the correlation analyses for 11- and 60-year serial scales are computed. From a long-term period (1700-2003) view, there is no notable correlation between the natural runoff and the sunspot relative number; however, it is evident that the correlations exist within a short-term period. The results also indicate that the relationships between solar activities and the natural runoff in the Yellow River are complicated.
