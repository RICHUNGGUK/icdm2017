This paper studies how these policies change the product pricing, the sales and the profit of the retailers, the amount of illegal WEEE disposal and the investment of the Government in the WEEE collection centers. The problems are formulated as nonlinear programming problems and the properties of the optimal solutions are investigated. The analysis result indicates that the Take back policy dominates the other three policies, with respect to the retailer's sales, the amount of illegal WEEE disposal and the investment of the Government. Thus the Take back policy should be adopted to regulate the disposal of WEEE in Hong Kong.", "paper_title": "Modeling the Effects of Hong Kong WEEE Management Policies on Retailers, Customers and the Government", "paper_id": "WOS:000357742700003"}
