Considerable evidence has accumulated regarding its unique ligand-binding properties, neural-specific distribution, distinct expression regulation, and possible roles in processes such as neuron protection and enzymatic metabolism. Structurally, neuroglobin enjoys unique features, such as bis-histidyl coordination to heme iron in the absence of exogenous ligand, heme orientational heterogeneity, and a heme sliding mechanism accompanying ligand binding. In the present work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to reveal functional and structural information in three carboxyl murine neuroglobin mutants with single point mutations F106Y, F106L and F106I, respectively. The MD simulation indicates a remarkable proximal effect on detectable displacement of heme and a larger tunnel in the protein matrix. In addition, the mutation at F106 confers on the CD region a very sensitive mobility in all three model structures. The dynamic features of neuroglobin demonstrate rearrangement of the inner space and highly active loop regions in solution. These imply that the conserved residue at the G5 site plays a key role in the physiological function of this unusual protein.", "paper_title": "Molecular dynamics simulation of a carboxy murine neuroglobin mutated on the proximal side: heme displacement and concomitant rearrangement in loop regions", "paper_id": "WOS:000275122000013"}
