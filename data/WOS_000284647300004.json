The training algorithm applies the rule to two and three layer SNNs, and is benchmarked using the Iris and Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WBC) data sets. The effectiveness of hidden layer dynamic threshold neurons is also investigated and results are presented.", "paper_title": "AN STDP TRAINING ALGORITHM FOR A SPIKING NEURAL NETWORK WITH DYNAMIC THRESHOLD NEURONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000284647300004"}
