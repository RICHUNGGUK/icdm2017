An irrigation decision support tool for peanut production was developed to provide probability distributions of the seasonal cost to irrigate peanuts under different El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasts. Yields were simulated for both irrigated and rainfed peanuts using the CSM-CROPGRO-Peanut model. The tool was used to examine the effects of different planting dates, soil types, and climate forecasts. Results of a case study are presented for the Georgia Green variety grown in Miller County, Georgia. The probability of obtaining a high net return under irrigated conditions increased when planting dates were delayed for El Nino years. Dryland peanut production was profitable in a La Nina year if peanuts were planted between mid-April and early May. The peanut irrigation decision support tool will be deployed as a web-based tool on the AgClimate web site (www.agclimate.org). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
