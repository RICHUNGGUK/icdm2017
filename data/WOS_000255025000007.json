The main steps of the analysis are also given, which yield the first error estimate for an adaptive scheme in the context of the Vlasov equation. This article focuses on a key feature of our method, which is a new algorithm to transport multiscale meshes along a smooth flow, in a way that can be said optimal in the sense that it satisfies both accuracy and complexity estimates which are likely to lead to optimal convergence rate., for the whole numerical scheme. From the regularity analysis of the numerical solution and how it gets transported by the numerical flow, it is shown that the accuracy of our scheme is monitored by a prescribed tolerance parameter E which represents the local interpolation error at each time step. As a consequence, the numerical solutions are proved to converge in L-infinity towards the exact ones as E and At tend to zero, and in addition to the numerical tests presented in (Campos Pinto and Mehrenberger, 2007), some complexity bounds are established which are likely to prove the optimality of the meshes.", "paper_title": "A direct and accurate adaptive semi-Lagrangian scheme for the Vlasov-Poisson equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000255025000007"}
