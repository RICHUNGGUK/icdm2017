They have been much less studied than node routing problems but impressive developments have been achieved in the last decade. The objective of this article is to survey these recent results and to provide an annotated bibliography. Except for a few references, the period surveyed starts from the publication of the book \"Arc routing: theory, solutions and applications\", edited by Dror in 2000. The article is made up of two main parts: one on uncapacitated (single vehicle) problems derived from the Chinese Postman Problem, the Rural Postman Problem, and the General Routing Problem; and one on multivehicle or capacitated problems such as the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem.
