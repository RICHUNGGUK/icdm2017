In this work, we optimise the shape, size and placement of the plate for successfully minimising bone remodelling around the implant. A design optimisation algorithm based on strain energy density criterion, combined with the finite element analysis, has been used in this study. The main optimisation goal was to reduce this change and keep it close to the conditions of an intact femur. The results suggest that the anterolateral side of the bone would be the optimum location for the plate, as for the geometry, the optimum moves towards having a thick, wide and short plate. These important results could be directly applicable to orthopaedic surgeons treating a femur fracture with internal plates. Since the optimisation algorithm remains the same for any patient, this advancement provides the surgeon with a tool to minimise the post surgery remodelling by trying to maintain the natural structure of the bone.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional design optimisation of patient-specific femoral plates as a means of bone remodelling reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000285145800020"}
