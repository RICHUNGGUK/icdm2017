In this article we trace the history of the movement, highlighting its interaction with intellectual property law. The movement has spawned open source software (OSS) communities where developers and users meet to create software that meets their needs. We discuss the demographic profile of OSS participants, their ideology, their motivations, and the process of OSS development. Then we examine the impacts of OSS on society as a whole from the perspective of the information society, discussing the effects on OSS developers, users of OSS, and society at large, particularly in developing countries.", "paper_title": "THE OPEN SOURCE MOVEMENT: A REVOLUTION IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000262841600001"}
