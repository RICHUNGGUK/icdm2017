A Borel-Cantelli lemma for uncertain measures is obtained and some convergence theorems for continuous uncertain measures are derived. Finally, these theorems are applied to compute the uncertainty distribution of Liu integral. We prove that the uncertain integral of a deterministic function with respect to a Liu process has a normal uncertainty distribution.", "paper_title": "A Note on Uncertain Sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000334734600009"}
