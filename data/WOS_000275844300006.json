However, it is vulnerable to unauthorized access to the transmitted data. People are worried about two major Security issues; privacy and authentication. Privacy refers to the guarantee that the communicated messages are not intercepted by an eavesdropper. Oil the other hand, authentication is carried out to ensure that any unauthorized user cannot fraudulently obtain his/her required services from the satellite communication systems. In this paper, the authors shall propose a new Secure protocol based oil key agreement scheme with mutual authentication to solve these problems on the VSAT satellite communications. Comparing with other key agreement schemes for VSAT satellite communications, our proposed scheme is more secure and efficient.", "paper_title": "A KEY AGREEMENT SCHEME FOR SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000275844300006"}
