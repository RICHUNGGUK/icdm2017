When there are several wireless communication devices on a human body, multiple access interference (MA!) usually occurs. To mitigate the effect of MAI and achieve additional diversity gain, we utilize SIC with an optimal ordering algorithm. A zero correlation duration (ZCD) code with robust MAT capability is employed as a spread code for UWB systems in a multi-device WBAN environment. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in terms of the bit error rate (BER). Simulation results confirm that the BER performance can be improved significantly if the proposed interference cancellation scheme and the ZCD code are jointly employed.", "paper_title": "Efficient Interference Cancellation Scheme for Wireless Body Area Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000290362900011"}
