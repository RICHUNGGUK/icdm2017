Heart failure (HF), CVD's primary paradigm, mainly affects people older than 65. The European MyHeart Project's mission is to empower citizens to fight CVD by leading a preventative lifestyle and allowing early diagnosis. This paper presents the iterative design and development of the HF management system, part of MyHeart Project. The system daily measures vital body signals to assess HF. The methodology applied herein has involved stakeholders in an iterative process: concept validation, feasibility, efficiency, patients' experience, and patients' acceptance. The final solution allows patient self-management of their chronic condition.", "paper_title": "Wearable and Mobile System to Manage Remotely Heart Failure", "paper_id": "WOS:000271481300017"}
