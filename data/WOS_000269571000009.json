In this standard, the best effort traffic uses the reservation multiple access control (MAC) mechanism, which is widely adopted in recent broadband network technologies. The goal of this paper is to study the performance of the MAC protocol of the best effort traffic in the IEEE 802.16 standard with emphasis on the size of the reservation period. We use a two-stage Markov chain model to capture all possible events on the reservation and service periods. This allows the computation of the inflow and outflow of bandwidth requests (BWRs) and their associated data packets which leads to the delay and throughput formulas. By means of illustrative examples and numerical results, validated through simulation, we investigate the key importance of the size of reservation period. We highlight potential performance improvement, through opportunistic dynamic control of the size of the reservation period to enhance the performance of reservation MAC protocol.
