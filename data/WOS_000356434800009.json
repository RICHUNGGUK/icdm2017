Design/methodology/approach - During the analysis four different magnetic material models were used for describing the static material characteristics, which characterised the materials' magnetisation behaviour with increasing accuracies: linear material model, piecewise linear material model, non-linear H(B) characteristic and the static hysteresis material model proposed by Tellinen. The described material models were implemented within a parametric magneto-dynamic model (PMD) of SMSSs, where the dynamic responses as well as power loss calculations from the obtained models were analysed. Findings - The momentous influences of various levels of detail on the calculation of dynamic variables and power losses inside SMSS with non-uniform magnetic fields were elaborated, where various static material characteristic models were evaluated, ranging from linear to hysteretic constitutive relationships. Research limitations/implications - The resulting PMD model using different static models was analysed over a frequency range from quasi-static to f = 1,000 Hz for different levels of magnetic flux density up to B-max = 1.5 T. Practical implications - The presented analysis provides fundamental insight when calculating dynamic electromagnetic variables and power losses inside non-linear SMSSs, which is instrumental when selecting an adequate model for a specific application. Originality/value - This paper provides closer insight on the way non-linearity, magnetic saturation and hysteresis affect the energy loss and magnetisation dynamics in SMSSs through the level of detail in the used material model. The strongly coupled model addresses both induced eddy currents and the ferromagnetic materials' magnetisation behaviour simultaneously using varying levels of detail so that the interplay between skin effect (i.e. eddy currents) across laminations and hysteresis can be resolved accurately. Therewith, adequate models for specific applications can be selected.", "paper_title": "Effects of saturation and hysteresis on magnetisation dynamics Analysis of different material models", "paper_id": "WOS:000356434800009"}
