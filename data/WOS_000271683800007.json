In particular, in the case where the exchangeable pair is constructed from a reversible Markov chain. we analyse how modifying the step size of the chain in a natural way affects the error term in the approximation acquired through Stein's method. It has been noted for the normal approximation that smaller step sizes may yield better bounds, and we obtain the first rigorous results that verify this intuition. For the examples associated to the normal distribution, the bound on the error is expressed in terms of the spectrum of the underlying chain, a characteristic of the chain related to convergence rates. The Poisson approximation using exchangeable pairs is less studied than the normal. but in the examples presented here the same principles hold.", "paper_title": "Step Size in Stein's Method of Exchangeable Pairs", "paper_id": "WOS:000271683800007"}
