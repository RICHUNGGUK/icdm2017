It integrates problem definition, reminding, creating, evaluating, and visualizing modules to automatically generate creative ideas. The system utilizes natural language processing techniques to map the patents to vectors by which related patent objects are automatically reminded around the given problem. These reminded objects are divided into text fragments, from which new idea can be generated through an interactive genetic algorithm. The system differs from existing creativity support systems in that it automatically reminds patents and generates creative ideas. This has been empirically validated by the conducted experiments.", "paper_title": "Generating creative ideas through patents", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500072"}
