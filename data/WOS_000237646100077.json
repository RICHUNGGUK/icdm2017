It presents a critical challenge to Mobile IP as the number of mobile environment devices scale up. This paper introduces an efficient movement management method which reduces the cost of the mobility signal messages of a mobile user. The proposed scheme uses a paging scheme and reduces the cost of paging request messages. Also the characteristic of a communication of a user is considered. This document present comparative analysis results for HMIPv6, P-HMEPv6 and proposed scheme, and show that the proposed scheme can reduce the cost of signal message which is needed by user to support the mobility management. According to the result of performance analysis, the proposed scheme can reduce the movement management signal message cost as 43% compare with the HMIPv6.", "paper_title": "An efficient movement management method of mobile node in Mobile IPv6", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100077"}
