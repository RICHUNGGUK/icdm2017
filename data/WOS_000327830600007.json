Automatically constructing effective polycube domains, however, is challenging. We present an algorithm for polycube construction and volumetric parameterization. The algorithm has three steps: pre-deformation, polycube construction and optimization, and mapping computation. Compared with existing polycube mapping methods, our algorithm can robustly generate desirable polycube domain shape and low-distortion volumetric parameterization. It can be used for automatic high-quality hexahedral mesh generation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
