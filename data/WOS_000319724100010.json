In this paper, we propose scheme TATA, the abbreviation of joint Temporal And Trust Analysis, which protects reputation systems from a new angle: the combination of time domain anomaly detection and Dempster-Shafer theory-based trust computation. Real user attack data collected from a cyber competition is used to construct the testing data set. Compared with two representative reputation schemes and our previous scheme, TATA achieves a significantly better performance in terms of identifying items under attack, detecting malicious users who insert dishonest ratings, and recovering reputation scores.", "paper_title": "Securing Online Reputation Systems Through Trust Modeling and Temporal Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000319724100010"}
