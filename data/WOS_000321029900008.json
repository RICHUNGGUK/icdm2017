These methods, which are often based on shape matching, tend to perform poorly for biological trajectories, such as cell motion, because similar biological behavior often results in dissimilar trajectory shape. Additionally, the criteria used for similarity may differ depending on the user's particular interest or the specific query behavior. We present a rank-based distance metric learning method that combines user input and a new set of biologically-motivated features for biological trajectory matching. We show that, with a small amount of user effort, this method outperforms existing trajectory methods. On an information retrieval task using real world data, our method outperforms recent, related methods by similar to 9%. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
