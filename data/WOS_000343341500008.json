Based on State, Operator, and Result (SOAR), which was a cognitive architecture, the traffic compliance agent was designed and elaborated in detail. In the paper, working memory (WM), long-term memory (LTM), operator selection, impasse solving, expected travel time determination, and chunking rule generation were described with the consideration of practical situations. Finally, two simulations with different information release modes were carried out under the same given condition, one was based on real-time flow statistics (M1), and the other was based on flow forecasting (M2). Through analyzing the changes of drivers' compliance rates and vehicles' lane-changing times under Variable Message Sign (VMS), M2 was proven to be more effective in alleviating traffic jam in the morning and evening peak periods and bring a higher compliance rate. This study laid a foundation for selecting the release modes of guidance information in both theory and practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
