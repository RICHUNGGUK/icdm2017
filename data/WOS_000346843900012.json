To handle with high and more uncertainty in the evaluation and selection processes, the problem is solved by using multi-criteria decision making technique with interval Type-2 fuzzy sets. The study contributes the facility location selection literature by introducing the application of fuzzy TOPSIS method with interval Type-2 fuzzy sets. Finally, the suggested approach is applied to a real life region and site selection problem of a cement factory.", "paper_title": "Multi-Criteria and Multi-Stage Facility Location Selection under Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Environment: A Case Study for a Cement Factory", "paper_id": "WOS:000346843900012"}
