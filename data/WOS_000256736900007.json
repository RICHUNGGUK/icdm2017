It contains a library of hard processes and models for initial-and final-state parton showers, multiple parton-parton interactions, beam remnants, string fragmentation and particle decays. It also has a set of utilities and interfaces to external programs. While previous versions were written in Fortran, PYTHIA 8 represents a complete rewrite in C++. The current release is the first main one after this transition, and does not yet in every respect replace the old code. It does contain some new physics aspects, on the other hand, that should make it an attractive option especially for LHC physics studies.", "paper_title": "A brief introduction to PYTHIA 8.1", "paper_id": "WOS:000256736900007"}
