A growing number of systems have been presented in the literature recently. This paper develops a general method of controller design for formation keeping and motion trajectory tracing of the MARS. A novel motion model about the motion trajectory tracing and group formation control of MARS for fixed and changing interaction is presented. Based on this model and the consensus theory, two theorems about the condition of mobile stability properties of the system are analyzed and proved. Finally, the validity of this scheme is supported by computer simulation.", "paper_title": "Consensus based formation control and trajectory tracing of multi-agent robot systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000244455300005"}
