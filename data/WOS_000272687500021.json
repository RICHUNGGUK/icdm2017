Research limitations/implications - In this paper, SMC method is applied for joint multistep-ahead prediction However, with the increasing of prediction step, the number of particles is increasing exponentially, which means that the prediction steps cannot be too large Practical implications - A very useful advice for researchers who study time-series forecasts Originality/value - A novel method of multistep-ahead prediction based oil joint probability distribution is proposed and SMC method is applied to prediction time series online. This paper is aimed at those researchers who focus oil time-series forecasts", "paper_title": "SMC method for online prediction in hidden Markov models", "paper_id": "WOS:000272687500021"}
