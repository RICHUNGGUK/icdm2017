Our algorithm is similar to the isomorphism algorithm for interval graphs of Lueker and Booth, but works on PC trees, which are unrooted and have a cyclic nature, rather than with PQ trees, which are rooted. This algorithm leads to linear-time isomorphism algorithms for related graph classes, including Helly circular-arc graphs, Gamma circular-arc graphs, proper circular- arc graphs and convex-round graphs.", "paper_title": "Isomorphism of graph classes related to the circular-ones property", "paper_id": "WOS:000319613200013"}
