However, few studies have examined the evolving relationships between physical movements and social closeness evolution. This is partially related to the shortage of longitudinal data in both physical locations and social interactions and the lack of an exploratory analysis environment capable of effectively investigating such a process over space and time. With the increasing availability of sociospatiotemporal data in recent years, it is now feasible to examine the relationships between physical separation and social interactions at the individual level in a space-time context. This research was intended to offer a spatiotemporal exploratory analysis approach to address this challenge. The first step was to propose the concept of a social closeness space-time path, which is an extension of the space-time path concept in time geography, to represent evolving human relationships in a social closeness space. A space-time geographical information system (GIS) prototype was then designed to support the representation and analysis of space-time paths in both physical and social closeness spaces. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed concept and design in gaining insight into the impact of physical migration on online social closeness was demonstrated through an empirical study. The contributions of this study include an extension of the time-geographic framework from physical space to social closeness space, the development of a multirepresentation approach in a GIS to integrate an individual's space-time paths in both physical and social closeness spaces, and an exploratory analysis of the evolving relationships between physical separation and social closeness over time.", "paper_title": "Exploring space-time paths in physical and social closeness spaces: a space-time GIS approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000355680500003"}
