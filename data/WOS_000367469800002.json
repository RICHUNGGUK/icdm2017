Optimization of function space assignment that relies upon users' activities is difficult due to the lack of quantifiable and detailed data about users' activities. In this paper, an activity-based simulation process model consisting of five phases is proposed and applied to an actual project. The phases include activity data collection, activity simulation, space movement pattern mining, function-space assignment optimization, movement simulation and assessment. The process also allows the building administrator to adjust the optimized assignment to accommodate hard-to-quantify preferences via a variety of indexes such as movement distance, corridor flow, and other space usage-related indexes. Results from application of the proposed model to an actual remodeling project indicated that the model offered the administrator a better assignment than the contracted architect, with a 5.79% increase in the objective function and a 23.92% decrease in movement distance. The adjusted assignment based on service-related indices, such as noise interference, further improved service by accounting for parameters that were not easily included in the objective function for optimization.", "paper_title": "An Activity-Based Simulation Model for Assessing Function Space Assignment for Buildings: A Service Performance Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000367469800002"}
