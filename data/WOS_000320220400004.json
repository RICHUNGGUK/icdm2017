In this paper, we propose a method for the construction of material models from microstructure images, that can be integrated into a heterogeneous CAD representation. The method utilizes Radon and wavelet transforms to compute a surfacelet representation. A novel feature recognition method was developed to identify microstructure features, including embedded fibers and grain boundaries, from the surfacelet representation. The models and methods were demonstrated with examples of synthetic and engineered polymer nanocomposites, a metal alloy, and a medical dataset of human feet. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
