The model introduced in this paper is based on two previously developed models, dynamic selective visual attention and visual stereoscopy, giving rise to the so-called dynamic stereoscopic selective visual attention method. The three models are based on the accumulative computation problem-solving method. This paper shows how software reusability enables enhancing results in vision research (video segmentation) by integrating earlier works. In this article, the first results obtained for synthetic sequences are included to show the effectiveness of the integration of motion and shape features with depth parameter in video segmentation.
