First, two relaxed conditions of nonquadratic stability with H-infinity norm bound are presented for this class of systems. The two relaxed conditions are shown to be useful in designing fuzzy control systems. By introducing some additional instrumental matrix variables, the two relaxed conditions are used to develop H-infinity controllers. In the control design, the first relaxed condition has fewer inequality constraints, but only admits a common additional matrix variable while the second one can admit multiple additional matrix variables. Finally, two examples are given to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Control design for fuzzy systems based on relaxed nonquadratic stability and H-infinity performance conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000245684800005"}
