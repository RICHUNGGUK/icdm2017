A previous model, called an Improver of Chess Problems, which is based on a hill-climbing search, improved slightly the quality of 10 out of 36 known problems (about 28%). In this article, we describe an improved model, called Deep Improver of Chess Problems. This model uses an improved version of Bounded Depth First Search. The experiment, we carry out on the same problems, show that the quality of 32 problems (about 89%) has been improved. Moreover, some of the improvements are meaningful and impressive.", "paper_title": "A deep improver of two-move chess mate problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237848300003"}
