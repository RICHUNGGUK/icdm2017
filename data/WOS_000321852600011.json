We compare this index with the one where not the h-index is divided by career length but where all citation numbers are divided by career length and where we then calculate the new h-index. Both mathematical models are compared. A variant of this second method is by calculating the h-index of the citation data, divided by article age. Examples are given.", "paper_title": "On the correction of the h-index for career length", "paper_id": "WOS:000321852600011"}
