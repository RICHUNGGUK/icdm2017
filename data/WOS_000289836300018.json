We focus on two-stage relay-interference networks where there are weak cross links, causing the networks to behave like a chain of Z Gaussian channels. Our main result is an approximate characterization of the capacity region for such ZZ and ZS networks. We propose a new interference management scheme, termed interference neutralization, which is implemented using structured lattice codes. This scheme allows for over-the-air interference removal, without the transmitters having complete access the interfering signals. This scheme in conjunction a new network decomposition technique provides the approximate characterization. Our analysis of these Gaussian networks is based on insights gained from an exact characterization of the corresponding linear deterministic model.", "paper_title": "Approximate Capacity of a Class of Gaussian Interference-Relay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000289836300018"}
