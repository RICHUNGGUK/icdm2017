The potential application for this architecture includes broadcast monitoring of video sequences for High Definition Television (HDTV) and DVD protection and access control. The proposed 2D design allows even distribution of the processing load onto a set of filters, with each set performing the calculation for one dimension according to the scan-based process. The video protection is achieved by the insertion of watermarks bank within the middle frequency of wavelet coefficients related to video frames by their selective quantization. The 2-D DWT is applied for both video stream and watermark in order to make the watermarking scheme robust and perceptually invisible. The proposed architecture has a very simple control part, since the data are operated in a row-column-slice fashion. This organization reduces the requirement of on-chip memory. In addition, the control unit selects which coefficient to pass to the low-pass and high-pass filters. The on-chip memory will be small as compared to the input size since it depends solely on the filter sizes. Due to the pipelining, all filters are utilized for 100% of the time except during the start-up and wind-down times. The major contribution of this research is towards the selection of appropriate real time watermarking scheme and performing a trade-off between the algorithmic aspects of our proposed watermarking scheme and the hardware implementation technique. The hardware architecture is designed, as a watermarking based IP core with the Avalon interface related to NIOS embedded processor, and tested in order to evaluate the performance of our proposed watermarking algorithm. This architecture has been implemented on the Altera Stratix-II Field Programmable Cate Array (FPGA) prototyping board. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed watermarking system for real time applications and its robustness against malicious attacks. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
