However, most of reported investigations on this concept focus on linear frequency diverse array, referred as Linear-FDA in this article. Compared with linear array, planar array can provide better directionality and higher gain. In this article, we focus on the beampattern characteristic analysis of planar frequency diverse array (Planar-FDA) and study the auto-scanning feature of its beampattern. The variation of the mainbeam with respect to time is analyzed and the constraint to guarantee the auto-scanning characteristic of the beampattern is derived. The signal transmitted from each element is designed under the constraint and the radiation characteristics of the beampattern of Planar-FDA are examined via three-dimensional electromagnetic field simulation software.
