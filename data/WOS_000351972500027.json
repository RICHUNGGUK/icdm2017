However, for processes with complex behavior and uncertainties, PID control may not always satisfy the higher requirements. Compared with PID control, proportional-integral-proportional-derivative (PI-PD) control can provide improved control performance but is now used in a limited scope because its controller parameter tuning is a little bit more inconvenient than PID. In view of the above facts, this paper proposed a new PI-PD control design based on dynamic matrix control (DMC) optimization, which bears the advantages of improved control performance under DMC optimization and at the same time, simple structure of PI-PD control for implementation. The proposed PI-PD controller is tested on the outlet temperature of an industrial coke furnace, where results show that the controller shows improved control performance compared with traditional PID control and PI-PD control in terms of set-point tracking and disturbance rejection.
