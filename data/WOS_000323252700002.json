In particular, the structural properties of controlled and conditioned invariance are defined and studied. These properties are investigated in terms of quarter-plane causal solutions of the implicit model given compatible boundary conditions. The definitions of controlled and conditioned invariance introduced, along with the corresponding output-nulling and input-containing subspaces, are shown to be richer than the one-dimensional counterparts. The analysis carried out in this paper establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of 2-D disturbance decoupling problems and unknown-input observation problems. The conditions obtained are expressed in terms of output-nulling and input-containing subspaces, which can be computed recursively in a finite number of steps.", "paper_title": "Geometric techniques for implicit two-dimensional systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000323252700002"}
