We study the rate-matching control, where the service rate is made proportional to the arrival rate. We show that the model with the rate-matching control can be regarded as a deterministic time transformation of a stationary G / G / 1 model, so that the queue length distribution is stabilized as time evolves. However, the time-varying virtual waiting time is not stabilized. We show that the time-varying expected virtual waiting time with the rate-matching service-rate control becomes inversely proportional to the arrival rate in a heavy-traffic limit. We also show that no control that stabilizes the queue length asymptotically in heavy traffic can also stabilize the virtual waiting time. Then we consider two square-root service-rate controls and show that one of these stabilizes the waiting time when the arrival rate changes slowly relative to the average service time, so that a pointwise stationary approximation is appropriate.", "paper_title": "Stabilizing performance in a single-server queue with time-varying arrival rate", "paper_id": "WOS:000363956800002"}
