The traditional definitions of stochastic ordering, hazard rate ordering, and also mean residual life ordering were extended and proposed the unified indexes to ranking fuzzy random variables. Finally, we study the stochastic ordering of fuzzy order statistics by using our proposed approach and established some properties.", "paper_title": "Some fuzzy stochastic orderings for fuzzy random variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000304103200005"}
