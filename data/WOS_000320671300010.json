With OFDM and coherent receiving technology, the system achieves high, elastic bandwidth allocation and excellent transporting property. Using optical heterodyne, the network implements the wireless access without adding a radio source. We evaluate the performance of the system in terms of bit error rate, coverage area, and receiving eye diagram and obtain the network as an excellent wire/wireless access property.", "paper_title": "Design of WDM RoF PON Based on OFDM and Optical Heterodyne", "paper_id": "WOS:000320671300010"}
