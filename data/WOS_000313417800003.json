The system is used as triage for human analysis and, thus, a very low false negative rate is more important than high accuracy. Data are classified using a standard SVM, but for data within the SVM margin, where misclassifications are more like, a k-NN is used to reduce the false negative rate. Using data from a month of operations of a predictive maintenance company, the system achieved a zero false negative rate and accuracy ranging from 75% to 84% for different machine types such as induction motors, gears, and rolling-element bearings.", "paper_title": "A COMBINATION OF SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE AND k-NEAREST NEIGHBORS FOR MACHINE FAULT DETECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000313417800003"}
