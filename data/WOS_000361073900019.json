Soil arching is a result of a complex soil culvert interaction (SCI) due to the relative stiffness between the culvert and the surrounding soil, and is a critical consideration in culvert design. The factors that affect soil arching on box culverts include the soil height above the culvert, the geometrical configuration of the box culvert and the properties of the soil around it. Box culverts are typically designed using formulae that assume simplified behaviors and in some cases rely on considerable empiricism. In the present study, small scale centrifuge physical model tests were conducted to investigate SCI considering the height and density of soil above the culvert and the geometry of the culvert. The results of these centrifuge tests were used to calibrate and verify a numerical model that was used to further investigate the response of box culverts to static loads. The results have been evaluated for bending moment and soil culvert interaction factors. The results demonstrated that the soil culvert interaction factors are not only a function of the height of soil column above the culvert, but also a function of the culvert thickness, soil elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio. Therefore, the results were used to establish charts and equations that can be employed to assess the design values of the static soil pressure and static bending moment for box culverts.
