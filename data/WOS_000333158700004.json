This result is obtained by analyzing the worst-case behaviour of a first-order short-step homotopy algorithm consisting of a feasibility phase followed by an optimization phase, and requires minimal assumptions on the objective function. Since a bound of the same order is known to be valid for the unconstrained case, this leads to the conclusion that the presence of possibly nonlinear/nonconvex inequality/equality constraints is irrelevant for this bound to apply.", "paper_title": "On the complexity of finding first-order critical points in constrained nonlinear optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000333158700004"}
