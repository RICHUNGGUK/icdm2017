When the supposition that there exists one horizontal straight line in two adjacent interfaces does not hold, the previously suggested local orthogonal transform method with an analytical formulation is not feasible. This paper presents a numerical coordinate transform and an equation transform to perform the transforms numerically for waveguides without satisfying the supposition. The boundary value problem is then reduced to an initial value problem by one-way reformulation based on the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map. This method is applicable in solving long-range wave propagation problems in slowly varying waveguides with a multilayered medium structure.", "paper_title": "A numerical local orthogonal transform method for stratified waveguides", "paper_id": "WOS:000285525700008"}
