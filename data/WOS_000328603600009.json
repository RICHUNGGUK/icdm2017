Divvy provides a novel UI that allows researchers to tighten the action-perception loop of changing algorithm parameters and seeing a visualization of the result. Machine learning researchers can use Divvy to publish easy to use reference implementations of their algorithms, which helps the machine learning field have a greater impact on research practices elsewhere.", "paper_title": "Divvy: Fast and Intuitive Exploratory Data Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000328603600009"}
