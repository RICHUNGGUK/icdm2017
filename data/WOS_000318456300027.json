The specification of the CDR frequency response is determined by jitter tolerance and jitter transfer. In this paper, jitter transfer and jitter tolerance of the BBCDR are characterized. Design/methodology/approach - The presented method is enough to be used for designing the BBCDR loop parameters. Findings - In this paper, jitter characteristics of the BBCDR are characterized. As a result, a new equation is presented to obtain angular frequency. Also, the jitter tolerance is expressed in closed form as a function of loop parameters. The analysis is verified using behavioral simulations in MATLAB. Simulation results show that good conformance between analytical equations and simulation results. Originality/value - The proposed approach offers two advantages compared to conventional designing methods. First, this approach does not consider any value restriction to the capacitor. Second, a new condition has been presented to guarantee that the value of jitter peaking is approximately zero.", "paper_title": "Modeling of jitter in bang-bang clock and data recovery circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000318456300027"}
