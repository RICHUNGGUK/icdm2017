Due to the limited computational power of DTV receivers (either domestic set-top boxes or mobile devices), most of the existing systems have opted to place the personalization engines in dedicated servers, assuming that a return channel is always available for bidirectional communication. However, in a domain where most of the information is transmitted through broadcast, there are still many cases of intermittent, sporadic or null access to a return channel. In such situations, it is impossible for the servers to learn who is watching TV at the moment, and so the personalization features become unavailable. To solve this problem without sacrificing much personalization quality, this paper introduces solutions to run a downsized semantic reasoning process in the DTV receivers, supported by a pre-selection of material driven by audience stereotypes in the head-end. Evaluation results are presented to prove the feasibility of this approach, and also to assess the quality it achieves in comparison with previous ones.", "paper_title": "Receiver-side semantic reasoning for digital TV personalization in the absence of return channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000262506300004"}
