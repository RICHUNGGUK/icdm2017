The concept of generalised H-differentiability is used. This concept is based on an enlargement of the class of differentiable fuzzy mappings; to define this, the lateral Hukuhara derivatives are considered. The proposed algorithm is illustrated by numerical examples, and some error comparisons are made with other methods for solving a FDE.
