For a complete description, it is sufficient that one conferencing capacity is positive. We obtain a dichotomy: either the channel's deterministic capacity region is zero or it equals the 2-D random coding region. We determine exactly when either case holds. We also discuss the benefits of conferencing. We give the example of an AV-MAC which does not achieve any nonzero rate pair without encoder cooperation, but the 2-D random coding capacity region if conferencing is possible. Unlike compound multiple-access channels, arbitrarily varying multiple-access channels may exhibit a discontinuous increase of the capacity region when conferencing in at least one direction is enabled.", "paper_title": "The Arbitrarily Varying Multiple-Access Channel With Conferencing Encoders", "paper_id": "WOS:000315120400013"}
