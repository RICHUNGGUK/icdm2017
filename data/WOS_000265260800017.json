Due to the fact that classical pricing methods are rarely suited to the hypotheses of complete markets, we use the Wang transform method to price the bond in an incomplete market, framework. The paper also carries out art empirical analysis on the price of catastrophe mortality bonds with data of Sri Lanka and Indonesia, and shows how the parameters affect. the price of the bond.", "paper_title": "DESIGN OF CATASTROPHE MORTALITY BONDS BASED ON THE COMONOTONICITY THEORY AND JUMP-DIFFUSION PROCESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000265260800017"}
