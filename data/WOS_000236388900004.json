This drives service infrastructures to similarly evolve to meet new service management challenges in order to adapt information delivery to a richer spatial, temporal, and user context whilst balancing the concerns of the different stake-holders. This paper presents the use of a multi-agent system service infrastructure and associated privacy model to maintain the balance between the service provider's need to maximize its knowledge of the user context against the need for the user's privacy to be protected.", "paper_title": "An integrated approach to user-centered privacy for mobile information services", "paper_id": "WOS:000236388900004"}
