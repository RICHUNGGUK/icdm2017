A test hydrothermal system is used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. Results are compared with those of other optimization methods reported in the literature. It is shown that the proposed method is capable of yielding higher quality solutions.", "paper_title": "Hydrothermal systems generation scheduling using cultural algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000261690100005"}
