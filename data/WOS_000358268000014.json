We present an ILP model, an exact approach based on the iterated execution of a two-dimensional packing algorithm, and a randomized metaheuristic. Such approaches are valid both for the case where the rectangles have fixed orientation and the case where they can be rotated by 90 degrees. We computationally evaluate the performance and the limits of the proposed approaches on a large set of instances, including a number of classical benchmarks from the literature, for both cases above, and for the special case where the items are squares.
