Specifically we investigate the feasibility of the Jeffreys-Perks procedure for interval estimation. Simulation results are derived to demonstrate the performance of the Jeffreys-Perks procedure compared with the profile likelihood method. It is found that both asymptotic methods perform well for small sample sizes despite being approximate procedures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
