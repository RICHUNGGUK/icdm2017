Network security becomes a major problem. A distributed node revocation scheme is effective in reducing the damages a compromised node may cause to a sensor network, but its operation tends to consume large-scale memory space of the hardware-constrained sensor nodes. To reduce such complexity, this paper presents a new distributed voting revocation scheme based on the one-way hash chain, the certificate revocation list and the public-key cryptography. Performance evaluation shows that our scheme taper forms the other tar get schemes in enhancing network security at reasonable calculation cost which is acceptable to the sensor nodes.", "paper_title": "A Node Revocation Scheme Using Public-Key Cryptography in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000282396700019"}
