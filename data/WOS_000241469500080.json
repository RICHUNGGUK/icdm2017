The most popular techniques proposed for both issues require the existence of specific resources in the interconnection network, usually a high number of separate queues at switch ports. Therefore, the implementation of these techniques is expensive or even infeasible. However, two novel, efficient, and cost-effective techniques for provision of QoS and for congestion management have been proposed recently. In this paper, we combine those techniques to build a single interconnection network architecture, providing an excellent performance while reducing the number of required resources.", "paper_title": "Towards a cost-effective interconnection network architecture with QoS and congestion management support", "paper_id": "WOS:000241469500080"}
