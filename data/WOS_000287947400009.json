In the scheme, an OFDM symbol is divided into blocks and one relay is selected for each block. Theoretical outage performance and error performance are analyzed and evaluated. A unified outage expression is given for our scheme and the other two schemes and the lower bound of the bit error rate of the three schemes is also obtained. The effect of the coherence bandwidth on the proposed scheme is also investigated. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to validate our analysis. The scheme can obtain a good tradeoff between complexity and performance and can be used in future 4G mobile communication systems.", "paper_title": "On the Performance of the Block-Based Selective OFDM Decode-and-Forward Relaying Scheme for 4G Mobile Communication Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000287947400009"}
