We mainly consider views and queries specified by Regular Path Queries (RPQ). These are queries selecting pairs of nodes in a graph database that are connected via a path whose sequence of edge labels belongs to some regular language. We say that a view V determines a query Q if for all graph databases D, the view image V (D) always contains enough information to answer Q on D. In other words, there is a well defined function from V (D) to Q(D). Our main result shows that when this function is monotone, there exists a rewriting of Q as a Datalog query over the view instance V (D). In particular the rewriting query can be evaluated in time polynomial in the size of V (D). Moreover this implies that it is decidable whether an RPQ query can be rewritten in Datalog using RPQ views.", "paper_title": "DATALOG REWRITINGS OF REGULAR PATH QUERIES USING VIEWS", "paper_id": "WOS:000373922900014"}
