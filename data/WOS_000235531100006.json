As a novelty in PAF applications, a Self Tuning Fuzzy Logic Controller is developed ill order to improve the dynamic behavior of the system, The performance of the self tuning fuzzy control is compared with that of two Mamdani type fuzzy PI controllers with symmetric and asymmetric triangular membership functions, as well a classical linear PI controller. Simulations arc performed to evaluate the system performance in terms of maximum overshoot (T(m)), rise time (t(r)), and settling time (t(s)) of the dc capacitor voltage to the 2% of the reference dc voltage. The results show that the self tuning fuzzy control improves the dynamic behavior of the PAF, while maintaining the improved Total Harmonic Distortion in the ac source current (THDi(as)) and the near unity power factor operation provided by the other methods. The obtained results also demonstrate the advantage of the proposed scheme as all efficient gain adaptation mechanism in comparison to standard fuzzy PI schemes, for systems that are subject to frequent and sudden load changes.", "paper_title": "Comparison of fuzzy logic based DC voltage control strategies for a three phase parallel active filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000235531100006"}
