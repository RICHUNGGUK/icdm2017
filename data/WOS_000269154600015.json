The three main types of pseudocodewords in the literature-linear programming pseudocodewords, graph cover pseudocodewords, and computation tree pseudocodewords-are reviewed and connections between them are explored. Some discrepancies in the literature on minimal and irreducible pseudocodewords are highlighted and clarified, and the minimal degree cover necessary to realize a pseudocodeword is found. Additionally, some conditions for the existence of connected realizations of graph cover pseudocodewords are given. This allows for further analysis of when graph cover pseudocodewords induce computation tree pseudocodewords. Finally, an example is offered that shows that existing theories on the distinction between graph cover pseudocodewords and computation tree pseudocodewords are incomplete.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Connections Between Pseudocodewords", "paper_id": "WOS:000269154600015"}
