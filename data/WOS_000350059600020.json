We present a highly interactive application that visualizes the sequence alignment, secondary structure and normalized read counts in synchronous multipanel windows. This helps users to easily examine the relationships between the structure of precursor and the sequences and abundance of final products and thereby will facilitate the studies on miRNA biogenesis and regulation. The project manager handles multiple samples of multiple groups. The read alignment is imported in BAM file format. Implemented features comprise sorting, zooming, highlighting, editing, filtering, saving, exporting, etc. Currently, miRseqViewer supports 84 organisms whose annotation is available at miRBase. Availability and implementation: miRseqViewer, implemented in Java, is available at https://github.com/insoo078/mirseqviewer or at http://msv.kobic.re.kr.
