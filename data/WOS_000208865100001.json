However, the intrinsic quality of knowledge and the differences in the value perceptions of both parties involved in a transaction often result in conflicts. This study investigates the key success factors of a one-to-many multi-objective negotiation mechanism, designs a knowledge-transaction negotiation process model, identifies issues of multi-objective negotiation and details a negotiation policy specification model (NPSM) that provides active assistance to automated negotiation procedures. The functional framework of a multi-objective decision method-based negotiation mechanism for knowledge trading has been developed according to the models and methods proposed by this study. Finally, the negotiation mechanism including five core components: the negotiation policy management module, the negotiation offer supply module, the negotiation offer evaluation module, the electronic contract (e-contract) construction module, and the intelligent engine. When implemented, this framework can be used for conflict resolution between knowledge requesters and suppliers and, thus, facilitates knowledge transactions.", "paper_title": "Design of knowledge trading negotiation model for accelerating acquirement of knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000208865100001"}
