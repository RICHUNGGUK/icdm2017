Due to the random nature of the occurrence of the gain variations in actual implementation, ROGVs, to be regulated by a group of random variables with Gaussian distribution, are utilized to better reflect this phenomenon. Then a L-th Rice fadings model is employed to represent channel fadings and time-delays simultaneously, in which the channel coefficients are mutually independent random variables conforming to any probability density function on [0, 1]. Furthermore, a kind of stochastic nonlinear disturbance is also considered in the H-infinity filtering research by means of a Bernoulli distributed white sequence. The purpose of this paper is to devise a non-fragile H-infinity filter such that the overall error dynamics is stochastically stable and satisfies the prescribed H-infinity performance. Through the Lyapunov stability theory, intensive stochastic analysis along with LMI methods, sufficient conditions are set up for the desired stochastic stability and H-infinity disturbance attenuation, and the proposed non-fragile filtering problem is converted into solving a convex optimization problem by the semidefinite programming technique. Finally, a numerical simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
