We prove that (i) if p/k for a function =(k) that tends to infinity as k does, then G(p) asymptotically almost surely contains a cycle (and thus a path) of length at least (1-o(1))k, and (ii) if p(1+o(1))lnk/k, then G(p) asymptotically almost surely contains a path of length at least k. Our theorems extend classical results on paths and cycles in the binomial random graph, obtained by taking G to be the complete graph on k + 1 vertices. (c) Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
