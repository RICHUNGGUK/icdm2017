Specifically, under the assumption that the road network is stored in a central server, the adjacent data elements in the network must be clustered on the disk in such a way that the number of disk page accesses is kept minimal during the processing of network queries. In this work, we introduce the link-based storage scheme for clustered road networks and compare it with the previously proposed junction-based storage scheme. in order to investigate the performance of aggregate network queries in clustered road networks, we extend our recently proposed clustering hypergraph model from junction-based storage to link-based storage. We propose techniques for additional storage savings in bidirectional networks that make the link-based storage scheme even more preferable in terms of the storage efficiency. We evaluate the performance of our link-based storage scheme against the junction-based storage scheme both theoretically and empirically. The results of the experiments conducted on a wide range of road network datasets show that the link-based storage scheme is preferable in terms of both storage and query processing efficiency.
