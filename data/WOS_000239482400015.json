Analysing the interaction structure of those complex applications will enable them to be well understood, controlled, and redesigned. Our contribution to workflow mining is a statistical technique to discover workflow patterns from event-based log. Our approach is characterised by a \"local\" workflow patterns discovery that allows to cover partial results through a dynamic programming algorithm. Those local discovered workflow patterns are then composed iteratively until discovering the global workflow model. Our approach has been implemented within our prototype WorkflowMiner.", "paper_title": "A bottom-up workflow mining approach for workflow applications analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000239482400015"}
