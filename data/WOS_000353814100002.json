The service durations have periodically time-dependent exponential () or homogeneous general () distributions. Assuming a cycle length of 1, we construct discrete dominating processes at the integer instants . Perfect sampling of the queue is obtained using dominated CFTP (Kendall and Moller 2000) when the system is relatively lightly loaded or with the regenerative method (Sigman 2012) in the general case. For the queue, perfect sampling is achieved with dominated CFTP.", "paper_title": "Perfect sampling of a single-server queue with periodic Poisson arrivals", "paper_id": "WOS:000353814100002"}
