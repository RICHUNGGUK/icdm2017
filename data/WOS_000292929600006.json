In particular, we show that for f a degree-d polynomial threshold function that the Gaussian noise sensitivity of f with parameter epsilon is at most d arcsin (root 2 epsilon-epsilon(2))/pi)/pi. This bound translates into an optimal bound on the Gaussian surface area of such functions, namely that the Gaussian surface area is at most d/root 2 pi. Finally, we note that the later result implies bounds on the runtime of agnostic learning algorithms for polynomial threshold functions.", "paper_title": "The Gaussian Surface Area and Noise Sensitivity of Degree-d Polynomial Threshold Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000292929600006"}
