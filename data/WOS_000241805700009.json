In this paper, we will consider the stopping redundancy of Reed-Muller codes and related codes. Let R(l, m) be the Reed-Muller code of length 2(m) and order l. Schwartz and Vardy gave a recursive construction of parity-check matrices for the Reed-Muller codes, and asked whether the number of rows in those parity-check matrices is the stopping redundancy of the codes. We prove that the stopping redundancy of R(m - 2, m), which is also the extended Hamming code of length 2(m), is 2m - 1 and thus show that the recursive bound is tight in this case. We prove that the stopping redundancy of the simplex code equals its redundancy. Several constructions of codes for which the stopping redundancy equals the redundancy are discussed. We prove an upper bound on the stopping redundancy of R (1, m). This bound is better than the known recursive bound and thus gives a negative answer to the question of Schwartz and Vardy.", "paper_title": "On the stopping redundancy of Reed-Muller codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241805700009"}
