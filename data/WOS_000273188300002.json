In this paper, a review of the state-of-art of the field is presented, focusing on the techniques that underpin these systems and their evaluation metrics. Although there is still a long way to go so as to reach the ideal system, the fact that the existing systems are already being used commercially and as a second opinion in exams Such as GMAT proves the uptake of this field.", "paper_title": "Computer-assisted assessment of free-text answers", "paper_id": "WOS:000273188300002"}
