The new checker is characterized by high testability, high-speed operation, and low silicon area requirements. The circuit has been designed, for various fan-in values, in a 0.18 mu m technology, and electrical simulations have been carried out to validate its operation, considering process, power supply, and temperature variations as well as variations of the electrical parameters.", "paper_title": "A current mode, parallel, two-rail code checker", "paper_id": "WOS:000256832200003"}
