To guarantee the reliability of communication, effective fault tolerant techniques are critical for an NoC. In this paper, a novel fault tolerant architecture employing redundant routers is proposed to maintain the functionality of a network in the presence of failures. This architecture consists of a mesh of 2 x 2 router blocks with a spare router placed in the center of each block. This spare router provides a viable alternative when a router fails in a block. The proposed fault-tolerant architecture is therefore referred to as a quad-spare mesh. The quad-spare mesh can be dynamically reconfigured by changing control signals without altering the underlying topology. This dynamic reconfiguration and its corresponding routing algorithm are demonstrated in detail. Since the topology after reconfiguration is consistent with the original error-free 2D mesh, the proposed design is transparent to operating systems and application software. Experimental results show that the proposed design achieves significant improvements on reliability compared with those reported in the literature. Comparing the error-free system with a single router failure case, the throughput only decreases by 5.19% and latency increases by 2.40%, with about 45.9% hardware redundancy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
