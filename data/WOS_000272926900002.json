Taking into account the reality of noisy channels, an extension of the pi-calculus, called the pi(N)-calculus, has been introduced recently. This paper presents an early transitional semantics of the pi(N)-calculus, which is not a directly translated version of the late semantics of pi(N), and then extends six kinds of behavioral equivalences consisting of reduction bisimilarity, barbed bisimilarity, barbed equivalence, barbed congruence, bisimilarity and full bisimilarity into the pi(N)-calculus. Such behavioral equivalences are cast in a hierarchy, which is helpful to verify behavioral equivalence of two agents. In particular, this paper shows that due to the noisy nature of channels, the coincidence of bisimilarity and barbed equivalence, as well as the coincidence of full bisimilarity and barbed congruence, in the pi-calculus does not hold in pi(N).", "paper_title": "A Hierarchy of Behavioral Equivalences in the pi-calculus with Noisy Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000272926900002"}
