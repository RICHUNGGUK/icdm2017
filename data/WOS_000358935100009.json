We propose a general construction of DE that unifies prior work and gives novel schemes. Specifically, its instantiations include: The first construction from any trapdoor function that has sufficiently many hardcore bits. The first construction that provides \"bounded\" multi-message security (assuming lossy trapdoor functions). The security proofs for these schemes are enabled by three tools that are of broader interest: A weaker and more precise sufficient condition for semantic security on a high-entropy message distribution. Namely, we show that to establish semantic security on a distribution M of messages, it suffices to establish indistinguishability for all conditional distribution M vertical bar E, where E is an event of probability at least 1/4. ( Prior work required indistinguishability on all distributions of a given entropy.) A result about computational entropy of conditional distributions. Namely, we show that conditioning on an event E of probability p reduces the quality of computational entropy by a factor of p and its quantity by log(2) 1/p. A generalization of leftover hash lemma to correlated distributions. We also extend our result about computational entropy to the average case, which is useful in reasoning about leakage-resilient cryptography: leaking lambda bits of information reduces the quality of computational entropy by a factor of 2(lambda) and its quantity by lambda.", "paper_title": "A Unified Approach to Deterministic Encryption: New Constructions and a Connection to Computational Entropy", "paper_id": "WOS:000358935100009"}
