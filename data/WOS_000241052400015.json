Given this information, the proposed system can adaptively adjust the operating parameters of the video source encoder and the forward error correction (FEC) channel encoder to maximize the delivered video quality based upon both application-layer video motion estimates and link-layer channel estimates. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach using the ITU-T H.264 video source coder. The results indicate that a significant performance improvement can be achieved with enhanced resilience to inaccurate channel feedback information and with substantially reduced computational complexity compared to competing approaches.", "paper_title": "An adaptive motion-based unequal error protection approach for real-time video transport over wireless IP networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241052400015"}
