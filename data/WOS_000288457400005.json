With the derived dynamic model in polar coordinates, an adaptive motion controller is synthesized via the adaptive backstepping approach. This proposed polar-space robust adaptive motion controller was implemented into an embedded processor using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip. Furthermore, the embedded adaptive motion controller works with a reusable user IP (Intellectual Property) core library and an embedded real-time operating system (RTOS) in the same chip to steer the mobile robot to track the desired trajectory by using hardware/software co-design technique and SoPC (system-on-a-programmable-chip) technology. Simulation results are conducted to show the merit of the proposed polar-space control method in comparison with a conventional proportional-integral (PI) feedback controller and a non-adaptive polar-space kinematic controller. Finally, the effectiveness and performance of the proposed embedded adaptive motion controller are exemplified by conducting several experiments on steering an embedded omnidirectional mobile robot.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Polar-Space Motion Control for Embedded Omnidirectional Mobile Robots with Parameter Variations and Uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000288457400005"}
