For the cationic species (z=+2, +4) such centered Ge@Ge-10(z) structures are shown to be energetically competitive (within similar to 1 kcal mol(-1)) to the lowest energy isomeric empty Ge-11(z) structures. These Ge@Ge-10(z) structures can be derived from the lowest energy empty 10-vertex Ge-10(z-4) structures by inserting a Ge4+ ion in the center. The outer 10-vertex polyhedron in the lowest energy Ge@Ge-10(2+) dication structure is the most spherical D-4d bicapped square antiprism, which is also the lowest energy structure of the empty Ge-10(2-) dianion, as expected from the Wade-Mingos skeletal electron counting rules. For the tetracationic Ge-11(4+)/Ge@Ge-10(4+) system the lowest energy centered Ge@Ge-10(4+) structure can be obtained by inserting a Ge4+ ion in the center of a C-3v deltahedral empty Ge-10 cluster. Centered 10-vertex polyhedral Ge@Ge-10(z) structures were also found for the neutral (z=0) and dianionic (z=-2) systems but at significantly higher energies than the lowest energy isomeric empty Ge-11(z) structures.", "paper_title": "Empty versus filled polyhedra: 11 vertex bare germanium clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000334934900021"}
