Using benchmarks that draw on three data types - scientific imagery, unstructured text, and semantic graphs representing networks of relationships - the authors demonstrate that emerging hardware technologies to augment traditional microprocessor-based computing systems can deliver 2 to 17 times the performance of general-purpose computers on a wide range of data-intensive applications by increasing compute cycles and bandwidth and reducing latency.", "paper_title": "Hardware technologies for high-performance data-intensive computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000254859900019"}
