A full DTS resembles two complete k-level (k > 0) binary trees whose leaf nodes are merged pair-wise, and thus consists of exactly N-k = 3 x 2(k) - 2 nodes. In this paper, the problem of planar straight-line embedding of a \"double-tree graph\" on a rectangular grid is investigated and an O(N-k) time algorithm for drawing it, is described. The embedding requires at most 2N(k) grid points, with an aspect ratio lying between 1 and 3/2. Next, techniques of embedding a partial DTS is considered when the number of nodes n not equal 3 x 2(k) - 2, for some k. Layouts of double-tree scan-paths for some benchmark circuits are also presented to demonstrate the results.", "paper_title": "Planar Straight-Line Embedding of Double-Tree Scan Architecture on a Rectangular Grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000262453900008"}
