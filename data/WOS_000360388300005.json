In this paper we initiate the study of the signed Roman domination number of digraphs, and we present different bounds on . In addition, we determine the signed Roman domination number of some classes of digraphs. Some of our results are extensions of well-known properties of the signed Roman domination number of graphs G.", "paper_title": "Signed Roman domination in digraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000360388300005"}
