However, the language used in documents is often complicated and ambiguous, and thus the results obtained by using keywords are often inaccurate. To address this problem, this study developed a semantic-based content mapping mechanism for an information retrieval system. This approach employs the semantic features and ontological structure of the content as the basis for constructing a content map, thus simplifying the search process and improving the accuracy of the returned results.
