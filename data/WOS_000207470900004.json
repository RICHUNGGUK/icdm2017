The high expressivity of the sorted predicate logic language used for specification allows representing a wide range of process-related concepts (e.g. tasks, processes, resources), characteristics and relations, which are described in the paper. Furthermore, for every organisation, structural and behavioural constraints on process-related concepts can be identified. Some of them should always be fulfilled by the organisation (e.g. physical world constraints), whereas others allow some degree of organisational flexibility (e.g. some domain specific constraints). An organisational specification is correct if it satisfies a set of relevant organisational constraints. This paper describes automated formal techniques for establishing correctness of organisational specifications with respect to a set of diverse constraint types. The introduced framework is a part of a general framework for organisation modelling and analysis.", "paper_title": "Process-oriented organisation modelling and analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000207470900004"}
