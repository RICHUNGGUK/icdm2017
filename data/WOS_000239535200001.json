Instead of the existing notion of smoothness based on balancedness, we propose a variance-based metric which is more intuitive and easier to compute. We propose a recursive loop scheduler for a class-based scheduling scenario based on an optimal weighted round-robin scheduler. We show that it achieves very good allocation smoothness with almost no degradation in intra-class fairness. In addition, we also demonstrate the equivalence between our proposed metric and the balancedness-based metric. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
