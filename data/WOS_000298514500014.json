It is proved that six cells suffice to generate any recursively enumerable set of natural numbers by such a one-symbol tissue P system with symport/antiport rules, under the restriction that only one channel is allowed between two cells or between a cell and the environment. As for the case of allowing two channels between a cell and the environment, it is shown that the computational completeness can be obtained by one-symbol tissue P systems with symport/antiport rules having at most five cells. These results partially answer an open problem formulated by Artiom Alhazov, Rudolf Freund and Marion Oswald.", "paper_title": "Small Universal Tissue P Systems with Symport/Antiport Rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000298514500014"}
