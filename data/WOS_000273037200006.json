Further, to an application of the ACO artificial agent to a resource-unconstrained network topology, the method is applied to a resource-constrained network and utilized in examining the effects of resource availability constraints to critical path calculations and project completion time.", "paper_title": "Scheduling Resource-Constrained Projects with Ant Colony Optimization Artificial Agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000273037200006"}
