The purpose of this paper is to model an interlaminar short circuit diagnosis test on an existing structure. Design/methodology/approach - This work presents the modeling of short-circuited laminations in a stator yoke of a turbo-generator. A 3D finite element model, associated to a homogenization technique, is used to calculate the short-circuit current. The diagnosis test known as El Cid has been modelled as well. Findings - Calculation results are compared with the experiment. The same tendency has been observed both in experimental and numerical results. Research limitations/implications - Additional calculations may be performed (parametric studies) in order to investigate El Cid measuring under different conditions (different material properties, fault position, size), which may lead to a better interpretation of the results. Practical implications - Modelling of short circuit diagnosis tests under different conditions may help with the interpretation of measuring results, predicting the fault size/seriousness and location. So, only the concerned parts of the stator have to be disassembled and repaired/rebuilt. Originality/value - It is not easy to model numerically a structure with a short circuit inside, since different dimensions are involved: the fault and the varnish between laminations are much smaller than the stator itself. Thus, homogenization techniques have been used to model the lamination stack region. The combination of this technique with the modelling of the El Cid test constitutes a tool to study this kind of fault and calculate its severity and location in a stator.", "paper_title": "Interlaminar short circuit detection: modeling and measurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000311269800014"}
