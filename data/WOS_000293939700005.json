Every option has a rental duration; the longer the duration, the more the discount. This generalizes the standard ski-rental problem where one can only rent or buy. We present a 4-competitive on-line algorithm for our problem and show that no deterministic algorithm can have a smaller competitive ratio when n is large enough. Comparing with the original ski-rental problem, the competitive ratio becomes larger when there are more options. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
