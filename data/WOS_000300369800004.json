Now, it is well known that link-based protection and path-based protection provide, respectively, a short recovery time and reduced use of resources. To benefit from the both of these saliencies, we propose in this paper to use these mechanisms simultaneously. Indeed, demands mandating shorter recovery time will be protected using link-based protection. Meanwhile, other demands (e.g., no-critical) will be protected using path-based protection. Simulation results show that the proposed solution achieves a good trade-off between resource utilization and recovery time.", "paper_title": "Application-aware protection in DWDM optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000300369800004"}
