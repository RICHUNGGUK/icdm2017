An L-length-bounded flow is a flow that can be decomposed into flow paths of length at most L. In contrast to classical flow theory, we describe instances for which the minimum L-length-bounded edge-cut (node-cut, respectively) is Theta(n(2/3))-times (Theta(root n)-times, respectively) larger than the maximum L-length-bounded flow, where n denotes the number of nodes; this is the worst case. We show that the minimum length-bounded cut problem is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of 1.1377 for L >= 5 in the case of node-cuts and for L >= 4 in the case of edge-cuts. We also describe algorithms with approximation ratio O(min{L, n/L} subset of O(root n) in the node case and O(min{L, n(2)/L-2, root m}) subset of O(n(2/3)) in the edge case, where m denotes the number of edges. Concerning L-length-bounded flows, we show that in graphs with unit-capacities and general edge lengths it is NP-complete to decide whether there is a fractional length-bounded flow of a given value. We analyze the structure of optimal solutions and present further complexity results.", "paper_title": "Length-Bounded Cuts and Flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000288825000004"}
