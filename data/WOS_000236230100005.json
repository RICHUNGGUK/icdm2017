However, most of the workflow literature focuses only on the modeling aspects and assumes that a workflow is correct if during the execution it respects the control and data dependency specified by the workflow designer. To address the correctness question properly we propose a new workflow model based on Hoare semantics that allows to: (1) automatically check if the desired outcome of a workflow can be produced by its actual implementation, (2) automatically synthesize a workflow implementation from the workflow specification and a given task library. In particular we: (1) formalize the semantics of workflows and tasks with pre- and postconditions, (2) for each control construct we provide a set of sound inference rules formalizing its semantics. While most of our workflow constructs are standard, two of them are new: the universal and the existential constructs. We then describe algorithms for automatically checking the correctness of workflows and for automatic workflow generation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
