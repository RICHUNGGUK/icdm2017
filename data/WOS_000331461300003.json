Several hardening techniques have been reported from the transistor- to system-level. In order to suppress the single event transients originating from logic gates, this paper presents an improved heuristic search utilizing the gate-sizing technique. The algorithm re-orders the gate-traversal to maintain the reduced soft error rates of the preceding logic gates. The preferential candidates for the two successive algorithms are the logic gates near the primary outputs and flip-flops, rather than those of the higher portions of block soft error rate. The proposed technique reduces the logic soft error rate by more than 60% compared to the existing method in 45nm CMOS cell designs.", "paper_title": "A Cell Sizing Technique for Mitigating Logic Soft Errors in Gate-level Designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000331461300003"}
