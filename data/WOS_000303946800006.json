More precisely, we construct a family of tiles indexed by integers with the property that T-k is a tile having k >= 2 as anisohedral number. That is k copies of T-k are assembled by translation in order to form a metatile. We prove that this metatile is a lattice-periodic tile while T-k is not a lattice-periodic tile.
