The leader-following consensus problem consists of designing for each agent a distributed protocol to make all agents track a leader vehicle, which has the same LTI dynamics as the agents. The interaction topology describing the information exchange of these agents is time-varying. An averaging method is proposed. Unlike the existing results in the literatures which assume the LTI agents to be neutrally stable, we relax this condition, only making assumption that the LTI agents are stablizable and detectable. Observer-based leader-following consensus is also considered.", "paper_title": "LEADER-FOLLOWING CONSENSUS OF MULTIPLE LINEAR SYSTEMS UNDER SWITCHING TOPOLOGIES: AN AVERAGING METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000314000600008"}
