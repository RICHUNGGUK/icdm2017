They illustrate the high potential of using discrete event simulation for pedagogical purposes. Unfortunately, this potential does not seem to go together with the availability of guidance for the game designer on the use of simulation. In response, we propose a conceptual modeling framework for simulation-based serious gaming. It structures the conceptual modeling process by identifying five key modeling activities in defining a conceptual model, i.e., a blue print for model coding. Activities aim to explore the learning environment, and capture modeling objectives, and model inputs, outputs and contents. Each activity is further detailed in terms of steps to undertake, good practices, and supportive methods. Use of the framework is illustrated by a case example concerning education of retail managers on inventory control. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
