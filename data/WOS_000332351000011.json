In this paper, a four-stage perceptual approach for full reference IQA is presented. In the first stage, the visual features are extracted by 2-D Gabor filter that has the excellent performance of modeling the receptive fields of simple cells in the primary visual cortex. Then in the second stage, the extracted features are post-processed by the divisive normalization transform to reflect the nonlinear mechanisms in human visual systems. In the third stage, mutual information between the visual features of the reference and distorted images is employed to measure the visual quality. And in the last pooling stage, the mutual information is converted to the final objective quality score. Experimental results show that the proposed metic has a high correlation with the subjective assessment and outperforms other state-of-the-art metrics.", "paper_title": "Perceptual image quality assessment metric using mutual information of Gabor features", "paper_id": "WOS:000332351000011"}
