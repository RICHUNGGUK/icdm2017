Collaborative design process gathers experts from different backgrounds and areas for a common objective about product development. An effective exchange support is expected to share and integrate design knowledge avoiding conflicts between designers. The management of heterogeneous product representation is a major step to integrate expert activities. To successfully manage this process, this paper proposes: (1) A research experimental platform for cooperative design in product development processes. (2) A new constraint based model to maintain complex relationships in multi-disciplinary cooperative design. (3) A model differentiation technique, which identifies differences and conflicts between models. (4) A Meta-rule concept, which controls the constraint network in design process, leading to a new notification mechanism to present conflict to all corresponding actors.", "paper_title": "Development of control mechanisms to support coherency of product model during cooperative design process", "paper_id": "WOS:000279714600016"}
