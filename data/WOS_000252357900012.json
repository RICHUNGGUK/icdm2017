Although overlay is a good solution to some demands, using them in an efficient, scalable way is still a problem. This paper puts forward a framework on how to construct an efficient, scalable overlay mesh in real network. Main differences between other overlays and ours are that our overlay mesh pocesses some nice features including class-of-service (CoS) and traffic engineering (TE). It embeds the end-to-end optimal traffic control law which can distribute traffic in an optimal way. Then, an example is given for better understanding the framework. Particularly, besides good scalability, and failure recovery, it possesses other characteristics such as routing simplicity, self-organization, etc. In such an overlay mesh, an applicable source routing scheme called hierarchical source routing is used to transmit data packet based on UDP protocol. Finally, a guideline derived from a number of simulations is proposed on how to set various parameters in this overlay mesh, which makes the overlay more efficient.", "paper_title": "Framework for end-to-end optimal traffic control law based on overlay mesh", "paper_id": "WOS:000252357900012"}
