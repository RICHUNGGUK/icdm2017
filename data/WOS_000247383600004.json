If Pi(U) denotes the canonical projection onto the parameter's space, solving C or S is reduced to the computation of submanifolds U subset of C-d or U subset of R-d such that (Pi(-1)(U) (U) boolean AND C, H-U) is an analytic covering of U (we say that U has the (H-U, C)-covering property). This guarantees that the cardinality of Pi(-1)(U) (u) boolean AND C is constant on a neighborhood of u, that Pi(-1)(U) (U) boolean AND C is a finite collection of sheets and that Pi(U) is a local diffeomorphism from each of these sheets onto U. We show that the complement in (Pi(U)) over bar (C) (the closure of Pi(U) (C) for the usual topology of C-n) of the union of all the open subsets of (Pi(U)) over bar (C) which have the (Pi(U), C)-covering property is a Zariski closed set which is called the minimal discriminant variety of C w. rt. Pi(U), denoted as W-D. We propose an algorithm to compute W-D efficiently. The variety W-D can then be used to solve the parametric system C (resp. S) as long as one can describe (Pi(U)) over bar (C)\\W-D (resp. R-d boolean AND ((Pi(U)) over bar (C.)\\W-D)). This can be done by using the critical points method or an \"open\" cylindrical algebraic decomposition. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
