Roughly speaking, a family of polynomials is in VPSPACE if its coefficients can be computed in polynomial space. Our main theorem is that if (uniform, constant-free) VPSPACE families can be evaluated efficiently then the class PAR(R) of decision problems that can be solved in parallel polynomial time over the real numbers collapses to P-R. As a result, one must first be able to show that there are VPSPACE families which are hard to evaluate in order to separate P-R from NPR, or even from PAR(R).", "paper_title": "VPSPACE and a Transfer Theorem over the Reals", "paper_id": "WOS:000272631400003"}
