Providing mobile users with high speed network connectivity will let them run various multimedia applications on their wireless devices. Satisfying users with different quality-of-service requirements while optimizing resource allocation is a challenging problem. In this paper, we discuss the challenges and possible solutions for transmitting MPEG video streams over WiMAX networks. We will briefly describe the MPEG traffic model suggested by the WiMAX Forum. A cross-layer solution for enhancing the performance of WiMAX networks with respect to MPEG video streaming applications is explained. Our solution uses the characteristics of MPEG traffic to give priority to the more important frames and protect them against dropping. Besides, it is simple and compatible with the IEEE 802.16 standards and thus easily deployable. It is shown that the proposed solutions will improve the video quality over WiMAX networks.", "paper_title": "A Quality-Driven Cross-Layer Solution for MPEG Video Streaming Over WiMAX Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000269776700010"}
