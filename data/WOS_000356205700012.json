Carbon nanotubes without caps are also called tubulenes. The resonance graph of a tubulene reflects the interaction between its Kekule stuctures. In this paper we prove some properties of tubulenes and their resonance graphs. We give the explicit proof that tubulenes are planar bipartite graphs what was observed in [14] but wasn't proved. Further, it is shown that the resonance graph of every tubulene is always bipartite. We also describe the structure and the length of a shortest path in the hexagonal lattice. This result is then used to give a condition under which the resonance graph of a tubulene is not connected.", "paper_title": "Some Properties of Carbon Nanotubes and their Resonance Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000356205700012"}
