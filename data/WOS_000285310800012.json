Using the previously shared EPR pairs as the quantum key, two bits of classical key can be established via one information carrier EPR state on average. In theory, the efficiency of this protocol reaches 100%, and there is no need to consume any entangled states including both the quantum key and the information carriers in ideal condition. The protocol can resist the particular attack that is fatal to other some channel-encrypting schemes. Principally, we prove the security against the most general individual attack of this protocol. Entanglement collapse in practical situation, as well as the realistic implementation of this protocol is also discussed.", "paper_title": "A TWO-STEP CHANNEL-ENCRYPTING QUANTUM KEY DISTRIBUTION PROTOCOL", "paper_id": "WOS:000285310800012"}
