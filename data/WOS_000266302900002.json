A key problem in developing ubiquitous smart spaces is how to design a physical space that Maps to the Underlying computing infrastructure and the corresponding patterns of situated interactions in every life. This paper explores design methods and technological issues encountered in the development of ubiquitous smart spaces. Methods for mapping different aspects of ubiquitous smart spaces are illustrated by a set of system prototypes. The prototypes are Finally integrated in an open living laboratory as a tested for smart living.", "paper_title": "Toward a Ubiquitous Smart Space Design Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000266302900002"}
