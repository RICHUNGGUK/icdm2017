We argue that the contribution of users feedback to any positioning system is two-fold. Firstly, users' feedback greatly help in fine-tuning an under-trained positioning system with proper filtering. Secondly, if users are well-behaved, our experimental results show that the participation of end-users can actually assist in the construction of a positioning system incrementally from scratch. We also show that user feedback-based positioning system adapts quite well when surroundings change. Our present system is built upon Bluetooth. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
