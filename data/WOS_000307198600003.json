Methods for obtaining feedback are available in knowledge management and produce tangible results in the industrial world. Nowadays, companies often consider employees knowledge as an asset. This approach is a potential answer for reusing knowledge acquired through experience. The Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) methodology, based on cognitive sciences, consists in solving new problems by reusing past experience. Case-Based Reasoning is an approach to solving a new problem by remembering and adapting a previous successful similar situation to the problem at hand. Of the four activities comprising CBR - Retrieve, Reuse, Revise, and Retain-this paper deals with the \"Retrieve\" phase. Consequently, we suggest using the Multi-Criteria Decisions concept in problem description to search for the solution in a case-based scenario. We show that Multi-Criteria Decisions and Case-Based Reasoning are complementary. This paper proposes using knowledge acquisition as a basis for seeking solutions from non-compensatory multi-criteria decision aids such as the ELECTRE-I and ELECTRE-II methods. We also carry out a robustness analysis at the end of this paper. We describe an industrial application with wire forming machines as an illustration of our recommendation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
