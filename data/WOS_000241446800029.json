It leads to simple entailment rules and relatively low computational complexity for reasoning. In this paper, we propose a forward-chaining reasoning algorithm to support RDFS entailments under the pD* semantics. This algorithm extends the Sesame algorithm to cope with the pD* entailments. In particular, an optimization to the dependent table between entailment rules is presented to eliminate much redundant inferring steps. Finally, some test results are given to illustrate the correctness and performance of this algorithm.", "paper_title": "A reasoning algorithm for pD", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800029"}
