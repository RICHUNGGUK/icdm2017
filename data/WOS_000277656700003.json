Then, these results are generalized for several types of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). We provide algorithms for the model reduction and error bounds for the reduced-order models. Some limits of the approach are pointed out and alternative methods for reduced-order subspace approximation are presented. The POD approach is tested and evaluated for a medium-sized DAE example from multi-body dynamics.", "paper_title": "A note on POD model reduction methods for DAEs", "paper_id": "WOS:000277656700003"}
