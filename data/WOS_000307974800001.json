The concept is rooted in the property that under certain conditions, some signals within digital designs are not \"observable\" at design outputs, making the circuitry that generates such signals a candidate for guarding. Guarded evaluation has been demonstrated successfully for application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs); in this paper, we apply the technique to field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In ASICs, guarded evaluation entails adding additional hardware to the design, increasing silicon area and cost. Here, we apply the technique in a way that imposes minimal area overhead by leveraging existing unused circuitry within the FPGA. The primary challenge in guarded evaluation is in determining the specific conditions under which a subcircuit's inputs can be held constant without impacting the larger circuit's functional correctness. We propose a simple solution to this problem based on discovering gating inputs using \"noninverting\" and \"partial noninverting\" paths in a circuit's AND-inverter graph representation. Experimental results show that guarded evaluation can reduce switching activity on average by as much as 32% and 25% for 6-input look-up table (6-LUT) and 4-LUT architectures, respectively. Dynamic power consumption in the FPGA interconnect is reduced on average by as much as 24% and 22% for 6-LUT and 4-LUT architectures, respectively. The impact to critical path delay ranges from 1% to 43%, depending on the guarding scenario and the desired power/delay tradeoff.", "paper_title": "FPGA Power Reduction by Guarded Evaluation Considering Logic Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000307974800001"}
