Consequences for four interacting aspects of the overall system (infrastructure, business models, geological framework and surveying methods) are outlined. Although each reflects a different area of expertise, all aspects must work together to support an incipient change of emphasis in survey work-from publishing maps and supporting documents, to contributing to a whole-Earth knowledge system that responds flexibly to user needs.
