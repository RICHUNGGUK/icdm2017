The architecture consists of four system level blocks that are stacked in volume and it weights 4.0 g. The current prototype's size is well suited for commercial implementation inside medium sized animal subjects, for instance, rabbits and larger rats. Transmit power reported in this paper is tested between 0 to 20 dBm by using phantom tissue model.", "paper_title": "In-vitro RF characterization of implantable telemetry system", "paper_id": "WOS:000345842200010"}
