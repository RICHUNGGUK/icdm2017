Appropriate customer centric strategies that make use of customers' context data are eagerly awaited by mobile service providers. To address this need, a framework is proposed in this paper that can be used for analyzing customers' context based behavioral data to provide suitable services to customers. Six case studies of context sensitive services are discussed to illustrate how the proposed framework can be used to improve them. Furthermore, simulated experiments are conducted using customers' behavioral data including location and time and it is found that the use of context related data leads to the discovery of deeper and improved knowledge of customers' behavior.
