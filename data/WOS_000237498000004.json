Given a set of seed entities, INEXT conducts information extraction on the documents, and ranks them based on the amount of novel entities and relations they contain. With users interacting with INEXT throughout the search process, documents are re-ranked to identify other relevant documents based on revised document relevance scores. In this paper, we present the overall system architecture and its component modules including the named entity recognition module, entity co-reference module, domain entity and relation extraction module, document ranking module, and entity and relation annotation module. These modules are designed to address the different sub-problems in the entire search process.", "paper_title": "INEXT: An investigative search tool for knowledge extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000237498000004"}
