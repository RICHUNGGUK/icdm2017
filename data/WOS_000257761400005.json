In order to verify the reasonability of the new model, the stability condition is obtained by the use of linear stability theory. The modified KdV (Korteweg de Vries) equation is derived by the use of the nonlinear analysis method and the kink-antikink soliton solution is obtained near the critical point. The propagation velocities of density waves are calculated for different numbers of the front interactions. A numerical simulation is carried out to check out the performance of GOCLM for traffic flow. The simulation results show that GOCLM is better than the previous models in suppressing the traffic jams.", "paper_title": "Analysis of generalized optimal current lattice model for traffic flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000257761400005"}
