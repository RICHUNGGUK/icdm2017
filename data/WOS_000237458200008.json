The discretization of the Fokker-Planck equation is performed using a 25-point molecule that leads to a coefficient matrix with equal number of diagonals. The method is all extension of Stone's implicit procedure, includes a vast class of collision terms and can be applied to stationary or non stationary problems with different discretizations in time. Test calculations and comparisons with other methods are presented in two stationary examples, including an astrophysical application for the Miyamoto-Nagai disk potential for a typical galaxy.
