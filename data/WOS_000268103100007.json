Therefore, a simulation model with the production process of a real wafer fab located in Hsin-Chu Science-based Park of Taiwan is built for further studying of the relationship between the flow time and the various input variables. In this research, a hybrid approach by combining Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) for flow time prediction in semiconductor manufacturing factory is developed. And Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to fine-tune the weights of features in the CBR model. The flow time and related shop floor status are collected and fed into the SOM for clustering. Then, a corresponding SGA-CBR method is selected and applied for flow time prediction. Finally, using the simulated data, the effectiveness of the proposed method (SGA-CBR) is shown by comparing with other approaches.", "paper_title": "Evolving CBR and data segmentation by SOM for flow time prediction in semiconductor manufacturing factory", "paper_id": "WOS:000268103100007"}
