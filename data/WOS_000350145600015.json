In this paper, we propose a novel stable and fast particle method to couple predictive-corrective incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics and geometric lattice shape matching (LSM), which animates the visually realistic interaction of fluids and deformable solids allowing larger time steps or velocity differences. By combining the boundary particles sampled from solids with a momentum-conserving velocity-position correction scheme, our approach can alleviate the particle deficiency issues and prevent the penetration artefacts at the fluid-solid interfaces simultaneously. We further simulate the stable deformation and melting of solid objects coupled to smoothed particle hydrodynamics fluids based on a highly extended LSM model. In order to improve the time performance of each time step, we entirely implement the unified particle framework on GPUs using compute unified device architecture. The advantages of our two-way fluid-solid coupling method in computer animation are demonstrated via several virtual scenarios.", "paper_title": "Stable and Fast Fluid-Solid Coupling for Incompressible SPH", "paper_id": "WOS:000350145600015"}
