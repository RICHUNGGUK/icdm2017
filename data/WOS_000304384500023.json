The new scheme enables to compute a near field enhancement of several orders with high accuracy degree. The developed computer model has been employed to investigate plasmonic resonance of two prolate spheroids. Both the electric field intensity between coupled particles and the Scattering Cross-Section have been examined versus particle distance and particles aspect ratio. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
