This approach consists in obtaining patterns of fuzzy distance zones from sensor readings; comparing these patterns in order to detect non-working sensors; and integrating the patterns obtained by each kind of sensor in order to obtain a final pattern that detects obstacles of any sort. A dissimilarity measure between fuzzy sets has been defined and applied to this approach. Moreover, an algorithm to classify orientation reference systems (built by corners detected in the robot world) as open or closed, is also presented. The final pattern of fuzzy distances, resulting from the integration process, is used to extract the important reference systems when a glass wall is included in the robot environment. Finally, our approach has been tested in an ActivMedia Pioneer 2 dx mobile robot using the Player/Stage as the control interface and promising results have been obtained.", "paper_title": "FUZZY DISTANCE SENSOR DATA INTEGRATION AND INTERPRETATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000290322000005"}
