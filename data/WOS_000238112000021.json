Some new sufficient conditions ensuring the existence; uniqueness, and global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium are established by means of Leray-Schauder principle, arithmetic-mean-geometric-mean inequality and vector delay differential inequality technique. These conditions are less restrictive than previously known criteria.", "paper_title": "On equilibrium and stability of a class of neural networks with mixed delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000021"}
