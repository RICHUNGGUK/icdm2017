The original two-dimensional problem is transformed into an equivalent singular, nonlinear boundary value problem of ordinary differential equations. Three neural network models are developed for the transformed problem based on unsupervised error using log-sigmoid, radial basis and tan-sigmoid functions. Optimal weights for each model are trained with the help of the sequential quadratic programming algorithm. Three test cases of the equation are solved using the proposed schemes. Statistical analysis based on a large number of independent runs is carried out to validate the models in terms of accuracy, convergence and computational complexity.", "paper_title": "Application of three unsupervised neural network models to singular nonlinear BVP of transformed 2D Bratu equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000344775800006"}
