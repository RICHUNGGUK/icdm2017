However, little attention has been paid to parametric estimation under this censoring scheme for the mixed exponential distribution (MED) model, which is an important model in life data analysis. Based on typeII progressively hybrid censored samples, the estimation problem of the MED is addressed. The closed form of maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of unknown parameters using the EM algorithm are obtained. Some Monte Carlo simulations are implemented and a real data set is analyzed to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
