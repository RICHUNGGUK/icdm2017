Under the novel conditions, some sufficient criteria ensuring exponential stability of the proposed system are obtained. In particular, the obtained conditions complement and improve earlier publications on conventional neural networks with continuous or discontinuous righthand side. Numerical simulations are also presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
