The problem referred to herein as f-SALBP-E consists of finding a combination of the number of workstations and the cycle time as well as a respective line balance such that the efficiency of the line is maximized. f-SALBP-E is an extension of the classical SALBP-E under fuzziness. First, a formulation of the problem is given with the tasks processing times presented by triangular fuzzy membership functions. Then, since the problem is known to be NP-hard, a meta-heuristic based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is developed for its solution. The performance of the proposed solution approach is studied and discussed over multiple benchmarks test problems taken from the open literature. The results demonstrate very satisfactory performance for the developed approach in terms of both solution time and quality. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
