TDR delivers the complex propagation constant (attenuation and phase constant) of lossy cable transmission line as a function of frequency. The frequency-dependent propagation velocity is also determined from the TDR measurements through the parameters extraction procedure. The calibration of the measuring system (MS) is carried-out to avoid the effect of multiple reflections on the accuracy of measurements. The results obtained from the measurements can be used to localize the discontinuities as well as the design of communication through distribution power cables.", "paper_title": "Determining wave propagation characteristics of MV XLPE power cable using time domain reflectometry technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000289044500003"}
