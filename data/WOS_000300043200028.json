A key feature of GWAtoolbox is its ability to perform quality control (QC) of any number of files in a matter of minutes. The implemented workflow has been structured to check three particular data quality aspects: (i) data formatting, (ii) quality of the GWAS results and (iii) data consistency across studies. Output consists of an extensive list of quality statistics and plots which allow inspection of individual files and between-study comparison to identify systematic bias.", "paper_title": "GWAtoolbox: an R package for fast quality control and handling of genome-wide association studies meta-analysis data", "paper_id": "WOS:000300043200028"}
