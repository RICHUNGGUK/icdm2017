It is known from prior work that for every epsilon > 0 there exists a constant-time distributed algorithm that finds a (1 + epsilon)-approximation of a maximum matching on bounded-degree graphs. In this work, we show-somewhat surprisingly-that no sublogarithmic-time approximation scheme exists for the dual problem: there is a constant delta > 0 so that no randomised distributed algorithm with running time o(log n) can find a (1 + delta)-approximation of a minimum vertex cover on 2-coloured graphs of maximum degree 3. In fact, a simple application of the Linial-Saks (Combinatorica 13:441-454, 1993) decomposition demonstrates that this run-time lower bound is tight. Our lower-bound construction is simple and, to some extent, independent of previous techniques. Along the way we prove that a certain cut minimisation problem, which might be of independent interest, is hard to approximate locally on expander graphs.", "paper_title": "No sublogarithmic-time approximation scheme for bipartite vertex cover", "paper_id": "WOS:000347477200004"}
