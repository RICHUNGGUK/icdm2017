Shunt compensators such as the static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) and static VAR compensator (S VC) are considered to be FACTS devices. The applied control method decreases the amount of oscillations in the outputs of STATCOM and SVC considerably, with fast damping. In this paper, a PI controller is added to the model to decrease the sensitivity of the Posicast controller to the parameter variations and plant model mismatch. Simplicity and applicability are the main features of this controller. The model is simulated in a MATLAB/Simulink environment.", "paper_title": "Application of the Posicast control method to static shunt compensators", "paper_id": "WOS:000312424100006"}
