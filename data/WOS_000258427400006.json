In preprocess, we automatically build a protrusive graph for any given 3D model. The purpose of the Protrusive Graph gives the user a good clue in partitioning the model into visually significant parts. This scheme can then interactively partition models according to the user-specified partitioning requirements. Finally, iterative clustering is used to stabilize our partitions and a smoothing refinement is used to smooth the boundary between adjacent partitions. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is a flexible and powerful method of decomposing models into their significant components.", "paper_title": "Interactive model decomposition using protrusive graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000258427400006"}
