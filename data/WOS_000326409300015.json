However, research on security vulnerability analysis and quantification for automated substations is still in the preliminary phase. In particular, it is not suitable to apply existing security vulnerability quantification approaches to IEC 61850-based SAS because of its heterogeneous characteristics. In this paper, we propose an EEC 61850-based SAS network modeling and evaluation approach for security vulnerability quantification. The proposed approach uses network-level and device groupings to categorize the characteristic of the SAS. In addition, novel attack scenarios are proposed through a zoning scheme to evaluate the network model. Finally, an MTTC (Mean Time-to-Compromise) scheme is used to verify the proposed network model using a sample attack scenario.", "paper_title": "A Novel Network Modeling and Evaluation Approach for Security Vulnerability Quantification in Substation Automation Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000326409300015"}
