Its use in induction of classification trees and rules, discretization, and other methods has however been hindered by its inability to suggest subsets of values of discrete attributes and thresholds for splitting continuous attributes into intervals. We present efficient algorithms for both tasks.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for subsetting attribute values with Relief", "paper_id": "WOS:000273674500005"}
