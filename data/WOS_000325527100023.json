This algorithm is in many cases more accurate than previous algorithms (G.R. Werner et al., 2007 [5]; A.F. Oskooi et al., 2009 [7]), and it remedies a defect that causes instability with high dielectric contrast (usually for epsilon >> 10) with either isotropic or anisotropic dielectrics. Ultimately this algorithm has first-order error (in the grid cell size) when the dielectric boundaries are sharp, due to field discontinuities at the dielectric interface. Accurate treatment of the discontinuities, in the limit of infinite wavelength, leads to an asymmetric, unstable update (CA. Bauer et. al., 2011 [6]), but the symmetrized version of the latter is stable and more accurate than other FDTD methods. The convergence of field values supports the hypothesis that global first-order error can be achieved by second-order error in bulk material with zero-order error on the surface. This latter point is extremely important for any applications measuring surface fields. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
