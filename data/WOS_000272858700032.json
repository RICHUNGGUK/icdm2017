This method splits the geometry into pieces logically equivalent to a quadrilateral. Then, it meshes each piece keeping the mesh compatibility between them by solving an integer linear problem. The main limitation of submapping algorithms is that it can only be applied to geometries in which the angle between two consecutive edges is, approximately, an integer multiple of pi/2. In addition, special procedures are required in order to apply it to multiply connected domains. This article presents two original modifications to mitigate these shortcomings. Finally, it presents several numerical examples that show the applicability of the developed algorithms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
