We present a model checking algorithm for symmetric or partially symmetric systems when their correctness specification is given in CCTL. The model-checking algorithm employs Guarded Quotient Structures introduced by Sistla and Godefroid (Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci., vol. 2102, 2001). The GQS structures can be succinct representations for the reachability graphs of partially symmetric or even asymmetric systems. Our algorithm exploits state symmetries for fast evaluation. The algorithm is top down in nature, and automatically incorporates formula decomposition and sub-formula tracking.", "paper_title": "Checking extended CTL properties using guarded quotient structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000250580800001"}
