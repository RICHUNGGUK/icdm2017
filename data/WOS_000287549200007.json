Deng, On the PI Index of a Graph, MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 60 (2008) 649-657] determined the extremal graphs with respect to the PI index among all complete multipartite graphs. He wrote: \"we do not know whether K(n) is the graph with the maximal PI index among all the simple connected graphs on n vertices\". In this paper, we study the problem of the order of magnitude for the PI index. As a consequence, a sequence {F(n)}(n >= 1) of graphs is presented for which PI(F(n)) > PI(K(n)), for n > 32.", "paper_title": "Order of Magnitude of the PI Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000287549200007"}
