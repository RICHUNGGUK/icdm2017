Furthermore, under most market behaviors, one can easily find that a vendor provides a credit period (for example 30 days) for buyers to stimulate the demand, boost market share or decrease inventories of certain items. Therefore, in this paper, we establish a deterministic economic order quantity model for a retailer to determine its optimal selling price, replenishment number and replenishment schedule with fluctuating demand under two levels of trade credit policy. A particle swarm optimization is coded and used to solve the mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem by employing the properties derived in this paper. Some numerical examples are used to illustrate the features of the proposed model. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
