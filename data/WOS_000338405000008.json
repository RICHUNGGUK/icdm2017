Its main novelties can be seen in the new approach, which brings together different systems and tools in a unique platform capable of automatically generating an accurate and complete model for an object of interest. This is performed through generating an approximate model of the object, designing a stereo imaging network for the-object with this model and capturing the images at the designed postures through exploiting an inverse kinematics method for a non-standard six degree of freedom robot. The images are then used for accurate and dense 3D reconstruction using photogrammetric multi-view stereo method in two modes, including resolving scale with baseline and with control points. The results confirm the feasibility of using Particle Swarm Optimization in solving inverse kinematics for this non-standard robot. The system provides this opportunity to test the effect of incidence angle on imaging network design and shows that the matching algorithms work effectively for incidence angle of 10 degrees. The accuracy of the final point cloud generated with the system was tested in two modes through a comparison with a dataset generated with a close range 3D colour laser scanner.
