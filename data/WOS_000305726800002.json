This model serves as an instrument to investigate restricted nondeterminism of two-way multi-head automata. Our result is that, in terms of expressive power, two-way multi-head automata with nondeterminism in form of nondeterministically initialising the input heads or with restricted nondeterminism in the classical way, i.e., in every accepting computation the number of nondeterministic steps is bounded by a constant, do not yield an advantage over their completely deterministic counter-parts with the same number of input heads. We conclude this paper with a brief application of this result. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
