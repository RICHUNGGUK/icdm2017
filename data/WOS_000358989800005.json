However, the video file has a big size in comparison to text or audio and might lead to a high delivery cost when transmitted over a mobile network, a cost that not all users are willing to pay. Concerns regarding the monetary cost for accessing data content through mobile networks have been raised by various researchers. A solution that considers the user preference for trading off between video quality and price in order to reduce the content delivery cost is presented. This paper also evaluates the proposed solution and presents the results of an experimental study that assesses the video content adaptation impact on information assimilation. The results show that although video quality is reduced information assimilation is not negatively affected by the adaptation. This holds true regardless of the mobile device used in the study.", "paper_title": "Assessing Learning Achievements when Reducing Mobile Video Quality", "paper_id": "WOS:000358989800005"}
