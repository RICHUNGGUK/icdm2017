The advantage of this measure is that it can avoid the problem of finding all possible decompositions for mixed states, which is usually complicated. This method can be applied to any physical system whose time evolution is governed by the master equation. As an example, we calculate the entanglement of the following cases: ( A) entangled system composed of a pair of two- level atoms coupling to two separate baths and, ( B) two entangled modes subjected to two separate baths.", "paper_title": "A measure of entanglement through quantum trajectory approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000255525100015"}
