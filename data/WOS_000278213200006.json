In the course of an assessment a workload data file is captured containing information on the volume and usage of collected evidence in the assessment. This paper presents an analysis of evidence usage data from a total of 30 assessments employing a range of Process Assessment Models and Assessment Methods. Key differences between ISO/IEC 15504-based and CMMI-based assessments are identified, and some explanations of the differences are offered.
