Despite its long history, the method has seen little use in three-dimensional problems or in problems with non-orthogonal domains, mainly due to computational implementation difficulties. This work presents a methodology for ground structure based topology optimization in arbitrary three-dimensional (3D) domains. The proposed approach is able to address concave domains and with the possibility of holes. In addition, an easy-to-use implementation of the proposed algorithm for the optimization of least-weight trusses is described in detail. The method is verified against three-dimensional closed-form solutions available in the literature. By means of examples, various features of the 3D ground structure approach are assessed, including the ability of the method to provide solutions with different levels of detail. The source code for a MATLAB implementation of the method, named GRAND3 - GRound structure ANalysis and Design in 3D, is available in the (electronic) Supplementary Material accompanying this publication.", "paper_title": "GRAND3-Ground structure based topology optimization for arbitrary 3D domains using MATLAB", "paper_id": "WOS:000366591000009"}
