In this work we propose a method for the identification of structures using a multiscale approach with inclusion of a priori information about the searched objects. After describing the image structures in the multiscale representation, a matching step determines which structure most likely corresponds to the target. Patterns are generated by previous application of the method to a set of images. We present a prototype for identifying structures in 2D images. A set of experiments was carried out to evaluate the prototype leading to encouraging results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
