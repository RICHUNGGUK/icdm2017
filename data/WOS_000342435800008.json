SVS approaches operate by trying to extract and interpret higher \"semantic\" level events that occur in video. One of the key challenges of SVS is that of person identification where the task is for each subject that occurs in a video shot to identify the person it corresponds to. The problem of person identification is especially challenging in resource-constrained environments where transmission delay, bandwidth restriction, and packet loss may prevent the capture of high-quality data. Conventional person identification approaches which primarily are based on analyzing facial features are often not sufficient to deal with poor-quality data. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that leverages heterogeneous contextual information together with facial features to handle the problem of person identification for low-quality data. We first investigate the appropriate methods to utilize heterogeneous context features including clothing, activity, human attributes, gait, people co-occurrence, and so on. We then propose a unified approach for person identification that builds on top of our generic entity resolution framework called RelDC, which can integrate all these context features to improve the quality of person identification. This work thus links one well-known problem of person identification from the computer vision research area (that deals with video/images) with another well-recognized challenge known as entity resolution from the database and AI/ML areas (that deals with textual data). We apply the proposed solution to a real-world dataset consisting of several weeks of surveillance videos. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach even on low-quality video data.", "paper_title": "Context-based person identification framework for smart video surveillance", "paper_id": "WOS:000342435800008"}
