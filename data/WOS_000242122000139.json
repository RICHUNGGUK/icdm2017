Since the advent of ubiquitous computing, semantic-based researches have been sped-up between service provider and user. We have tried to maintain user information with a semantic cache scheme. In this paper, we propose a semantic prefetching (SP) strategy for efficient data management, considering semantic information of user. We concentrate on data prefetching methods to send mass data to high bandwidth channels. In the SP, the prepared semantic descriptions are prefetched from server to client according as the client locates in anywhere. The semantic descriptions are dynamically composed of user patterns, such as the request patterns of user, the size of querying area, the direction of user and the average speed of user. We also propose a new cache management scheme, called to semantic least recently used (S-LRU). The evaluation result shows that the system performance is significantly improved.", "paper_title": "Considering a semantic prefetching scheme for cache management in location-based services", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000139"}
