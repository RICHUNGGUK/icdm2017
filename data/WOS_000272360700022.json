An architecture to perform cooperative missions with a multi-UAV platform is presented. The interactions between UAVs are not only information exchanges but also physical couplings required to cooperate in the joint transportation of a single load. Then, the paper also presents the control system for the transportation of a slung load by means of one or several helicopters. Experimental results of the load transportation system with one and three helicopters are shown. On the other hand, the UAVs considered in the platform can also deploy small objects, such as sensor nodes, on different locations if it is required. This feature along with the whole platform architecture are illustrated in the paper with a real multi-UAV mission for the deployment of sensor nodes to repair the connectivity of a wireless sensor network.", "paper_title": "Multi-UAV Cooperation and Control for Load Transportation and Deployment", "paper_id": "WOS:000272360700022"}
