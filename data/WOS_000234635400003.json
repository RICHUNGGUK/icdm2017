Much of the literature employ advanced quantitative techniques to produce evidence against, or for, a developed theory. Often times, these studies make strict assumptions and judgment calls that allow one to question the validity of the results. In this paper, we combine computer simulation and exploratory data analysis to gain a better understanding of stock market portfolios and of common risk measures. By taking a computational approach, our study requires a small amount of subjectivity and makes no assumptions about capital markets. This makes our results very difficult to discredit. Our results provide strong evidence against the efficient market hypothesis and display some undesirable properties of several well-known risk measures.", "paper_title": "Market truths: theory versus empirical simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000234635400003"}
