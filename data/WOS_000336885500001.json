In order to increase the usability, acceptability, and accuracy of fingerprint recognition technologies, touchless systems have recently been studied. With respect to touch-based biometric techniques, these systems present important differences in most of the steps of the recognition process. Studies in the literature can be classified into technologies based on two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods. These studies also present important differences in terms of accuracy and required level of user cooperation. This paper presents a brief survey on touchless recognition technologies, proposing a classification of two-dimensional and three-dimensional biometric recognition techniques.", "paper_title": "Touchless Fingerprint Biometrics: A Survey on 2D and 3D Technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000336885500001"}
