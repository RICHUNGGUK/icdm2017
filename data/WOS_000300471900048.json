Since the highest ranked images in original retrieval results are not always relevant, a naive PRF based re-ranking approach is not capable of producing a satisfactory result. We employ a two-step approach to address this issue. In step 1, a Pearson's correlation coefficient based similarity update method is used to re-rank the high ranked images. In step 2, after estimating a relevance probability for each of the highest ranked images, a fuzzy SVM ensemble based approach is adopted to re-rank the images. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms two other re-ranking methods.", "paper_title": "A New Re-Ranking Method Using Enhanced Pseudo-Relevance Feedback for Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000300471900048"}
