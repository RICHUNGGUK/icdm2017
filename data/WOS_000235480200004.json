In the first paper, the theory of FTP is presented. In this paper, in order to validate the theory, two practical examples are given. The first one is a material tensile strength test and the second one was tool condition monitoring in boring. The experiment results indicate that the new method is effective. It outperforms the popular artificial neural network method (feed-forward network with back propagation training) by as much as 9%. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
