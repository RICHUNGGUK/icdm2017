The use of environment maps is a common approach to this problem, but implicates performance problems due to costly pre-filtering steps or expensive sampling. We, therefore, introduce a regular sampling scheme for environment maps that relies on an efficient MIP-map-based filtering step, and minimizes the number of necessary samples for creating a convincing real-time rendering of glossy BRDF materials.", "paper_title": "Real-time rendering of glossy materials with regular sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000337054700015"}
