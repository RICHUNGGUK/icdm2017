However, to exploit this available capacity, we need a suitable software platform that allows effective parallel packet processing and resource management. In this paper, we at first introduce an improved forwarding architecture for software routers that enhances parallelism by exploiting hardware classification and multi-queue support, already available in recent commodity network interface cards. After evaluating the original scheduling algorithm of the widely-used Click modular router, we propose solutions for extending this scheduler for improved fairness, throughput, and more precise resource management. To illustrate the potential benefits of our proposal, we implement and evaluate a few key elements of our overall design. Finally, we discuss how our improved forwarding architecture and resource management might be applied in virtualized software routers.", "paper_title": "Improved parallelism and scheduling in multi-core software routers", "paper_id": "WOS:000313166000014"}
