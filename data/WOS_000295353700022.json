This research investigates the ways that such mismatches can be addressed, suggesting that this can be done by minimizing quality variability and increasing the overall video quality rendered to end-systems. Towards this end, we formulate a combination of innovative congestion control-aware mechanisms and filtering techniques. Our proposal involves extracting explicit information from the network, as well as providing the video source with consistent and stable information. We investigate this proposal throughout the following pages and reveal its efficiency by simulating representative scenarios. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
