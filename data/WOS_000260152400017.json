Typically, DLs are limited to deal with precise and well-defined concepts. In this paper we first present a fuzzy extension of ALC*, called fuzzy ALC*, combining Zadeh's fuzzy logic with an expressive DL and de. ne its syntax and semantics. Then we devote to taking advantage of the expressive power and reasoning capabilities of fuzzy ALC* by encoding flexible planning problems within the framework of fuzzy ALC*. Both theory and experimental results have shown that our method is sound and efficient. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
