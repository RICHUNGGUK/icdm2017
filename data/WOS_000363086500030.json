It utilizes position of the last nonzero level of quantized discrete cosine transform block to embed information bits. Because only the high-frequency levels are changed, it can guarantee a high peak signal-to-noise ratio and slight increase in bit rate after the watermark embedding. The extraction process is not complex; thus, the proposed technique is an excellent solution for real-time applications such as broadcasting. Experimental results on several test sequences demonstrate that the proposed approach can realize blind extraction with real-time performance; it also provides very high capacity, low distortion and increase in bit rate by about 0.5%.
