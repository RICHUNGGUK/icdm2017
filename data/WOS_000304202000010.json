To solve this problem, projective clustering has been defined as an extension to traditional clustering that attempts to find projected clusters in subsets of the dimensions of a data space. In this paper, a probability model is first proposed to describe projected clusters in high-dimensional data space. Then, we present a model-based algorithm for fuzzy projective clustering that discovers clusters with overlapping boundaries in various projected subspaces. The suitability of the proposal is demonstrated in an empirical study done with synthetic data set and some widely used real-world data set.", "paper_title": "Model-Based Method for Projective Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000304202000010"}
