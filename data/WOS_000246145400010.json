The distributor marks each individual copy with a unique fingerprint. If an illegal copy appears, it can be traced back to one or more guilty pirates due to this fingerprint. To work against a coalition of several pirates, the fingerprinting scheme must be based on a collusion-secure code. This paper addresses binary collusion-secure codes in the setting of Boneh and Shaw (1995/1998). We prove that the Boneh-Shaw scheme is more efficient than originally proven, and we propose adaptations to further improve the scheme. We also point out some differences between our model and others in the literature.", "paper_title": "The Boneh-Shaw fingerprinting scheme is better than we thought", "paper_id": "WOS:000246145400010"}
