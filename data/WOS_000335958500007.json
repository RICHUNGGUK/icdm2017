The RoF bus has been designed based on the use of cascaded building blocks to support a large number of access nodes using electronic coupling and in-line amplification inside the access nodes. A dedicated emulation protocol has been defined to test the RoF bus, and experimental results have shown that a coverage distance of about 4.5 m is obtained for bidirectional communications up to 18 access nodes. For large buildings, a star-bus network, based on multiple interconnected RoF buses, is proposed, and significant reduction of in-building deployed fiber length is achieved (89%) compared to a RoF star network infrastructure.", "paper_title": "Demonstration of an In-Building Optical Bus Network for Wireless Access", "paper_id": "WOS:000335958500007"}
