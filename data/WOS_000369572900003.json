In this paper we present ERBAC - an event-driven extension of the TRBAC model that allows the specification and enforcement of general reactive policies - and its implementation. While almost all the individual features of ERBAC occur separately in some previous model, the detailed design of the policy language, its implementation in XACML, and its testing contribute to the development of expressive, event-driven policy frameworks by demonstrating that this rich model can be satisfactorily implemented, and that its expressivity and performance are compatible with a variety of realistic application scenarios. In particular, a number of examples illustrate ERBAC's expressive power, and its ability of handling exceptional situations in a flexible way, while keeping policies compact and manageable. The prototype extends XACML's language and the implementation of the PDP to support the new model. Systematic scalability experiments show that the computational cost of policy rule evaluation in ERBAC is compatible with real-world applications.", "paper_title": "Event-driven RBAC", "paper_id": "WOS:000369572900003"}
