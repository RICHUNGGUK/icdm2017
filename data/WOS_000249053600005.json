The timeline for a set of documents returned in response to a query gives an indication of how documents relevant to that query are distributed in time. Examining the timeline of a query result set allows us to characterize both how temporally dependent the topic is, as well as how relevant the results are likely to be. We outline characteristic patterns in query result set timelines, and show experimentally that we can automatically classify documents into these classes. We also show that properties of the query result set timeline can help predict the mean average precision of a query. These results show that meta-features associated with a query can be combined with text retrieval techniques to improve our understanding and treatment of text search on documents with timestamps.", "paper_title": "Temporal profiles of queries", "paper_id": "WOS:000249053600005"}
