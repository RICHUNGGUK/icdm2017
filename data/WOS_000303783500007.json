Hedging strategies for international portfolios have usually focused on the use of forward contracts to mitigate the currency risk. We propose an alternative formulation aimed at the reduction of the overall portfolio risk by assuming the returns are uncertain and maximizing the portfolio return for the worst possible outcome of the returns. This technique known as robust optimization provides a first guarantee on the portfolio value thanks to the non-inferiority property. We further complement our approach with forward contracts on the foreign exchange rates and options on the assets. Because the total return on any asset will be the product of its local return and currency return, the models proposed are bilinear and non convex. A reformulation of both the uncertainty set and the objective function as a semidefinite problem will yield an approximate tractable model. We compare the hedging alternatives proposed with simulated and historical market data and conclude on their relative benefits. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
