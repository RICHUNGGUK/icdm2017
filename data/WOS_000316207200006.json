We propose new iteration function for the rho method by exploiting the fact that point halving is more efficient than point addition for elliptic curves over binary fields. We present a careful analysis of the alternative rho method with new iteration function. Compared to the previous r-adding walk, generally the new method can achieve a significant speedup for computing elliptic curve discrete logarithms over binary fields. For instance, for certain NIST-recommended curves over binary fields, the new method is about 12-17% faster than the previous best methods.", "paper_title": "Speeding up elliptic curve discrete logarithm computations with point halving", "paper_id": "WOS:000316207200006"}
