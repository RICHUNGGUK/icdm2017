We present a model which takes free inspiration from some features of biological clocks. In particular, we associate the concept of Innate Releasing Mechanisms (IRM) to the concept of periodic behavior activation in order to link the variability of the behavior to the circumstances in which it is activated. We propose an architecture in which the frequency of access to the sensory system is modified in accordance to the environmental changes. To this purpose we use the Schema Theory paradigm. Some first experimental results are reported and discussed.", "paper_title": "Periodic adaptive activation of behaviors in robotic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000258879900013"}
