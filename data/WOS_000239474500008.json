To achieve our goal we define the notions of simulation and equivalence. Using these two concepts, we construct sets of simulation conditions which imply that the physical device of interest is equivalent to the one it is supposed to implement. Another benefit of our formalism is that our statements can be proved to be robust. Finally, we design a test for quantum circuits whose complexity is polynomial in the number of gates and qubits, and the required precision.", "paper_title": "Self-testing of quantum circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474500008"}
