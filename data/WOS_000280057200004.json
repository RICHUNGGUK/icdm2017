The player who dominates more than half of the lines wins the game. In this note, we first present the result of exhaustive computations of Stonehenge: for all first moves, the winner of the game is computed, and the results show that the first player has a winning strategy. Second, we consider Generalized Stonehenge played on a hypergraph and prove its PSPACE-completeness.", "paper_title": "STONEHENGE: OUTCOME OF ALL FIRST MOVES AND PSPACE-COMPLETENESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280057200004"}
