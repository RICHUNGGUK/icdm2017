Unfortunately, these can be noisy (that is, have a high Monte Carlo error). We derive an optimal weighting strategy using bootstrap and quadratic programming to obtain a more computationally stable HPD, or in general, shortest probability interval (Spin). We prove the consistency of our method. Simulation studies on a range of theoretical and real-data examples, some with symmetric and some with asymmetric posterior densities, show that intervals constructed using Spin have better coverage (relative to the posterior distribution) and lower Monte Carlo error than empirical shortest intervals. We implement the new method in an R package (SPIn) so it can be routinely used in post-processing of Bayesian simulations.", "paper_title": "Simulation-efficient shortest probability intervals", "paper_id": "WOS:000356828600010"}
