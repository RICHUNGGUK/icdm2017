This paper presents VMRPC, a lightweight RPC framework specifically designed for VMs that leverages the heap and stack sharing mechanism to circumvent unnecessary data copy and serialization/deserilization. Our evaluation shows that the performance of VMRPC is an order of magnitude better than traditional RPC systems and existing alternative interdomain communication optimization systems. The evaluation on a VMRPC-enhanced networked file system across a varied range of benchmarks further reveals the competitiveness of VMRPC in IO-intensive applications.", "paper_title": "A Fast RPC System for Virtual Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000319678800001"}
