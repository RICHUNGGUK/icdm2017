Specifically, switches in the distribution systems are modeled as intelligent agents and organized as local power committees in a distribution system. The advantage of this approach is to utilize the solving ability of a local committee of agents who could coordinate with neighboring committees to achieve an agreement that satisfies the global objective of the power distribution system service restoration problems without relying on a pre-determined centralized optimization algorithm as traditional approaches. The proposed coordination method helps switches in the distributed local power committees to reach a consensus among many proposed service restoration solutions after faults are detected and isolated. We also take the voltage violations into consideration in the search of solutions. Two examples of different power distribution systems are presented to demonstrate how the algorithms of the coordination method can identify the best restoration solution among many proposed local candidate solutions. The simulation results show that the proposed committee-based multi-agent approach yields better performance than the previous methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
