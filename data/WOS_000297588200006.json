This model allows us to relate the total time until the failure to some type of cumulative damage. The majority of the models based on the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution have assumed fixed-effects, and a few have been investigated for correlated data. In this work, we introduce Birnbaum-Saunders mixed models for censored data. Specifically, we estimate their parameters by means of the Gauss-Hermite quadrature approximation, carry out a residual analysis for these models, and conduct an application using real censored reliability data. This application illustrates the utility of a Birnbaum-Saunders random intercept model.", "paper_title": "Birnbaum-Saunders Mixed Models for Censored Reliability Data Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000297588200006"}
