Existing network analysis tools often lack intuitive interfaces to support the exploration of large scale data. We present a visual recommendation system to help guide users during navigation of network data. Collaborative filtering, similarity metrics, and relative importance are used to generate recommendations of potentially significant nodes for users to explore. In addition, graph layout and node visibility are adjusted in real-time to accommodate recommendation display and to reduce visual clutter. Case studies are presented to show how our design can improve network exploration.", "paper_title": "Visual Recommendations for Network Navigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000292164300046"}
