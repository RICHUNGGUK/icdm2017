Each SVM classifier is designed to deal with a specific noise configuration and, when combined together - by means of the Iterative Boolean Combination (IBC) technique - they provide high robustness to different noise-to-signal ratio. In order to produce a high amount of vibration signals, considering different defect dimensions and noise levels, the BEAring Toolbox (BEAT) is employed in this work. The experiments indicate that the proposed strategy can significantly reduce the error rates, even in the presence of very noisy signals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
