We analyze the smooth and discrete ARAP energy and formulate our spherical parametrization energy from the discrete ARAP energy. The solution is non-trivial as the energy involves a large system of non-linear equations with additional spherical constraints. To this end, we propose a two-step iterative algorithm. In the first step, we adopt a local/global iterative scheme to calculate the parametrization coordinates. In the second step, we optimize a best approximate sphere on which parametrization triangles can be embedded in a rigidity-preserving manner. Our algorithm is simple, robust, and efficient. Experimental results show that our approach provides almost isometric spherical parametrizations with lowest rigidity distortion over state-of-the-art approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
