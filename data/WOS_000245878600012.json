We propose a family of iterative improvement heuristics based on previous work by Potts [Analysis of a heuristic for one machine sequencing with release dates and delivery times. Operations Research 1980;28:1436-41] and Uzsoy [Scheduling batch processing machines with incompatible job families. International Journal for Production Research 1995;33(10):2685-708] and combine them with a genetic algorithm (GA) based on the random keys encoding of Bean [Genetic algorithms and random keys for sequencing and optimization. ORSA Journal on Computing 1994;6(2):154-60]. Extensive computational experiments show that one of the proposed GAs runs significantly faster than the other, providing a good tradeoff between solution time and quality. The combination of iterative heuristics with GAs consistently outperforms the iterative heuristics on their own. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
