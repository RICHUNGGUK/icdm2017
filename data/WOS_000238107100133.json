In order to obtain the highest experimental efficiency, the distributions of constructed combinatorial libraries should be carefully adjusted. The presented approach takes into account diversity- completeness trade-off and tries to maximize the number of new amino acid sequences generated in each cycle of the experiment. In the paper, the mathematical model is introduced and the parallel genetic algorithm for the defined optimization problem is described. Its implementation on the SunFire 6800 computer proves a high efficiency of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "The parallel genetic algorithm for designing DNA randomizations in a combinatorial protein experiment", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100133"}
