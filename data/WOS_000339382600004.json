A simple -Venn diagram is an -Venn diagram in which at most two curves intersect at any point. In this paper, we introduce a new property of Venn diagrams called crosscut symmetry, which is related to dihedral symmetry. Utilizing a computer search restricted to diagrams with crosscut symmetry, we found many simple symmetric Venn diagrams with 11 curves. The question of the existence of a simple 11-Venn diagram has been open since the 1960s. The technique used to find the 11-Venn diagram is extended and a symmetric 13-Venn diagram is also demonstrated.", "paper_title": "New Roses: Simple Symmetric Venn Diagrams with 11 and 13 Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000339382600004"}
