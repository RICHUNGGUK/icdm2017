On the basis of this consideration, this paper incorporates the power line system into the HAN and proposes a hybrid architecture of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based wireless communication and power line communication for the Smart Grid security application. With this new solution, the channel diversity of the HAN is realized, and the communication reliability is still guaranteed even when the wireless channel suffers from jamming. Simulation results validate the feasibility of the proposed hybrid architecture, and furthermore, as a receiver diversity scheme, selection combining is preferred to maximum ratio combining.
