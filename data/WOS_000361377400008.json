The key goal of the method presented here is to widen the appeal and application of game metrics within research relevant to, and representative of the wider field of game studies. In doing so, we acknowledge that the interests of this research community is often focused on player experience and performance with a broad range of off-the-shelf games that have already been released to the public. In order to be able to include any PC game system within research (or audiovideo stream, e.g., YouTube walkthroughs) our approach comprises of a postprocessing method for analyzing player performance. Through exploiting the audiovisual streams that are transmitted to the player, this approach processes content activated and generated during play and is therefore representative of individual player's encounters with specific games.", "paper_title": "Postprocessing Gameplay Metrics for Gameplay Performance Segmentation Based on Audiovisual Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000361377400008"}
