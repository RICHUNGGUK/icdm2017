The rules are based on three basic adaptive learning principles: the benefit principle, the minimal disturbance principle, and the burden-sharing principle. In order to follow the benefit principle and the minimal disturbance principle, a neuron selection rule and a weight adaptation rule are developed. Besides, a learning control rule is developed to follow the burden-sharing principle. The advantage of the rules is that they can effectively guide the BFNN's learning to conduct constructive adaptations and avoid destructive ones. With these rules, a sensitivity-based adaptive learning (SBALR) algorithm for BFNNs is presented. Experimental results on a number of benchmark data demonstrate that the SBALR algorithm has better learning performance than the Madaline rule II and backpropagation algorithms.", "paper_title": "Sensitivity-Based Adaptive Learning Rules for Binary Feedforward Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000302705100009"}
