However, to assure its learned probabilities to be non-negative, LSPC involves a post-processing step of rounding up negative parameters to zero, which can unexpectedly influence classification performance. In order to mitigate this problem, we propose a simple alternative scheme that directly rounds tip the classifier's negative outputs, not negative parameters. Through extensive experiments including real-world image classification and audio tagging tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed modification significantly improves classification accuracy, while the computational advantage of the original LSPC remains unchanged.", "paper_title": "Improving the Accuracy of Least-Squares Probabilistic Classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000292480800030"}
