We discuss what is meant by bidirectional transformations, and the model-driven development scenarios in which they are needed. We analyse the fundamental requirements on tools which support such transformations, and discuss some semantic issues which arise. In particular, we show that any transformation language sufficient to the needs of model-driven development would have to be able to express non-bijective transformations. We argue that a considerable amount of basic research is needed before suitable tools will be fully realisable, and suggest directions for this future research.", "paper_title": "Bidirectional model transformations in QVT: semantic issues and open questions", "paper_id": "WOS:000272321500002"}
