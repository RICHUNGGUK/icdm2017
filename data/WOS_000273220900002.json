This paper presents a new and fast calculation method for the DIN boundary operator in the important case of rectangular structures, based on the superposition of parallel-plate waveguide modes. Especially for its non-differential form, some numerical issues need to be addressed. It is further explained how the DtN operator can be determined for composite geometries. The theory is illustrated with some numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Construction and applications of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator in transmission line modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000273220900002"}
