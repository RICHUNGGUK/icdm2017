Ripcord enables researchers to build and evaluate new network features and topologies, using only commercially available hardware and open-source software. The Ripcord demo will show three examples of custom network functions, operating together, on top of a 160-node cluster. The first is a routing engine that isolates classes of traffic. The second is a dynamic network manager than adjusts links and switch power states to reduce energy. The third is a statistics aggregator that supports network health monitoring and automatic alerts. The demo will be interactive, with a visualization of live parameters for each link and switch, such as bandwidth, drops, and power status, as well a control panel to modify the traffic load. We feel that an interactive demo is the best way to introduce the research community to Ripcord and get their feedback.", "paper_title": "Ripcord: A Modular Platform for Data Center Networking", "paper_id": "WOS:000284879800064"}
