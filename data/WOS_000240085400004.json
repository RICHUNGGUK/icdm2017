This paper proposes an enhanced ACS, which embeds the sequential insertion heuristic method, to solve VRPTW. The main idea is to organize two respective ant colonies to successively achieve a multiple objective minimization. Experiments on a series of benchmark problems demonstrate the excellent performance of ACS when compared with other optimization methods.", "paper_title": "Ant colony system for optimizing Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW)", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400004"}
