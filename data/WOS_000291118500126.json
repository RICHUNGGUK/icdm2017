In a previous work, we found these hotspots in the context of a Geographic Information System (GIS) by using the extended fuzzy C-means (EFCM). Here we show how the spatial distribution of the hotspots can evolve temporally and like applicational example, we present the spatial-temporal evolution in the period 2000-2006 of the fire point-events data of the Santa Fe district (NM) (downloaded from URL: www.fs.fed.us/r3/gis/sfe_gis.shtml).
