The static and dynamic noises given to the proposed circuits were obtained from device mismatches of current sources (transistors) and externally applied random spike currents, respectively. Through circuit simulations we confirmed that the circuit exhibited noise-shaping properties, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the network was improved by 7.9 dB compared with that of the uncoupled network as a result of noise shaping.", "paper_title": "An inhibitory neural-network circuit exhibiting noise shaping with subthreshold MOS neuron circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093800008"}
