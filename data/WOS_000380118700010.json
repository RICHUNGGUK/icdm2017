The idea is to use the fact that the preparation of certain single-qubit states, so called magic states, plus any Clifford gate operations are universal for quantum computing. If Merlin is honest, he sends the witness plus magic states to Arthur. If Merlin is malicious, he might send other states to Arthur, but Arthur can verify the correctness of magic states by himself. We also generalize the result to QIP(3): we show that the class QIP(S) does not change even if the computational power of the verifier is restricted to only Clifford gate operations (plus classical XOR gate).", "paper_title": "QUANTUM MERLIN-ARTHUR WITH CLIFFORD ARTHUR", "paper_id": "WOS:000380118700010"}
