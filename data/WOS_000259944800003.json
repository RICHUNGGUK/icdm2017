Thus, the study of the communication networks for distributed systems is very important, which is the focus of this paper. In particular, we address the problem of interconnection networks performance modeling for heterogeneous meta-computing systems. We consider the meta-computing system as a typical multi-cluster system. Since the heterogeneity is becoming common in such systems, we take into account network its well as cluster size heterogeneity to propose the model. To this end, we present all analytical network model and validate the model through comprehensive simulation. The results of the simulation demonstrated that the proposed model exhibits a good degree of accuracy for various system organizations and Under different working conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
