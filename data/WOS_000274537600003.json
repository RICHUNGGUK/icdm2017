A greedy compression algorithm with the transform model is presented as well as a Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)-type compressed pattern matching algorithm. The compression ratio is a match for gzip and Re-Pair, and the search speed of our CPM algorithm is almost twice faster than the KMP-type CPM algorithm on Byte-Pair-Encoding by Shibata et al. [18], and in the case of short patterns, faster than the Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm with the stopper encoding by Rautio et al. [14], which is regarded as one of the best combinations that allows a practically fast search.", "paper_title": "Context-Sensitive Grammar Transform: Compression and Pattern Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000274537600003"}
