As evidenced by a number of studies, this algorithm features several innovative aspects in its operational procedure that foster its utilization in diverse fields such as construction, engineering, robotics, telecommunications, health and energy. This manuscript will go through the most recent literature on the application of Harmony Search to the aforementioned disciplines towards a three-fold goal: (1) to underline the good behavior of this modern meta-heuristic based on the upsurge of related contributions reported to date; (2) to set a bibliographic basis for future research trends focused on its applicability to other areas; (3) to provide an insightful analysis of future research lines gravitating on this meta-heuristic solver.
