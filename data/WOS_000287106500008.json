This paper also introduces a secure and efficient symmetric cryptosystem based on affine transformation. The proposed cryptosystem includes an encryption algorithm that is an improved variant of the Affine Hill cipher, and two cryptographic protocols that are introduced for the proposed cryptosystem.
