The resulting parameters have been compared with those calculated for conventional peptides. Rotational profiles, which were obtained spanning the corresponding dihedral angle, were corrected by removing the energy contributions associated to changes in interactions different from torsion under study. For this purpose, the torsional energy associated to each point of the profiles was estimated as the corresponding quantum mechanical energy minus the bonding and nonbonding energy contributions produced by the perturbations that the variation of the spanned dihedral angle causes in the bond distances, bond angles and the other dihedral angles. These energies were calculated using force-field expressions. The corrected profiles were fitted to a three-term Fourier expansion to derive the torsional parameters. Atomic charges for retro-inverso modified residues were derived from the rigorously calculated quantum mechanical electrostatic potential. Furthermore, the reliability of electrostatic models based on geometry-dependent charges and fixed charges has been examined.", "paper_title": "Force-field parametrization of retro-inverso modified residues: Development of torsional and electrostatic parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000238317300002"}
