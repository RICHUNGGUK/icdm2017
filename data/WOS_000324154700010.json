Through an extensive literature search, 1612 secreted proteins have been collected as a standard data set from three data sources, including Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL and RefSeq. To explore the relationships among different types of secreted proteins, we model this data set as a sequence similarity network. Finally, a multi-classifier named SecretP is proposed to distinguish different types of secreted proteins, and yields a high total sensitivity of 90.12% for the test set. When performed on another public independent dataset for further evaluation, a promising prediction result is obtained.
