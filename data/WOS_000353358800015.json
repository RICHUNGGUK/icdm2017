An analog implementation of the LMS algorithm is used to continuously adapt the feedback filter coefficients. A clock and data recovery circuit is used to extract the clock from the DFE output. The adaptive DFE dissipates 318 mW, not including output buffers, and can equalize PRBS data corrupted by a 300-m multimode fiber achieving BER .", "paper_title": "A 10 Gb/s adaptive analog decision feedback equalizer for multimode fiber dispersion compensation in 0.13 mu m CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000353358800015"}
