In this paper, we propose a graph clustering method based on spatio-temporal information of moving objects for multiple person tracking. First, the part-based model is utilized to localize individual foreground regions in each frame. Then, we heuristically leverage the spatio-temporal constraints to generate a set of reliable tracklets. Finally, the graph shift method is applied to handle tracklet association problem and consequently generate the completed trajectory for individual object. The extensive comparison experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Multiple Person Tracking based on Spatial-temporal Information by Global Graph Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000358995800014"}
