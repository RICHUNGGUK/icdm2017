The classical shading for MCVR, however, results in a low quality image. In this paper, a so-called estimators combining technique is presented that estimates a realistic rendering using the Lambertian reflection illumination model. Such a technique is particularly adapted to changes in viewing and lighting, and provides high quality shading images exhibiting strong shape and spatial relationship of objects.", "paper_title": "Combining estimators for Monte Carlo volume rendering with shading", "paper_id": "WOS:000239839300003"}
