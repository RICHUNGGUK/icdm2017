Typically, recovery from even a simple fault will require knowledge of the environment in which a computing system operates. To meet this need, we present an approach to self healing and recovery informed by environment knowledge that combines case based reasoning (CBR) and rule based reasoning. Specifically, CBR is used for fault diagnosis and rule based reasoning for fault remediation, recovery, and referral. We also show how automated information gathering from available sources in a computing system's environment can increase problem solving efficiency and help to reduce the occurrence of service failures. Finally, we demonstrate the approach in an intelligent system for fault management in a local printer network.", "paper_title": "Autonomic self healing and recovery informed by environment knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000251609100008"}
