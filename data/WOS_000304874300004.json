A improved macromodel of the clamped-clamped microbeam-based MEMS capacitive switch is presented to investigate the nonlinear dynamic response of clamped-clamped microbeam of MEMS capacitive switch under different mechanical shock in this article, the macromodel provides an effective and accurate design tool for this class of MEMS devices because of taking account into some effects simultaneously including midplane stretching effect, residual stress and different mechanical shock loads. A numerical analytical method based on multimode Galerkin discretization is presented to investigate the nonlinear response of clamped-clamped microbeam of MEMS capacitive switch under the different mechanical shock loads. The results show that using five or more modes can be sufficient to capture the nonlinear dynamic response of clamped-clamped microbeam, and the microbeam experiences a mechanical shock load as a quasi-static load or a dynamic load depending on the ration between the natural periods of the structure and the period or frequency of mechanical shock load. The proposed method gives the identical results to other numerical methods in the literature. Moreover, this method is straightforward to implement and could save computation efforts while not losing accuracy.", "paper_title": "The nonlinear dynamic response of microbeam of MEMS capacitive switch under mechanical shock", "paper_id": "WOS:000304874300004"}
