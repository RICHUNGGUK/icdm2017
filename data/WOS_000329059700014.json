Results: With we present an automatic annotation pipeline developed specifically for comparative genomics of small nucleolar RNAs. It makes use of sequence conservation, canonical box motifs as well as secondary structure and predicts putative targets.", "paper_title": "snoStrip: a snoRNA annotation pipeline", "paper_id": "WOS:000329059700014"}
