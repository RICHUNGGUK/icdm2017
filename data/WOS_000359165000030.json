However, KFs exhibit poor estimation performance or even diverge when system models have parameter uncertainties. To overcome this drawback, finite impulse response (FIR) filters have been studied; these are more robust against model uncertainty than KFs. In this paper, we propose a novel MU algorithm based on FIR filtering for Markov jump linear systems (MJISs). The proposed algorithm is called the multi-target FIR tracking algorithm (MTFTA). The MTFTA is based on the decision-making process to identify the true-target's state among candidate states. The true-target decision-making process utilizes the likelihood function and the Mahalanobis distance. We show that the proposed MTFTA exhibits better robustness against model parameter uncertainties than the conventional KF-based algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
