Recently, multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems with interval type-2 fuzzy information have received increasing attentions both from researchers and practitioners. As a result, a number of interval type-2 fuzzy MADM methods have been developed. In this paper, we extend the VIKOR (VIseKriterijumska Optimizacijia I Kompromisno Resenje, in Serbian) method based on the prospect theory to accommodate interval type-2 fuzzy circumstances. First, we propose a new distance measure for IT2FS, which is comes as a sound alternative when being compared with the existing interval type-2 fuzzy distance measures. Then, a decision model integrating VIKOR method and-prospect theory is proposed. A case study concerning a high-tech risk evaluation is provided to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. In addition, a comparative analysis with interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS method is also presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
