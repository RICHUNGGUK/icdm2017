The problem is shown to be NP-hard when the number of receive antennas grows linearly with the number of transmit antennas. For the case where the number of receive antennas is constant, the problem can be solved in polynomial time. An optimal algorithm is explicitly constructed. For practical purposes, a low-complexity algorithm based on local search is presented. Simulation results show that its performance is nearly optimal.", "paper_title": "Optimal Phase Control for Equal-Gain Transmission in MIMO Systems With Scalar Quantization: Complexity and Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000278812000025"}
