Some properties of the I-topology are studied. It is shown that a Menger PNS with the I-topology forms a both locally convex and locally bounded I-topological vector space of QL-type. In addition, the relation between the I-topology and that topologically generated by some classical topologies is investigated.", "paper_title": "I-topologies generated by probabilistic norms", "paper_id": "WOS:000357312800014"}
