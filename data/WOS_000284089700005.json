The automation of building function is highly dependent on sensing devices and Smart Building Applications(SBAs), which are often only evaluated in situ post deployment, making re-development costly. In this paper we explore our experiences developing a Simulated Context (SimCon) Model which currently supports taking information from a Virtual Reality (VR) SB and converting it into three types of location context to conduct early rapid evaluation of location based SBAs. This model is expressed using the Sensor Modelling Language (sensorML). It also explores the integration of this model into the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) for modelling and simulating SBs. It also details usability evaluations of the SimConfig and SimConViz Tool for improving evaluation during the design phase of smart building development life cycle.", "paper_title": "SimCon: A Tool to Support Rapid Evaluation of Smart Building Application Design using Context Simulation and Virtual Reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000284089700005"}
