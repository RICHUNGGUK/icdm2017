While dealing with complex parts (e.g. the number of surfaces of the solid) no CAD modeling methodology is existing. Based on the analysis of industrial designers' practices as well as student practices on CAD, we identified key factors that lead to better performance. Our objective in this article is to propose a practical method for complex parts modeling in parametric CAD system. An illustration of the performances and the results obtained by this method are presented comparing the traditional method with the proposed one while using an academic case and then an industrial case.
