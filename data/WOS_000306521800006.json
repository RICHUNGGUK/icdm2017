A paradigm for modeling the cost of wind-generated electricity from a wind farm is proposed. Based on the Weibull wind speed distribution and wind turbine model represented by function approximation, the frequency distribution of wind farm power output to be the basis for modeling wind generation cost is established via applying Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed wind generation cost model consists of the opportunity cost of wind power shortage and the opportunity cost of wind power surplus, which reflect the cost of dispatching additional reserve capacity and the cost of environmental benefit loss, respectively, and it is integrated into the conventional OPF program. Furthermore, the small signal stability constraints are considered simultaneously as well during optimization. A self-adaptive evolutionary programming method is employed to solve the OPF with wind power involved. A case study is conducted based on the IEEE New England test system (10-Generator-39-Bus) as a benchmark. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of the proposed model and method.", "paper_title": "Optimal Power Flow Solution Incorporating Wind Power", "paper_id": "WOS:000306521800006"}
