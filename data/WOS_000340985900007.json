There is a wide range of types and designs available, allowing them to be applied to areas having different shapes. At the design stage, once an insulator design has been developed sufficiently to identify its dimensions and features, the attaching time and baseline cost must be estimated with reasonable accuracy to enable a comparison of vendor quotes. However, the current estimation method is not sufficiently accurate in terms of the baseline cost. This paper presents a motion-based time-estimating scheme with which the time required for the attachment of such insulators can be calculated more accurately. The scheme has been developed by analyzing the motions needed to attach 350 insulators and then designating representative motions and their time values. For this purpose, a modular arrangement of predetermined time standards (MODAPTS) is adopted. Motion-based time-estimation method is useful in terms of simplicity and accuracy. It enables design engineers to estimate the time required for the attachment based only on a drawing of the insulator and a few MODAPTS rules. Estimates made with this method should vary from the actual value by no more than 9.5%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
