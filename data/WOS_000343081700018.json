The main idea is that, instead of choosing a rectangle matrix, we choose a square matrix with small rank to generate Bi-ISIS problem without affecting the hardness of the underlying SIS problem. Based on this new problem, we present two new hardness problems: computational Bi-ISIS and decisional problems. As a direct application of these problems, we construct a new lattice-based key exchange (KE) protocol, which is analogous to the classic Diffie-Hellman KE protocol. We prove the security of this protocol and show that it provides better security in case of worst-case hardness of lattice problems, relatively efficient implementations, and great simplicity.", "paper_title": "Lattice-based key exchange on small integer solution problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000343081700018"}
