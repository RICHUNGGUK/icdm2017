In this paper, a new method to extract the single-dispersion Cole bioimpedance model parameters is presented using a simple circuit consisting of a operational amplifier and a set of resistors. We examine the theory behind this magnitude-only method and demonstrate its application for the extraction of impedance data from a number of different fruit samples. Three means to compute the single-dispersion Cole model parameters are given and discussed under different measurement scenarios, and compared with experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
