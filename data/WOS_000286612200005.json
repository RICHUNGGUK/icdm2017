At the middle of 2005, a partial positive answer was given, proving that the conjecture holds if dissolution rules are forbidden. In this paper we give a detailed and complete proof of this result modifying slightly the notion of dependency graph associated with recognizer P systems.", "paper_title": "ON A PARTIAL AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER FOR A PAUN'S CONJECTURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612200005"}
