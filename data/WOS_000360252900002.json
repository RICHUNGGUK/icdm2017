However, most Chinese firms adopt this innovation without fully utilizing its benefits. Extant IS research only focuses on factors that impact its adoption (rather than post-adoption factors). Assimilation theories suggest that most information technologies exhibit an \"assimilation gap\" such that widespread usage tends to lag behind their adoption. Drawing upon the TOE framework, we investigate antecedents of RFID assimilation into these Chinese companies. Empirical results indicate that factors such as IT infrastructure, managerial capability, absorptive capacity and environmental uncertainty significantly influence RFID assimilation.
