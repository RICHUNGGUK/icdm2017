For certain types of nonlinearities we provide explicit analytical solutions. These solutions are used to show that conventional unconditionally monotone finite volume schemes have only first-order accuracy. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the monotonicity of finite volume discretizations and use these conditions to construct a monotone finite volume discretization accurate to second-order.
