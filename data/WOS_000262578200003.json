Two main effects were studied: the size of the ring and the inclusion of oxygen atoms in the ring. In these complexes the C=O and H-X participating bonds in the hydrogen-bond are elongated, while others bonds are compressed. The calculated vibrational spectra were interpreted and band assignments were reported. Surface potential energy calculations are carried out with scanning HCl and HF near oxygen atom.", "paper_title": "The effect of ring size on vibrational spectroscopy and hydrogen bonding properties for the complexes between small ring carbonyl compounds with HF and HCl: Theoretical analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000262578200003"}
