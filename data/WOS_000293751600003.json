We focus on the cases when an edge between x and y is added with probability decaying with the Euclidean distance as vertical bar x-y vertical bar(-s+o(1)) when vertical bar x-y vertical bar -> infinity. For s is an element of (d, 2d) we show that the graph diameter for the graph reduced to a box of side L scales like (log L)(Delta+o(1)) where Delta(-1) := log(2)(2d/s). In particular, the diameter grows about as fast as the typical graph distance between two vertices at distance L. We also show that a ball of radius r in the intrinsic metric on the (infinite) graph will roughly coincide with a ball of radius exp{r(1/Delta+o(1))} in the Euclidean metric.
