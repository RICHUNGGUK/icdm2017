The Quantum Chemical Cluster Approach was used to obtain transition States of MAO B complexed with phenylethylamine (PEA), benzylamine (BA), and p-nitrobenzylamine (NBA). The choice of these amines relies on their importance to address MAO B catalytic mechanisms so as to help us to answer questions such as why BA is a better substrate than NBA or how para-substitution affects substrate's reactivity. Transition states were later validated by comparison with the experimental free energy barriers. From a theoretical point of view, and according to the our reported transition states, their calculated barriers and structural and orbital differences obtained by us among these compounds, we propose that good substrates such as BA and PEA might follow the hydride transfer pathway while poor substrates such as NBA prefer the polar nucleophilic mechanism, which might suggest that MAO B can act by both mechanisms. The low free energy barriers for BA and PEA reflect the preference that MAO B has for hydride transfer over the polar nucleophilic mechanism when catalyzing the oxidative deamination Of neurotransmitters.", "paper_title": "Revealing Monoamine Oxidase B Catalytic Mechanisms by Means of the Quantum Chemical Cluster Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000358821300008"}
