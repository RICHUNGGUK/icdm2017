This paper analyses the behavior of an oscillator in the presence of coupling between the oscillator and a power amplifier or antenna. Symbol switching in the modulator will cause frequency shifts in the oscillator at the modulation frequency. A new architecture for a 120 GHz quadrature frequency generator with large tuning range and immunity against PA-VCO coupling is presented. Combining the output signals of two independent oscillators, the pulling effect is removed and the frequency generator can be integrated with a PA and an antenna on the same chip. This architecture also makes quadrature generation with large tuning range feasible at 120 GHz. The chip is fabricated in a 45 nm CMOS technology and shows a tuning range of 16.2 GHz (13.5 ), a phase noise of 112 dBc/Hz @ 10 MHz offset and a phase error of 5 (Volkaerts et al. in: IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium (RFIC), 2013).", "paper_title": "A 120 GHz QVCO with 16.2 GHz tuning range resistent against VCO pulling in 45 nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000348435400001"}
