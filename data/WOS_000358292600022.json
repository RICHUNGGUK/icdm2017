It has received renewed attention in the past few years. Recently Conforti, Cornu,jols, Daniilidis, Lemar,chal, and Malick proposed a general framework for studying cut-generating functions. However, they gave an example showing that not all cuts can be produced by cut-generating functions in this framework. They conjectured a natural condition under which cut-generating functions might be sufficient. This note settles this open problem.", "paper_title": "Sufficiency of cut-generating functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000358292600022"}
