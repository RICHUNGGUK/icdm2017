In this paper, by extending the idea of the conjugate gradient least squares (CGLS) method, we construct an iterative method for solving a generalized inverse eigenvalue problem: minimizing vertical bar vertical bar X(T)AX - C vertical bar vertical bar where vertical bar vertical bar . vertical bar vertical bar is the Frobenius norm, X is an element of R(nxm) and C is an element of R(mxm) are given, and A is an element of R(nxn) is a M-symmetric matrix to be solved. Our algorithm produces a suitable A such that X(T)AX = C within finite iteration steps in the absence of roundoff errors, if such an A exists. We show that the algorithm is stable any case, and we give results of numerical experiments that support this claim. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
