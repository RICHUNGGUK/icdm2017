In contrast with a conventional limiting amplifier architecture, the PA is consisted of a voltage amplifier followed by a slicer. By means of the TIA and the PA codesign, the receiver front-end provides a -3-dB bandwidth of 7.86 GHz and a gain bandwidth product (GBW) of 248.5 THz-Omega. The tiny photocurrent received by the AFE is amplified to a differential voltage swing of 900 mVPP when driving 5042 output loads. The measured input sensitivity of the optical receiver is -13 dBm at a bit-error rate of 10(-12) with a 2(31) - 1 pseudorandom test pattern. The optical receiver AFE dissipates a total power of 199 mW from a 1.8-V supply, among which 35 mW is consumed by the output buffer. The chip size is 1300 mu m x 1796 mu m.", "paper_title": "A 90-dB Omega 10-Gb/s optical receiver analog front-end in a 0.18-mu m CMOS technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000245768100011"}
