The delay factor is assumed to be time-varying and belongs to a given interval, which means that the lower and upper bounds of the interval time-varying delays are available. Furthermore, the derivative of the time-varying delay function can be larger than one. With partial knowledge of the jump rates of the Markov process, a new delay-range-dependent bounded real lemma for the solvability of the jump system is obtained based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, which is in terms of strict linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). When these LMIs are feasible, an expression of a desired H-infinity filter is given. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed techniques.", "paper_title": "H-infinity filtering for nonlinear singular Markovian jumping systems with interval time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000296975800007"}
