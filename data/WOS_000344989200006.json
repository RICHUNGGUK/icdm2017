In network-wide virtualization, it is important to efficiently map a virtual infrastructure (VI) over a wide-area optical network and guarantee the survivability of such a VI against failures. In this paper, we study the regional failure-resilient VI mapping (RRVIM) problem, where a failure-dependent protection approach is used to enable efficient sharing of protection resources among different regional failure scenarios. We first formulate the minimum-cost RRVIM problem using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and then propose four heuristic algorithms to solve the problem. The efficiency of the MILP and the heuristics is compared via extensive simulation experiments under various performance metrics.", "paper_title": "Regional Failure-Resilient Virtual Infrastructure Mapping in a Federated Computing and Networking System", "paper_id": "WOS:000344989200006"}
