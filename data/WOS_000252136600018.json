In this paper, an immune-inspired incremental feature selection algorithm called ISFaiNET is proposed as a solution for mining data streams, immune network memory antibody set which is far less than the size of data streams is design as a sketch data set. We can get the change features to the most extent by this set. ISFaiNET have the ability of feature extraction of dynamically tracking increasing huge size information by introducing increment strategy such as window mechanism. The empirical results for our algorithm are presented and discussed which demonstrate acceptable accuracy coupled with efficiency in running time. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
