The objective of this study is to investigate how the changes of task requirement of a visual motor task are reflected by the changes of pupil size. In the present study, a simple continuous aiming task is performed and the task requirement is manipulated and measured by Fitts' Index of Difficulty (ID), calculated for different combinations of the target size and movement distance. Pupil response is recorded using a remote eye-tracker. The results show that event-triggered pupil dilations in continuous aiming movements respect Fitts' Law, such that higher task difficulty evokes higher peak pupil dilation and longer peak duration. These findings suggest that pupil diameter can be employed as a physiological indicator to task workload evoked by the task requirement in visual motor tasks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
