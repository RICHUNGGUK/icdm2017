We develop a model characterization and corresponding algorithms, for studying system diagnosability using a structural decomposition that avoids generating the full set of system analytical redundancy relations. Simultaneous application of integral and differential causal interpretations for differential constraints results in a mixed causality interpretation for the system. The added power of mixed causality is demonstrated using a Reverse Osmosis Subsystem from the Advanced Water Recovery System developed at the NASA Johnson Space Center. Finally, we summarize our work and provide a discussion of the advantages of mixed causality over just derivative or just integral causality.", "paper_title": "Diagnosability Analysis Considering Causal Interpretations for Differential Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000307893300015"}
