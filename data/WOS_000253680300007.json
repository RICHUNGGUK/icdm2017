It is fully analog in order to avoid analog-digital conversions and to limit chip size and power consumption. It is constituted by a single input, ten neurons in the hidden layer and a single output. The MLP-NN has been implemented in a 84 pins (0.6 mu m CMOS ASIC) and has a power consumption of 600 mW. The NN layout size is 1.8 mm x 0.7 mm. This paper reminds the design and the simulations of each implemented cell and details the different experimental tests achieved.", "paper_title": "Functional tests of a 0.6 mu m CMOS MLP analog neural network for fast on-board signal processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000253680300007"}
