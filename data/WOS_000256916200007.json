We decompose the potential into both inverse and classical moments and show that this method is a rapid and efficient way to calculate the extracellular field both near and far from the cell body. The action potential gives rise to a large quadrupole moment that contributes to the extracellular field up to distances of almost 1 cm. This method will serve as a starting point in connecting the microscopic generation of electric fields at the level of neurons to macroscopic observables such as the local field potential.", "paper_title": "Dynamic moment analysis of the extracellular electric field of a biologically realistic spiking neuron", "paper_id": "WOS:000256916200007"}
