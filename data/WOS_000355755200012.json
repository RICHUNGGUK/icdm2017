A genetic algorithms (GA)-based technique is proposed to deal with such uncertainty setting; this approach requires addressing three main issues: i) the representation of the uncertainty in the parameters and its propagation onto the fitness values; ii) the development of a ranking method to sort the obtained uncertain fitness values, in case of single-objective optimization; and iii) the definition of Pareto dominance, for multi-objective optimization problems. A known hybrid Monte Carlo-Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence method is used to address the first issue, whereas two novel approaches are developed for the second and third issues. For verification, a practical case study is considered concerning the optimization of maintenance for the nozzle system of a turbine in the Oil & Gas industry.", "paper_title": "Genetic Algorithms in the Framework of Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence for Maintenance Optimization Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000355755200012"}
