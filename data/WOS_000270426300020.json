The decomposing theorem of the sliding mode control systems is used to synthesis this system. Firstly, the stability problem for the reduced order sliding motion equations is studied and a sufficient condition of asymptotical stability for the sliding motion is derived. Then the sliding mode controller is designed to ensure that the state trajectory from any initial place reaches the sliding manifold in finite time. A simulation example is presented to illustrate effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "SLIDING MODE CONTROL FOR A CLASS OF PARABOLIC UNCERTAIN DISTRIBUTED PARAMETER SYSTEMS WITH TIME-VARYING DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000270426300020"}
