This fosters optimal resource usage and management allowing a plethora of potential applications such as secondary spectrum access, cognitive wireless backbones, cognitive machine-to-machine etc. The majority of overview works in the field of cognitive radio networks deal with the notions of observation and adaptations, which are not a distinguished cognitive radio networking aspect. Therefore, this paper provides insight into the mechanisms for obtaining and inferring knowledge that clearly set apart the cognitive radio networks from other wireless solutions.", "paper_title": "Learning and Reasoning in Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327250500011"}
