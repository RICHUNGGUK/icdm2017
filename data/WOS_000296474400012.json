In this work we compare rankings lists of universities captured by the first Italian evaluation exercise, through peer review, with the results of bibliometric simulations. The comparison shows the great differences between peer review and bibliometric rankings for excellence and productivity.", "paper_title": "National research assessment exercises: a comparison of peer review and bibliometrics rankings", "paper_id": "WOS:000296474400012"}
