This problem of element distortion in Lagrangian formulation of FEM can be resolved by using element erosion methodology. Element erosion approach is applied in the finite element program by defining failure parameters as a condition for element elimination. In this study strain parameters for both compression and tension at failure are used as failure criteria. Since no direct method exists to determine these values, a calibration approach is used to establish suitable failure strain values while performing numerical simulations of ogive-nose steel projectile penetration/perforation into concrete target. A range of erosion parameters is suggested and adopted in concrete penetration/perforation tests to validate the suggested values. Good agreement between the numerical and field data is observed.", "paper_title": "Numerical study on concrete penetration/perforation under high velocity impact by ogive-nose steel projectile", "paper_id": "WOS:000287054400008"}
