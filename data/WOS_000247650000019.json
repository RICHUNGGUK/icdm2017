Statistical knowledge about a large number of parts from many different objects is used to find a part correspondence between two previously unseen input shapes. No class membership information is required. The knowledge-based approach is shown to produce significantly better results than a classical metric distance approach. The potential role of part correspondence as a complement to geometric and structural comparisons is discussed. (c) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
