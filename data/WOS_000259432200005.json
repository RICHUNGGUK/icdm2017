They showed its satisfiability problem to be in 3-DEXPTIME. lWe improve this result by showing that satisfiability for this class is NEXPTIME-complete, using new resolution techniques. We show satisfiability to be DEXPTIME-complete if clauses are Horn, which is what is required for modeling cryptographic protocols. While translation to Horn clauses only gives a DEXPTIME upper bound for the secrecy problem for these protocols, we further show that this secrecy problem is actually DEXPTIME-complete.", "paper_title": "Flat and one-variable clauses: Complexity of verifying cryptographic protocols with single blind copying", "paper_id": "WOS:000259432200005"}
