In this paper we discuss a number of basic building blocks that allow for effective implementations of computational structures in those new paradigms, and analyze them in terms of area, delay, and energy consumption.", "paper_title": "An analysis of basic structures for effective computation in single electron tunneling technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000255345300007"}
