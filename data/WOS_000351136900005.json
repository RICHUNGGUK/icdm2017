The present paper presents a simple and complete solution of the spin-statistics problem on the basis of the \"conformal quantum geometrodynamics (CQG)\", a theory that was found to reproduce successfully all relevant processes of the SQM based on Dirac's or Schrodinger's equations, including Heisenberg's uncertainty relations and non-local Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations. When applied to a system made of many identical particles, an additional property of all elementary particles enters naturally into play: the \"intrinsic helicity\". This property, not considered in the SQM, determines the correct spin-statistics connection (SSC) observed in nature.", "paper_title": "The intrinsic helicity of elementary particles and the spin-statistic connection", "paper_id": "WOS:000351136900005"}
