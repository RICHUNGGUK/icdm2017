Human systems are modelled in terms of the competencies and capacities they can bring as potential occupants of work roles. Multiple dependent enterprise processes (used by a specific 'manufacturing enterprise') are also modelled. The process modelling enables separable groupings of activities to be identified and designated as required work roles, to which competency and capacity requirements are associated. By coherently modelling role requirements and potential role occupants, and at needed abstraction levels, the enhanced multi-process modelling approach (i) supports human system selection (from among candidates), (ii) enables the development and testing of simulation models (that predict relative cost and lead-time performance of alternative role occupants) and (iii) enables the generation of workflow models (that support the runtime management and control of work through specified process and human resource system configurations). The current paper illustrates the use of the developed approach and observed benefits in respect to (i) and (ii). An example application of the approach is described that concerns the human resourcing of a machine design and build process currently used by a vendor of automotive production lines.", "paper_title": "Predicting the performance of candidate human systems within specific work contexts", "paper_id": "WOS:000239182100001"}
