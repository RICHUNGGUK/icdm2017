Natural questions are, then, could we check whether a given TA enjoys these properties? These problems are not algorithmically solvable. Minimizing the \"resources\" of a TA (number of clocks or size of constants) are also unsolvable problems. In this paper we provide simple undecidability proofs using a \"constructive\" version of the problems where we require not just a yes/no answer, but also a \"witness\". Proofs are then simple reductions from the universality problem. Recent work of Finkel shows that the corresponding decision problems are also undecidable [O.
