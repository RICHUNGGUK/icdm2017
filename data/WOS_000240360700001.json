Given audio-visual content for which motion data is not available, motion may be automatically generated from multichannel audio, usually from a Low-Frequency Effects channel (LFE) such as that distributed on Digital Versatile Discs (DVDs). Alternatively, custom motion programs may be created to accompany multimedia content. This paper presents the results of a study designed to test the sense of realism, sense of presence, and global preference for multimedia playback in these two distinct cases of platform accompaniment: motion which has been generated automatically from audio, and motion which has been designed expressly for the purpose of stimulating appropriate haptic and vestibular sensations.", "paper_title": "Perception of audio-generated and custom motion programs in multimedia display of action-oriented DVD films", "paper_id": "WOS:000240360700001"}
