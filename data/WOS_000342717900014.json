The integration of cameras in consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones, tablets, etc. allows the adoption of new methods based on video streaming analysis by a mobile device video camera that can enhance two essential features for a successful navigation experience: localisation and orientation. These features are important in services such as life assistance, direct marketing or localisation. The proposed infrastructure is based on the integration of heterogeneous resources under the umbrella of the distributed object paradigm. Our ultimate goal is to provide an efficient implementation of multi-user indoor localisation and orientation services. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
