In accordance with these recommendations, the Evolvable Production Systems (EPS) has aimed at developing such technological solutions and support mechanisms. Since its inception in 2002 (Onori, M., 2002. In: ISR2002 - 33rd International Symposium on Robotics, Stockholm, 617-621) as a next generation of production systems, the concept is being further developed and tested to emerge as a production system paradigm. The essence of evolvability resides not only in the ability of system components to adapt to the changing conditions of operation but also to assist in the evolution of these components in time such that processes may become self-X, X standing for one or more desirable properties of a system subjected to a variable operation condition such as self-evolvable, self-reconfigurable, self-tuning, self-diagnosing, and so on. Characteristically, evolvable systems have distributed control and are composed of integrated intelligent modules. To assist the development and life cycle issues, comprehensive methodological framework is being developed. A concerted effort is being exerted through European research projects in collaboration with European manufacturers, technology/equipment suppliers and universities. After briefly stating the fundamental concepts of EPS, this article presents current developments and applications.", "paper_title": "Evolvable systems: an approach to self-X production", "paper_id": "WOS:000289716100012"}
