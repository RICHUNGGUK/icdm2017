Furthermore, with the K means of joint support vector clustering method to reduce the number of external stocks, a new multi-objective optimization algorithm KSVC-SPEA is proposed. Then, taking the multi-objective optimization of the overall performance of the HT160X1N high-speed injection molding machine as an example, the traditional linear weighting methods, Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) and the KSCV-SPEA are applied. Case studies show that the KSVC-SPEA is able to effectively achieve the multi-objective optimization design of the overall performance of injection molding machine with a high efficiency.", "paper_title": "MULTI-OBJECTIVE PERFORMANCE DESIGN OF INJECTION MOLDING MACHINE VIA A NEW MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000292626800027"}
