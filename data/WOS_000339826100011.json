We identify as code design criterion for finite lattice constellations a finite sum of inverse of algebraic norms, in fact the analogous for finite sums of the known criterion for infinite constellations, which motivates us to study totally real number fields with few elements of small norms, over which ideal lattices can be built to provide wiretap lattice codes. More precisely, we first narrow down our search to Abelian number fields known to provide reliable lattice codes, among which we look for no small inert primes and large regulators.", "paper_title": "Wiretap lattice codes from number fields with no small norm elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000339826100011"}
