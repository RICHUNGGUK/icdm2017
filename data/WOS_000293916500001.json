Nuclear safeguards experts of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) evaluate indicators by benefitting from several sources such as State declarations, on-site inspections, the IAEA databases, and other open sources. The IAEA expert evaluations are aggregated to make a final decision, which usually incomplete because of over 900 indicators, lack of expertise, and unavailability of information sources. In this study, a cumulative belief degree approach is introduced based on the belief structure. It is used to aggregate the incomplete expert evaluations that are represented with fuzzy linguistic terms. Moreover, a reliability index is employed to find the trustworthiness of the final result depending on the available evaluations. A numerical example illustrates the applicability of the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "A Cumulative Belief Degree-Based Approach for Missing Values in Nuclear Safeguards Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000293916500001"}
