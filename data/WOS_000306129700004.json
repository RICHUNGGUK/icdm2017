The objective of inventory control is to monitor the stock flow of merchandises in order to understand the operating profit and loss. A proper mechanism of inventory control could be made to help the profitability. As RFID is applied to inventory control, it can improve efficiency, enhance accuracy and achieve security. In this paper, we introduce the evolution of different mechanisms of inventory control with RFID system - counting method, collect-all method, and continuous monitoring method. As for improving the accuracy of inventory check during business hours, continuous monitoring is the solution. We introduce the infrastructure of the RFID inventory management system based on M2M architecture can make the inventory be efficiently monitored with instant warnings.", "paper_title": "On The Security of RFID-based Monitoring Mechanism for Retail Inventory Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000306129700004"}
