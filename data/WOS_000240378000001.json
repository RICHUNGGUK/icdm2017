The best way to manage the complexity and risk is to abstract and model them. This paper presents a new method of modeling Web-based Remote Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis Systems (WRMFDSs) with Unified Modeling Language (UML). A component framework model is put forward. A highly maintainable WRMFDS with three reusable component packages was developed using component-based programming. This paper, which studies a reusable WRMFDS model, aims at making such advanced information technologies be used widely in the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis domain, it can give developers a paradigm to accomplish the similar systems.", "paper_title": "Modeling a web-based remote monitoring and fault diagnosis system with UML and component technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000240378000001"}
