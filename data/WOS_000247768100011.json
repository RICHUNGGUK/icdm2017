The formulation of the FG element stiffness, buckling and natural frequency equations is presented. The first natural frequency and buckling load are determined for the simply supported plate with a central circular void. The void is then offset to three further locations to asses the applicability of FGFEA eigenvalue analysis at reduced symmetry. A correlation trend is formed by comparison with traditional FEA results at nine increasingly refined mesh densities for each example. In addition to this, a relationship between the FGFEA error and the boundary element intersection angle with the void is formed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. and Civil-Comp Ltd.
