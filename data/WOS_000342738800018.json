The WSFtMax problem under per base station transmit power constraint is known to be NP-hard, and the optimal solution is computationally very expensive. We propose two lesscomplex suboptimal convex approximated solutions which are based on sequential parametric convex approximation approach. We derive provably faster convergent iterative convex approximation techniques that locally optimize the weighted sum-rate function. Both the iterative solutions are found to converge to the local optimal solution within a few iterations compared to other well-known techniques. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "Convex Approximated Weighted Sum-Rate Maximization for Multicell Multiuser OFDM", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738800018"}
