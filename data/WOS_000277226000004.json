A related problem is the computability of an object. We present practical examples of a new way to address this problem. By giving an appropriate representation to our objects, based on a hierarchical coding of information, we exemplify how it is remarkably easy to compute complex objects. Our algorithmic complexity is related to the length of the class of objects, rather than to the length of the object.", "paper_title": "On Ultrametric Algorithmic Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000277226000004"}
