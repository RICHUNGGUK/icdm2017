For instance, we determine the maximum number of line shellings of a -polytope with facets when the shelling line contains a fixed point . If is the order polytope of a poset, then the sets of facets visible from a point involve a generalization of chromatic polynomials related to list colorings.", "paper_title": "Valid Orderings of Real Hyperplane Arrangements", "paper_id": "WOS:000353895400015"}
