This is the. first result to beat the standard Theta(lg n) bound for infinite precision models. As a consequence, we obtain the first o(n lg n) (randomized) algorithms for many fundamental problems in computational geometry for arbitrary integer input on the word RAM, including: constructing the convex hull of a three-dimensional (3D) point set, computing the Voronoi diagram or the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of a planar point set, triangulating a polygon with holes, and finding intersections among a set of line segments. Higher-dimensional extensions and applications are also discussed. Though computational geometry with bounded precision input has been investigated for a long time, improvements have been limited largely to problems of an orthogonal flavor. Our results surpass this long-standing limitation, answering, for example, a question of Willard (SODA'92).", "paper_title": "TRANSDICHOTOMOUS RESULTS IN COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY, I: POINT LOCATION IN SUBLOGARITHMIC TIME", "paper_id": "WOS:000268859000015"}
