Thismethod can support high concurrent interaction of clients and implement various tasks such as editing, querying, accessing and motion controlling. Some application experiments are performed to demonstrate its efficiency and soundness.", "paper_title": "ViWoSG: A distributed scene graph of ultramassive distributed virtual environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000264106500007"}
