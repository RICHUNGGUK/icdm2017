We prove that there is no percolation at the critical point. The same arguments are valid for a sandwich of thickness three with periodic boundary conditions. It remains an open problem to extend this result to other sandwiches. Note added in proof: This extension has recently been accomplished in arXiv 1401.7130. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
