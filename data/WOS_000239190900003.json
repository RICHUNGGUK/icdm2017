However, the applicability of this approach is quite limited, in the sense that a detailed knowledge of the system nonlinearities is required. In practice, most physical chaotic systems have inherent unknown nonlinearities, making real-time control of such chaotic systems still a very challenging area of research. In this paper, we propose using the recurrent high-order neural network for both identifying and controlling unknown chaotic systems, in which the feedback linearization technique is used in an adaptive manner. The global uniform boundedness of parameter estimation errors and the asymptotic stability of tracking errors are proved by the Lyapunov stability theory and the LaSalle-Yoshizawa theorem. In a systematic way, this method enables stabilization of chaotic motion to either a steady state or a desired trajectory. The effectiveness of the proposed adaptive control method is illustrated with computer simulations of a complex chaotic system. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
