The articles acquired from such literature were concentrated on the general analysis by scientific output, the research performances by countries, institutes, and collaborations, and the research trends by the frequency of author keywords, words in title, words in abstract, and keywords plus. Over the past years, there had been a notable growth trend in publication outputs, along with more participation and collaboration of countries and institutes. Research collaborative papers had shifted from the national inter-institutional to the international collaboration. Benzene, toluene, and formaldehyde were the three kinds of VOCs concerned mostly. Detection and removing, especially by adsorption and oxidation, of VOCs were to be the orientation of all VOCs research in the next few years.", "paper_title": "A bibliometric analysis of world volatile organic compounds research trends", "paper_id": "WOS:000276499500012"}
