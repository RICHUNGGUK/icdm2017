The TMD was installed on a 39-story, 184.6-m steel building located in Incheon, Korea with a monitoring system consisting of an anemometer, accelerometers, and internet-based data logging system. On September 2, 2010, the building experienced the Kompasu Typhoon, in which the peak wind speed, measured by an anemometer installed on the roof floor, was 49.7 m/s. To analyze the behavior of the building during the typhoon, the dynamic properties of building and TMD are identified from the measured responses. The modal wind load is then inversely estimated from the TMD and building accelerations using a Kalman filter, and the vibration reduction performance of the TMD is evaluated. The analysis results show that the typhoon-induced vibration was reduced significantly due to the installation of TMD.", "paper_title": "Performance Evaluation of TMD under Typhoon Using System Identification and Inverse Wind Load Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000304902800005"}
