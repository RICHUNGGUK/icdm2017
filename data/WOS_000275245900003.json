To begin with, a collaborative architecture including the user and the planner is described. Then, for real-time purposes, a motion planner divided into two steps is presented: firstly, a preliminary workspace discretization is carried out with no time limitations at the beginning of the simulation, secondly, using this computed data, a second algorithm tries to find a collision-free path in real-time. Once the path has been found, haptic artificial guidance on the path is provided to the user. The user can subsequently influence the planner by following-or choosing not to follow-the path and automatically order new path research. The performance of this haptic assistance is measured on tests based on an ALSTOM power component assembly simulation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
