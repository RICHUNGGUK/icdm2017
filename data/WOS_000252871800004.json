The analytical predictions are validated against detailed simulation experiments, and prove to be accurate and robust under a variety of operating conditions. The model also provides original insights into the impact on the network of long-tail flow length distributions, and allows the effectiveness of \"TCP pacing\" in reducing the traffic burstiness to be evaluated analytically. Our contribution is a performance evaluation methodology that could be usefully employed in network dimensioning and engineering. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
