There are three indices of FMEA in this work: the occurrence (0) that can be learned from the testing report; the likelihood of being detected (D) that refers to the difficulty of detection: and severity (S) that can be quantified from the declaration statement and the frequency of green component used by project. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) was applied to determine the relative weightings of four factors, then a green component risk priority number (GC-RPN) can be calculated for each one of the components, which are provided by the suppliers to identify and manage the risks that may be derived from them. Numerical results indicated that through the use of the proposed approach, the detected rate of the high risk green components can at least be improved to 20% while the CC-RPN is above 7, and the highest risk green components can be increased by 46.2% within the CC-RPN between 9 and 10.
