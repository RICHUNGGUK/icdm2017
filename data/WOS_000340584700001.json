In this paper, a review of a variety of supervised neural networks with online learning capabilities is presented. Specifically, we focus on articles published in main indexed journals in the past 10 years (2003-2013). We examine a number of key neural network architectures, which include feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, fuzzy neural networks, and other related networks. How the online learning methodologies are incorporated into these networks is exemplified, and how they are applied to solving problems in different domains is highlighted. A summary of the review that covers different network architectures and their applications is presented.", "paper_title": "A review of online learning in supervised neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000340584700001"}
