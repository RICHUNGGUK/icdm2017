Some of the main advantages of these maps are final compactness and expressivity, aspects that make storage easier and simplify higher level reasoning. Most existing approaches, however, stick to low level features such as points, segments and sometimes circles, corners or splines. This paper presents the incorporation of rectangles as higher level features in a feature based graph Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) framework for the consideration of the structure of the environment in the mapping process.
