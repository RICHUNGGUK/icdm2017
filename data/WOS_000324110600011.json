In the proposed method, invasive weed optimization (IWO), which possesses the characteristics of adaptation required in memetic algorithm, is firstly considered as a local refinement procedure to adaptively exploit local regions around solutions with high fitness. On the other hand, differential evolution (DE) is introduced as the global search model to explore more promising global area. To accommodate the hybrid method with the task of constrained optimization, an adaptive weighted sum fitness assignment and polynomial distribution are adopted for the reproduction and the local dispersal process of IWO, respectively. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach are tested on 13 well-known benchmark test functions. Besides, our proposed IWO_DE is applied to four well-known engineering optimization problems. Experimental results suggest that IWO_DE can successfully achieve optimal results and is very competitive compared with other state-of-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "A novel memetic algorithm based on invasive weed optimization and differential evolution for constrained optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000324110600011"}
