In the course of this work, it is intended to show the practical application of some of the best multi-dimensional fusion research in the UK. This paper highlights the work done in the area of multi-spectral synthetic data generation, super-resolution, joint fusion and blind image restoration, multi-resolution target detection and identification and assessment measures for fusion. The paper also delves into the future aspirations of the work to look further at the use of hyper-spectral data and hyper-spectral fusion. The paper presents a wide work base in multi-dimensional fusion that is brought together through the use of common synthetic data, posing real-life problems faced in the theatre of war. Work done to date has produced practical pertinent research products with direct applicability to the problems posed.", "paper_title": "Applied multi-dimensional fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000250676500003"}
