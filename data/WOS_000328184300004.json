The model further supports transparent execution of designated tasks on heterogeneous platforms, including clusters of GPUs. This paper focuses on the methodology and tools that complements the programming model forming a consistent development environment with the objective of simplifying the live of application developers. The programming environment includes the tools TAREADOR and TEMANEJO, which have been designed specifically for StarSs. TAREADOR, a Valgrind-based tool, allows a top-down development approach by assisting the programmer in identifying tasks and their data-dependencies across all concurrency levels of an application. TEMANEJO is a graphical debugger supporting the programmer by visualizing the task dependency tree on one hand, but also allowing to manipulate task scheduling or dependencies. These tools are complemented with a set of performance analysis tools (Scalasca, Cube and Paraver) that enable to fine tune StarSs application. (C) 2013 Elsevier By.
