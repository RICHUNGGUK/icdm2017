As the number of cores and the capacity of on-chip memory increase, the Non-Uniform Cache Architecture (NUCA) becomes more attractive. Compared to 2D cases, 3D stacking provides more options for the design of on-chip memory due to numerous advantages, such as the extra layout dimension, low latency across layers, etc. On the other hand, 3D stacking aggravates the thermal problem due to the increase of power density. In this work, we first study the design of 3D-stacked set-associative L2 caches through managing the placement of cache ways. The evaluation results show that the placement and corresponding management of 3D cache ways have an impact on the performance of CMPs. Then, we show that the efficiency of thermal control is also related to the placement of cache ways. For caches implemented with different memory technologies, the placement and management of cache ways have different effects on power consumption and power distribution. Consequently, we propose techniques to improve the efficiency of thermal control for different memory technologies. The evaluation results show the trade-off between performance and thermal control efficiency.", "paper_title": "Performance/Thermal-Aware Design of 3D-Stacked L2 Caches for CMPs", "paper_id": "WOS:000303104000003"}
