This is particularly true as it refers to the efficiency of ligands per unit size (i.e., binding affinity/ number of non-hydrogen atoms or binding affinity/MW). The use of the Ligand Efficiency Indices (LEIs) as variables for a Cartesian mapping of chemico-biological space, the concept of AtlasCBS, has been presented in a recent publi-cation with some initial drug-discovery applications. In this communication, we present additional applications of the concept in three domains of drug discovery: i) analyze and compare the content of databases: inhibitors vs. drugs; ii) polypharmacology; and iii) applications to Fragment-Based strategies. We suggest that the combined use of LEIs in a Cartesian representation of Chemico-Biological Space (AtlasCBS) could be a useful tool in various aspects of drugdiscovery in the future.", "paper_title": "Ligand Efficiency Indices (LEIs): More than a Simple Efficiency Yardstick", "paper_id": "WOS:000288861600005"}
