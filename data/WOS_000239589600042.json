We consider an application in financial portfolio management where we can train a controller to directly optimize a Sharpe Ratio (or other risk-averse non-additive) utility function. We illustrate the approach by demonstrating experimental results using a kernel-based controller architecture that would not normally be considered in traditional reinforcement learning or approximate dynamic programming.", "paper_title": "The K best-paths approach to approximate dynamic programming with application to portfolio optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000239589600042"}
