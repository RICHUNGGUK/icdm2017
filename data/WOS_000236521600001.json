SS is applicable to any instance of bin packing in which the bin capacity B and item sizes s(a) are integral (or can be scaled to be so), and runs in time 0(n B). It performs remarkably well from an average case point of view: For any discrete distribution in which the optimal expected waste is sublinear, SS also has sublinear expected waste. For any discrete distribution where the optimal expected waste is bounded, SS has expected waste at most 0 (log 11). We also discuss several interesting variants on SS, including a randomized 0(nB log B)-time online algorithm SS* whose expected behavior is essentially optimal for all discrete distributions. Algorithm SS* depends on a new linear-programming-based pseudopolynomial-time algorithm for solving the NP-hard problem of determining, given a discrete distribution F, just what is the growth rate for the optimal expected waste.", "paper_title": "On the sum-of-squares algorithm for bin packing", "paper_id": "WOS:000236521600001"}
