This paper introduces a discriminative classification algorithm for semi-automated segmentation of brain tumorous tissues. The classifier uses interactive hints to obtain models to classify normal and tumor tissues. A non-parametric Bayesian Gaussian random field in the semi-supervised mode is implemented. Our approach uses both labeled data and a subset of unlabeled data sampling from 2D/3D images for training the model. Fast algorithm is also developed. Experiments show that our approach produces satisfactory segmentation results comparing to the manually labeled results by experts.", "paper_title": "Semi-supervised discriminative classification with application to tumorous tissues segmentation of MR brain images", "paper_id": "WOS:000263674200001"}
