The condition under which the self-assembled monolayer forms is examined. The properties of the well-ordered structures, including the packing patterns, the equilibrium distances between two neighboring chains, and the tilt angles, are calculated to characterize the structure of the self-assembled monolayer. The results are comparable with those obtained experimentally.", "paper_title": "Self-assembled monolayers of oligosilane on the silicon (001) surface: molecular dynamics simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000289531300010"}
