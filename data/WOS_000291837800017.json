The main contributions of this work to learning machines are twofold. One is that we develop an algorithm for calculating the label confidence value of each training sample. Thus, the label confidence values of all of the training samples can be considered in training support vector machines. The other one is that we propose a method for incorporating the label confidence value of each training sample into learning and derive the corresponding quadratic programming problems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SVMACs, a series of experiments are performed on three benchmarking pattern classification problems and a challenging gender classification problem. Experimental results show that the generalization performance of our SVMACs is superior to that of traditional SVMs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
