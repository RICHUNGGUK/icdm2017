Several linear layout problems that are NP-hard on general graphs are solvable in polynomial time on interval graphs. We prove that, quite surprisingly, optimal linear arrangement of interval graphs is NP-hard. The same result holds for permutation graphs. We present a lower bound and a simple and fast 2-approximation algorithm based on any interval model of the input graph.", "paper_title": "Optimal linear arrangement of interval graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000240271700024"}
