The dynamics of the free surface is treated through the mass and momentum fluxes across the interface cells. A bounce-back boundary condition is utilized to model the contact between the fluid and the moving object. The method is implemented for the analysis of a two-dimensional flow physics produced by a symmetric wedge entering vertically a weakly-compressible fluid at a constant velocity. The method is used to predict the wetted length, the height of water pile-up, the pressure distribution and the overall force on the wedge. The accuracy of the numerical results is demonstrated through comparisons with data reported in the literature.", "paper_title": "Lattice Boltzmann modeling of water entry problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000347229100013"}
