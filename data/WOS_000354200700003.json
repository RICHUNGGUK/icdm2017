Secure obfuscation for several particular function families has been raised out despite the general impossibility result presented by Barak et al. Re-encryption function is a useful primitive, which transforms ciphertexts for one party into ciphertexts under another party's public key. Hohenberger et al. constructed a special re-encryption function and securely obfuscated it in TCC'07, and the security is based on classical hardness assumption. In this paper, we construct a new re-encryption function and securely obfuscate it based on the standard learning with error (LWE) assumption. LWE is proved to be reducible to standard lattice problems, which are conjectured immune to quantum cryptanalysis or post-quantum'. Besides, we discuss about the relations between these two cryptographic primitives in detail: proxy re-encryption and obfuscation for re-encryption functions.
