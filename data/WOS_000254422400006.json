Specifically, focus is given to particular forms of the stochastic conditional duration (SCD) model and the stochastic volatility (SV) model, with four alternative parameterisations of each model considered. A controlled experiment using simulated data reveals that relationships exist between the simulation efficiency of the MCMC sampler, the magnitudes of the population parameters and the particular parameterisation of the state space model. Results of an empirical analysis of two separate transaction data sets for the SCD model, as well as equity and exchange rate data sets for the SV model, are also reported. Both the simulation and empirical results reveal that substantial gains in simulation efficiency can be obtained from simple reparameterisations of both types of non-Gaussian state space models.
