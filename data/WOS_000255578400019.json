An unsupervised methodology based on the self-organizing map of Kohonen is developed. The methodology is described and applied to a cross-ply glass-fibre/polyester laminate submitted to a tensile test. Six different AE waveforms were identified. Hence, the damage sequence has been identified from the modal nature of the AE waves. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
