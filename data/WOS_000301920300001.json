However, in the process of RSC, there always are many uncertain factors influencing the dynamics of RSC, which makes the manufacturing task impossible to be completed efficiently and with high quality. In order to deal with the resulting failures of RSC due to these dynamic changes, this article presented the concept of RSC flexibility as well as the idea of RSC optimal-selection based on flexibility, which can enable RSC to adapt to the dynamic changes. First, the related factors affecting the life-cycle of RSC were analysed, and the definition and classification of RSC flexibility were investigated. Then, the quantitative measuring method of RSC flexibility was investigated, which can establish the perfect evaluation system of RSC flexibility and to achieve the RSC optimal-selection based on flexibility. Meantime, several case studies were presented to illustrate the proposed measurement method. Finally, the significance and effectiveness to put forward the RSC flexibility were tested through simulation experiments.", "paper_title": "Research on measurement method of resource service composition flexibility in service-oriented manufacturing system", "paper_id": "WOS:000301920300001"}
