A previously validated biomechanical model of the hand has been used. The equilibrium of the grasped object was added to the model through the consideration of a soft contact model. A grasping posture generation algorithm was also incorporated into the model. All the geometry was represented using a spherical extension of polytopes (s-topes) for efficient collision detection. The model was used to simulate an experiment in which a subject was asked to grasp two cylinders of different diameters and weights. Different objective functions were checked to solve the indeterminate problem. The normal finger forces estimated by the model were compared to those experimentally measured. The popular objective function sum of the squared muscle stresses was shown not suitable for the grasping simulation, requiring at least being complemented by task-dependent grasp quality measures.", "paper_title": "Grasp modelling with a biomechanical model of the hand", "paper_id": "WOS:000329199700001"}
