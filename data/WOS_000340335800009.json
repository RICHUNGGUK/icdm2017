The aim is to recover both the impedance function and the scatterer simultaneously. Based on boundary integral equations, our method splits the inverse problem into a well-posed direct problem followed by a smaller ill-posed problem which has advantages both in understanding the inverse problem and in the numerical reconstructions.
