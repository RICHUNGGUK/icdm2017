It would be useful to retrieve these new findings from literature. The aim of this work is to investigate if using verbs in MEDLINE queries can improve the retrieval of findings. Verbs used in the field of findings were selected: 'to show' (an examination shows a finding) and 'to confirm' (a finding confirms a diagnosis). For each of these verbs, semantically close verbs were researched on the WordNet website. Then, the extent to which adding these verbs to a query about various radiological pathologies can improve findings retrieval in Medline citations was studied. This method has been tested on two sets of MEDLINE citations regarding the diagnostic imaging of musculo- skeletal disorders. Using appropriate verbs in Medline queries enhances the precision from 53% to 61% and from 53% to 74%, respectively, in our first and second test set. A recall of 74% and 83% was reached in our two experiments. Using relevant verbs can be a rather simple way to improve the retrieval of findings related to diseases and diagnostic procedures from Medline citations.", "paper_title": "The value of using verbs in Medline searches", "paper_id": "WOS:000248007000004"}
