It adapts to the user in terms of route calculation, instructions delivery, and interface design. To do so, the system divides the calculated route into atomic instructions and uses street-level photographs at the decision points. To evaluate this approach, we compared it with a commercial navigation application on a field trial with a sample of users (N = 18). From the evaluation, we concluded that our system improves users' performance in terms of the number who reached the destination and were able to identify it correctly.", "paper_title": "An Adapted Wayfinding System for Pedestrians with Cognitive Disabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000363633300001"}
