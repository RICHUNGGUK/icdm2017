Design/methodology/approach - A finite element procedure, based on the d- and q-axis model of the induction motor is adopted. Findings - Such a procedure is well suited to analyse IM with anisotropic rotor, where an intentionally created saliency is introduced in the rotor bar geometry, so as to detect the IM rotor position without sensor. Originality/value - The proposed procedure allows one to evaluate the sensorless control capability of the IM. It will be useful for both analysis of the IM performance and design of the machine itself.", "paper_title": "Finite element estimation of induction motor parameters for sensorless applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000300535100014"}
