It is based on a Geographical Positioning System to register virtual information on real space. Layar platform, for mobile devices, was used to visualize 3D models, which are linked to virtual information channels through a database and geo-located in their real position. The basis of this proposal is students' innate affinity with friendly digital devices such as smart phones or tablets. Educational content visualization in real environments was found to help students to evaluate and share their own-generated architectural proposals and improve their spatial skills. The suggested method aims to improve access to 3D multimedia content on mobile devices and adapt it to all types of users and content. In addition, a usability analysis was carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this technology in educational settings.", "paper_title": "Geo-located teaching using handheld augmented reality: good practices to improve the motivation and qualifications of architecture students", "paper_id": "WOS:000358382200005"}
