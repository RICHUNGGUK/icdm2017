To solve these challenges, we propose the Role-Based P2P model, in which the role notion is functioned as the bridge component between users and resources to enforce secure resource dissemination together with relative constraints. The property rights attached to resource and user's private identity information are both protected as promise by taking each local role as a permission set in local centralized network and each global role as a user's pseudonym in global decentralized network. Furthermore, we propose the access control algorithm to describe how to handle access requests by the role policy in the role-based hybrid P2P model. In addition, we illustrate the intra and inter access schemas as two kinds of access processes. The model is feasible as its role structure and the connection with user and resource in open environment are consistent with the application objectives. The model is extensible, as the role structure can be also available for Purpose-Based Privacy Protection technologies.", "paper_title": "Role-based peer-to-peer model: Capture global pseudonymity for privacy protection", "paper_id": "WOS:000239658700017"}
