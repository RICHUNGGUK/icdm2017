We use Shrink-wrap algorithm to quantify the attainable region (AR) of non-isothermal reactor networks for the first time. The algorithm is applicable to both constant density fluid (CDF) and variable density fluid (VDF) reactor networks. One advance of the algorithm is that it can assess different energy utilization options. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on a case study involving a multi pi e-reaction scheme.
