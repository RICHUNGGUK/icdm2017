With the development of fast sequencing techniques, large-scale DNA molecules are investigated with respect to the relative order of genes in them. Contrary to the traditional alignment approach, genome rearrangements are based on comparison of gene orders. Recently, it became a topic capturing wide attention. In this paper, we cover many kinds of rearrangement events such as reversal, transposition, translocation, fussion, fission, and so on. Different types of distances between genomes or chromosomes are discussed. A variety of mathematic models are included.", "paper_title": "Algorithmic approaches for genome rearrangement: A review", "paper_id": "WOS:000240009600003"}
