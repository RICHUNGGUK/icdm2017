Such network is formed by (1) a set of local ontology networks that are language dependent, in which each network represents the local and particular view that each ES has of the employment market; and (2) a reference ontology network developed in English that represents a standardized and agreed upon terminology of the European employment market. In this network each local ontology network is aligned with the reference ontology network so that search queries. CVs, and job offers can be mediated through these alignments from any ES. The development of the ontologies has followed the methodological guidelines issued by the NeOn Methodology and is focused mainly on scenarios that involve reusing and re-engineering knowledge resources already agreed upon by employment experts and standardization bodies. This paper explains how these methodological guidelines have been applied for building e-employment ontologies. In addition, it shows that the approach to building ontologies by reusing and re-engineering agreed upon non-ontological resources speeds the ontology development, reduces development costs, and retrieves knowledge already agreed upon by a community of people in a more formal representation.
