Since there exist some problems of uncertain data in many actual forecasting problem, the input variables are described as fuzzy numbers by fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. To solve the shortage of c-insensitive loss function for hybrid noises such as singularity points, biggish magnitude noises and Gaussian noises, a novel robust loss function is proposed in this paper. Then by the integration of the triangular fuzzy theory, v-SVC and robust loss function theory, fuzzy robust v-SVC (FRv-SVM) which can penalize those hybrid noises is proposed. To seek the optimal parameters of FRv-SVC, genetic algorithm is also proposed to optimize the unknown parameters of FRv-SVC. The results of the application in fuzzy car assembly line system diagnosis confirm the feasibility and the validity of the FRv-SVC model. Compared with other SVC methods, FRv-SVC method has better classifier precison for small sample with hybrid noises. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
