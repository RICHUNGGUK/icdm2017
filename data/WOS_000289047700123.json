First some operational laws, score function and accuracy function of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are defined, and based on these, a method for ranking interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers is presented, then an optimization model based on the minimizing deviation method, by which the attribute weights can be determined, is established, so an approach for decision making with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information is developed, finally these are applied to practical reservoir operation and the optimal scheme is obtained. This case study shows that the model and corresponding method are scientific and practical. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
