Basically, an efficient buffer manager should be built in a proxy server to cache frequently accessed documents in the buffer, thereby achieving better response time. In the paper, we developed an access sequence miner to mine popular surfing 2-sequences with their conditional probabilities from the proxy log, and stored them in the rule table. Then, according to buffer contents and the rule table, a prediction-based buffer manager also developed here will make appropriate actions such as document caching, document prefetching, and even cache/prefetch buffer size adjusting to achieve better buffer utilization. Through the simulation, we found that our approach has much better performance than the other ones, in the quantitative measures such as hit ratios and byte hit ratios of accessed documents.
