The T-codes to which they applied this observation were specifically T-codes constructed by systematic T-augmentation, that is by T-augmentation sequences in which each T-expansion parameter is 1 (simple T-augmentation) and where the T-codes A((p1, p2, ... , Pi)) at each T-augmentation level i do not contain any codewords shorter than p(i) (strictly minimal T-augmentation). This present paper generalizes their result to arbitrary T-codes and formalizes their earlier result as a special case of the general result.", "paper_title": "On the generation of aperiodic and periodic necklaces via T-augmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000255560500009"}
