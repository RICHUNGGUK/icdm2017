These wall functions were implemented via tables for the turbulence quantities and the friction velocity u(tau). A special treatment for the epsilon and f boundary conditions is proposed. On fine grids (y(+) < 1) this approach yields results consistent with the wall integration solution. Detailed numerical results are presented for a zero pressure gradient boundary layer and separated flow over a ramp.
