As an example of our results, for c = 5, the code length becomes only 1500log(1/epsilon) bits while the conventional Tardos code requires 2500 log(1/epsilon) bits, where c is a security parameter. Furthermore our codes do not need a continuous distribution which is needed to construct the original Tardos codes. Our codes are based on a simple random variable drawn from a small set. It implies that it makes to implement and to perform a simulation extremely easier than the original one.", "paper_title": "A short random fingerprinting code against a small number of pirates", "paper_id": "WOS:000236107500019"}
