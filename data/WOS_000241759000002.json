First, a preprocessing step based on the T-test method is used to filter irrelevant and noisy genes. KPLS is then used to extract features with high information content. Finally, the extracted features are fed into a classifier. Experiments are performed on three benchmark datasets: breast cancer, ALL/AML leukemia and colon cancer. While using either the T-test method or KPLS does not yield satisfactory results, experimental results demonstrate that using these two together can significantly boost classification accuracy, and this simple combination can obtain state-of-the-art performance on all three datasets.", "paper_title": "Gene feature extraction using T-test statistics and kernel partial least squares", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000002"}
