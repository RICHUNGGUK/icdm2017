In this study, two 1,2,3,4tetrazines, furoxano-1,2,3,4-tetrazine-1,3,5-trioxide (FTTO-alpha) and furoxano-1,2,3,4-tetrazine-1,3,7-trioxide (FTTO-beta), were theoretically studied. The geometrical structures in gas phase were studied at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of density functional theory (DFT). The gas phase enthalpies of formation were calculated by the homodesmotic reaction method. The enthalpies of sublimation and solid phase enthalpies of formation were predicted with corrections of electrostatic potential method at the B3PW91/6-31G(d,p) level. The detonation properties were estimated with the Kamlet-Jacobs equations based on the predicted densities and enthalpies of formation in solid state. The available free space in the lattice was calculated to evaluate their stability. Calculations of potential energy surface and structure interconversion thermodynamics under different temperatures were carried out to further confirm their stability. FTTOs have better performance than HMX and FTDO but are easy to decompose to 5,6-dinitroso-v-tetrazine 1,3-dioxide. A synthesis route for FTTO-beta was proposed to provide a consideration for the further study. We believe FTTOs could be the key compounds to synthesize other v-tetrazines such as TTTO.", "paper_title": "Theoretical studies on vicinal-tetrazine compounds: furoxano-1,2,3,4-tetrazine-1,3,5-trioxide (FTTO-alpha) and furoxano-1,2,3,4-tetrazine-1,3,7-trioxide (FTTO-beta)", "paper_id": "WOS:000345626700006"}
