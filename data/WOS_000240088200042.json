Description and control upon these systems are of prominent significance. This paper is concerned with mining and construction of the established FMS from work event logs. A novel Petri nets based algorithm is developed to implement such an idea. When an FMS is mined and constructed, its corresponding Petri net is used to evaluate, analyze, and control the system. Theoretical and experimental results are illustrated to show the effectiveness and efficiency of this approach.", "paper_title": "Mining of flexible manufacturing system using work event logs and Petri nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200042"}
