In order to provide an efficient solution to these control problems, we propose a composite control scheme, which consists of a friction state observer, a RFNN approximator and an approximation error compensator with sliding mode control. In first, a sliding mode controller and friction state observer are designed to estimate the unknown internal state of the LuGre friction model. Next, a RFNN is developed to approximate an unknown lumped friction uncertainty. Finally, an adaptive error compensator is designed to compensate an approximation error of RFNN. Some simulations and experiments on the mechanical servo system composed of ball-screw and DC servo motor are executed. Their results give a satisfactory performance of the proposed control scheme.
