Five hits have been reported to inhibit the NCp7-viral nucleic acids interaction at micromolar concentrations. We used two computationally refined structures of NCp7 as receptors to propose a reliable binding pose for these compounds, by means of computational methods. Theoretical binding modes are in agreement with available experimental data. Results lay the foundations for a rationale development of more effective NCp7 inhibitors.", "paper_title": "Predicting the Binding Mode of Known NCp7 Inhibitors To Facilitate the Design of Novel Modulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000287685700024"}
