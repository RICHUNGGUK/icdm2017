In this paper we directly relate this approach to exponential multistep methods, a subclass of the increasingly popular class of exponential integrators. This natural, but new interpretation of rational multistep methods enables us to prove a convergence result of the same quality as for the exponential version. In particular, we consider schemes of rational Adams type based on A-acceptable Pad, approximations to the matrix exponential. A numerical example is also provided.", "paper_title": "Convergence of rational multistep methods of Adams-Pad, type", "paper_id": "WOS:000300850800002"}
