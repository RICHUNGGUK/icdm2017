Trace inclusion and equivalence give rise to asymmetrical and symmetrical linear distances, while simulation and bisimulation give rise to asymmetrical and symmetrical branching distances. We study the relationships among these distances and we provide a full logical characterization of the distances in terms of quantitative versions of LTL and mu-calculus. We show that, while trace inclusion (respectively, equivalence) coincides with simulation (respectively, bisimulation) for deterministic boolean transition systems, linear and branching distances do not coincide for deterministic metric transition systems. Finally, we provide algorithms for computing the distances over finite systems, together with a matching lower complexity bound.", "paper_title": "Linear and Branching System Metrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000264551600009"}
