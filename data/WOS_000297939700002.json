The measures are based on the difference between a quantum entropic quantity and the corresponding classical quantity obtained from measurements on the two systems. Three types of entropic quantities are used, and three different measurement strategies are applied to these quantities. Many of the resulting measures of non-classical correlations have been proposed previously. Properties of the various measures are explored, and results of evaluating the measures for two-qubit quantum states are presented.", "paper_title": "ENTROPIC MEASURES OF NON-CLASSICAL CORRELATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000297939700002"}
