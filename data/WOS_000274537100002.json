Forward body biasing and inverter-based circuit techniques were applied in the design of a feedforward Delta-Sigma A/D modulator operating with a 0.5 V supply. Transformer utilization is also presented as an inductor area reduction technique. In addition, application of stochastic resonance to A/D conversion is discussed as a future technology.", "paper_title": "Low-Voltage Wireless Analog CMOS Circuits toward 0.5 V Operation", "paper_id": "WOS:000274537100002"}
