Golyshev conjectured that for any smooth polytope P with dim(P)a parts per thousand currency sign5 the roots zaa\", of the Ehrhart polynomial for P have real part equal to -1/2. An elementary proof is given, and in each dimension the roots are described explicitly. We also present examples which demonstrate that this result cannot be extended to dimension six.", "paper_title": "Roots of Ehrhart Polynomials of Smooth Fano Polytopes", "paper_id": "WOS:000294011700007"}
