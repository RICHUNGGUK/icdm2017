Usually electrode impedance and stimulation currents required to elicit physiological responses mandates the use of large stimulation voltages, again dictating the use of high-voltage integrated circuit technologies. Power consumption in the stimulating circuits and associated supply generation circuits are the major contributors to overall system power dissipation. In this paper we present circuit design techniques that address power consumption in both stimulating circuits and power supply circuits. First, our power supply design approach is to recycle currents between the two low-voltage power supply needed for the stimulating circuits, whereby power consumption in these circuits can be close to halved. Second, our stimulating circuits design approach is to use very small quiescent currents, fast turn-on time and pre-stimulating dynamic calibration which allow the delivery of charge balanced bi-phasic stimulation pulses with very good power efficiency. A variation of this include passive charge recovery for further power reduction. In combination, significant implant power consumption reduction is achieved.", "paper_title": "POWER SAVING CIRCUIT DESIGN TECHNIQUES FOR IMPLANTABLE NEURO-STIMULATORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000312458700009"}
