Reducing the dimensionality of raw visual media data is desirable since high dimensionality degrades not only the effectiveness but also the efficiency of visual recognition algorithms. We present a comparative study on spatial interest pixels (SIPs), including eight-way (a novel SIP detector), Harris, and Lucas-Kanade, whose extraction is considered as an important step in reducing the dimensionality of visual media data. With extensive case studies, we have shown the usefulness of SIPs as low-level features of visual media data. A class-preserving dimension reduction algorithm (using GSVD) is applied to further reduce the dimension of feature vectors based on SIPs. The experiments showed its superiority over PCA.", "paper_title": "Spatial interest pixels (SIPs): useful low-level features of visual media data", "paper_id": "WOS:000240363400004"}
