However, there is still no comprehensive analytical model for HCCA. Therefore, novel modeling of pure HCCA based on the cyclic-service queueing system is provided in this paper. Our model is general enough to accept a wide range of schedulers and various types of traffic under the finite buffer policy. Via comparisons with simulations, high accuracy of the analytical model is exhibited. Furthermore, some valuable insights and recommendations on how to improve the HCCA performance are revealed by investigating the HCCA mode through the proposed model.", "paper_title": "Modeling the IEEE 802.11e HCCA mode", "paper_id": "WOS:000320891600015"}
