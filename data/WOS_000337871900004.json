Traditional pairwise similarity measure ignores the contextual information, and the Graph Transduction (GT) has been proposed as a contextual similarity learning algorithm to utilize the contextual information, which is embedded in a nearest neighbor graph. On main shortage of this method is that it is difficult to choose the optimal graph since different graphs may focus on different aspects of the objects. Co-Transduction (CT) is lately proposed by fusing two different graphs. In this paper, we generalize this problem by using the ensemble of many candidate graphs with different models and parameters for transduction, by assuming that the optimal graph could be obtained by the weighted linear ensemble of these candidate graphs. The similarities and graph weights are modeled within one unified objective function, and optimized alternately in an iterative algorithm. The new proposed algorithm, named as Ensemble Transduction (ET), is tested on two challenging tasks and the experimental results show that it can outperform both the GT and CT. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
