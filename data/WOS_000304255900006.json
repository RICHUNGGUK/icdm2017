Here, we show, through measurement of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal, that liver arterial and hepatic portal blood supplies can be modulated through hyperoxia exposure and by consumption of a standardized meal, respectively. As such, we suggest that hyperoxia modulates the hepatic arterial BOLD signal, whereas a controlled meal changes predominantly the hepatic portal BOLD signal. The hemodynamics of the dual liver blood supplies in response to the aforementioned challenges are complex and variable across subjects, making a general linear model-based analysis difficult. Therefore, we present the application of two local (at each voxel) hemodynamic response-independent techniquesprincipal component analysis and partial least squaresto observe the hypothesized reduction in BOLD contrast during cycles of hyperoxic breathing, when comparing preprandial versus postprandial states in a normally functioning liver. We illustrate the ability of our techniques to differentiate between healthy and diseased livers with an analysis of 17 subjects11 with normal livers and 6 with liver disease (hepatitis or cirrhosis). Our local analysis can correctly classify all of the subjects.
