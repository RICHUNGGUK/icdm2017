Although it can be measured at different levels (country, sector, organization.) this research focuses on productivity at the job level. The aim of this paper is to obtain an overview of the state of the art in productivity measurement in software engineering, including the inputs and outputs of the production process used for this measurement at the job level in the workplace. To do so, a systematic literature review protocol was adapted from literature review protocol standards, and subsequently carried out. The objective is to assess the current inputs and outputs present in the literature in order to create new productivity measures for software practitioners. This paper reveals that two different measures are used to assess software engineering professionals: traditional SLOC/Time and planning projects units per time unit.", "paper_title": "SOFTWARE ENGINEERING JOB PRODUCTIVITY - A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW", "paper_id": "WOS:000321584800006"}
