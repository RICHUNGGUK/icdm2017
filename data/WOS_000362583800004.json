This family is compared with the benchmarks obtained by Sok and LewiA\"ski (2011a), resulting the cost only slightly larger than the benchmarks, being its geometry simpler. Results taking into account horizontal forces which can be originated by the friction between foundation and ground or by active applied forces are also shown. Finally, an exploration of layouts resulting for solutions to this problem with few nodes is included.", "paper_title": "Near-optimal solutions for two point loads between two supports", "paper_id": "WOS:000362583800004"}
