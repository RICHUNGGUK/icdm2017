In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve the search efficiency and scalability of MANETs by clustering nodes based on trust mechanism. In our method, the trust relationship is formed by evaluating the level of trust using Bayesian statistic analysis, and clusters can be formed and maintained autonomously by nodes with only partial knowledge. Simulation results show that each node can form and join proper clusters based on their trust degree, and the cluster-based search algorithm with trust mechanism outperforms over those in current popular clustering models.
