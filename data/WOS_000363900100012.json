However, the latency and accuracy of automatic recognition remain as bottlenecks against its real-world usage. In this article, we introduce a novel framework that combines interactive image segmentation with multifeature fusion to achieve improved MLR with high accuracy. First, we propose an effective vector binarization method to reduce the memory usage of image descriptors extracted on-device, which maintains comparable recognition accuracy to the original descriptors. Second, we design a location-aware fusion algorithm that can fuse multiple visual features into a compact yet discriminative image descriptor to improve on-device efficiency. Third, a user-friendly interaction scheme is developed that enables interactive foreground/background segmentation to largely improve recognition accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for on-device MLR applications.", "paper_title": "On-Device Mobile Landmark Recognition Using Binarized Descriptor with Multifeature Fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000363900100012"}
