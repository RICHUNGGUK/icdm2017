The fully coupled formulation of incompressible viscous fluid flow interacting with a flexibly supported airfoil is considered. The flow is described by the incompressible system of Navier-Stokes equations, where large values of the Reynolds number are considered. The Navier-Stokes equations are spatially discretized by the finite element method and stabilized with a modification of the Galerkin Least Squares (GLS) method; cf. [T. Gelhard, G. Lube, M.A. Olshanskii, J.-H. Starcke, Stabilized finite element schemes with LBB-stable elements for incompressible flows, Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 177 (2005) 243-267]. The motion of the computational domain is treated with the aid of Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) method and the stabilizing terms are modified in a consistent way with the ALE formulation.
