By intentionally introducing a communication network that produces proper network-induced delays in the feedback control loop, a stable and satisfactory tracking control can be ensured for the T-S fuzzy system. Due to the presence of network-induced delays, the fuzzy system and the fuzzy tracking controller operate in an asynchronous way. Taking the asynchronous operation and network-induced delays into consideration, the network-based tracking control system is modeled as an asynchronous T-S fuzzy system with an interval time-varying delay. A new delay-dependent criterion for L-2-gain tracking performance is derived by using the deviation bounds of asynchronous normalized membership functions and a complete Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Applying a particle swarm optimization technique with the feasibility of the derived criterion, a novel design algorithm is presented to determine the minimum L-2-gain tracking performance and control gains simultaneously. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by performing network-based output tracking control of a Duffing-Van der Pol's oscillator.", "paper_title": "Network-Based Output Tracking Control for a Class of T-S Fuzzy Systems That Can Not Be Stabilized by Nondelayed Output Feedback Controllers", "paper_id": "WOS:000358213100011"}
