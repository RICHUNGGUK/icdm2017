More precisely, we present and discuss definitions of an abductive problem and an abductive solution in terms of an agent's information, that is, in terms of knowledge and beliefs. The discussion is then formalised by 'implementing' our definitions in a dynamic epistemic logic framework, where the properties of these definitions are studied, an epistemic action that represents the application of an abductive step is introduced, and an illustrative example is provided. A number of the most interesting properties of abductive reasoning (those highlighted by Peirce) are shown to be better modelled within this approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
