The nozzle used was a six-orifice microsac nozzle, with cylindrical holes, and therefore inclined to cavitate. The experimental results available for the validation purpose comprised measurements of mass flow rate and spray momentum flux, which correctly combined provide also fundamental information such as discharge coefficient, nozzle exit effective velocity and area contraction. The model was proved to be able of reproducing the experimental results with high degree of confidence and, through the exploration of the internal flow, allowed the explanation of widely reported experimental findings related to cavitation phenomena: the mass flow choking induced by cavitation and the increment of effective injection velocity.
