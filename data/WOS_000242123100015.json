The main focus of this paper is on context modeling to design a real-time face recognition system for ubiquitous computing. In this research, a real-time framework with the combining concepts of context-awareness and genetic algorithm referred as real-time genetic algorithm (RGA) is proposed that meets the characteristics of context model and developments of a ubiquitous application. This framework is implemented on a real-time environment and a recognizable success is notified.", "paper_title": "A context model for ubiquitous computing applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100015"}
