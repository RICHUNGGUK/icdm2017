We demonstrate that such a distance can be precisely and mathematically defined. Not only such a definition is possible, it is actually provably better than any other feasible definitions. Not only such an ultimate definition is possible, but also it can be conveniently and fruitfully applied to construct a QA system. We have built such a system - QUANTA. Extensive experiments are conducted to justify the new theory.", "paper_title": "New information distance measure and its application in question answering system", "paper_id": "WOS:000257809900005"}
