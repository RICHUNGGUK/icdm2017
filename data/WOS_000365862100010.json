This method uses as prototiles the set of rhombs with angles that are integer multiples of pi/n, and includes various special cases that have already been constructed by hand for low values of n. An example constructed by this method for n = 11 is exhibited; this is the first substitution tiling with elevenfold symmetry appearing in the literature.", "paper_title": "On substitution tilings of the plane with n-fold rotational symmetry", "paper_id": "WOS:000365862100010"}
