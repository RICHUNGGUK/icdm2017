When a particle hits the boundary, it immediately disappears and the boundary moves to the right by some fixed quantity (the particle size). We study the speed of the boundary movement (growth). Possible applications are dynamics of traffic jam growth, growth of a thrombus in a vessel, and epitaxy. Nontrivial mathematics concerns the correlation between particle dynamics and boundary growth.", "paper_title": "Accumulation on the boundary for a one-dimensional stochastic particle system", "paper_id": "WOS:000255782900006"}
