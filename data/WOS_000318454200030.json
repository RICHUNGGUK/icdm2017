Utilizing the full capacity of cover images by embedding one bit of data per pixel, using methods such as LSB flipping or LSB matching, usually decreases the security, making the algorithm vulnerable to steganalytic attacks. And then, it is proposed by an efficient high payload +/- 1 data embedding scheme(EPES) based on a special two variable binary function. This function uses the information of the least two significant bit planes of the cover image for the embedding and extraction purposes. Rather than randomly selecting +1 or -1, EPES achieves higher embedding efficiencies by choosing the correct modification component. The steganalytic method based on sample pair analysis (SPA) cannot effectively detect EPES. Hence, we propose a steganalysis by constructing adjacency pixel bits structure (SAP). The resulting detection algorithm is simple and fast. Analytical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides ;higher detecting efficiency than the other steganalysis.
