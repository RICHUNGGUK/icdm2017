The video registration is based on a RANSAC trajectory-to-trajectory matching, which estimates an affine transformation matrix that maximizes the overlapping of thermal and visible foreground pixels. Sensor fusion uses the aligned images to compute sum-rule silhouettes, and then constructs thermal-visible object models. Finally, multiple object tracking uses blobs constructed in sensor fusion to output the trajectories. Results demonstrate the advantage of our proposed framework in obtaining better results for both image registration and tracking than separate image registration and tracking methods.
