It is the underlying law of probability that constitutes the context of a source. A new Distributed Regression System is presented, which makes use of a discrete representation of the probability density functions (pdfs). Neighborhoods of similar datasets are detected by comparing their approximated pdfs. This information supports an ensemble-based approach, and the improvement of a second level unit, as it is the case in stacked generalization. Two synthetic and six real data sets are used to compare the proposed method with other state-of-the-art models. The obtained results are positive for most datasets.", "paper_title": "Discrete Neighborhood Representations and Modified Stacked Generalization Methods for Distributed Regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000358988900006"}
