The independent variables in the model are chemical compositions, initial austenite grain size, and cooling rate over the temperature range of the occurrence of phase transformations. For purpose of constructing these models, 114 different experimental data were gathered from the literature. The data used in the fuzzy logic model are arranged in a format of twelve input parameters that cover the chemical compositions, initial austenite grain size, and cooling rate, and output parameter which is Vickers microhardness. In this model, the training and testing results in the fuzzy logic systems have shown strong potential for prediction of effects of chemical compositions and heat treatments on hardness of microalloyed steels.", "paper_title": "Modeling hardness of Nb-microalloyed steels using fuzzy logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000320865100021"}
