High performance under this ultra-low supply is achieved by a feed-forward modulator architecture for reduced integrator swing, a special switched-capacitor-resistor feedback for less sensitivity to jitter noise, and a fast-settling fully differential amplifier. The synthesized modulator also has a high thermal-noise-limited SNR of 91 dB over a 20 kHz bandwidth. The 0.5-V fully-differential gate-input amplifier employs an adaptive common-mode feedback frequency compensation circuit, which leads to a robust modulator performance against process, supply voltage and temperature variations. Fabricated in a standard 0.13 mu m CMOS process, the modulator achieves a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 101.9 dB and a signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) of 90 dB (A-weighted) over a 20-kHz signal bandwidth, with the latter being very close to the thermal noise limit. The modulator operates over a supply range from 0.4 to 0.75 V and a temperature range from -20 to 90 degrees C.", "paper_title": "A 0.5-V 90-dB SNDR 102 dB-SFDR audio-band continuous-time delta-sigma modulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000302812400001"}
