Our representation of structure is derived from an image-space analysis of modal object deformation: projections of an object's resonant modes are recovered from the temporal spectra of optical flow in a video, and used as a basis for the image-space simulation of object dynamics. We describe how to extract this basis from video, and show that it can be used to create physically-plausible animations of objects without any knowledge of scene geometry or material properties.", "paper_title": "Image-Space Modal Bases for Plausible Manipulation of Objects in Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000363671200075"}
