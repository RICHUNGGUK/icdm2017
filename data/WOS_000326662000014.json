Here, we describe an automatic drusen segmentation method for SD-OCT retinal images, which leverages a priori knowledge of normal retinal morphology and anatomical features. The highly reflective and locally connected pixels located below the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) are used to generate a segmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer. The observed and expected contours of the RPE layer are obtained by interpolating and fitting the shape of the segmented RPE layer, respectively. The areas located between the interpolated and fitted RPE shapes (which have nonzero area when drusen occurs) are marked as drusen. To enhance drusen quantification, we also developed a novel method of retinal projection to generate an en face retinal image based on the RPE extraction, which improves the quality of drusen visualization over the current approach to producing retinal projections from SD-OCT images based on a summed-voxel projection (SVP), and it provides a means of obtaining quantitative features of drusen in the en face projection. Visualization of the segmented drusen is refined through several post-processing steps, drusen detection to eliminate false positive detections on consecutive slices, drusen refinement on a projection view of drusen, and drusen smoothing. Experimental evaluation results demonstrate that our method is effective for drusen segmentation. In a preliminary analysis of the potential clinical utility of our methods, quantitative drusen measurements, such as area and volume, can be correlated with the drusen progression in non-exudative AMD, suggesting that our approach may produce useful quantitative imaging biomarkers to follow this disease and predict patient outcome.
