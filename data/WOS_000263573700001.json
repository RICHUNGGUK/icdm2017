By adopting the addition theorem, the four kernels in the dual formulation are expanded into degenerate kernels that separate the field point and the source point. The source point matrices decomposed in the four influence matrices are similar to each other or only to some combinations. There are many zeros or the same influence coefficients in the field point matrices decomposed in the four influence matrices, which can avoid calculating the same terms repeatedly. The separable technique reduces the number of floating-point operations from O((N)(2)) to O(N log(a) (N)), where N is the number of elements and a is a small constant independent of N. Finally, the FMM is shown to reduce the CPU time and memory requirement, thus enabling us to apply boundary element method (BEM) to solve water scattering problems efficiently. Two-moment FM[M formulation was found to be sufficient for convergence in the singular equation. The results are compared well with those of conventional BEM and analytical solutions and show the accuracy and efficiency of the FMM.
