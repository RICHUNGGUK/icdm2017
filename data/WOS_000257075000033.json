To enable users to detect relations and patterns in terms of data associated with nodes and edges, we present a technique where this data plays a more central role. Nodes and edges are clustered based on associated data. Via direct manipulation users can interactively inspect and query the graph. Questions that can be answered include, \"which edge types are activated by specific node attributes?\" and, \"how and from where can I reach specific types of nodes?\" To validate our approach we contrast it with current practice. We also provide several examples where our method was used to study transition graphs that model real-world systems.", "paper_title": "Visual inspection of multivariate graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000257075000033"}
