The basic problems, SCAN and MULTIPLESCAN, aim to find all the occurrences of a given PWM or a set of PWMs in long sequences. Some other PWM tasks share a common NP-hard subproblem, SCOREDISTRIBUTION. The existing algorithms rely on the enumeration on a large set of scores or words, and they are mostly not suitable for parallelization. We propose a new algorithm, BUCKETSCOREDISTRIBUTION, that is both very efficient and suitable for parallelization. We bound the error induced by this algorithm. We realized a CPU prototype for SCAN, MULTIPLESCAN and BUCKETSCOREDISTRIBLITION with the CUDA libraries, and report for the different problems speed-ups larger than 10x on several Nvidia cards.
