This added structure opens new possibilites for various types of epistemic change that cannot be distinguished in traditional belief revision. In this article I use the so-called 'action model' approach known from the literature on dynamic epistemic logic to provide a unified framework in which we can reason about these various types of epistemic changes. I show how to model some natural examples of epistemic changes involving change of the research agenda in this framework. The action models give rise to a dynamic logic which is proven to be decidable.", "paper_title": "Modelling epistemic actions in interrogative belief revision", "paper_id": "WOS:000311670000004"}
