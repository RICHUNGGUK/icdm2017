This paper constitutes an introduction to the study of non-trivial simple sets in the framework of cubical 3-D complexes. A simple set has the property that the homotopy type of the object in which it lies is not changed when the set is removed. The main contribution of this paper is a characterisation of the non-trivial simple sets composed of exactly two voxels, such sets being called minimal simple pairs.", "paper_title": "Minimal simple pairs in the 3-D cubic grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000259439300002"}
