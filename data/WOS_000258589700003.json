The particularity of this model comes from the fact that the effect of each lag upon the present is considered separately and additively, so that the number of parameters required is drastically reduced. However, the efficiency for the MTD parameter estimations proposed up to date still remains problematic on account of the large number of constraints on the parameters. In this article, an iterative procedure, commonly known as expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, is developed cooperating with the principle of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate the MTD parameters. Some applications of modeling MTD show the proposed EM algorithm is easier to be used than the algorithm developed by Berchtold. Moreover, the EM estimations of parameters for high-order MTD models led on DNA sequences outperform the corresponding fully parametrized Markov chain in terms of Bayesian information criterion.", "paper_title": "An EM algorithm for estimation in the mixture transition distribution model", "paper_id": "WOS:000258589700003"}
