On the other hand, automated monitoring of a production process is necessary, not only for real time product quality assessment, but also for potential machinery malfunction diagnosis. For this reason, control chart pattern recognition (CCPR) methods have received a lot of attention over the last two decades. Current state-of-the-art control monitoring methodology includes K charts which are based on support vector machines (SVM). Although K charts have some profound benefits, their performance deteriorate when the learning examples for the normal class greatly outnumbers the ones for the abnormal class. Such problems are termed imbalanced and represent the vast majority of the real life control pattern classification problems. Original SVM demonstrate poor performance when applied directly to these problems. In this paper, we propose the use of weighted support vector machines (WSVM) for automated process monitoring and early fault diagnosis. We show the benefits of WSVM over traditional SVM, compare them under various fault scenarios. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in binary and multi-class environments for the most popular abnormal quality control patterns as well as a real application from wafer manufacturing industry.
