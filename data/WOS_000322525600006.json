Further, the software reconfiguration overhead incurred by loading corresponding device drivers into the kernel of an operating system has been overlooked until now. As a result, the enhancement of system performance and the utilization of reconfigurable hardware modules are still quite limited. This work proposes a virtualizable hardware/software design infrastructure (VDI) for dynamically partially reconfigurable systems. Besides the gate-level hardware virtualization provided by the partial reconfiguration technology, VDI supports the device-level hardware virtualization. In VDI, a reconfigurable hardware module can be virtualized such that it can be accessed efficiently by multiple applications in an interleaving way. A Hot-Plugin Connector (HPC) replaces the conventional device driver, such that it not only assists the device-level hardware virtualization but can also be reused across different hardware modules. To facilitate hardware/software communication and to enhance system scalability, the proposed VDI is realized as a hierarchical design framework. User-designed reconfigurable hardware modules can be easily integrated into VDI, and are then executed as hardware tasks in an operating system for reconfigurable systems (OS4RS). A dynamically partially reconfigurable network security system was designed using VDI, which demonstrated a higher utilization of reconfigurable hardware modules and a reduction by up to 12.83% of the processing time required by using the conventional method in a dynamically partially reconfigurable system.", "paper_title": "Virtualizable Hardware/Software Design Infrastructure for Dynamically Partially Reconfigurable Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000322525600006"}
