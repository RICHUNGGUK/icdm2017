A DES model represents the processes associated with a system of interest. Some models may be composed of submodels running in their own CSPs on different computers linked together over a communications network via distributed simulation software. The creation of a distributed simulation with CSPs is still complex and typically requires a partnership of problem owners, modelers, CSP vendors, and distributed simulation specialists. In an attempt to simplify this development and foster discussion between modelers and technologists, the SISO-STD-006-2010 Standard for COTS Simulation Package Interoperability Reference Models has been developed. The standard makes it possible to capture interoperability capabilities and requirements at a DES modeling level rather than a computing technical level. For example, it allows requirements for entity transfer between models to be clearly specified in DES terms (e. g. the relationship between departure and arrival simulation times and input element (queue, workstation, etc.), buffering rules, and entity priority, instead of using specialist technical terminology. This article explores the motivations for distributed simulation in this area, related work, and the rationale for the standard. The four Types of Interoperability Reference Model described in the standard are discussed and presented (A. Entity Transfer, B. Shared Resource, C. Shared Event, and D. Shared Data Structure). Case studies in healthcare and manufacturing are given to demonstrate how the standard is used in practice.", "paper_title": "Bridging The Gap: A Standards-Based Approach to OR/MS Distributed Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000311299500001"}
