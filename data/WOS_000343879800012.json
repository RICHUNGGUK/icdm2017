However, dynamics of the operating environment is one of the major challenges that impede RFID deployment. Even though numerous researchers focus on controlled laboratory experiments to enhance the success of deployment, it is found that system performance in the actual production environment may differ significantly from that conducted in a controlled laboratory, resulting in poor deployment result. To cope with this situation, this paper proposes an RFID Deployment Optimizer (RFIDDO), which is a generic methodology for optimizing the RFID configuration to provide objective, quantifiable data about the data capture performance of RFID readers for comparing and optimizing RFID applications in a scientific manner. A case study has also been conducted in a logistics company to demonstrate the implementation of RFIDDO and provide contextual details to help other firms in coping with the environmental dynamics in the journey of RFID deployment.", "paper_title": "A methodological approach to optimizing RFID deployment", "paper_id": "WOS:000343879800012"}
