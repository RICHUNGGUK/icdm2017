A straightforward and simple algorithm is presented here for finding all MPs before calculating the binary-state network reliability between the source node and the sink node (i.e., one-to-one reliability). It is based on the universal generating function method (UGFM) and a generalized composition operator. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is also analyzed. Finally, an example is given to illustrate how all MPs are generated using the proposed UGFM.", "paper_title": "A Simple Universal Generating Function Method to Search for All Minimal Paths in Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270947600010"}
