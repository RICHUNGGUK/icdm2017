We use the Spin (Simple Promela Interpreter) formal verification tool and the Promela (Process Meta-Language) language for the description of the model. If the model is prepared manually, we need an expert with the detailed knowledge of the system, specification language, and modelling language. This method is prone to the incorrect modelling of the system's properties due to the human error. Therefore, automatic generation of the model from the SDL specification is desired.
