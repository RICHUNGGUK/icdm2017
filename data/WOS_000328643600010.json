In this article, we argue that identifier/location separation can also help prevent distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. We discuss an identifier-to-locator mapping approach and explain how the approach makes it difficult for attackers to control botnets. We also present numerical results based on data from a real DDoS attack to demonstrate that, even if many zombies attack a victim, identifier/locator separation helps detect DDoS attacks.", "paper_title": "Preventing DDoS Attacks by Identifier/Locator Separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000328643600010"}
