Based on the observation that in networks with SRLGs, link protection frequently helps avoid over-long backup routes and traps, we propose a novel hybrid protection scheme, with the objective of combining the high-average capacity efficiency of shared-path protection with the fast recovery and simple trap avoidance of shared-link protection. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme steadily achieves lower blocking probabilities than both the shared-path and the shared-link protections, while the average protection-switching time is shortened as well. Meanwhile, the signaling and control procedures of the proposed scheme are kept with reasonable complexities.", "paper_title": "Hybrid protection in WDM networks with shared risk link groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000240902400006"}
