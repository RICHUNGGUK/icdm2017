Carol fixes a coloring of it balls with three colors. At each step, Paul chooses a pair of balls and asks Carol whether the balls have the same color. Carol truthfully answers yes or no. In the Plurality problem, Paul wants to find a ball with the most common color. In the Partition problem, Paul wants to partition the balls according to their colors. Paul's goal is to ask Carol the fewest number of questions to reach his goal. We find optimal probabilistic strategies for the Partition problem and the Plurality problem in the considered setting.
