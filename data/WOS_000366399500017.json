In this study, we propose a new algorithm for DT recognition based on group sparsity structure in conjunction with chaotic feature vector. Bag-of-words model is used to represent each video as a histogram of the chaotic feature vector, which is proposed to capture self-similarity property of the pixel intensity series. The recognition problem is then cast to a group sparsity model, which can be efficiently optimized through alternating direction method of multiplier algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method exhibited the best performance among several well-known DT modeling techniques.", "paper_title": "Chaotic Features for Dynamic Textures Recognition with Group Sparsity Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000366399500017"}
