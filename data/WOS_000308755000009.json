However, such a template loses temporal information in a gait sequence, which is critical to the performance of gait recognition. To address this issue, we develop a novel temporal template, named Chrono-Gait Image (CGI), in this paper. The proposed CGI template first extracts the contour in each gait frame, followed by encoding each of the gait contour images in the same gait sequence with a multichannel mapping function and compositing them to a single CGI. To make the templates robust to a complex surrounding environment, we also propose CGI-based real and synthetic temporal information preserving templates by using different gait periods and contour distortion techniques. Extensive experiments on three benchmark gait databases indicate that, compared with the recently published gait recognition approaches, our CGI-based temporal information preserving approach achieves competitive performance in gait recognition with robustness and efficiency.", "paper_title": "Human Identification Using Temporal Information Preserving Gait Template", "paper_id": "WOS:000308755000009"}
