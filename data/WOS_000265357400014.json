They also have the advantage of being self-supported. The disadvantage of this type of feed is its wide beamwidth. To solve this problem, a new hat feed is proposed that can be used as prime-focus feed for Fresnel zone plate antennas. The novel design, called parabolic hat feed is achieved by appropriate shaping of the hat feed profile. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
