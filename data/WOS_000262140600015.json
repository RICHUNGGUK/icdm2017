We address the problem of tracking axons across large distances in volumes acquired by serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM). Tracking, for this application, is defined as the segmentation of an axon that spans a volume using similar features between slices. This is a challenging problem due to the small cross-sectional size of axons and the low signal-to-noise ratio in our SBFSEM images. A carefully engineered algorithm using Kalman-snakes and optical flow computation is presented. Axon tracking is initialized with user clicks or automatically using the watershed segmentation algorithm, which identifies axon centers. Multiple axons are tracked from slice to slice through a volume, updating the positions and velocities in the model and providing constraints to maintain smoothness between slices. Validation results indicate that this algorithm can significantly speed up the task of manual axon tracking. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
