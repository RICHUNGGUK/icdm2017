Based on the graph theory, LaSalle's invariance principle and the homogeneity with dilation, the finite-time consensus protocol of each agent using local information is designed. The leader-following finite-time consensus is analysed in detail. Moreover, some examples and simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Finite-time consensus for leader-following second-order multi-agent system", "paper_id": "WOS:000314168000011"}
