Evolving graphs arise naturally in diverse applications such as computer network topologies, multiplayer games and medical imaging. A natural and interesting problem in evolving graph analysis is the discovery of compact subgraphs that change in a similar manner. Such subgraphs are known as regions of correlated change and they can both summarise change patterns in graphs and help identify the underlying events causing these changes. However, previous techniques for discovering regions of correlated change suffer from limited scalability, making them unsuitable for analysing the evolution of very large graphs. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm called ciForager, that addresses this scalability challenge and offers considerable improvements. The efficiency of ciForager is based on the use of new incremental techniques for detecting change, as well as the use of Voronoi representations for efficiently determining distance. We experimentally show that ciForager can achieve speedups of up to 1000 times over previous approaches. As a result, it becomes feasible for the first time to discover regions of correlated change in extremely large graphs, such as the entire BGP routing topology of the Internet.", "paper_title": "ciForager: Incrementally Discovering Regions of Correlated Change in Evolving Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000310560600002"}
