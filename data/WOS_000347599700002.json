Various techniques have been applied to both problems in a wide range of situations. In this article, a novel implementation of the processing techniques involved in copper heap leaching is presented. Specifically, the impact of the used numerical method and the selection of the parametric family are evaluated. From a methodological point of view, a global algorithm is proposed that integrates the solutions of both problems. Finally, our computational experiments are compared with previous experimental results from the Chilean copper mining industry and related works.
