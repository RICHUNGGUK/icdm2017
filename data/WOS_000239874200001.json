The main tool is the construction of a \"tangent complex\" for an arbitrary geometrical object, generalising the usual tangent bundle of a manifold. This framework can be used to develop algorithms for automatic feature location. We give several examples of applying such algorithms to geometric objects represented by point-cloud data sets.", "paper_title": "An algebraic topological method for feature identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000239874200001"}
