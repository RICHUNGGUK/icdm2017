Most staff functions are carried out using standard means of text communication. Exactly how members of staff perform their duties, who they communicate with and how, and how they could perform better, is an area of active research. In command and control research, there is not yet a single model which explains all actions undertaken by members of staff well enough to prescribe a set of procedures for how to perform functions in command and control. In this context, we have studied whether automated classification approaches can be applied to textual communication to assist researchers who study command teams and analyze their actions. Specifically, we report the results from evaluating machine leaning with respect to two metrics of classification performance: (1) the precision of finding a known transition between two activities in a work process, and (2) the precision of classifying messages similarly to human researchers that search for critical episodes in a workflow. The results indicate that classification based on text only provides higher precision results with respect to both metrics when compared to other machine learning approaches, and that the precision of classifying messages using text-based classification in already classified datasets was approximately 50%. We present the implications that these results have for the design of support systems based on machine learning, and outline how to practically use text classification for analyzing team communications by demonstrating a specific prototype support tool for workflow analysis.", "paper_title": "Message classification as a basis for studying command and control communications-an evaluation of machine learning approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000302240800001"}
