Accurate models of their performance are crucial to delivering storage infrastructures that meet given quality of service requirements. To this end, this paper presents a flexible fork-join queueing simulation model of RAID systems that are composed of zoned disk drives and which operate under RAID levels 01 or 5. The simulator takes as input I/O workloads that are heterogeneous in terms of request size and that exhibit burstiness, and its primary output metric is I/O request response time distribution. We also study the effects of heavy workload, taking into account the request-reordering optimizations employed by modern disk drives. All simulation results are validated against device measurements and compared with existing analytical queueing network models for the development of the models.", "paper_title": "Analytical and Simulation Modelling of Zoned RAID Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000290315200005"}
