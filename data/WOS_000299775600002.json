Many enterprises are assessing the potential of exploiting the commercial opportunities of this technology. Although social networking commercial activities may be the next big productivity booster for firms, some consider such activities to be time wasters and security traps. Therefore, it is useful to develop a framework to consolidate the issues in adopting this technology. This article reviews the opportunities provided by enterprise social networking and proposes using the fit-viability model to evaluate concerns related to the successful implementation of enterprise social networking. We also examine the major potential risks and the mechanisms for their management.", "paper_title": "ENTERPRISE SOCIAL NETWORKING: OPPORTUNITIES, ADOPTION, AND RISK MITIGATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000299775600002"}
