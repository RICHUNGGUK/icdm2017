Design/methodology/approach - This two-phase study explores users'reactions to DMB contents and services, users' perceptions on the pricing of DMB phone handsets, phone usage time, program contents, and DMB carrier services. Findings from the use of qualitative method of existential phenomenology were explored further with quantitative analyses including T-test, ANOVA, and Duncan test. Findings - The young generation will be a major impact on the DMB market due to their mindset and lifestyle. Thus, the DMB market strategy should be to base decisions on reaching out and focusing on the younger generation (especially, the teens) as the latest trendsetters. Research limitations/implications - The sample size was collected during the experimental/trial stages of satellite DMB services. This research should be continued to solidify findings with an increased sample size of respondents collected during the actual stage of satellite-DMB and terrestrial-DMB services. Practical implications - The findings from this exploratory research will be valuable for the DMB service and content providers to gain insight into various age groups and their perceptions. Originality/value - This study is the first kind of research in this area. With the study as a forerunner, the authors examined the effect of DMB mobile phone program contents and services on users.", "paper_title": "Empirical findings on the perceived use of digital multimedia broadcasting mobile phone services", "paper_id": "WOS:000237547900009"}
