The ability of these descriptors to measure size, shape and distribution of nanostructures was assessed on Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) micrographs of treated milk, in which fat was stained. Comparisons of scores obtained from automatic descriptors and visual observation showed that these methods generate similar groupings among milk treatments. The discriminative power of these descriptors was also proved by their ability to infer group classifications on testing images. In a two-group classification, success rates were 89% and 91.9%, whereas rejection ratios were lower than 7% for a probability threshold up to 75%. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
