Based on a metric-driven Discrete Voronoi Diagram construction, our output is an optimized 3D triangular mesh with a user-defined vertex budget. Our approach can deal with a wide range of applications, from high-quality mesh generation to shape approximation. By using appropriate metric constraints, the method generates isotropic or anisotropic elements. Based on point sampling, our algorithm combines the robustness and theoretical strength of Delaunay criteria with the efficiency of an entirely discrete geometry processing. Besides the general described framework, we show the experimental results using isotropic, quadric-enhanced isotropic, and anisotropic metrics, which prove the efficiency of our method on large meshes at a low computational cost.", "paper_title": "Generic remeshing of 3D triangular meshes with metric-dependent Discrete Voronoi Diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000252254200011"}
