We firstly derive the relationship between the projection on the viewing sphere of a space point and its catadioptric image. And then by the relationship we establish a group of linear constraints on the catadioptric parameters from the catadioptric projections of spatial lines. By using these linear constraints, any central catadioptric camera can be fully calibrated from a single view of three or more lines without prior knowledge on the camera. Extensive experiments show this algorithm can improve the calibration's robustness. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
