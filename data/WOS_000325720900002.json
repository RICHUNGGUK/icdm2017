In the general case of a semiorder defined on topological space, we find several necessary conditions for the continuous representability. These necessary conditions are not sufficient, in general. As a matter of fact, the analogous of the classical Debreu's lemma for the continuous representability of total preorders is no longer valid for semiorders. However, and in a positive direction, we show that if the set is finite those conditions are indeed sufficient. In particular, we characterize the continuous Scott-Suppes representability of semiorders defined on a finite set endowed with a topology.", "paper_title": "FURTHER RESULTS ON THE CONTINUOUS REPRESENTABILITY OF SEMIORDERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000325720900002"}
