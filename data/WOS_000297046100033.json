Then, we study the optimum lower bounds of these measures for permutations of an Abelian group. A construction of permutations, by modifying some permutation functions over finite fields, is given. Their ambiguity and deficiency is investigated; most of these functions are APN permutations. We show that, when they are not optimal, the Mobius function in the multiplicative group of F(q) is closer to being optimal in ambiguity than the inverse function in the additive group of. We note that the inverse function over F(28) is used in AES. Finally, we conclude that a twisted permutation polynomial of a finite field is again closer to being optimal in ambiguity than the APN function employed in the SAFER cryptosystem.", "paper_title": "Two New Measures for Permutations: Ambiguity and Deficiency", "paper_id": "WOS:000297046100033"}
