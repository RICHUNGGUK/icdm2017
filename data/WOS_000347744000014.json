The quasi-experimental method is introduced in order to examine the differences of the learning effectiveness between the MOODLE e-learning and the traditional teaching method. Through the computer-based statistical analysis, the result of this study shows that the integration of the MOODLE e-learning into elementary school's curriculum indeed help improve students' performance, as well as students with the MOODLE e-learning are more confident in self-studying and better understanding of the course contents.", "paper_title": "A Study of Investigating the Learning Effectiveness of Applying the MOODLE E-Learning in Taiwan's Elementary School", "paper_id": "WOS:000347744000014"}
