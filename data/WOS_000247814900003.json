This is followed by a detailed investigation of specified meet contraction, i.e. the operation divided by such that K divided by p = K similar to f(p), where similar to is full meet contraction and f is a function from sentences to sentences. A number of realistic examples of belief contraction are discussed, and it is shown how the properties of contraction differ according to how the sentence to be contracted is situated in the structure of the belief state. Some plausible properties of f are proposed, and it is shown how they correspond to properties of the contraction operator.", "paper_title": "Contraction based on sentential selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000247814900003"}
