In this paper the new canceller scheme, named as Double Window Cancellation and Combining (DWCC) is proposed. It includes the entire symbol interval, delayed by multipath as a signal processing window and intends to improve the performance by combining the double windows that can be formed by the pre- and post-ISI cancellation and reconstruction to the received OFDM symbol interfered by the multipath exceeding the guard interval. The proposed scheme has two algorithm structures of the DWCC-I and -II which are distinguished by the operational sequence (Symbol-wise or Group-wise) to the OFDM symbols of the received packet and by the selection of the processing window in the iterative decision feedback processing. Since the performance of the canceller is dependant on the equalization, particularly on the initial equalization, the proposed schemes operate with the time and frequency domain equalizer in the initial and the iterative symbol detection, respectively. For the verification of the proposed schemes, each scheme is evaluated in the turbo coded OFDM for low (QPSK) and high level modulation systems (16QAM, 64QAM), and compared with the conventional canceller with respect to the performance and computational complexity. As a result, the proposed schemes do not have an error floor even for 64QAM in a severe frequency selective channel.", "paper_title": "Double Window Cancellation and Combining tor OFDM in time-invariant large delay spread channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093800003"}
