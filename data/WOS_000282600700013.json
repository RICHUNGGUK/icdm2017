Many different variants of this model have been proposed. One of the most important models is known as tissue P systems with cell separation. This model has the ability of generating an exponential amount of workspace in linear time, thus it allows us to design cellular solutions to NP-complete problems in polynomial time. In this paper, we present a solution to the Vertex Cover problem via a family of such devices. This is the first solution to this problem in the framework of tissue P systems with cell separation.", "paper_title": "Solving Vertex Cover Problem by Means of Tissue P Systems with Cell Separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000282600700013"}
