The relevance of using evolutionary algorithms to these problems is then mentioned. These are followed by different approaches, along with their merits, for addressing some of the aforesaid tasks. Finally, some limitations of the current research activity are provided. An extensive bibliography is included.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary computation in bioinformatics: A review", "paper_id": "WOS:000240009600001"}
