The distances of the test fingerprint to the reference fingerprints are normalized by the corresponding mean values obtained from the reference set, to form a five-dimensional feature vector. This feature vector is then projected onto a one-dimensional Karhunen-Loeve space and then classified into one of the two classes (genuine or impostor). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
