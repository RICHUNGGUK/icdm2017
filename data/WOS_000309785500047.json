An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation method is described that exploits a normal variance-mean mixture representation of the error distribution with an inverse gamma distribution as the mixing distribution. The proposed method is illustrated using simulated data, daily S&P500 and TOPIX stock returns. The models for stock returns are compared based on the marginal likelihood in the empirical study. There is strong evidence in the stock returns high leverage and an asymmetric heavy-tailed distribution. Furthermore, a prior sensitivity analysis is conducted whether the results obtained are robust with respect to the choice of the priors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
