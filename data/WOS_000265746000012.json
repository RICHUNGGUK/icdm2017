We suggested that the collagen network surrounding the muscular fibers could account for these mechanical behaviors. To test this hypothesis we develop a model for large deformation response of active, incompressible, nonlinear elastic and transversely isotropic living soft tissue ( such as cardiac or arteries tissues) in which we include a coupling effect between the connective tissue and the muscular fibers. Then, a three-dimensional finite element formulation including this internal pseudo-active kinematic constraint is derived. Analytical and finite element solutions are in a very good agreement. The numerical results show this wall thickening effect with an order of magnitude compatible with the experimental observations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
