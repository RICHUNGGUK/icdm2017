Many solutions and projects are being developed and, among the large amount of used tools, semantics is called to play a paramount role. In order to overcome issues related to cooperation, interoperability and accessibility of services in the domain, semantics can be used to improve in-use solutions and to develop new mechanisms able to support the development of expert and intelligent systems in eGovernment. This paper addresses a semantic based philosophy to tackle a holistic platform for the domain taking into account the knowledge of the administrations. By means of intelligent documents and Life Events, as they are presented in the paper, it is possible to build up a intelligent platform to host eGovernment services, as proved by the successful study case Tecut portal.
