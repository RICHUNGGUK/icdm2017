Our SZ is an extension of the recently published BZ algorithm. BZ scans the so-called \"marriage table\" to optimize global satisfaction and equity over all couples. It still gets about 5% unstable results in average. After a case study that sorts blocking situations into 4 types, we explain here how to resolve unstability in forcing blocking pairs to marry wrt. their type. SZ is compared to BZ and Gale-Shapley on 40000 instances of a 200 persons large population. An example of stereo reconstruction by SZ is given for illustration.", "paper_title": "A stable marriages algorithm to optimize satisfaction and equity", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600038"}
