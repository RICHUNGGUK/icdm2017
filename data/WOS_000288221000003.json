We demonstrate this by way of three basic and frequent computations on shapes - convex hull, decomposition, and medial axis. In particular, we propose a novel medial axis algorithm that beats existing methods in simplicity and practicality, and at the same time guarantees convergence to the medial axis of the original shape.", "paper_title": "COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL ADVANTAGES OF CIRCULAR BOUNDARY REPRESENTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000288221000003"}
