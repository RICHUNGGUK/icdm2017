The series in named in honour of George Boole, the first professor of Mathematics at UCC, whose seminal work on logic in the mid-1800s is central to modern digital computing. To mark this great contribution, leaders in the field of computing and mathematics are invited to talk to the general public on directions in science, on past achievements and on visions for the future.", "paper_title": "The Boole Lecture - A very mathematical dilemma", "paper_id": "WOS:000238906600008"}
