An influential differential equation model for the activity of individual neurons in the preBotc yields transitions from quiescence to bursting to tonic spiking as a parameter is varied. Further, past work has established that bursting dynamics can arise from a pair of tonic model cells coupled with synaptic excitation. In this paper, we analytically derive one- and two-dimensional maps from the differential equations for a self-coupled neuron and a two-neuron network, respectively. Using a combination of analysis and simulations of these maps, we explore the possible forms of dynamics that the model networks can produce as well as which transitions between dynamic regimes are mathematically possible.", "paper_title": "First return maps for the dynamics of synaptically coupled conditional bursters", "paper_id": "WOS:000280065200001"}
