A topology preserving parametric B-spline-based representation of the deformation field is considered [12]. Topology preservation ensures that the transformation is a one-to-one mapping and consequently that it is invertible. Inverting such transformation fields amount to solving a system of nonlinear equations. To tackle this problem, we rely on interval analysis techniques. The proposed algorithm yields a solution whose accuracy is user-controlled. This method may be extended to any dense transformation field and also to deformations defined on a grid of point, by considering a projection in the space of topology preserving B-spline-based deformation fields. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated on transformation fields coming from intersubject brain registration.", "paper_title": "Accurate inversion of 3-D transformation fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000259372100019"}
