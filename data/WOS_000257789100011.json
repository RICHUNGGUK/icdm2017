Technically speaking, we replace the rule (Hyp): F epsilon Gamma/Gamma proves F (Hyp) with the rule (P-Hyp): F epsilon Gamma proves sigma.T/Gamma proves F (P-Hyp) with sigma denoting a substitution replacing all variables of Gamma with an example. This substitution is called the motivation of Gamma. These systems are in essence negationless. In the present article, we study the second-order propositional calculus, since it is the simplest non-trivial natural deduction system in which the negation is definable. Some pedagogical versions of the second-order propositional calculus are proposed. We argue that these pedagogical calculi are negationless and we study their expressive power.", "paper_title": "Pedagogical second-order propositional calculi", "paper_id": "WOS:000257789100011"}
