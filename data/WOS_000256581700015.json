Due to the nature of mesh routers (relay nodes), i.e., they are dedicated and have sufficient power supply, this game consists of only service requestors. Our main contributions in this paper are as follows: (1) We prove that there always exists a pure strategy Nash Equilibrium in the game and the optimal solution of our game is a Nash Equilibrium as well. (2) The price of anarchy is proved to be O(n(2)). (3) Furthermore, our heuristic algorithms are introduced to approach the equilibrium state in the sense of the optimal routing and channel assignment response of every requestor, while the decisions from other agents are fixed. To evaluate our scheme, substantial simulation results are presented and the conclusion is twofold: (1) Our proposal is not far from the optimal. (2) Even performance gains can be expected, as compared with off-the-shelf techniques. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
