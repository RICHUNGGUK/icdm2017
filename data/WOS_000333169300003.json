In 2002, the random projection algorithm was introduced to solve the challenging (15, 4)-motif finding problem by using randomly chosen templates. Two years later, a so-called uniform projection algorithm was developed to improve the random projection algorithm by means of low-dispersion sequences generated by coverings. In this article, we introduce an improved projection algorithm called the low-dispersion projection algorithm, which uses low-dispersion sequences generated by developed almost difference families. Compared with the random projection algorithm, the low-dispersion projection algorithm can solve the (l, d)-motif finding problem with fewer templates without decreasing the success rate.", "paper_title": "Finding Motifs in DNA Sequences Using Low-Dispersion Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000333169300003"}
