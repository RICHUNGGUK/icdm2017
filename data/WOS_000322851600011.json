With the growth of distributed systems, the distributed file systems have emerged as a constantly active research area, with various solutions that cover a vast variety of requirements. EuterpeFS is a distributed file system that emphasizes in the efficient semantic organization of the distributed content and its protection, based on MPEG standards. Its layered, fine grained and standards based, design makes EuterpeFS an easily adaptable distributed file system that can work with different publish- subscribe protocols, security and semantic technologies; even with other distributed file systems. The contributions of EuterpeFS can be summarized in the following aspects: Semantic organization of content where the directory structured is dictated by ontologies. Content protection using MPEG-21 licensing technologies allowing protecting content in a dynamic distributed environment, where users are arbitrarily entering and leaving the system. Implementation based on standard MPEG-M API enabling easy integration and interoperation between different implementations of particular components.", "paper_title": "Distributed Content Semantic Organization and Access Control with EuterpeFS", "paper_id": "WOS:000322851600011"}
