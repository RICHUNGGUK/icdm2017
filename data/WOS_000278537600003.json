For a proper proportion of unidirectional shortcuts, the stable self-sustained activity with irregular firing states indeed occurs in the considered network. By varying the shortcut density while keeping other system parameters fixed, different levels of irregular firing states, from weakly irregular to Poisson-like and burst firing states, are obtained in 2-D SW neural networks. It is also observed that this activity is sensitive to small perturbations, which might provide a possible mechanism for producing chaos. On the other hand, we find that several other system parameters, such as the network size and refractory period, have significant impact on this activity. Further simulation results show that the 2-D SW neural network can sustain such long-lasting firing behavior by using a smaller number of connections than the random neural network.", "paper_title": "Self-Sustained Irregular Activity in 2-D Small-World Networks of Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurons", "paper_id": "WOS:000278537600003"}
