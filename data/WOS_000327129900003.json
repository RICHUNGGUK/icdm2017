We then provide a uniform and modular method to obtain finite-valued semantics for every canonical labelled calculus by introducing the notion of partial non-deterministic matrices. The semantics is applied to provide simple decidable semantic criteria for two crucial syntactic properties of these calculi: (strong) analyticity and cut-admissibility. Finally, we demonstrate an application of this framework for a large family of paraconsistent logics.", "paper_title": "Finite-valued Semantics for Canonical Labelled Calculi", "paper_id": "WOS:000327129900003"}
