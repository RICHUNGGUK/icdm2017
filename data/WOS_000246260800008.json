These are wireless multihop networks spontaneously deployed by users willing to share communication resources. Due to the community spirit characterizing such networks, it is likely that users will be willing to share other resources besides communication resources, such as data, images, music, movies, disk quotas for distributed backup, and so on. To support resource exchange in these wireless mesh community networks, algorithms for efficient retrieval of information are required. In this paper we introduce Georoy, an algorithm for the efficient retrieval of the information on resource location based on the Viceroy peer-to-peer algorithm. Differently from Viceroy, Georoy exploits the capability of setting and managing a direct mapping between the resource ID and the node which maintains information about its location so as to speed up the search process. Simulation results show that Georoy enables efficient and scalable search of resources and can be successfully used in wireless mesh community networks. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
