A new family of associative memories based on Sparse Clustered Networks (SCNs) has been recently introduced that can store many more messages than classical Hopfield-Neural Networks (HNNs). In this paper, we propose fully-parallel hardware architectures of such memories for partial or erroneous inputs. The proposed architectures eliminate winner-take-all modules and thus reduce the hardware complexity by consuming 65 % fewer FPGA lookup tables and increase the operating frequency by approximately 1.9 times compared to that of previous work. Furthermore, the scaling behaviour of the implemented architectures for various design choices are investigated. We explore the effect of varying design variables such as the number of clusters, network nodes, and erased symbols on the error performance and the hardware resources.", "paper_title": "Algorithm and Architecture of Fully-Parallel Associative Memories Based on Sparse Clustered Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000340451200003"}
