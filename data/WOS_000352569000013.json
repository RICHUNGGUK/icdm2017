The uncoordinated, dense deployments of femtocells however, pose several unique challenges relating to interference and resource management in OFDMA femtocell networks. Towards addressing these challenges, we propose RADION, a distributed resource management framework that effectively manages interference across femtocells. RADION's core building blocks enable femtocells to opportunistically determine the available resources in a completely distributed and efficient manner. Further, RADION's modular nature paves the way for different resource management solutions to be incorporated in the framework. We implement RADION on a real WiMAX femtocell testbed deployed in a typical indoor setting. Two distributed solutions are enabled through RADION and their performance is studied to highlight their quick self-organization into efficient resource allocations.", "paper_title": "Self-Organizing Resource Management Framework in OFDMA Femtocells", "paper_id": "WOS:000352569000013"}
