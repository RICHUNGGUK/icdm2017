In the considered scheduling problem, each job has a number of attributes and each attribute has one or more levels. Because there is at least one different level of attribute between two adjacent jobs, it is necessary to make a setup adjustment whenever there is a switch to a different job. The objective of the problem is to determine a processing sequence so as to minimize the total setup time on a single machine. We develop a constructive heuristic based on several theorems for the problem. The heuristic has been evaluated by comparing with an existing constructive heuristic, a tabu search heuristic and a dynamic programming approach, and its efficiency and effectiveness have been demonstrated. The computational results show that the proposed heuristic outperforms the current scheduling method used by the case plant with a significant improvement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
