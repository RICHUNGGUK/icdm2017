In ISOMAP, two approaches are applied for neighborhood construction, called k-neighbor and epsilon-neighbor. For the k-neighbor, the number of the neighbors is a const k. For the other one, all the distances between the neighbors is less than epsilon. Either the k-neighbor or the epsilon-neighbor neglects the difference of each point. This paper proposes an new method called the kc-neighbor, in which the neighbors are defined based on c time distance of the k nearest neighbor, which can avoid the neighborhood graph unconnected and improve the accuracy in computing neighbors. In this paper, SVM rather than MDS is applied to classify head poses after the geodesic distances are computed. The experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "The application of extended geodesic distance in head poses estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300026"}
