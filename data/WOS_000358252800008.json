In the most real world production cases, flow shops operate with uniform parallel machines at each stage to eliminate or reduce the bottleneck stages with aim of enhancing the efficiency of production. This paper deals with a no-wait scheduling problem considering anticipatory sequence-dependent setup times on the flexible flow shop environment with uniform parallel machines. The objective is to find the sequence which minimizes maximum completion time of jobs (i.e. makespan). Since this problem is known to be NP-hard, we introduce a novel approach to tackle the problem. In the solution approach, firstly a heuristic formulation is used for objective function evaluation. Afterwards, principles of meta-heuristic algorithms namely invasive weed optimization, variable neighborhood search and simulated annealing algorithms are hybridized as solution method of the problem. In addition, a Taguchi method is employed for calibration of parameters and operators of the proposed hybrid meta-heuristic. Various computational experiments in two scales of small and large are established to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Finally, the experimental results revealed the superiority of the performance of the hybrid meta-heuristic in comparison with original ones singularly.", "paper_title": "No-wait flexible flowshop with uniform parallel machines and sequence-dependent setup time: a hybrid meta-heuristic approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000358252800008"}
