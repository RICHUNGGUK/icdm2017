Photon mapping, as one of the most powerful techniques to render highly realistic 3-D images by high amounts of floating-point operations, is very time-consuming. To use the advantages of multiprocessor systems to make 3-D scenes, parallel photon-mapping rendering on a homogeneous multiprocessor SoC (MPSoC) platform along with a mesh NoC by an adaptive wormhole routing method to communicate packets among cores is proposed in this paper. To make efficient use of the MPSoC platform to carry out photon-mapping rendering, many methods concerning the increase of load balancing, the efficient use of memory, and the decrease of communication cost to achieve a scalable application are explored in this paper. The resulting MPSoC platform is verified and evaluated by cycle-accurate simulations for different sizes of the mesh NoC. As expected, the proposed methods can obtain excellent load balancing and achieve a maximum of 44.3 times faster on an 8-by-8 MPSoC platform than on a single-core MPSoC platform.
