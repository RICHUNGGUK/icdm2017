Replication is a widely recognized method for balancing the demands of storage space with bandwidth and battery life. We propose a novel scheme that seeks to strategically balance these constrained resources through a cooperative game-theory approach for replication in a mobile environment. Our replication strategy relies on the cooperation of the nodes within the network to make replica caching decisions which are spatiotemporally local-optimal for the network from an energy and bandwidth conservation standpoint. In cooperative altruistic data replication, each node calculates the net global benefit, for caching a replica of the requested data, as the result data is returned from the responding node to the requesting node, where it determines the spatiotemporally local-optimal node for replicating the data item. Performance results from our research indicate that our scheme, CADR, improves the query response time by 25 and 45 %, mean hop count is improved by 26 and 46 %, query error is reduced by 30 and 48 %, while energy utilization is reduced 30 and 57 % when compared with both another game theoretic replication approach and standard cooperative caching respectively.", "paper_title": "Data Replication in Cooperative Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000316762900009"}
