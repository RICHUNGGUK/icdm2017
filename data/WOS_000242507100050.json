The periodic complementary sequences can be obtained using symmetric or anti-symmetric extensions. The properties of their autocorrelation functions are studied. The non-periodic complementary sequences are the intersection between anti-symmetric and symmetric periodic sequences. These non-periodic and periodic complementary sequences are identified to be special cases of non-periodic and periodic (or cyclic) orthogonal wavelet transforms. This relationship leads to the novel approach.", "paper_title": "Analytic constructions of periodic and non-periodic complementary sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100050"}
