Because training speed of standard online SVR algorithm is very slow, a kernel cache-based method is developed to accelerate the standard algorithm and a new fast online SVR algorithm is obtained. Then the new algorithm is applied in straight inverse control for constructing the inverse model of controlled system online, and output errors of the system are used to control online SVR algorithm, which made the whole control system a closed-loop one. Simulation results show that the new algorithm has good control performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
