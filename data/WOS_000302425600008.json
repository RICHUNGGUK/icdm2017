Prove by reduction that MPP, ASPP, and TLP are computationally at least equivalent to the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) in the same prime field, and meanwhile find some evidence which inclines people to believe that the new problems are harder than DLP each, namely unsolvable in DLP subexponential time. Demonstrate the correctness of the decryption and the verification, deduce the probability of a plaintext solution being nonunique is nearly zero, and analyze the exact securities of the cryptosystem against recovering a plaintext from a ciphertext, extracting a private key from a public key or a signature, and forging a signature through known signatures, public keys, and messages on the assumption that IFP, DLP, and LSSP can be solved. Studies manifest that the running times of effectual attack tasks are greater than or equal to O(2(n)) so far when n = 80, 96, 112, or 128 with Ig M approximate to 696, 864, 1030, or 1216. As viewed from utility, it should be researched further how to decrease the length of a modulus and to increase the speed of the decryption. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
