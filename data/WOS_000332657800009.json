However, methods and infrastructure for supporting construction research data management are currently underdeveloped; emphasizing the need for developing effective and efficient means for managing and sharing research data. A review of existing data management models reveals that there is currently no effective universal system for sharing the data obtained from construction research endeavours. This paper presents electronic product and process management systems (EPPMS) as a construction research data management and sharing approach. The developed EPPMS is a web-based system that utilizes workflows that can automate the collection, authorization, and dissemination of construction research data. A comparative analysis of the developed system to the existing web-based cloud and web-based share point systems indicates that an EPPMS offers a more fitting solution for construction research data management.", "paper_title": "Workflow-Based Construction Research Data Management and Dissemination", "paper_id": "WOS:000332657800009"}
