Then, we extend these operators to uncertain environments and present an uncertain generalized power average (UGPA) operator and its weighted form, and an uncertain generalized power ordered weighted average (UGPOWA) operator to aggregate the input arguments taking the form of interval of numerical values. We also extend the GPA operator and the GPOWA operator to intuitionistic fuzzy environment, and obtain the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy power averaging (GIFPA) operator and the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy power ordered weighted averaging (GIFPOWA) operator. Moreover, some properties of these operators are studied. We also present new approaches on the basis of the proposed operators in an example of strategic decision making. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
