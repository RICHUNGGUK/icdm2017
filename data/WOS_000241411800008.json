In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, called Twins, tailored for self-organizing networks. Twins architecture involves addressing and locating nodes in large networks, forwarding packets between them, and managing in the presence of mobility/topology changes. Twins defines a logical multidimensional space for addressing and forwarding, while location service and management operations make use of a one-dimensional space. To improve scalability and performance, forwarding is hop-by-hop with greedy next-hop choice and the location service uses a rendezvous paradigm to distribute information among nodes. In this paper, we describe the Twins architecture and present a performance evaluation to assess scalability, fairness in the overhead distribution among nodes, and routing robustness.", "paper_title": "Twins: A dual addressing space representation for self-organizing networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241411800008"}
