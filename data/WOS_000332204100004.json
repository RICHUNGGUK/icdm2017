The methodology is demonstrated in the case of multiple systems moving in a plane. Starting from the given information structure constraints, the expansion/contraction paradigm based on the restriction conditions is applied. The local design provides tracking controllers for the extracted subsystems; contraction is done according to the inclusion principle and results in a stable controller provided the system graph has a directed spanning tree. A specific methodology based on sequential LQ optimization is proposed for local controller design.", "paper_title": "Decentralized overlapping tracking control", "paper_id": "WOS:000332204100004"}
