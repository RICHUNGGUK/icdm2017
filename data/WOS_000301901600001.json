This contribution focuses upon the stable and high-order numerical simulation of the interaction of time-harmonic electromagnetic waves incident upon a periodic doubly layered dielectric media with sharp, irregular interface. We describe a boundary perturbation method for this problem which avoids not only the need for specialized quadrature rules but also the dense linear systems characteristic of boundary integral/element methods. Additionally, it is a provably stable algorithm as opposed to other boundary perturbation approaches such as Bruno and Reitich's \"method of field expansions\" or Milder's \"method of operator expansions\". Our spectrally accurate approach is a natural extension of the \"method of transformed field expansions\" originally described by Nicholls and Reitich (and later refined to other geometries by the authors) in the single-layer case.
