Let G be a graph of order n, minimum degree delta, and vertex-connectivity K. If G is not the complete graph, then Chartrand and Harary [G. Chartrand, F. Harary, Graphs with prescribed connectivities, in: P. Erdos, G. Katona (Eds.), Theory of Graphs, Academic Press, New York, 1968, pp. 61-63] proved in 1968 that K >= 2 delta+2-n. In 1993, Topp and Volkmann [J. Topp, L. Volkmann, Sufficient conditions for equality of connectivity and minimum degree of a graph, J. Graph Theory 17 (1993) 695-700] proved the following analog bound for bipartite graphs. If G is a bipartite graph with K < delta, then K >= 46-n. In this paper we present some generalizations and extensions of these inequalities for digraphs as well as for graphs. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
