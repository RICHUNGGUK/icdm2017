The algorithm deploys DBSM, which directly selects some bits from original string as the reversible hash function. The overlapping of hash bit strings in this paper brings the ability to confirm the homogenetic hash strings. The efficiency of RSECBF in the principal component analysis was verified by the DDoS detection in a published trace.", "paper_title": "Disclosing the element distribution of Bloom Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200159"}
