In particular, the asymptotical distribution of the correlation information criterion (CIC) is derived and a new method for selecting a working ICS is proposed by standardizing the selection criterion as the p-value. The CIC test is found to be powerful in detecting misspecification of the working ICS structures, while with respect to the working ICS selection, the standardized CIC test is also shown to have satisfactory performance. Some simulation studies and applications to two real longitudinal datasets are made to illustrate how these criteria and tests might be useful. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
