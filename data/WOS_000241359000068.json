The SINAI research group participated in both the ad hoe task and the medical task. For the first task, we have used several translation schemes as well as experiments with and without Pseudo Relevance Feedback (PRF). A voting-based system has been developed, for the ad hoc task, joining three different systems of participant Universities. For the medical task, we have also submitted runs with and without PRF, and experiments using only textual query and using textual mixing with visual query.", "paper_title": "University of Jaen at ImageCLEF 2005: Adhoc and medical tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000068"}
