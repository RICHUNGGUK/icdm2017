In this work, a new sliding function dependent on the probability of packet dropout is constructed. By means of a Lyapunov function involved in sliding mode variable and system state, both the reachabiltiy and the stability are analyzed simultaneously, and the sufficient condition is derived via linear matrix inequalities. Finally, numerical simulation results are given. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
