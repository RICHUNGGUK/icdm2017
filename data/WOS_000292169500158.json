In these last decades, the DEA as a powerful approach has been very popular into different contexts, but despite its popularity, it cannot provide adequate information in its initial framework to discriminate between all efficient DMUs. So lately, invention of and pay attention to different approaches to mitigate and eliminate this flaw has been very significant. In this paper a ranking method is revealed based on investigating some effects relative to deletion of an efficient DMU on another efficient ones. To this end, some artificial units called aggregate units are defined. Moreover, two numerical examples illustrate how the proposed method works in actual practices in comparison with some other conventional ranking methods.
