The developed model is useful for a wide range of textures. Within the scope of the method it is possible to pose such tasks as e.g. learning the parameters of the prior model, texture synthesis and texture segmentation in a very natural and good founded way. To solve these tasks we propose approximative schemes based on the Gibbs Sampler combined with the Expectation Maximization algorithm for learning. Preliminary experiments show good performance and accuracy of the method.", "paper_title": "Template based Gibbs probability distributions for texture modeline and setimentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241486800004"}
