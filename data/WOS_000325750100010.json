After introducing a model with six state variables, a preliminary step considers the reduction of the number of parameters to be identified by means of sensitivity analysis, and then identifiability items are discussed. A nonlinear optimization-based procedure for identification is developed, which divides the unknown parameters into two families: the group dependent and the patient dependent parameters. Numerical results show that the identified model can be individually adapted to each patient and this result is promising for predicting the effects (e.g., failures or successes) of therapeutic actions.
