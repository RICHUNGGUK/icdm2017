We introduce the notions of complete and incomplete Boolean degrees. We show that for each complete P (2)-degree there exist both a countable decreasing chain of P (2)-degrees and a countable antichain of P (2)-degrees. We prove that above each incomplete P (2)-degree there is a continuum of P (2)-degrees. Thus, in total we show that in the partially ordered set of P (2)-degrees there are no maximal elements.", "paper_title": "Complete and incomplete Boolean degrees", "paper_id": "WOS:000286328800005"}
