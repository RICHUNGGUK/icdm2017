In a small power system that appears in an early stage of a black start of a power system, an overvoltage could be caused by core saturation on the energization of a shunt reactor with residual flux. The most effective method for the limitation of the switching overvoltages is controlled switching since the magnitudes of the produced transients are strongly dependent on the closing instants of the switch. A harmonic index has been introduced that it's minimum value is corresponding to the best-case switching time. In addition, in this paper an artificial neural network (ANN) is used to estimate the optimum switching instants for real time applications. ANN is trained with equivalent circuit parameters of the network, so that developed ANN is applicable to every studied system. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed index and accuracy of the ANN-based approach, two case studies are presented and demonstrated.", "paper_title": "CONTROL OF SHUNT REACTOR OVERVOLTAGES BY CONTROLLED SWITCHING DURING POWER SYSTEM RESTORATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000313706200003"}
