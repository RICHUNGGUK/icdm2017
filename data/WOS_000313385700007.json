First two anatomical features of the pectoral muscle, homogeneous texture and high intensity deviation are employed to identify the initial pectoral muscle edge. Then Kalman filter is used to refine the ragged initial edge. The proposed method is tested on Mammographic Image Analysis Society Mini-Mammographic (mini-MIAS) database and Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) database. The acceptable rate is 90.06% and 92% for the mini-MIAS database and the DDSM database, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
