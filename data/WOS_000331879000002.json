Based on marketing communication concepts and existing models for consumer behavior, three stages, namely attraction, interaction and conation, are defined in this article to analyze the effectiveness of interactive display advertising. By reviewing various methods and strategies employed by existing systems with attraction, interaction and conation stages, this article concludes that smart mobile devices should be integrated as a component to increase the effectiveness of interactive displays as advertising tools. Future research challenges related to this topic are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Convergence of Interactive Displays with Smart Mobile Devices for Effective Advertising: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000331879000002"}
