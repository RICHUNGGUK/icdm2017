An increase in the complexity of technology-based services and customer interaction has fueled the development of innovative services that improve the quality of service offerings. This research looks at the design of a technology-based service that may provide users of enterprise communication tools with a satisfying customer experience. A new conceptual model for the design of co-creative services that combines cybernetic concepts with interaction design methods is illustrated by way of example through the design of an email service called Scribee. In doing so, the proposed model presents a way of conceiving service systems that have the potential to move beyond the simple creation and sharing of knowledge to assist end user involvement and collaborative interaction.
