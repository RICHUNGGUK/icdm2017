Interconnection networks provide an effective mechanism for exchanging data between processors in a parallel computing system. In this paper, we introduce a technique to obtain a lower bound for dilation of an embedding. Moreover, we give algorithms to compute exact dilation of embedding circulant network into a triangular grid, Tower of Hanoi graph and Sierpinski gasket graph, proving that the lower bound obtained is sharp.", "paper_title": "A Lower Bound for Dilation of an Embedding", "paper_id": "WOS:000366469000004"}
