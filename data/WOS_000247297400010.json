Typically, given a dataflow algorithm and a set of architectural constraints, the high-level synthesis performs algorithmic transformation and produces the optimal scheduling. How to verify the correctness of high-level synthesis becomes a key issue before mapping the synthesis results onto a silicon. Many tools exist for RTL (Register Transfer Level) design, but few for high-level synthesis. Instead of applying Boolean algebra, this paper adopts the Petri Net theory to verify the correctness of the synthesis result, because the Petri Net model has the nature of dataflow algorithms. Herein, we propose three approaches to realize the Petri Net based formal verification algorithm and conclude the best one who outperforms the others in terms of processing speed and resource usage.
