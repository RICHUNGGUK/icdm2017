Methods: In this paper we report a review study about the semi-automatic and automatic liver segmentation techniques, and we describe our fully automatized method. Results: The survey reveals that automatic liver segmentation is stilt an open problem since various weaknesses and drawbacks of the proposed works must still be addressed. Our gray-level based liver segmentation method has been developed to tackle all these problems; when tested on 40 patients it achieves satisfactory results, comparable to the mean intra- and inter-observer variation. Conclusions: We believe that our technique outperforms those presented in the literature; nevertheless, a common test set with its gold standard traced by experts, and a generally accepted performance measure are required to demonstrate it.
