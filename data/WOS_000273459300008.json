One of the most important parameters governing a transformer's life expectancy is the Hot-Spot Temperature (HST) value. The classical approach has been established to consider the hot-spot temperature as the sum of the ambient temperature, the top-oil temperature rise in the tank, and the hot-spot-to-top-oil (in tank) temperature gradient. In this paper, the heat conduction equation for temperature is solved. For numerical solution of the heat conduction equation, the finite element method is used. The selected Model for simulation is a 32M VA transformer with Non-Directed Oil-Forced (NDOF) cooling and Directed Oil-Forced (DOF) cooling.", "paper_title": "Estimation of Hottest Spot Temperature in Power Transformer Windings with NDOF and DOF Cooling", "paper_id": "WOS:000273459300008"}
