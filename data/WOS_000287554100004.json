This new system is an extension of Parigot's Classical Natural Deduction with dual-context to formulate S4 modal logic. The modal lambda mu-calculus is also introduced as a computational extraction of CNDS4. It is an extension of both the lambda mu-calculus and the modal lambda-calculus. Subject reduction, continency, and strong normalization of the modal lambda mu-calculus are shown. Finally, the computational interpretation of the modal lambda mu-calculus, especially the computational meaning of the modal possibility operator, is discussed.", "paper_title": "Classical Natural Deduction for S4 Modal Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000287554100004"}
