All four models were extensively validated by various cross-validation tests, and encouraging predictability was achieved. ASM-ATC-LOGP, the best model, achieves leave-one-out correlation coefficient square (q(2)) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.832 and 0.840 logarithm unit, respectively. In a 10,000 times 85/15 cross-validation test, this model achieves the mean of q(2) and RMSE being 0.832 and 0.841 logarithm unit, respectively. We believe that those robust models can serve as an important rule in druglikeness analysis and an efficient filter in prioritizing compound libraries prior to high throughput screenings (HTS).", "paper_title": "Aqueous Solubility Prediction Based on Weighted Atom Type Counts and Solvent Accessible Surface Areas", "paper_id": "WOS:000264533400006"}
