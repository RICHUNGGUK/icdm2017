To this end a Two-Stage Kalman Filter (TSKF) is used to simultaneously estimate and isolate possible faults in each actuator. The faults are modelled as losses in control effectiveness of rotors. Three fault scenarios are investigated: loss of control effectiveness in one single actuator, simultaneous loss of control effectiveness in all motors, and loss of control effectiveness in three motors with different magnitudes. The developed FDD algorithm is evaluated through experimental application to an unmanned quadrotor helicopter testbed available at the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering of Concordia University, called Qball-X4. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed FDD method.", "paper_title": "Experimental Test of a Two-Stage Kalman Filter for Actuator Fault Detection and Diagnosis of an Unmanned Quadrotor Helicopter", "paper_id": "WOS:000312642600009"}
