Two feature extractors based on neural networks (NN) are introduced: the first producing phone-state posteriors and the second making use of a compressive NN layer. They are combined with three different QbE detectors: while the Gaussian mixture model/hidden Markov model (GMM/HMM) and dynamic time warping (DTW) both work on continuous feature vectors, the third one, based on weighted finite-state transducers (WFST), processes phone lattices. QbE STD is compared to two standard STD systems with text queries: acoustic keyword spotting and WFST-based search of phone strings in phone lattices. The results are reported on four languages (Czech, English, Hungarian, and Levantine Arabic) using standard metrics: equal error rate (EER) and two versions of popular figure-of-merit (FOM). Language-dependent and language-independent cases are investigated; the latter being particularly interesting for scenarios lacking standard resources to train speech recognition systems. While the DTW and GMM/HMM approaches produce the best results for a language-dependent setup depending on the target language, the GMM/HMM approach performs the best dealing with a language-independent setup. As far as WFSTs are concerned, they are promising as they allow for indexing and fast search.", "paper_title": "Comparison of Methods for Language-Dependent and Language-Independent Query-by-Example Spoken Term Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000308657600004"}
