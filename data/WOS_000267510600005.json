Let alpha be a fixed real in (0, 1]. We are given a bounding rectangle rho and a set R of n possibly intersecting unit disks whose centers lie in rho. The task is to pack a set B of m disjoint disks of radius alpha into rho such that no disk in B intersects a disk in R, where m is the maximum number of unit disks that can be packed. In this paper we present a polynomial-time algorithm for alpha = 2/3. So far only the case of packing squares has been considered. For that case, Baur and Fekete have given a polynomial-time algorithm for alpha = 2/3 and have shown that the problem cannot be solved in polynomial time for any alpha > 13/14 unless P = NP.", "paper_title": "A POLYNOMIAL-TIME APPROXIMATION ALGORITHM FOR A GEOMETRIC DISPERSION PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000267510600005"}
