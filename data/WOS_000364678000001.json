One of the major issues of this healthcare is secure transmission and data authenticity. If the data is not transmitted securely or not authenticated, the clients may face embarrassment. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based healthcare framework that will authenticate speech data from a patient suspected to have Parkinson's disease. The patient sends his or her speech signal recorded via a smart phone through Internet to the cloud. A discrete wavelet transform- (DWT-) singular value decomposition (SVD) based speech watermarking module is run in the cloud to embed watermark to the signal. In case of authentication, watermark is extracted from the questioned signal and matched with the stored watermark. Experimental results indicate that the proposed DWT-SVD based watermarking system achieves imperceptibility and is robust against attacks such as additive white Gaussian noise and filtering.", "paper_title": "Watermarking of Parkinson Disease Speech in Cloud-Based Healthcare Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000364678000001"}
