Although interdomain provisioning has been well studied for packet/cell-switching networks, the wavelength dimension presents many additional challenges. To address this challenge, a detailed hierarchical routing GMPLS-based framework for provisioning all-optical and optoelectronic multidomain DWDM networks is presented. The scheme adapts topology abstraction schemes to improve routing scalability and lower interdomain blocking probabilities. Related interdomain light-path RWA and signaling schemes are also tabled. Performance analysis results are also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms along with directions for future research work.
