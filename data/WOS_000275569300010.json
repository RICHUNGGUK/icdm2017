To fuse them to get high accuracy depth maps varying over time, we extend traditional spatial MRFs to dynamic MRFs with temporal coherence. This new model allows both the spatial and the temporal relationship to be propagated in local neighbors. By efficiently finding a maximum of the posterior probability using Loopy Belief Propagation, we show that our approach leads to improved accuracy and robustness of depth estimates for dynamic scenes.", "paper_title": "Spatial-Temporal Fusion for High Accuracy Depth Maps Using Dynamic MRFs", "paper_id": "WOS:000275569300010"}
