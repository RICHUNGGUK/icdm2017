The ASP is described by means of a nonlinear model and results on a Two-Input Two-Output multi-variable system. In this paper a discrete time digital control is proposed where the design of a decentralized controller is faced. Local controllers are given the form of a Two-Degree-of-Freedom PI controller tuned using the data-driven Virtual-Reference Feedback tuning approach.", "paper_title": "Digital Control of a Waste Water Treatment Plant", "paper_id": "WOS:000289028900017"}
