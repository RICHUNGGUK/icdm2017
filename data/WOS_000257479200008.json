Our model deals with collisions between weighted particles of arbitrary species, conserving energy perfectly in each collision while momentum is conserved on the average. We also discuss a new method to model extremely high densities, applicable to a wide range of plasmas from the cold, non-relativistic to the ultra-relativistic regime in the high energy density physics.
