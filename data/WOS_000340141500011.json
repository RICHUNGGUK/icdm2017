Thus, a non-destructive technique of detecting insect-damaged vegetable soybean must be developed. An efficient detection method based on a hyperspectral image was proposed by selecting the region of interest (ROI) through automatic threshold segmentation and optimal wavelength selection using the fuzzy-rough set model. For the 362 samples of beans, three image features (i.e., entropy, energy, and mean) of the ROI were extracted as classification features, whose spectral region covered 400-1000 nm and contained 94 wavelengths. Three or less optimal wavelengths were then selected using a fuzzy-rough set model based on the thermal charge algorithm (FRSTCA). Support vector data description (SVDD) was used to develop classification models for the insect-damaged soybean. For the prediction samples of the beans, the classification results indicated that the normal samples were 100.0% correctly classified using the automatic extracting ROI method based on automatic threshold segmentation. The classification accuracy for the insect-damaged samples was 91.7%, and a 98.8% overall classification accuracy was achieved with the FRSTCA selecting two wavelengths. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
