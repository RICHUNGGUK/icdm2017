It implies that the existing encoding schemes based on the RC model may not improve or possibly worsen the delay when the inductance effects become dominant. A bus-invert method is also proposed to reduce the on-chip bus delay based on the RLC model. Simulation results show that the proposed encoding scheme significantly reduces the worst case coupling delay of the inductance-dominated buses.", "paper_title": "RLC coupling-aware simulation and on-chip bus encoding for delay reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000240926700030"}
