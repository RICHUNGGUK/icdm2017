This method directly leads to improved kernel sizes for several problems, without needing new reduction rules. Moreover, new kernelization algorithms are developed for CONNECTED VERTEX COVER, EDGE DOMINATING SET, and MAXIMUM TRIANGLE PACKING problems, further improving the kernel sizes for these problems.
