The proposed design approach is based on a combined use of equivalent circuit model of a filter and a space mapping technique. A reduced number of full-wave evaluations are needed, leading to a reduced optimization time. A novel SIW filter with improved stop-band characteristic using cross-coupling has been proposed.
