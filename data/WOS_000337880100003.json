However, these codes do not always allow for the free introduction of implicitly defined state functions when automatic differentiation is used to compute the iteration matrix. This makes it considerably more difficult to solve geomechanical problems using non-linear constitutive models. This paper proposes a method for overcoming this difficulty based on multiphysics capabilities. The implementation of the well-known Barcelona basic model is described to illustrate the application of the method. For this purpose, without including formulation details addressed by other authors, the fundamentals of its implementation in a finite element code are described. Examples that demonstrate the scope of the proposed methodology are also presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
