In the present paper, the experimental framework used for the validation of the novel approach is described. The validation protocol, which uses different development and test sets in order to achieve unbiased results, includes the comparison of real and synthetic databases in terms of (i) visual appearance, (ii) statistical information, and (iii) performance evaluation of three competitive and totally different verification systems. The experimental results show the high similarity existing between synthetically generated and humanly produced samples, and the great potential of the method for the study of the signature trait.
