However, providing the consistent data replication service for computational grid environments is not an easy task because it requires a sophisticated technique to minimize I/O and communication latencies incurred during data copy steps to the remote clients. We have developed a replication architecture that is combined with data compression to reduce I/O and network overheads, with the help of data base. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of our replication architecture and present performance results on Linux clusters.", "paper_title": "Developing a consistent data sharing service over grid computing environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000241591300081"}
