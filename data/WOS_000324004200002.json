The rapid growth of the data volume in the Web brings new opportunities for us to extract position relations of interest from the Web. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to extract position relations from the Web. Our algorithm is based on the structural feature of position relations in the Web, i.e., a position relation is usually presented in Web pages as a table or a list. In order to define the structural feature of Web content, we first introduce a structural coefficient for each Web page, which is then used to generate structural file segments for Web pages. A structural file segment consists of all candidates of position relations having a similar structure. After that, we employ a pattern-matching method to extract position relations from the structural file segments. Finally, we conduct experiments on a real data set containing 6028 Chinese Web pages gathered by the Baidu search engine, and evaluate precision and recall of our approach. The experimental results confirm that our algorithm has a precision over 96% and a recall over 87%.", "paper_title": "A STRUCTURAL APPROACH TO EXTRACTING CHINESE POSITION RELATIONS FROM WEB PAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000324004200002"}
