Each web page i carries a weight w(i) representative of the frequency with which it is visited. By adding hotlinks - shortcuts from a node to one of its descendents - we wish to minimize the expected number of steps l needed to visit pages from the home page; expressed as a function of the entropy H(p) of the access probabilities p. This paper introduces several new strategies for effectively assigning hotlinks in a tree. For assigning exactly one hotlink per node, our method guarantees an upper bound on l of 1.141H(p)+1 if d > 2 and 1.08H(p)+2/3 if d = 2. We also present the first efficient general methods for assigning at most k hotlinks per node in trees of arbitrary maximum degree, achieving bounds on l of at most 2H(p)/log(k+1) and H(p)/log(k+d)-log d, respectively. Finally, we present an algorithm implementing these methods in O(n log n) time, an improvement over the previous O(n(2)) time algorithms.", "paper_title": "Near-entropy hotlink assignments", "paper_id": "WOS:000241478200026"}
