The new system is based on the Radon transform of binary silhouettes. For each gait sequence, the transformed silhouettes are used for the computation of a template. The set of all templates is subsequently subjected to linear discriminant analysis and subspace projection. In this manner, each gait sequence is described using a low-dimensional feature vector consisting of selected Radon template coefficients. Given a test feature vector, gait recognition and verification is achieved by appropriately comparing it to feature vectors in a reference gait database. By using the new system on the Gait Challenge database, very considerable improvements in recognition performance are seen in comparison to state-of-the-art methods for gait recognition.", "paper_title": "Gait recognition using radon transform and linear discriminant analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000244311100013"}
