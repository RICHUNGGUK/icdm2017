These early works were later extended to simulate the process of vapour deposition. In general, Ballistic Deposition models involve (d+1)-dimensional particles which rain down sequentially at random onto a d-dimensional substrate; when a particle arrives on the existing agglomeration of deposited particles, it sticks to the first particle it contacts, which may result in lateral growth. In this paper we present a first P system model for Ballistic Deposition with d=1.", "paper_title": "An Approach to Ballistic Deposition Based on Membrane Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000265074000004"}
