It is very useful in many situations since many offline scenarios involve the users who work with explicitly disconnecting from the network. This paper proposes the approaches of designing offline web client as a guidance of developing offline web client applications, and describes the details of how to design and implement them. Finally, a prototype system is presented to verify the proposed approach. The experiments show that offline web client can increase user productivity and satisfaction, and enhance the usage of web-based systems.", "paper_title": "Offline web client: Approach, design and implementation based on web system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624200029"}
