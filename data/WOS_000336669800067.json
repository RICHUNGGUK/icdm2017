Clouds will be required to support large numbers of interactions with varying quality requirements. Service quality will therefore be an important differentiator among cloud providers. In order to distinguish themselves from their competitors, cloud providers should offer superior services that meet customers' expectations. A quality model can be used to represent, measure, and compare the quality of the providers, such that a mutual understanding can be established among cloud stakeholders. In this paper, we take a service perspective and initiate a quality model named CLOUDQUAL for cloud services. It is a model with quality dimensions and metrics that targets general cloud services. CLOUDQUAL contains six quality dimensions, i.e., usability, availability, reliability, responsiveness, security, and elasticity, of which usability is subjective, whereas the others are objective. To demonstrate the effectiveness of CLOUDQUAL, we conduct empirical case studies on three storage clouds. Results show that CLOUDQUAL can evaluate their quality. To demonstrate its soundness, we validate CLOUDQUAL with standard criteria and show that it can differentiate service quality.", "paper_title": "CLOUDQUAL: A Quality Model for Cloud Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800067"}
