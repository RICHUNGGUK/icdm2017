In recent times, there has been interest from researchers and governments in securing as well as exfiltrating data stored on such devices (e.g. the high profile PRISM program involving the US Government). In this paper, we propose an adversary model for Android covert data exfiltration, and demonstrate how it can be used to construct a mobile data exfiltration technique (MDET) to covertly exfiltrate data from Android devices. Two proof-of-concepts were implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of exfiltrating data via SMS and inaudible audio transmission using standard mobile devices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
