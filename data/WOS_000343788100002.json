With pitchRx, one can easily obtain and store Gameday data in a remote database. The Gameday website hosts a wealth of XML data, but perhaps most interesting is PITCHf/x. Among other things, PITCHf/x data can be used to recreate a baseball's flight path from a pitcher's hand to home plate. With pitchRx, one can easily create animations and interactive 3D scatterplots of the baseball's flight path. PITCHf/x data is also commonly used to generate a static plot of baseball locations at the moment they cross home plate. These plots, sometimes called strike-zone plots, can also refer to a plot of event probabilities over the same region. pitchRx provides an easy and robust way to generate strike-zone plots using the ggplot2 package.", "paper_title": "Taming PITCHf/x Data with XML2R and pitchRx", "paper_id": "WOS:000343788100002"}
