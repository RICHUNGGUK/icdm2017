Some applications such as Couette/Poiseulle flows and supersonic flows show that the present method can give accurate and stable solutions for both rarefied and transitional gas flows. A new adaptive Soroban-grid which is suitable for the CIP method is combined with the present method for supersonic flows to track steep profiles such as shock fronts with higher resolution than fixed grids.
