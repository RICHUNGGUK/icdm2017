We first review two existing approximation approaches, and an exact approach proposed which we refer to as the division method. We then develop a new exact approach called the subtraction method. We compare the two exact methods on the selection power. The results show that the proposed subtraction method is indeed more powerful than the division method. A two-phase selecting procedure is then developed based on the subtraction method for practical applications. Some computational results are tabulated for practitioners' convenience.", "paper_title": "An effective powerful test for one-sided supplier selection problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000295683200006"}
