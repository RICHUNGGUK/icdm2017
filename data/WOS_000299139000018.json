The arbitrary arrival and serving rates of tasks on peers impedes the high throughput in large-scale P2P Grids. We propose a novel autonomous resource allocation scheme, which can maximize the throughput of self-organizing P2P Grid systems. Our design possesses three key features: (1) high adaptability to dynamic environment by proactive and convex-optimal estimation of nodes' volatile states; (2) minimized task migration conflict probability (upper bound can be limited to 2%) of over-utilized nodes individually shifting surplus loads; (3) a load-status conscious gossip protocol for optimizing distributed resource discovery effect. Based on a real-life user's workload and capacity distribution, the simulation results show that our approach could get significantly improved throughput with 23.6-47.1% reduction on unprocessed workload compared to other methods. We also observe high scalability of our solution under dynamic peer-churning situations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
