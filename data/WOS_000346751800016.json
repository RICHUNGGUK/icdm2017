The calibration tool was tested for six model scenarios constructed for three watersheds of increasing size each for a 2 year and 10 year simulation duration. Results show significant speedup in calibration time and, for up to 64 cores, minimal losses in speedup for all watershed sizes and simulation durations. An empirical relationship is presented for estimating the time needed to calibration a SWAT model using the cloud calibration tool as a function of the number of Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs), time steps, and cores used for the calibration.
