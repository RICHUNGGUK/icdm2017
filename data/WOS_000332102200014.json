The proposed converter is fabricated with TSMC 0.35 mu m DPQM CMOS process. The structure of the proposed buck converter includes the voltage-feedback and current-feedback design to improve load regulation and achieve high efficiency. The experimental results show the maximum power efficiency is about 94 %. The load regulation is 6.22 (ppm/mA) when the load current changes from 0 to 300 mA. With a 3.6 V input power supply, the proposed buck converter provides an adjustable power output with a voltage range is from 1 to 3 V precisely.", "paper_title": "A DC-DC buck converter with load-regulation improvement using dual-path-feedback techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000332102200014"}
