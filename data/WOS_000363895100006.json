We propose Dynamic Multi Spectro Temporal-Curvature Scale Space (DMST-CSS), an improved feature descriptor for enhancing the performance of CBVR task. Our primary contribution is in representation of the dynamics of the evolution of the MST-CSS surface. Unlike the earlier MST-CSS descriptor [22], which extracts geometric features after the evolving MST-CSS surface converges to a final formation, this DMST-CSS captures the dynamics of the evolution (formation) of the surface and is thus more robust. We have represented the dynamics of MST-CSS surface as a multivariate time series to obtain a DMST-CSS descriptor. A global kernel alignment technique has been adapted to compute a match cost between query and model DMST-CSS descriptor. In our experiments, VIDCAR was shown to have greater precision recall than the competitors on five datasets.", "paper_title": "VIDCAR: an unsupervised CBVR framework for identifying similar videos with prominent object motion", "paper_id": "WOS:000363895100006"}
