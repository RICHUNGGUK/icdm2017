The proposed algorithm consists of a spatial-domain key insertion part for attack analysis and a frequency-domain watermark insertion part using discrete wavelet transform. With the spatial-domain key extracted from the damaged image, the proposed algorithm analyzes distortion and finds the attack partern. After restoring the damaged image, the algorithm extracts the embedded watermark. By using both spatial domain key and frequency domain watermark, the proposed algorithm can achieve robust watermark extraction against geometrical attacks and image compressions such as JPEG.", "paper_title": "A robust watermarking algorithm using attack pattern analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100069"}
