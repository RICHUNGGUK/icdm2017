This field includes well known and studied problems like traveling salesman problems or TSP or the more realistic asymmetric variant or ATSP, whose applications extend to other areas of transport and operations research. This work studies the effect that the asymmetry of road transportation networks, geographical location and territory have over TSP and ATSP methods. We conduct comprehensive experiments in order to assess the effects that these factors have on some of the best known algorithms for the TSP/ATSP. We demonstrate that all these factors have a significant influence in solution time and quality. Furthermore, we show that the solutions obtained with Euclidean matrices and those obtained with real distance matrices differ significantly. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
