The circuit is capable of processing an analog sensor current and producing an ASK modulated digital signal with modulating signal frequency proportional to the sensor current level. An on-chip regulator has been included to stabilize the supply voltage received from an external RF power source. The circuit can operate with a power supply as low as 1 V and consumes only about 20 mu W of power, which is therefore very suitable for implantable biomedical applications. The whole chip was laid out and fabricated in a 0.35 mu m bulk CMOS technology. Experimental results show good agreement with the simulation results.", "paper_title": "A low-power RF integrated circuit for implantable sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000236963400012"}
