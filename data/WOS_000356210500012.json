By generalized synchronization we mean the existence of an invariant manifold that allows a reduction in dimension. The case of a concrete system modeling the dynamics of a chemical solution on two containers connected to a third container is studied from the basics to arbitrary perturbations. Conditions under which synchronization occurs are given. Our theoretical results are complemented with a numerical study.", "paper_title": "GENERALIZED SYNCHRONIZATION IN A SYSTEM OF SEVERAL NON-AUTONOMOUS OSCILLATORS COUPLED BY A MEDIUM", "paper_id": "WOS:000356210500012"}
