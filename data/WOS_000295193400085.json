This paper introduces a R&D network to make up the missing aspect of the traditional approaches about using multi-sources and to find out the trend of convergence technology R&D in Korea. We collect data about human resources and national R&D projects from Korean national R&D databases, and then construct a weighted network between experts by using meta-data mapping and the network folding technique. And we apply Newman's grouping algorithm that is generalized to a weighted network for detecting the community structure of the network. Gathering data from multi-sources is useful to reveal the structure of network rather than to use only one database. Lastly, we perform a network analysis to examine important experts. The result shows significant information about research trend and core experts in Korea. We expect this study will be helpful in three ways: (1) how to make a network from heterogeneous multi-sources, (2) how to figure out the current situation of convergence technology R&D, (3) how to discover who are important people in Korean convergence technology R&D network. And this paper is just a cornerstone of the work to investigate the current situation of national R&D projects in Korea. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
