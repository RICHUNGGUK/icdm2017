In this scheme, all sets at a hierarchical level have same size but are k times more than the size of sets in the next level of hierarchy where k is called division factor. Therefore the size of tag fields associated to each set is variable and it depends on the hierarchy level of the set it is in. This scheme is proposed to achieve higher hit ratios with respect to the two conventional schemes namely set-associative and direct mapping. The proposed scheme has been simulated with several standard trace files SPEC 2000 and statistics are gathered and analyzed for different cache configurations. The results reveal that the proposed scheme exhibits a higher hit ratio compared to the two well-known mapping schemes, namely set-associative and direct mapping. Moreover, the area and power consumption of this scheme is less than full-associative scheme.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical set-associate cache for high-performance and low-energy architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000246347400004"}
