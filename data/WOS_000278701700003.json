One of them is the checkpointing technique combined with its corresponding rollback recovery process Different checkpointing schemes have been developed and at various levels: task- (or activity-) level and workflow-level. At workflow-level, the usually adopted approach is to establish a checkpointing frequency in the system which determines the moment at which a global workflow checkpoint - a snapshot of the whole workflow enactment state at normal execution (without failures) - has to be accomplished. We describe an alternative workflow-level checkpointing scheme and its corresponding rollback recovery process for hierarchical scientific workflows in which every workflow node in the hierarchy accomplishes its own local checkpoint autonomously and in an uncoordinated way after its enactment. In contrast to other proposals, we utilise the Reference net formalism for expressing the scheme Reference nets are a particular type of Petri nets which can more effectively provide the abstractions to support and to express hierarchical workflows and their dynamic adaptability (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved", "paper_title": "An uncoordinated asynchronous checkpointing model for hierarchical scientific workflows", "paper_id": "WOS:000278701700003"}
