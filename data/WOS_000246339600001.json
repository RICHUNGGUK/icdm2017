A challenge facing designers of such systems is to create interfaces that fit in people's everyday contexts and incorporate the values of daily life. This paper focuses on tangible expressive interaction as one possible approach towards linking everyday experiences to intuitive forms of interaction and presents a number of principles for expressive interaction design in this field. A case study of a tangible expressive interface to control a living room atmosphere projection system (orchestrating living room lighting, audio and video-art) is presented to illustrate and reflect upon the design principles. Furthermore, the case study describes possible techniques towards integrating the design principles into a design method.", "paper_title": "The case of sculpting atmospheres: towards design principles for expressive tangible interaction in control of ambient systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000246339600001"}
