Here, we present Cyni, an open-source 'fill-in-the-algorithm' framework that provides common network inference functionality and user interface elements. Cyni allows the rapid transformation of Java-based network inference prototypes into apps of the popular open-source Cytoscape network analysis and visualization ecosystem. Merely placing the resulting app in the Cytoscape App Store makes the method accessible to a worldwide community of biomedical researchers by mouse click. In a case study, we illustrate the transformation of an ARACNE implementation into a Cytoscape app.", "paper_title": "The Cyni framework for network inference in Cytoscape", "paper_id": "WOS:000355665800029"}
