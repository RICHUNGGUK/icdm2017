UWB receivers are anticipated to operate under hostile interference environments. So the study of the coexistence of various communication standards with MB-OFDM UWB over fiber is an important issue. The performance of MB-OFDM UWB over fiber transmission system is investigated, considering the effect of in-band narrow-band jammers such as WiMAX, MIMO WLAN, WLAN, and marine radar. Experiments were performed to show the effect of fiber transmission under various interferer power levels. It is found that in-band interferers can cause severe degradation in system performance if any interferer to the UWB peak power ratio is not held below a certain level. The results also show that MB-OFDM UWB over fiber transmission is more vulnerable to certain interferers such as WiMAX and radar signals than to the other in-band jammers.", "paper_title": "Investigation of the Performance of Multiband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Ultrawideband Over Fiber Transmission Under the Presence of In-Band Interferers", "paper_id": "WOS:000270408000014"}
