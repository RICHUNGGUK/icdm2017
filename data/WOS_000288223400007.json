This tool is able to generate, according to user requirements, the hardware description of a digital architecture, which implements a Support Vector Machine, one of the current state-of-the-art algorithms for Pattern Recognition. The output of the Core Generator consists of a high-level language hardware core description, suitable to be mapped on a reconfigurable device, like a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). As an example of the use of our tool, we compare different solutions, by targeting several reconfigurable devices, and implement the recognition part of a machine vision system for automotive applications.", "paper_title": "A FPGA CORE GENERATOR FOR EMBEDDED CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288223400007"}
