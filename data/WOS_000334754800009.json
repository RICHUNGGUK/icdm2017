The main result is motivated by and extends the characterisation of standard controllability by Wood and Zerz (Notes on the definition of behavioural controllability, Syst Control Lett 37(1):31-37, 1999). Negligibility is defined with respect to a suitably chosen Serre category of modules over a given operator domain. A behaviour is called negligible if its module belongs to this category. Standard examples of negligible behaviours with respect to suitably chosen Serre categories are asymptotically stable and nilpotent behaviours according to Bisiacco and Valcher. A behaviour is called controllable up to negligible trajectories if its factor behaviour modulo its largest controllable subbehaviour is negligible. This controllability notion generalises multidimensional stabilisability and coincides with it in dimension one. The preceding definitions also apply to continuous systems. The domain of the independent discrete variables of the considered discrete behaviours is an arbitrary finitely generated submonoid of a free abelian group.", "paper_title": "Controllability up to negligible trajectories of discrete multidimensional behaviours", "paper_id": "WOS:000334754800009"}
