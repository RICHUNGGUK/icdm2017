An unwrappable facade is represented by the mutually orthogonal baseline and profile. We first reconstruct semidense 3D points from images, then the baseline and profile are extracted from the point cloud to construct the base shape and compose the textures of the building from the images. Through our unwrapping process, the reconstructed 3D points and composed textures are further mapped to an unwrapped space that is parameterized by the baseline and profile. In doing so, the unwrapped space becomes equivalent to the planar space in which planar facade modeling techniques can be used to reconstruct the details of the buildings. Finally, the augmented details can be wrapped back to the original 3D space to generate the final model. This newly introduced unwrappable representation extends the state-of-the-art modeling for planar facades to a more general class of facades. We demonstrate the power of the unwrappable representation with a few examples in which the facade is not planar.", "paper_title": "Image-Based Modeling of Unwrappable Facades", "paper_id": "WOS:000323473800011"}
