A shortcoming of any of these services can disturb the network goals. However, failures are not exceptions in WSNs, since problems as energy exhaustion, communication range loss or physical damages are usual incidents. Considering the need of managing WSNs in an efficient manner, improving information quality and availability, this work proposes the use of the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and the autonomic computing paradigm in the design of self-healing WSNs. We also propose a service management approach for a self-managed network that dynamically adapts itself in order to maintain the service availability and promote the resources productivity. This approach aims to employ the self-healing service in WSNs, allowing them to discover, examine, diagnose and react to dysfunctions. Results show that service management applied to a self-healing WSN extend the longevity and availability of the network.", "paper_title": "A service management approach for self-healing wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241448700018"}
