The MICRA model was applied in a case study, whereas the verification and validation of its previously defined functionalities led to ontology validation. MICRA shows to be an innovative model, based on a thorough, organized and systematic analysis of the educational context. In addition, SICRA goes beyond other ontologies as it not only defines reusable competences, classified according to Bloom's taxonomy, but also defines and establishes a correspondence among Computer Science Knowledge Areas. We have thus contributed to making learning institutions' training curricula widely available, allowing for their contrastive analysis in order to promote student and teacher mobility within the European Higher Education Area and in other countries.", "paper_title": "Interoperability Framework for Competences and Learning Outcomes", "paper_id": "WOS:000365385300004"}
