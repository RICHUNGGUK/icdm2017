In this paper, we propose an automatic, efficient and unsupervised method based on gradient matrix, the normalized cut criterion and tracking strategy. Making use of the gradient matrix of the Lucas-Kanade equation, which consists of only the first order derivatives, the proposed method can detect a candidate window where a vessel possibly exists. The normalized cut criterion, which measures both the similarity within groups and the dissimilarity between groups, is used to search a local intensity threshold to segment the vessel in a candidate window. The tracking strategy makes it possible to extract thin vessels without being corrupted by noise. Using a multi-resolution segmentation scheme, vessels with different widths can be segmented at different resolutions, although the window size is fixed. Our method is tested on a public database. It is demonstrated to be efficient and insensitive to initial parameters.", "paper_title": "Multi-resolution vessel segmentation using normalized cuts in retinal images", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700114"}
