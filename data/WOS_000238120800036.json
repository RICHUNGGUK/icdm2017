According to our empirical measurements, packet losses are not frequent, meaning that UNITS link-level retransmission mechanisms are adequate to cope with data corruption through the wireless link. However, ARQ loss recovery mechanisms produce a high variability of the packet delay, which can also affect the performance of the IP data service. By analysing actual UNITS traces, we explore the behaviour of the packet delay through the UNITS network, explaining the effects of the underlying mechanisms. Finally, we derive a simple model to imitate the behaviour of UNITS Internet access. This model could be very useful in simulation or emulation experiments.", "paper_title": "Experimental analysis and characterization of packet delay in UMTS networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238120800036"}
