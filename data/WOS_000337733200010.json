Till now so many proxy multi-signature schemes based on ECC without pairings have been proposed. To the best of our knowledge, none of them are provable secure. Having motivated, we first define a formal security model and then propose a provable secure proxy multi-signature scheme based on ECC without pairings. Our proposed scheme can play a crucial role in application to distributed systems, grid computing, mobile agent environment etc.", "paper_title": "Provably Secure Proxy Multi-Signature Scheme Based on ECC", "paper_id": "WOS:000337733200010"}
