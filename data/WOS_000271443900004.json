An important subset of graphs is directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This paper presents a new E-Spring algorithm, extended from the popular spring embedder model, which eliminates node overlaps in clustered DAGs. In this framework, nodes are modeled as non-uniform charged particles with weights, and a final drawing is derived by adjusting the positions of the nodes according to a combination of spring forces and repulsive forces derived from electrostatic forces between the nodes. The drawing process needs to reach a stable state when the average distances of separation between nodes are near optimal. We introduce a stopping condition for such a stable state, which reduces equilibrium distances between nodes and therefore results in a significantly reduced area for DAG visualization. It imposes an upper bound on the repulsive forces between nodes based on graph geometry. The algorithm employs node interleaving to eliminate any residual node overlaps. These new techniques have been validated by visualizing eBay buyer-seller relationships and has resulted in overall area reductions in the range of 45-79%. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
