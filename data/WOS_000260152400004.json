However, this does not mean that metaheuristics can be applied blindly to any new problem. In this contribution we showed how the most basic ingredients of Soft Computing, namely fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules, are used in the context of a simple metaheuristic and a cooperative strategy based on it, to obtain successful results for the p-median problem.
