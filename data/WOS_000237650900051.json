The grid resolution in the shear layer which was generated from the interaction of main and injected streams strongly influences the subsequent evolution of the passive scalar. Dissipation, integral length-scale, skewness and flatness factors of the passive scalar are sensitive to the numerical resolution away from the wall where coherent structures grow very rapidly.", "paper_title": "Effect of grid resolution on the statistics of passive scalar in an injection-driven channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900051"}
