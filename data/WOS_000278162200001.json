However, a drawback in these schedulers is that they ignore a task's affinity towards the processor where it was executed last, causing frequent inter-processor task migrations which ultimately results in increased execution times. This paper presents Partition Oriented Frame Based Fair Scheduler (POFBFS), an efficient proportional fair scheduler for periodic firm and soft real-time tasks that ensures a bounded number of task migrations. Experimental results reveal that POFBFS can achieve 3 to 100 times reduction in the number of migrations suffered with respect to the General-ERfair algorithm (for a set of 25 to 100 tasks running on 2 to 8 processors) while simultaneously maintaining high fairness accuracy.
