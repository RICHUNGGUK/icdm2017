Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses a literature review of research articles from 1996 to 2007 with keyword indexes to survey the KM practice, KMS technology and its application in BOSC. Such keyword indexes include: BOSC, SCM, KM, KMS, expert system, knowledge-based system and information system on the Elsevier online database, ScienceDirect, EBSCO, Proquest, Emerald, DOAJ, and Wiley Inter Science. A total of 1,500 articles were found but only 149 articles related to the keywords of KMS application and KM practices within SCM and BOSC. Findings - The important findings indicate that the KMS application is solely focused on single knowledge problem for enabling individual SC members to attain operational excellence. There is a need for further research into the development of KMS with features of knowledge coordination that cross organizational borders in attaining the BOSC integration. Research limitations/implications - Perhaps, the limitation of this study was the narrowness of the scope of the paper based on the keywords used for searching. Practical implications - Validation of the multi-disciplines of KM practices and KMS applications provides enterprises with useful guidelines for implementing KM- and KMS-related projects within their current BOSC practices. Originality/value - This paper provides useful knowledge by highlighting the characteristics of KMS technology within BOSC and empirical insights into the relationship between KM and BOSC practices.", "paper_title": "Knowledge management approach in build-to-order supply chains", "paper_id": "WOS:000248068600016"}
