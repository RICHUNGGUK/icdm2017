Here invariance means that each available move in a game can be played anywhere inside the game board. In fact, we establish such a result for a wider class of pairs of complementary sequences, and in the process generalize the notion of a subtraction game. Given a pair of complementary sequences (a(n)) and (b(n)) of positive integers, we define a game G by setting {{a(n), b(n)}} as invariant moves. We then introduce the invariant game G*, whose moves are all non-zero P-positions of G. Provided the set of non-zero P-positions of G* equals {{a(n), b(n)}}, this is the desired invariant game. We give sufficient conditions on the initial pair of sequences for this 'duality' to hold. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
