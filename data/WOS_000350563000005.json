Our protocol also satisfies the stronger notions of concurrent nonmalleability and robustness. As a corollary, we establish that constant-round nonmalleable zero-knowledge arguments for NP can be based on one-way functions and constant-round secure multiparty computation can be based on enhanced trapdoor permutations; also here, earlier protocols additionally required either collision-resistant hash functions or subexponential one-way functions.", "paper_title": "Constant-Round Nonmalleable Commitments from Any One-Way Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000350563000005"}
