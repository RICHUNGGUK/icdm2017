We investigate how a neuron encodes the external stimulus and the sensitivity of neuronal firing rate to noises. Noisy direct current IEF (DCIEF) and alternating current IEF (ACIEF) are added into the model at the bifurcation point, respectively. Through numerical simulation, we show that frequency and amplitude of the IEF have significant influences on the sensitivity of neuronal firing rate. The presented results may have important implications for neural information processing. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
