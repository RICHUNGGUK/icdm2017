The new wavelet transform realizes accurate computation of coefficients of complex B-spline base functions. It integrates good properties of orthogonality, symmetry and continuity, and offers better approximations to continuous signal than do the Haar wavelet and Daubechies wavelets. All algorithms of the new orthogonal wavelet transform are based on explicit formulas and easy to be implemented.", "paper_title": "ORTHOGONAL WAVELET TRANSFORM OF SIGNAL BASED ON COMPLEX B-SPLINE BASES", "paper_id": "WOS:000314539000004"}
