This tool, referred to as the PCRaster Python library, consists of. (1) the standard Python programming language, which is a generic, interpreted scripting language, supporting object oriented programming; (2) a large set of spatial and temporal functions on raster maps that are embedded in the Python language as an extension; (3) a framework provided as a Python class to construct and run iterative temporal models and to calculate error propagation with Monte Carlo simulation; and (4) visualization routines to display spatio-temporal data read and written by this framework. Python is a high-level programming language, and users of the tool do not have to be specialist computer programmers. Users of the PCRaster Python library can take advantage of several other Python libraries, such as extensions for matrix algebra and for modelling in three spatial dimensions.", "paper_title": "Modelling landscape dynamics with Python", "paper_id": "WOS:000246967200002"}
