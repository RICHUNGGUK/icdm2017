The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach is typically used to obtain the parameter estimates. The likelihood estimates do not exist when the number of parameters, p, is greater than the number of observations n. The MLE also does not exist if there are no overlapping observations in the data. In a situation where the number of parameters is less than the sample size but p is approaching to n, the likelihood estimates may not exist, and if they exist they may have quite large standard errors. An estimation method is proposed to address the last two issues, i.e. complete separation and the case when p approaches n, but not the case when p>n. The proposed method does not use any penalty term but uses pseudo-observations to regularize the observed responses by downgrading their effect so that they become close to the underlying probabilities. The estimates can be computed easily with all commonly used statistical packages supporting the fitting of POMs with weights. Estimates are compared with MLE in a simulation study and an application to the real data.", "paper_title": "Regularized proportional odds models", "paper_id": "WOS:000343315700003"}
