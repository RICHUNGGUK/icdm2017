Moreover, we also point out that autocontinuity from above cannot imply double asymptotic null-additivity for monotonic measures using a counterexample contrary to the case of fuzzy measures proved by Ha et al. [Fundamental convergence of sequences of measurable junctions on fuzzy measure space. Fuzzy Sets and Systems 95 (1998) 77-81]. Finally, we show that for monotonic measure convergence, double asymptotic null-additivity is better than autocontinuity from above. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
