We conducted a pilot survey in February 2005 and our full survey in November 2005. We compare the results from these two surveys and the previous ( July 2003) survey of P3P adoption. In general, we find that P3P adoption is stagnant, and errors in P3P documents are a regular occurrence. In addition, very little maintenance of P3P policies is apparent. These observations call into question P3P's viability as an online privacy-enhancing technology. Our survey exceeds other previous surveys in our use of both detailed statistical analysis and scope; our February pilot survey analyzed more than 23,000 unique Web sites, and our full survey in November 2005 analyzed more than 100,000 unique Web sites.", "paper_title": "Survey and analysis of the P3P protocol's agents, adoption, maintenance, and future", "paper_id": "WOS:000246207400006"}
