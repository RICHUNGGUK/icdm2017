In this paper, we address this problem and introduce an adaptive evolutionary approach that uses a genetic algorithm in an adaptive process. An application of this approach to the dynamic vehicle routing problem with time windows is presented. We compare the adaptive version of a hybrid genetic algorithm with the non-adaptive one with respect to the robustness and the quality of the generated solutions. The results obtained show the ability of our operator combination adaptation approach to produce solutions that are superior to hand-tuning and other adaptive methods with respect to performance sensitivity and robustness.
