Hairpin (-free) DNA structures have numerous applications to DNA computing and molecular genetics in general. A word is called hairpin-free if it cannot be written in the form xvy theta(v)z, with certain additional conditions, for an involution theta (a function theta with the property that theta(2) equals the identity function). A particular involution, the so-called Watson-Crick involution, can characterize binding of two DNA strands. We study algebraic and decision properties, finiteness and descriptional complexity of hairpin (-free) languages. We show an existence of polynomial-time algorithms deciding hairpin-freeness of regular and context-free sets. Two related DNA secondary structures are considered, taking into the account imperfect bonds (bulges, mismatches) and multiple hairpins. Finally, effective methods for design of long hairpin-free DNA words are given.", "paper_title": "A formal language analysis of DNA hairpin structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000240246700005"}
