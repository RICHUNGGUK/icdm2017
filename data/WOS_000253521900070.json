According to characteristics of samples spatial distribution the number of linguistic values of every input and the means and deviations of corresponding membership functions are determined. So the reasonable fuzzy space partition is got. Further a subtractive clustering algorithm is used to derive cluster centers from samples. With the parameters of linguistic values the cluster centers are fuzzified to get a more concise rule set with importance for every rule. Thus redundant rules in the fuzzy space are deleted. Then antecedent parts of all rules determine how a fuzzification layer and an inference layer connect. Next, weights of the defuzzification layer are initialized by a least square algorithm. After the network is built, a hybrid method combining a gradient descent algorithm and a least square algorithm is applied to tune the parameters in it. Simultaneous, an adaptive learning rate which is identified from input-state stability theory is adopted to insure stability of the network. The improved T-S fuzzy neural network (ITSFNN) has a compact structure, high training speed, good simulation precision, and generalization ability. To evaluate the performance of the ITSFNN, we experiment with two nonlinear examples. A comparative analysis reveals the proposed T-S fuzzy neural network exhibits a higher accuracy and better generalization ability than ordinary T-S fuzzy neural network. Finally, it is applied to predict markup percent of the construction bidding system and has a better prediction capability in comparison to some previous models.
