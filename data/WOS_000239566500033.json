We aim to build on the formative work of Ren, Eakins and Briggs who produced an initial ground truth database. Human participants were asked to draw and rank their perceptions of the,parts of a series of figurative images. These rankings were then used to score the perceptions, identify the preferred human breakdowns and thus allow us to induce perceptual rules for human decomposition of figurative images. The results suggest that the human breakdowns follow well-known perceptual principles in particular the Gestalt laws.", "paper_title": "Eliciting perceptual ground truth for image segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566500033"}
