It focuses on the case when a necessity-measured atomic flexible condition is imposed on the values of a fuzzy numerical attribute. The proposal is to apply a classical indexing structure for numerical crisp data, a B+-tree combined with a Hilbert curve. The use of such a common indexing technique makes its incorporation into current systems straightforward. The efficiency of the proposal is compared with that of another indexing procedure for similar fuzzy data and flexible query types. Experimental results reveal that the performance of the proposed method is similar and more stable than that of its competitor.", "paper_title": "INDEXING FUZZY NUMERICAL DATA WITH A B+ TREE FOR FAST RETRIEVAL USING NECESSITY-MEASURED FLEXIBLE CONDITIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000268447700002"}
