A research model was used to explain the acceptance of the technology of 140 participated physicians from three hospitals. The results indicated that the research model was acceptable with a reasonable goodness-of-fit. Both performance expectancy and effort expectancy have significant impact on physicians' intention to use the CDSS, and further influence their actual utilization behavior. Marginal supports were found on the paths of social influence to usage intention and the facilitating condition to use behavior. Based on the research findings, implications and limitations are then discussed for future possible research. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
