Conventional implementations of echo cancellers are often the adaptive transversal filter architectures due to the simplicity and robustness of stability and convergence. However, the conventional echo cancellers suffer from high cost problem especially when the response time of the echo is long. In this paper, a new cost-efficient architecture of echo cancellers, targeting on 10GBase-T Ethernet System, is presented. The proposed scheme inherits the concept of channel shortening which is widely employed in DSL systems. A shortened impulse response filter is implemented at the receiver to shorten the impulse response of the echo signal. Hence, the overall cost of echo cancellers can be reduced. We generalize the channel shortening architecture to a joint multi-channel shortening scheme. The joint multi-channel shortening architecture can be applied to multiple-input multiple-output wireline communication systems to further reduce both the cost of echo and near-end crosstalk (NEXT) cancellers. We apply the proposed scheme to 10GBase-T Ethernet system. The simulation results show that the proposed echo and NEXT cancellers can save up to 35% hardware cost compared to the conventional transversal implementations.", "paper_title": "Cost-effective joint echo-NEXT canceller designs for 10GBase-T Ethernet Systems based on a shortened impulse response filter (SIRF) scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000255742500005"}
