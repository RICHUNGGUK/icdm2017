A reversible data hiding method can extract the cover image from a stego-image without distortion after extracting the hidden data. In this paper a semi-reversible data hiding method that utilizes interpolation and the least significant substitution technique is proposed. First, interpolation methods are used to scale up and down the cover image before hiding secret data for a higher capacity and quality. Secondly, the LSB substitution method is used to embed secret data. Experimental results show that the proposed method can embed a large amount of secret data while keeping very high visual quality, where the PSNR is guaranteed to be 37.54 dB (k = 3) and 43.94 dB (k = 2).", "paper_title": "Steganographic method based on interpolation and LSB substitution of digital images", "paper_id": "WOS:000351394500021"}
