Design/methodology/approach - An exhaustive model based on Multi-conductor Transmission Lines (MTLs) theory has been used. The governing telegraphist's equations have been solved by Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. Findings - The results demonstrated that there are some overvoltages at the end and middle turns that should be considered in insulation design. The magnitudes of these overvoltages are several times more than the steady state value of the corresponding turn which cause very high electric field stresses. Originality/value - The paper describes results obtained from an original and innovative implementation of FDTD method in transmission line modelling and is applied properly to air-cored pulse transformers.", "paper_title": "Study of very fast transient overvoltages in air-cored pulsed transformers", "paper_id": "WOS:000302384700019"}
