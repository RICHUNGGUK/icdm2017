Other areas of chemometrics also deal with distilling relevant information in highly information-rich data sets. Traditional tools such as the principal component analysis or hierarchical clustering are often not optimal for providing succinct and accurate information from high rank data sets. A relatively little known approach that has shown significant potential in other areas of research is coclustering, where a data matrix is simultaneously clustered in its rows and columns (objects and variables usually). Coclustering is the tool of choice when only a subset of variables is related to a specific grouping among objects. Hence, coclustering allows a select number of objects to share a particular behavior on a select number of variables. In this paper, we describe the basics of coclustering and use three different example data sets to show the advantages and shortcomings of coclustering.
