We consider two types of stabilization: the self- and pseudo-stabilization. Our goal is to implement the self- and/or pseudo-stabilizing leader election in systems with process crashes, weak reliability, and synchrony assumptions. We try to propose, when it is possible, communication-efficient implementations. Our approach allows to obtain algorithms that tolerate both transient and crash failures. Note that some of our solutions are adapted from existing fault-tolerant algorithms. The motivation here is not to propose new algorithms but merely to show some assumptions required to obtain stabilizing leader elections in systems with crash failures. In particular, we focus on the borderline assumptions where we go from the possibility to have self-stabilizing solutions to the possibility to only have pseudostabilizing ones.
