The construction of a bottom-up RLC clock tree with minimal clock delay and zero skew is crucial to ensure good SoC performance. This study proves that an RLC clock tree construction always has no zero skew owing to skew upward propagation. Specifically, this study proposes the insertion of two unit-size buffers associated with the binary search for a tapping point into each pair of subtrees to interrupt the non-zero skew upward propagation. This technique enables reliable construction of a buffered RLC clock tree with zero skew. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by assessing benchmarks.", "paper_title": "Zero-skew driven buffered RLC clock tree construction", "paper_id": "WOS:000245194000014"}
