To overcome these problems, various flash-aware strategies have been suggested in terms of buffer cache, file system, FTL, and others. Also, the recent development of next-generation nonvolatile memory types such as MRAM, FeRAM, and PRAM provide higher commercial value to Non-Volatile RAM (NVRAM). At today's prices, however, they are not yet cost-effective. In this paper, we suggest the utilization of small-sized, next-generation NVRAM as a write buffer to improve the overall performance of NAND flash memory-based storage systems. We propose various block-based NVRAM write buffer management policies and evaluate the performance improvement of NAND flash memory-based storage systems under each policy. Also, we propose a novel write buffer-aware flash translation layer algorithm, optimistic FTL, which is designed to harmonize well with NVRAM write buffers. Simulation results show that the proposed buffer management policies outperform the traditional page-based LRU algorithm and the proposed optimistic FTL outperforms previous log block-based FTL algorithms, such as BAST and FAST.", "paper_title": "Performance Trade-Offs in Using NVRAM Write Buffer for Flash Memory-Based Storage Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000265412200003"}
