A recent paper by Bshouty et al. (2003) shows that the class of polynomial-size DNF formulas is efficiently learnable in this random walk model; this result suggests that the Random Walk model is more powerful than comparable standard models of learning from independent examples, in which similarly efficient DNF learning algorithms are not known. We give strong evidence that the Random Walk model is indeed more powerful than the standard model, by showing that if any cryptographic one-way function exists (a universally held belief in cryptography), then there is a class of functions that can be learned efficiently in the Random Walk setting but not in the standard setting where all examples are independent.", "paper_title": "Separating models of learning from correlated and uncorrelated data", "paper_id": "WOS:000247002600004"}
