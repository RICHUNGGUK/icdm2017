We have noticed that the there are little work has been cone in cross-authentication for heterogeneous domains. In this paper, we target on this problem, and propose a cross-authentication model for heterogeneous domains on active networks. We implement our model with the method of system redundancy. We make the simulation of active networks under Windows environment. Moreover, we give out the security proof of our model. Our system implements mutual entity authentication among heterogeneous domains based on PKI and ID-PKC. The theoretical analysis and the preliminary experiments demonstrate that the proposed system possesses the properties of high security and stability.", "paper_title": "A cross-authentication model and implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000258348100004"}
