The proposed DAC implemented in a 0.35 mu m CMOS n-well process employs three stage 4 bit thermometer decoders and deglitch circuits to minimize glitch energy and linearity error. The measurement results show a +/- 1.5 LSB/+/- 1.3 LSB of INL/DNL and 31 pV center dot s of glitch energy. ENOB and SFDR are measured to be 10.5 bit and 71.09 dB at sampling frequency of 120 MHz and input frequency of 1 MHz with a total power consumption of 105 mW. Linearity error between I-channel DAC and Q-channel DAC is measured to be approximately 1.5 mV, i.e. the accuracy of 13 bit.", "paper_title": "An I/Q channel 12-bit 120 MS/s CMOS DAC with deglitch circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000304874300009"}
