GPU implementation of up to ninth-order accurate WENO schemes for the multi-dimensional Euler equations of gas dynamics is presented. The implementation detail is discussed in the paper. The computational times of different schemes are obtained and the speedups are reported for different number of grid points. Furthermore, the execution times for the main kernels of the code are given and compared with each other. The numerical experiments show the speedups for the WENO schemes are very promising especially for fine grids.
