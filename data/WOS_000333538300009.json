This, up to the existence of epsilon, matches the approximation ratio obtained by the trivial algorithm that just picks an assignment at random, and thus the result is tight. Said equivalently, the result proves that Max-NTW is approximation resistant on satisfiable instances, and this makes complete our understanding of arity three maximum constraint satisfaction problems with regards to approximation resistance.", "paper_title": "ON THE NP-HARDNESS OF MAX-NOT-2", "paper_id": "WOS:000333538300009"}
