Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on an extensive survey of recent literature as well as on the authors' own experience in the modelling of RFB systems. Findings - RFBs present unique features which make them suitable for distributed storage and thus particularly interesting in the context of smart grids. Current research aims at resolving some outstanding issues which still limit the widespread use of RFBs. Practical implications - A more widespread use of energy storage technologies, and RFBs in particular, will allow a much higher penetration of renewable energy sources. Originality/value - The paper presents one of the few comprehensive studies on RFBs including both technological and modelling aspects.", "paper_title": "Large scale energy storage with redox flow batteries", "paper_id": "WOS:000324445800002"}
