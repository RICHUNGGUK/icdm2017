In this paper, we jointly optimize the transmit power, the number of active antennas, and the antenna subsets at the transmitter and receiver to maximize the energy efficiency. The optimal solution can be obtained by exhaustive search; suboptimal algorithms are also developed to reduce the complexity. Simulation results show that antenna selection can improve the energy efficiency significantly.", "paper_title": "Antenna Selection for Energy-Efficient MIMO Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696400007"}
