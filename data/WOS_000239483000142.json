General non-Gaussian systems are considered and the tracked objective is the statistic information (including the moments and the entropy) of a given target probability density function (PDF), rather than a deterministic signal. The control is aiming at making the statistic information of the output PDFs to follow those of a target PDF. The B-spline neural network with modelling error is applied to approximate the corresponding dynamic functional. For the nonlinear weighting system with time delays in the presence of exogenous disturbances, the generalized H-2 and H. optimization technique is then used to guarantee the tracking, robustness and transient performance simultaneously in terms of LMI formulations.", "paper_title": "Statistic tracking control: A multi-objective optimization algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000142"}
