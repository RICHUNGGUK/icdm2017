Many approaches assume that the background scene is static or undergoes the planar perspective transformation. In this paper, we relax these restrictions and present a comprehensive system for accurately computing object motion, layer, and depth information. A novel algorithm that combines different clues to extract the foreground layer is proposed, where a voting-like scheme robust to outliers is employed in optimization. The system is capable of handling difficult examples in which the background is nonplanar and the camera freely moves during video capturing. Our work finds several applications, such as high-quality view interpolation and video editing.", "paper_title": "Robust Bilayer Segmentation and Motion/Depth Estimation with a Handheld Camera", "paper_id": "WOS:000286204700012"}
