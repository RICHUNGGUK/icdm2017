And this new model takes advantage of support vector machine (SVM) theory to find the relationship between the harmonic current and all voltage components. Then a comparison between the linear regressive model and nonlinear regressive models with different kernel functions has been made. The computer simulation has revealed that the model implemented by the nonlinear regression with Polynomial kernel is more precise, and is superior to other regressions.", "paper_title": "Harmonic source model based on support vector machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600074"}
