The objective of this work is to apply the models of material and structural optimization to the design of passive vibration isolators. A computational tool to identify the optimal viscoelastic characteristics of a nonlinear one-dimensional isolator was developed. The cost functional involves the minimization of a weighted average of the maximum transient and steady state response amplitudes for a set of predefined dynamic loads. The optimal isolator behaviour is obtained by a simulated annealing method. The solutions obtained are analyzed and discussed concerning their dependence on the applied forces and objective function selection. The results obtained can facilitate the design of elastomeric materials with improved behaviour in terms of dynamic stiffness for passive vibration control.", "paper_title": "Optimization of passive vibration isolators mechanical characteristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000279842400001"}
