Compared with other algorithms, this method can work efficiently even when the source signals are not well grounded. Moreover, this method is insensitive to the particular underlying distribution of the source data. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our approach in achieving satisfactory results regardless of whether the source data are well grounded or not. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
