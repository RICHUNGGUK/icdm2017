We assume that the system is closed and static and define a global cost function that may be used to identify the states of the system. The cost function is minimized with the help of the Langevin equation. We demonstrate the use of the proposed model with the help of simulated data.", "paper_title": "Modeling Buyer-Seller Relations in a Closed System of Shared Resources, Incorporating Personal Preference and Trust", "paper_id": "WOS:000269155600008"}
