More and more processes require analysis and insights that allow controlling them beyond the mere execution of rules and beyond prefitted controllers in order to automatically keep them within the desired conditions. Automatic and flexible decision making based on challenging conditions such as increasing amounts of information, lacking prior knowledge of data, incomplete, missing or contradicting data, becomes the key challenges for future automation technologies. In this paper, we present a survey of methods on how to integrate some of a human's capabilities for the use in automation applications. Theories for process modeling, decision making, and hierarchical processing are summarized as well as applications thereof in such areas as Ambient Assisted Living or Robotics given.", "paper_title": "Cognitive AutomationSurvey of Novel Artificial General Intelligence Methods for the Automation of Human Technical Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000302720000002"}
