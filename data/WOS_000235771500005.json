The goal of these algorithms is to perform, for any behavior of the system, asymptotically as well as the best expert. We provide a survey of these algorithms and show how they can be used for adaptive routing in different packet switched networks.", "paper_title": "Adaptive routing using expert advice", "paper_id": "WOS:000235771500005"}
