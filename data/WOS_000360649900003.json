The different interaction conditions between particles and walls were considered for particles with Stokes numbers ranging from 0.1 to 10(4). The particle deposition rates were predicted accurately because of the accurate calculation of turbulence and particle dispersion. It was found the interaction between the turbulent particles and the walls determined the re-entrainment mechanism of inertial particles away from the wall. The dispersion of deposition of particles were independent of the wall conditions in the partial diffusional and whole diffusion-impaction regime, consistent with a log-log law with particle Stokes number, which was found to be V-dep(+) = 4: 57 x 10(-4)tau(p)+(1.82). The deposition rate decreased with decreasing adhesion of the wall in the inertia-moderated regime. The present results may be helpful for establishing and evaluating accurate prediction models of micro-particle deposition rates in various engineering applications.", "paper_title": "Numerical prediction on deposition of micro-particulate matter in turbulent channel flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000360649900003"}
