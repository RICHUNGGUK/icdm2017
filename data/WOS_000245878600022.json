Several techniques have been developed recently to map the available information into a set of features (feature space) that improve the classification performance. Kernel functions provide a nonlinear mapping that implicitly transforms the input space to a new feature space where data can be separated, clustered and classified more easily. In this paper a kernel revised version of the Total Recognition by Adaptive Classification Experiments (T.R.A.C.E) algorithm, an iterative k-means like classification algorithm is presented.
