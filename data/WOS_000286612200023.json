This paper will mainly focus on those systems whose insertion operations are performed in a context-free fashion, called context-free insertion systems, and obtain several characterizations of language families with the help of other primitive languages (like star languages) as well as simple operations (like projections, weak-codings). For each k >= 1, a language L is a k-star language if L = F(+) for some finite set F with the length of each string in F is no more than k. The results of this kind have already been presented in [10] by Paun et al., while the purpose of this paper is to prove enhanced versions of them. Specifically, we show that each context-free language L can be represented in the form L = h(L(gamma)boolean AND F(+)), where gamma is an insertion system of weight (3, 0) (at most three symbols are inserted in a context-free manner), h is a projection, and F(+) is a 2-star language. A similar characterization can be obtained for recursively enumerable languages, where insertion systems of weight (3, 3) and 2-star languages are involved.", "paper_title": "MORPHIC CHARACTERIZATIONS OF LANGUAGE FAMILIES IN TERMS OF INSERTION SYSTEMS AND STAR LANGUAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612200023"}
