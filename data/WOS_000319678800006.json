Most studies focus on the single-reader and single-tag case to provide security protection, which leads to certain limitations for diverse applications. This paper proposes a grouping-proofs-based authentication protocol (GUPA) to address the security issue for multiple readers and tags simultaneous identification in distributed RFID systems. In GUPA, distributed authentication mode with independent subgrouping proofs is adopted to enhance hierarchical protection; an asymmetric denial scheme is applied to grant fault-tolerance capabilities against an illegal reader or tag; and a sequence-based odd-even alternation group subscript is presented to define a function for secret updating. Meanwhile, GUPA is analyzed to be robust enough to resist major attacks such as replay, forgery, tracking, and denial of proof. Furthermore, performance analysis shows that compared with the known grouping-proof or yoking-proof-based protocols, GUPA has lower communication overhead and computation load. It indicates that GUPA realizing both secure and simultaneous identification is efficient for resource-constrained distributed RFID systems.", "paper_title": "Grouping-Proofs-Based Authentication Protocol for Distributed RFID Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000319678800006"}
