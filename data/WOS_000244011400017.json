This study proposes a method which executes a assignment of worker or workload control by genetic algorithm simultaneously. We chose a project management problem which can evaluate its congestion by job arrival ratio in a operation. In simulation, we show that a proposed process control method using genetic algorithm is superior to the usual method which makes a assignment of worker by the Dijkstra method and a workload control by the gradient method.", "paper_title": "Adaptive worker's arrangement and workload control for project management by genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000244011400017"}
