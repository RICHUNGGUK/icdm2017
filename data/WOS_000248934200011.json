To accurately estimate echo path keeping the high level of performance in echo erasing, this scheme uses two filters, of which one filter is utilized as a guideline which does not erases echo but helps updating of the other filter, which actually erases echo. In addition, we propose a new filter dividing technique to apply to the filter divide scheme, and utilize this as the guideline. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves the convergence behavior compared to conventional methods both in system mismatch (i.e., normalized coefficients error) and Echo Return Loss Enhancement (ERLE).", "paper_title": "Stereophonic acoustic echo canceler based on two-filter scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000248934200011"}
