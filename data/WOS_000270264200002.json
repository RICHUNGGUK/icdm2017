Whereas numerous methods have been presented for this purpose, up to now no standardized evaluation methodology has been published to reliably evaluate and compare the performance of the existing or newly developed coronary artery centerline extraction algorithms. This paper describes a standardized evaluation methodology and reference database for the quantitative evaluation of coronary artery centerline extraction algorithms. The contribution of this work is fourfold: (1) a method is described to create a consensus centerline with multiple observers, (2) well-defined measures are presented for the evaluation of coronary artery centerline extraction algorithms, (3) a database containing 32 cardiac CTA datasets with corresponding reference standard is described and made available. and (4) 13 coronary artery centerline extraction algorithms, implemented by different research groups, are quantitatively evaluated and compared. The presented evaluation framework is made available to the medical imaging community for benchmarking existing or newly developed coronary centerline extraction algorithms. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
