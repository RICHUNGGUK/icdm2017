Simulations of steady state and dynamic airflow during inhalation are performed at flow rates of 9-60l/min. Depositions for particles of size 0.5-20 mu m are determined and compared with experimental and simulation results from the literature in terms of deposition efficiencies. The nasal model is validated by comparison with experimental and simulation results from the literature for particle deposition under steady-state flow. The distribution of deposited particles in the nasal cavity is presented in terms of an axial deposition distribution as well as a bivariate axial deposition and particle size distribution. Simulations of dynamic airflow and particle deposition during an inhalation cycle are performed for different nasal cavity outlet pressure variations and different particle injections. The total particle deposition efficiency under dynamic flow is found to depend strongly on the dynamics of airflow as well as the type of particle injection.", "paper_title": "Computational model of particle deposition in the nasal cavity under steady and dynamic flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000345142700007"}
