This study aims to study the speed-dependent packet error rate (PER) of wireless sensor radios on rotating mechanical structures. A series of rotating IEEE 802.15.4 sensor radio transmission experiments and vector network analyzer measurements have been conducted to derive and validate a predictive PER model for a fast rotating sensor radio channel based on channel impulse response measurements. The proposed predictive PER model, including power attenuation, bit error rate (BER) and PER sub-models, captures the channel property of rotating sensors based on the received signal strength and the radio receiving sensitivity. The PER model has accurately predicted the PER profile of sensors on a rotating machine tool spindle as well as a rotating plate of a prototype rotation system. The analysis provides an in-depth understanding of how multipath propagation causes the fast power variation and the resulting speed-dependent PER for wireless sensors on rotating mechanical structures.", "paper_title": "Study of Speed-Dependent Packet Error Rate for Wireless Sensor on Rotating Mechanical Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000312839600007"}
