For a given such matrix A, we consider a matrix A' that is obtained by removing some rows and corresponding columns with too many value 1 entries. Then for this A', we show that the largest eigenvalue is asymptotically close to alpha + 1 and its eigenvector is almost parallel to all one vector (1,..., 1).", "paper_title": "Spectral Analysis of Random Sparse Matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000292480700006"}
