Most of the work in this domain is either focused on analyzing retrieval model bias or proposing different retrieval strategies for increasing documents retrievability. However, little is known about the relationship between retrievability and other information retrieval effectiveness measures such as precision, recall, MAP and others. In this study, we analyze the relationship between retrievability and effectiveness measures. Our experiments on TREC chemical retrieval track dataset reveal that these two independent goals of information retrieval, maximizing retrievability of documents and maximizing effectiveness of retrieval models are quite related to each other. This correlation provides an attractive alternative for evaluating, ranking or optimizing retrieval models' effectiveness on a given corpus without requiring any ground truth available (relevance judgments).", "paper_title": "Automatic ranking of retrieval models using retrievability measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000341835200008"}
