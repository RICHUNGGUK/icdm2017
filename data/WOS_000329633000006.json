This map is generally the object of a clustering analysis step which aims to partition the referents vectors (map neurons) into compact and well-separated groups. In this paper, we consider the problem of the clustering SOM using different aspects: partitioning, hierarchical and graph coloring based techniques. Unlike the traditional clustering SOM techniques, which use k-means or hierarchical clustering, the graph-based approaches have the advantage of providing a partitioning of the SOM by simultaneously using dissimilarities and neighborhood relations provided by the map. We present the experimental results of several comparisons between these different ways of clustering.", "paper_title": "Different Aspects of Clustering The Self-Organizing Maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000329633000006"}
