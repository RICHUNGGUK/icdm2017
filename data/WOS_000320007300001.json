The need for multiple sensors and constant monitoring lead these systems to be energy hungry and expensive with short operating lifetimes. In this paper, we offer a review of existing work of WBAN and focus on energy-aware management in it. We emphasize that nodes computation, wireless communication, topology deployment and energy scavenging are main domains for making a long-lived WBAN. We study the popular power management technique Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and identify the impact of slack time in Dynamic Power Management (DPM), and finally propose an enhanced dynamic power management method to schedule scaled jobs at slack time with the goal of saving energy and keeping system reliability. Theoretical and experimental evaluations exhibit the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Energy-aware Management in Wireless Body Area Network System", "paper_id": "WOS:000320007300001"}
