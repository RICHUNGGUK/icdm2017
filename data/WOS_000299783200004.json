A pattern is distinctive if it occurs with higher probability in a corpus as compared to an anticorpus. A small set of transcribed Cretan folk songs was encoded, organized using a knowledge base of classes, and mined using distinctive pattern discovery methods. In this exploratory study several highly distinctive melodic patterns emerge, indicating the ability of distinctive patterns to describe subgroups of folk songs.", "paper_title": "Comparative Pattern Analysis of Cretan Folk Songs", "paper_id": "WOS:000299783200004"}
