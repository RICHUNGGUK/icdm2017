The SA-BPS is considered not only to be used for inner layer user pairing within femtocell user equipments (HUEs) to increase spectrum efficiency, but also to be used for cross layer user pairing between HUEs and macrocell user equipments (MUEs) to cancel the cross layer interference from MUEs to HUEs. As a growth control coefficient is used in SA-BPS to control the growth of average BER of users in the pairing group, rapid user BER deterioration can be prevented by adopting a proper coefficient. Simulation results show that, the SA-BPS outperforms RPS, DPS, and the conventional SA algorithm in terms of BER performance, whether used for inner layer user pairing or cross layer user pairing. Also, the mode switching signal to interference ratio (SIR) threshold between inner and cross layer user pairing are obtained by simulation in three cross layer interference power distribution scenarios.", "paper_title": "Research on user pairing algorithm for LTE femtocell uplink", "paper_id": "WOS:000339365500009"}
