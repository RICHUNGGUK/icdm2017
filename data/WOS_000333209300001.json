In our scheme, one secret (2 (n + x) -aEuro parts per thousand 1)-ary digit is hidden in a group of pixels in an image as a modified secret digit. Our proposed scheme has an embedding rate , which is greater than the rate of the EMD scheme, which is R = log(2)(2n + 1)/n for n a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 2 . Embedding rate R is the number of secret bits embedded in each cover pixel. Our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is able to embed 3 times as many secret bits in an image compared to the original EMD embedding scheme when n = 2 and x = 5. Our scheme has low time complexity and achieves this higher embedding performance while retaining reasonable perceptual quality for the image. An experiment verifies these features of our proposed data hiding scheme.", "paper_title": "Data hiding by an improved exploiting modification direction", "paper_id": "WOS:000333209300001"}
