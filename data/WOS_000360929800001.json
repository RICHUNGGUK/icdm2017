In this paper, an innovative optimization approach has been developed to facilitate sustainable process planning and scheduling. In the approach, honey-bee mating and annealing processes are simulated to optimize multi-objectives including energy consumption, makespan and the balanced machine utilization. Experiments on practical cases show that the optimization results from this approach are promising in comparison with those from a genetic algorithm, a honey bee mating optimization algorithm, ant colony optimization and a simulated annealing algorithm, respectively.", "paper_title": "A hybrid optimization approach for sustainable process planning and scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000360929800001"}
