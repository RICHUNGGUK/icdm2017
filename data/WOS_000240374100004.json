Unlike the existing thermal LB models, this model is entirely based on the framework of the LB method and directly derived from the macro temperature equation. Moreover, the computation cost decreases because the computation of complicated material derivative term has been avoided successfully. To testify the simulation capability of this model, the thermal Couette flow is simulated and the results indicate agreement with the analytical solutions.", "paper_title": "Thermal lattice Boltzmann model with viscous heat dissipation in the incompressible limit", "paper_id": "WOS:000240374100004"}
