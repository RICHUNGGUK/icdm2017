Consequently, a correct diagnosis of a pump failure needs to consider many symptoms and hydraulic or mechanical causes. But, due to nonlinear, time-varying behavior and imprecise measurement information of the systems it is difficult to deal with pumps failures with precise mathematical equations, while human operators with the aid of their practical experience can handle these complex situations, with only a set of imprecise linguistic if-then rules and imprecise system state, but this procedure is time consuming and needs the knowledge of human experts and experienced maintenance personnel. The purpose of this study is to provide a correct and timely diagnosis mechanism of pump failures by knowledge acquisition through a fuzzy rule-based inference system which could approximate human reasoning. The proposed fuzzy inference system by: (I) reduction of human error, (2) reduction of repair time (3) creation of expert knowledge which could be used for training (4) reduction of unnecessary expenditures for upgrades and finally, (5) reduction of maintenance costs, will improve the maintenance process. The novelty of this work is the knowledge acquisition (the extraction of linguistic rules) through the interactive impact of the critical failure modes on the both hydraulic and mechanical operating parameters including flow rate, discharge pressure, NPSHR (Net Positive Suction Head Required), BHP (Brake Horse Power), efficiency, vibration and temperature. The proposed approach is tested and applied to a petrochemical industry. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
