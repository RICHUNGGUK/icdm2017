So far, there is only one ranking method for such sets, whereas there are many similarity and uncertainty measures. A new ranking method and a new similarity measure for IT2 FSs are proposed in this paper. All these ranking methods, similarity measures and uncertainty measures are compared based on real survey data and then the most suitable ranking method, similarity measure and uncertainty measure that can be used in the computing with words paradigm are suggested. The results are useful in understanding the uncertainties associated with linguistic terms and hence how to use them effectively in Survey design and linguistic information processing.
