This requires a segmentation of the larynx cartilage structures from computed tomography (CT) datasets. In our work, we use 3D Stable Mass-Spring Models (SMSMs) for this segmentation task. Thereto, we create a specific 3D deformable shape model for the segmentation of the thyroid cartilage. A new concept for elastic initialization of this model is presented, allowing the deformable model to adapt specifically to patient-specific shape variations and pathological deformations. We show that using our generation and initialization method, prototypical 3D deformable shape models can be adapted to very different patients without any prior training and prior knowledge about new patients' data.", "paper_title": "Generation and initialization of stable 3D mass-spring models for the segmentation of the thyroid cartilage", "paper_id": "WOS:000241486800017"}
