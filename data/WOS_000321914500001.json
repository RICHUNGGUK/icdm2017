This variation may lead to seemingly inexplicable differences in query results. In this paper, we present SECRET, a model of the behavior of SPEs. SECRET is a descriptive model that allows users to analyze the behavior of systems and understand the results of window-based queries (with time- and tuple-based windows) for a broad range of heterogeneous SPEs. The model is the result of extensive analysis and experimentation with several commercial and academic engines. In the paper, we describe the types of heterogeneity found in existing engines and show with experiments on real systems that our model can explain the key differences in windowing behavior.", "paper_title": "Modeling the execution semantics of stream processing engines with SECRET", "paper_id": "WOS:000321914500001"}
