The governing equations expressing the conservation of mass, momentum and energy with first-order slip velocity and temperature jump boundary conditions were solved numerically. The numerical model based on the Finite Volume Method was validated using the available data. The study reveals significant impact of slip velocity and temperature jump conditions on the hydrodynamic and thermal flows. For very small injection rates, all profiles and quantities remain unchanged compared to the impermeable wall case. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
