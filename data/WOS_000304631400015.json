Three challenging issues are critical to design of an environmental monitoring system, including energy efficiency of sensors, coverage of monitoring area, and validity of sensed data. In this paper, we design and implement an environmental monitoring system on the WSRN, namely distributed air pollution sensing (APS) system, to monitor the air quality in urban environment by taking the three issues into consideration. We apply the sensing region partition and monitoring period concepts for efficient sensed data transmission. We implement the energy-efficient reporting mechanism to prevent redundant transmissions of sensed data to save energy consumption of sensors and prolong network lifetime of the WSRN.
