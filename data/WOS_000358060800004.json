In this paper, the importance boundary sampling (IBS) method is proposed to enhance the efficiency of Kriging-model-based RBDO. Rather than fitting all the parts of the limit state constraints precisely within the design region, the proposed IBS mainly selects sample points on the critical parts of the limit state constraints. Two importance coefficients are proposed to identify these critical boundary parts: the first importance coefficient is determined by the objective function value; and the second one is calculated using the joint probability density value of the design variables. The sampling and optimization processes are conducted alternately to select the sample points more rationally. The computation capability of the proposed method is demonstrated using several mathematical RBDO problems and a box girder design application. The comparison results show that the proposed IBS method is very efficient.", "paper_title": "An important boundary sampling method for reliability-based design optimization using kriging model", "paper_id": "WOS:000358060800004"}
