An extended bumpless switching technique is proposed via linear quadratic (LQ) optimal control and internal model principle. Then a sufficient condition for guaranteeing the switched closed-loop systems to be stable under bumpless switching is developed. Dwell-time and multiple Lyapunov functions methodologies are utilized for the stability analysis and switching law design. Simulations for the generic hypersonic vehicle model show the effectiveness of the proposed design method.", "paper_title": "BUMPLESS SWITCHING SCHEME DESIGN AND ITS APPLICATION TO HYPERSONIC VEHICLE MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000299648400012"}
