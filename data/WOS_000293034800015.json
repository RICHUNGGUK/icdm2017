The hybrid remapping is performed in two steps. In the first step, only nodes of the grid that lie inside subdomains occupied by single materials are moved. At this stage, computationally cheap swept-region remapping is used. In the second step, nodes that are vertices of mixed cells (cells containing several materials) and vertices of some cells in a buffer zone around mixed cells are moved. At this stage, intersection-based remapping is used. The hybrid algorithm results in computational expense that lies between swept-region and intersection-based remapping We demonstrate the performance of our new method for both structured and unstructured polygonal grids in two dimensions, as well as for cell-centered and staggered discretizations.
