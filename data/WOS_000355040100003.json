In the real-time HFS environment, the arriving of new jobs is dynamic, while the processes in work stages are not continuous. The decision makers in shop floor level and stage level have different objectives. Therefore, classical off-line HFS scheduling approaches cannot be used under these situations. In this research, two major measures are taken to deal with these specific real-time features. Firstly, a ubiquitous manufacturing (UM) environment is created by deploying advanced wireless devices into value-adding points for the collection and synchronization of real-time shop floor data. Secondly, a multi-:period hierarchical scheduling,(MPHS) mechanism is developed to divide the planning time horizon into multiple shorter periods. The shop floor manapr and stage managers can hierarchically make decisions for their own objectives. Finally, the proposed MPHS mechanism is illustrated by a numerical case study.
