First, combining with the procedure of traditional iterative closest point method, the registration problem was modeled as an optimization problem on Lie group GL (2, R). To assure the registration non-degenerate, some reasonable constraints were introduced into the model by Iwasawa decomposition. Then, a series of quadratic programming were used to approximate the registration problem and a novel affine registration algorithm was proposed. At last, several illustration and comparison experiments were presented to demonstrate the performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Particularly, a way of selecting a good initial registration based on ICA method to achieve the global minimum was suggested.", "paper_title": "Iwasawa decomposition: a new approach to 2D affine registration problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000290032200002"}
