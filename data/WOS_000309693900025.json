The JPEG2000 standard integer lossless 5-3 filter has been implemented. It achieves optimal hardware utilisation with minimal combinational logic block slices and high frequency of operation. To reduce the hardware complexity and to achieve high performance the proposed architecture implements lifting scheme with a single multiplier-free processing element to perform both predict and update operations. Symmetric extension is used at image boundaries without requiring any extra clock cycle. The generic architecture is very flexible and can perform up to five levels of forward transform on any arbitrary image size. Synthesis of the 5-level architecture on Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA shows that the processor can achieve a maximum frequency of operation of 221.44 MHz. The reduced hardware complexity and high frequency of operation render the design suitable for incorporation in image processing applications requiring fast operations. The 5-level design has been successfully implemented on a Xilinx Spartan 3E FPGA, utilising only 1104 slices for a 512-by-512 pixel test image, the lowest hardware requirements for a 5-level discrete wavelet transform processor reported to date.
