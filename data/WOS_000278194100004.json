This scheme incorporates the edge information in multiple scales of the wavelet domain, and it not only locates the position of each edge point, but also estimates its amplitude and identifies its singularity type, namely, step edge and ridge edge. Moreover, for a ridge edge point, the proposed scheme could estimate the width of the ridge. Unlike traditional edge detectors, this method adaptively selects two optimal scales for each edge point to locate it and estimate its direction. As a result, better performances in localization and edge direction estimation are achieved. Experiments on both synthetic and real images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A WAVELET-BASED IMAGE EDGE DETECTION AND ESTIMATION METHOD WITH ADAPTIVE SCALE SELECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000278194100004"}
