In this paper, we propose a measurement for the degree of responsibility of each formula in a knowledge base for the inconsistency of that base. This measurement is given in terms of minimal inconsistent subsets of a knowledge base. Moreover, it can be well explained in the context of causality and responsibility presented by Chockler and Halpern [1]. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
