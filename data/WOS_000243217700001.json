Genome rearrangement problems lead to combinatorial puzzles of finding parsimonious scenarios towards measuring what difference species have and explaining how a species evolves from another. Throughout this chapter, we will focus on the introduction of computing the genomic distance, arising from the effects of a set of rearrangement events, between a pair of genomes. In the end, two experiments on Campanulaceae and Proteobacteria are used to simply show how to exploit the genome rearrangement approach for exposing phylogenctic relationships.", "paper_title": "Exposing phylogenetic relationships by genome rearrangement", "paper_id": "WOS:000243217700001"}
