One can better understand current and future development trends in the relevant field when updated with trends in research fronts. This study uses bibliographic coupling and sliding window to explore the organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) research fronts from 2000 to 2009, and identifies eighteen research fronts that match those predicted by subject experts related to OLED materials. Closer observation of the evolution shows that among the eighteen research fronts, there are four emerging fronts, two growing fronts, eleven stable fronts, and one shrinking front. Bibliographic coupling with sliding window is an effective tool to track the generation, growth, decline, and disappearance of research fronts. Therefore, this analytical method has great potential in discovering the evolution of research fronts.", "paper_title": "Detecting research fronts in OLED field using bibliographic coupling with sliding window", "paper_id": "WOS:000331559800009"}
