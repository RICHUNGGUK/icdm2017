In particular, it is argued that the way in which they characterize positive/negative association has advantages over other measures such as null-invariant measures. Several properties are reviewed and proposed as requirements for an adequate confirmation measure in a data mining context. While none of the well-known confirmation measures satisfy all of these requirements, two new measures are proposed which do and one of these is shown to have a further advantage. Some results suggest that these measures are relatively stable when the number of null transactions varies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
