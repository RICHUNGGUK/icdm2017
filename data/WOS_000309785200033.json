Some intrinsic features of the SPH technique such as the use of link lists and the check for the limits are analysed here in detail. Numerical results are compared to experimental data for several cases studies: (i) Creation of waves by landslides, (ii) Dam-break propagation over wet beds and (iii) Wave-structure interaction. In addition, the capabilities of SPHysics to deal with realistic cases are depicted using the CPU version for several visual examples. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
