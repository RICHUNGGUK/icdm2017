Their protocol reduces computation and communication costs by employing elliptic curve cryptosystems. However, Tan (2010) pointed out that Yang and Chang (2009)'s protocol cannot withstand impersonation and parallel attacks, and further proposed an enhanced protocol to resist these attacks. This paper demonstrates that Tan (2010)'s approach still suffers from impersonation attacks, and presents an efficient and secure three-party authenticated key exchange protocol to overcome shown weaknesses.", "paper_title": "Efficient and secure three-party authenticated key exchange protocol for mobile environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000318558100003"}
