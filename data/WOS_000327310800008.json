We propose an automatic method that efficiently calculates a many-to-many strand correspondence between two or more given hair models, taking into account the multi-scale clustering structure of hair. Experiments demonstrate that hair interpolation can be used for producing more vivid portrait morphing effects and enabling a novel example-based hair styling methodology, where a user can interactively create new hairstyles by continuously exploring a style space spanning multiple input hair models.", "paper_title": "Hair Interpolation for Portrait Morphing", "paper_id": "WOS:000327310800008"}
