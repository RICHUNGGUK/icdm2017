We describe our labeling procedure of various corrections types and statistical analyses of their features in a corpus collected from a train information spoken dialogue system. We then present results of machine-learning experiments designed to identify user corrections of speech recognition errors. We investigate the predictive power of features automatically computable from the prosody of the turn, the speech recognition process, experimental conditions, and the dialogue history. Our best-performing features reduce classification error from baselines of 25.70-28.99% to 15.72%.", "paper_title": "Characterizing and predicting corrections in spoken dialogue systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240734900004"}
