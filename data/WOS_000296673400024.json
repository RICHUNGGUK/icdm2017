PMP, digital camcorders, digital cameras has increased. These devices provide various services for multimedia file manipulation, allowing multimedia contents playback, multimedia file editing, etc. Additionally, digital TV provides a recorded multimedia file copy to a portable USB disk. However, Linux Ext3 file system, as employed by these devices, has a lot of drawbacks, as it required a considerable amount of time and disk I/Os to store large-size edited multimedia files, and it is hard to access for typical PC users. Therefore, in this paper a design and implementation of an amortized Ext3 with FWAE (Fast Writing-After-Editing) for WinXP-based multimedia applications is described. The FWAE is a fast and efficient multimedia file editing/storing technique for the Ext3 that exploits Mode block pointer re-setting and shared data blocks by simply modifying metadata information. Individual experiments in this research show that the amortized Ext3 with FWAE for WinXP not only dramatically improves written performance of the Ext3 by 16 times on average with various types of edited multimedia files but also notably reduces the amount of consumed disk space through data block sharing. Also, it provides ease and comfort to use for typical PC users unfamiliar with Linux OS.", "paper_title": "Amortized Linux Ext3 File System with Fast Writing after Editing for WinXP-Based Multimedia Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000296673400024"}
