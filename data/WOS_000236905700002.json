Are-annotated sequences are used for representing the structural information, e.g., RNA and protein sequences in molecular biology. Given two sequences with arcs, a text of length n and a pattern of length m, the problem is to determine whether the pattern is an arc-preserving subsequence of the text. Although it is NP-complete in a general case, an O(mn) algorithm has been proposed if the given sequences have no crossing-arcs. Our contribution is to revise it and to obtain more simple one. We also present our experimental results of the running time.", "paper_title": "Faster pattern matching algorithm for arc-annotated sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000236905700002"}
