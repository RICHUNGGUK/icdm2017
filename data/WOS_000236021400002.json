Due to the difference between traditional and wireless networks, in particular in terms of available bandwidth and network structure, the concepts used for supporting real-time applications in both networks are different. This paper gives an overview of the key technical challenges that are fundamental and need to be solved in order to easily support real-time applications in wireless and mobile environments. In a first step, issues related to service provisioning in mobile networks are discussed. This is followed by a look at the Quality of Service supported by wireless networks and possible techniques for improving it. Finally, concepts for securing the communication between the users of real-time applications in wireless and mobile networks are presented. For each of these issues, we provide a detailed analysis and an overview of the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we illustrate the main points using distributed online games as an example.
