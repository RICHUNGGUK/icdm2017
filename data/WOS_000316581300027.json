The SMCS does not require the presence of multiple classifiers, and generates diversity through the creation of pseudo test samples. The pseudo test sample generation mechanism allows the SMCS to adapt to dynamic environments without multiple classifier training. Moreover, because of the presence of multiple classifications, classification combination schemes, such as majority voting, can be applied, and so the mechanism may improve the recognition rate in a manner similar to that of Multiple Classifier Systems (MCS). The experimental results confirm the validity of the proposed SMCS as applicable to many classification systems. Even without parameter selection, the average performance of the SMCS is still comparable to that of Bagging or Boosting. Moreover, the SMCS and the traditional MCS scheme are not mutually exclusive, and the SMCS can be applied along with traditional MCS, such as Bagging and Boosting. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
