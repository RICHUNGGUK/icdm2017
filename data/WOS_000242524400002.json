For PEPABS, the activity durations may be allowed to be generally distributed, and the corresponding transition probability matrix has a blockpartitioned structure. Specifically, PEPA(BS) is suitable for describing and analysing performance of general systems with block-structured transition probability matrices, such as Markov chains of GI/G/1 type. The steady-state probabilities of the PEPA(BS) model can be calculated by means of censoring technique and the RG-factorisation, which have been successfully applied to study infinite-state Markov chain or Markov renewal process. Some practical examples show that the formal method is convenient to model and analyse non-Markovian systems, and can efficiently tackle an infinite-state problem under an algorithmic framework.", "paper_title": "Block-structured stochastic process algebra and its applications to queueing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242524400002"}
