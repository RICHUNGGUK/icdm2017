The benefit is to be maximized under a time constraint. They reduced the problem to the constrained longest-path problem in a graph. In this note we present a modified FPTAS that improves on their result by a factor of (n/h) log log ((b) over bar/(b) under bar), where (b) over bar and (b) under bar are an upper bound and a lower bound on the maximum benefit, respectively, n is the number of nodes, and h is the length of the longest path (in hops) in the graph.", "paper_title": "An Improved FPTAS for Mobile Agent Routing with Time Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000304607500005"}
