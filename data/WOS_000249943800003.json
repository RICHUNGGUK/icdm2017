As collaborative virtual environments become utilized more effectively, it is only natural that interactants will have the ability to touch one another. In the work presented here, we used relatively basic devices to begin to explore the expression of emotion through VIT. In Experiment 1, participants utilized a 2 DOF force-feedback joystick to express seven emotions. We examined various dimensions of the forces generated and subjective ratings of the difficulty of expressing those emotions. In Experiment 2, a separate group of participants attempted to recognize the recordings of emotions generated in Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, pairs of participants attempted to communicate the seven emotions using physical handshakes. Results indicated that humans were above chance when recognizing emotions via data shed light on the development of haptic devices. By providing a quantitative framework for isolating aspects of different types of hand movements, our work assists other researchers in exploring the utility and theoretical possibilities of various types of virtual interfaces. Given the research in developing social robots for collaboration (Hinds, Roberts, & Jones, 2004) and education (Kanda, Hirano, Eaton, & Ishiguro, 2004), it is important to understand how haptic devices can be used to generate emotional content in other contexts as well, such as online gaming, training exercises, and chatrooms designed for the sole purpose of social interaction.", "paper_title": "Virtual interpersonal touch: Expressing and recognizing emotions through haptic devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000249943800003"}
