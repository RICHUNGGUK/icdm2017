We give the local weight distribution of the (256,93) third-order binary Reed-Muller code. For the computation, a coset partitioning algorithm is modified by using a binary shift invariance property. This reduces the time complexity by about 1/256 for the code. A necessary and sufficient condition for minimality in Reed-Muller codes is also presented.", "paper_title": "Local weight distribution of the (256,93) third-order binary Reed-Muller code", "paper_id": "WOS:000245194000020"}
