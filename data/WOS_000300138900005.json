A novel delay-dependent robust stability condition with disturbance attenuation, in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is derived for the uncertain stochastic genetic networks with time-varying delays and intrinsic and extrinsic noises. These stability conditions can be tested efficiently by the available commercial software packages such as Matlab LMI Control Toolbox. Two numerical examples with simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness and validity of the derived theoretical results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
