The goal is to create an integrated workflow tool chain to facilitate integration of various subsystems and verification of the overall system performance to meet a set of desired system requirements. This paper describes an implementation in a model-based representation that encompasses real system hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) components to verify the effectiveness and capability of the development platform. Discussion is provided on the developed model transformation processes that make this possible and is explained through the application of our approach to the development of subsystems for a vehicle system. The key contributions of research include: 1) identification of a suitable model-based systems design methodology and toolset (based on IBM Rhapsody/Mathworks Simulink combination) to include HIL for system verification; 2) design and development of model transformation tools to facilitate bidirectional transformation of an IBM Rhapsody model to a Simulink model; and 3) successful mapping between platform independent models and platform-specific models involving HIL. The research outcomes show particularly promising results that are anticipated to benefit the MBSE community.", "paper_title": "Bridging the Gaps in a Model-Based System Engineering Workflow by Encompassing Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000325403000009"}
