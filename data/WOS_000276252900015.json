Their attractive characteristic, in comparison to the already published structures, is that the minimum supply voltage requirement is equal to a base-emitter voltage plus twice the saturation voltage of MOS transistors operated in strong inversion, giving potential for employment in modern low-voltage environments. The realization of the corresponding transfer function is achieved by introducing a set of complementary operators which allow the realization of low-voltage active building blocks in the log-domain. Both linear and non-linear performances of the introduced configurations have been studied through simulation results.", "paper_title": "Low-voltage log-domain differentiators", "paper_id": "WOS:000276252900015"}
