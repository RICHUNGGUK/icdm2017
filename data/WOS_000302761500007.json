We focus squarely on design, while taking account of both technical and pedagogical issues and challenges, and provide an account of how we have designed and built a system with a very close lit to our knowledge of students' difficulties with the subject matter. We report the challenges involved in building a system that is both intelligent and exploratory, a learning environment in which both student and teacher are supported without explicit tutoring.
