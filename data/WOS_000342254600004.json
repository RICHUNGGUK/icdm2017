This paper aims to introduce a new joint input shaping and feedforward parametrization in iterative feedforward control. Such a parametrization has the potential to significantly improve the performance for systems executing a point-to-point reference trajectory. The proposed approach enables an efficient optimization procedure with global convergence. A simulation example and an experimental validation on an industrial motion system confirm (i) the performance improvement obtained by means of the joint input shaping and feedforward parametrization compared to pre-existing results, and (ii) the efficiency of the proposed optimization procedure.
