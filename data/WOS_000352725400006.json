This paper continues the work by generalizing to higher alphabet. The core of a word as well as the relatived version is the essential part of a word that captures the key information of the word from the perspective of its Parikh matrix. Various nice properties of the cores and some interesting results regarding the M-equivalence classes of ternary words are obtained.", "paper_title": "On Core Words and the Parikh Matrix Mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000352725400006"}
