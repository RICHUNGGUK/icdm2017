In this paper, we present a class of M-channel nonuniform filter banks with arbitrary sampling factors including integer, rational, and even irrational numbers. Consequently, the frequency partitioning in the proposed filter bank is much more flexible, which is very attractive in many applications.", "paper_title": "M-channel nonuniform filter banks with arbitrary scaling factors", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100037"}
