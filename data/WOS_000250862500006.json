These states, which double the extension of the available qubits, are engineered by a simple experimental method which uses linear optics and a single Type I nonlinear crystal. The AVN test of local realism represents a generalization of the GHZ to the case of two entangled particles and two observers.", "paper_title": "Quantum nonlocality of polarization-momentum hyper-entangled states", "paper_id": "WOS:000250862500006"}
