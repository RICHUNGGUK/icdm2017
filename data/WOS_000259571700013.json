The proposed simulator is composed of a PHANToM haptic device and a modular software package that allows for visual feedback and kinesthetic interactions between an operator and multimodality image databases. The system provides real-time ultrasound images in the same fashion as a typical ultrasound machine, enhanced with corresponding augmented computerized tomographic (CT) and/or MRI images. The proposed training system allows trainees to develop radiology techniques and knowledge of the patient's anatomy with minimum practice on live patients, or in places or at times when radiology devices or patients with rare cases may not be available. Low-level details of the software structure that can be migrated to other similar medical simulators are described. A preliminary human factors study, conducted on the prototype of the developed simulator, demonstrates the potential usage of the system for clinical training.", "paper_title": "A framework for the design of a novel haptic-based medical training simulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000259571700013"}
