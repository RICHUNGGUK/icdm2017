In this paper, a threshold VCS with the abilities of OR and XOR decryptions is proposed based on random grids CRC). If a copy machine is not available, the secret could be reconstructed by stacking. On the other hand, if a device having XOR operation is available, the visual quality of the recovered secret image is improved as well as the secret can be reconstructed losslessly for (k, n) threshold (case) when n shares are collected. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the security and efficiency of the proposed scheme. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
