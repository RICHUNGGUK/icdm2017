One of the main problems found by educators in the programs centered in the promotion of self-regulation is that they need to monitor all their students constantly and thoroughly. If the number of students is large, which is typical in higher education, this becomes a problem. They need tools to address it and be able to monitor their learning progress. We are developing a tool for self-regulated learners, to provide them with support for their learning process using embedded learning strategies and tools to enable planning, monitoring, and evaluating their own learning process. In this paper, we present the monitoring system designed for this tool, which has been enhanced in order to enable in-depth monitoring for both educators and learners. This enables process and progress tracking and also eases self-monitoring and self-evaluation for learners.", "paper_title": "A Monitoring System to Ease Self-Regulated Learning Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000365098000005"}
