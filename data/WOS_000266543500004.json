The purpose is to design a state-feedback fuzzy controller such that the closed-loop system is robustly exponentially stable with a prescribed decay rate. Sufficient conditions for the solvability of this problem are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). By using feasible solutions of these LMIs, desired fuzzy controllers are designed and their corresponding exponential estimates are given. In addition, the main results of this paper are explicitly dependent on the decay rate. This enables one to design fuzzy controllers by freely selecting decay rates according to different practical conditions. Two numerical examples are provided finally to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design methods. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
