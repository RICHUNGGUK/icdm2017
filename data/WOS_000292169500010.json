The input and output variables of the proposed model are described as triangular fuzzy numbers. Then by integrating the triangular fuzzy theory and v-support vector regression machine, the triangular fuzzy v-support vector machine (TFv-SVM) is proposed. To seek the optimal parameters of TFv-SVM, particle swarm optimization is also applied to optimize parameters of TFv-SVM. A forecasting method based on TFv-SVRM and PSO are put forward. The results of the application in sale system forecasts confirm the feasibility and the validity of the forecasting method. Compared with the traditional model, TFv-SVM method requires fewer samples and has better forecasting precision. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
