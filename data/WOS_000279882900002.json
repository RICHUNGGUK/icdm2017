We detect the horizon using sizable or uniformly moving vessels, and estimate the vertical apex using water reflections of the street lamps. The computed horizon and apex provide a metric rectification that removes the affine distortions and reduces the searching space for geo-registration. Geo-registration is obtained by searching the best orientation where the estimated water masks on satellite images and camera views are matched. The proposed solution has the following contributions: first, water and coastlines are used as features for registration between horizontally looking maritime views and satellite images. Second, water reflections are proposed to estimate the vertical vanishing point. Third, we give algorithms for the detection of water areas in both satellite images and camera views. Experimental results and applications on cross camera tracking are demonstrated. We also discuss several observations, as well as limitations of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "AUTOMATIC GEO-REGISTRATION FOR PORT SURVEILLANCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000279882900002"}
