When the nonlinear coupling strengths are equal, we use a unitary transformation to remove the linear coupling terms, and show that the existing soliton solutions oscillate from one species to the other. When the nonlinear coupling strengths are different, the soliton dynamics is numerically investigated and the findings are compared to the results of an effective two-mode model. The case of two linearly coupled Ablowitz-Ladik equations is also briefly discussed. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
