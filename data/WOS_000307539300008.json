This can be attained by processing Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) images and retrieving soil-moisture parameters. In this article, TerraSAR-X product images are investigated in combination with a water-cloud model based on the Shi semi-empirical model to determine the accuracy of soil-moisture parameter retrieval. SAR images were captured between January 2008 and September 2010 in the vicinity of the city Maribor, Slovenia, at different incidence angles. The water-cloud model provides acceptable estimated soil-moisture parameters at bare or scarcely vegetated soil areas. However, this model is too sensitive to speckle noise; therefore, a pre-processing step for speckle-noise reduction is carried out. Afterwards, self-organizing neural networks (SOM) are used to segment the areas at which the performance of this model is poor, and at the same time neural networks are also used for a more accurate approximation of model parameters' values. Ground-truth is measured using the Pico64 sensor located on the field, simultaneously with capturing SAR images, in order to enable the comparison and validation of the obtained results. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the water-cloud model accuracy over all incidence angles.", "paper_title": "Soil-moisture estimation from TerraSAR-X data using neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000307539300008"}
