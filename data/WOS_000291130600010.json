In this paper, we propose a strategy to reduce the dispersive and disspative errors of the two-dimensional (2D) multi-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method (MRT-LBM). By presenting an effective algorithm, we obtain a uniform form of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations corresponding to the MRT-LBM in wave-number space. Using the matrix perturbation theory and the equivalent modified equation approach for finite difference methods, we propose a class of minimization problems to optimize the free-parameters in the MRT-LBM. We obtain this way a dispersion-relation-preserving LBM (DRP-LBM) to circumvent the minimized dispersion error of the MRT-LBM. The dissipation relation precision is also improved. And the stability of the MRT-LBM with the small bulk viscosity is guaranteed. Von Neuman analysis of the linearized MRT-LBM is performed to validate the optimized dispersion/dissipation relations considering monochromatic wave solutions. Meanwhile, dispersion and dissipation errors of the optimized MRT-LBM are quantitatively compared with the original MRT-LBM. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried out to assess the new optimized MRT-LBM schemes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
