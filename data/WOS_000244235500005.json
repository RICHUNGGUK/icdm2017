Two material models, one for asphalt-concrete and another for unbound materials, have been calibrated to laboratory test data. The models account for the time and temperature dependent deformation of the asphalt-concrete as well as the friction and cyclic compaction of the unbound layers. The models have been used in simulations of a complete road structure exposed to cyclic mechanical and thermal loads. The simulation results are qualitatively similar to the rutting observed in reality. The simulations can either trace the complete history of the individual load cycles, or can be performed to directly obtain the accumulated effect after a certain number of load cycles. This makes it possible to get quickly the result due to a large number of loadings as desired in engineering design practice. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
