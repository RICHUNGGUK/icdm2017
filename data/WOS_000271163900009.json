We also prove that it separates distinguishable phylogenetic networks. In this way, it becomes the strongest dissimilarity measure for phylogenetic networks available so far. Furthermore, we propose a generalization of that metric that separates arbitrary phylogenetic networks.", "paper_title": "On Nakhleh's Metric for Reduced Phylogenetic Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000271163900009"}
