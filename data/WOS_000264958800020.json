These methods have also been evaluated in a number of applications in the cognitive science, computational linguistics and the information retrieval literatures. In this paper, we review the available methodologies for derivation of semantic relatedness front free text, as well as their evaluation in a variety of biomedical and Other applications. Recent methodological developments, and their applicability to several existing applications are also discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
