Patients of anemia have kidneys that are incapable of performing certain basic functions such as sensing of oxygen levels to secrete erythropoietin when red blood cell counts are low. Under such conditions, external administration of human recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) is administered as alternative to improve conditions of CKD patients by increasing their hemoglobin (Hb) levels to a given therapeutic range. Presently, EPO dosing strategies extensively depend on packet inserts and on \"average\" responses to the medication from previous patients. Clearly dosage strategies based on these approaches are, at best, nonoptimal to EPO medication and potentially dangerous to patients that do not adhere to the notion of expected \"average\" response. In this work, a technique called semi-blind robust identification is provided to uniquely identify models of the individual patients of anemia based on their actual Hb responses and EPO administration. Using the a priori information and the measured input-output data of the individual patients, the procedure identifies a unique model consisting of a nominal model and the associated model uncertainty for the patients. By incorporating the effects of unknown system initial conditions, considerably small measurement samples can be used in the modeling process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
