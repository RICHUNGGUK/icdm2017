They appear as models for interconnection networks, as well as in chemistry. We derive a characterization of Lucas cubes that is based on a peripheral expansion of a unique convex subgraph of an appropriate Fibonacci cube. This serves as the foundation for a recognition algorithm of Lucas cubes that runs in linear time.", "paper_title": "A new characterization and a recognition algorithm of Lucas cubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000327036900004"}
