Compact, attractive and easy to use, our dynamic video retrieval system (DVRS) gives students quick access to resources that can facilitate their learning. In this Study, we integrate an innovative learning-assisted system, named the dynamic video retrievals system, which allows students of English-as-a-Foreign-Language to use information retrieval techniques which examine video scripts for specific word collocations and subsequently utilize a ranking-based approach to analyze the collocations discovered. Such computer-mediated interaction enables students in traditionally structured English classes to find engaging, real life examples of grammar and vocabulary in use, giving them opportunities to strengthen their language skills in a culturally relevant way.
