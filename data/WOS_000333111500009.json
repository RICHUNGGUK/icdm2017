Most feature extraction methods require prior knowledge to decide if they are suitable for a specific domain and to optimize their input parameters. In this paper, we introduce a new color image context categorizationmethod (DITEC) based on the trace transform. The problem of dimensionality reduction of the obtained trace transform signal is addressed through statistical descriptors of its frequency representation that keep the underlying information. We also analyze the distortions produced by the parameters that determine the sampling of the discrete trace transform. Moreover, Feature Subset Selection (FSS) is applied to both, improve the classification performance and compact the final length of the descriptor thatwill be provided to the classifier. These extracted features offer a highly discriminant behavior for content categorization without prior knowledge requirements. The method has been experimentally validated through two different datasets.", "paper_title": "Trace Transform Based Method for Color Image Domain Identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000333111500009"}
