Since the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of Gaq (2.9 eV) lies in between that of Alq(3) (3.1 eV) (or Bphen (3.0 eV)) and TBADN (2.8 eV), step barrier from Alq(3) (or BPhen) though Gaq to TBADN can be formed. The experimental results indicate that the J-V characteristics of both the electron-only and the complete devices show the increase of the current density in devices with step barrier compared with the devices without step barrier. For electron-only devices, the driving voltage at the current density of 20 mA/cm(2) is reduced from 7.9 V to 4.9 V for devices with Alq3, and from 4.2 V to 3.1 V for devices with BPhen, respectively, owing to the introduction of step barrier. For the complete devices, when Gaq step barrier is introduced, at 20 mA/cm(2), the driving voltage is reduced from 7 V to 5.8 V for devices with Alq(3) and from 6.2 V to 5.1 V for devices with BPhen. It has also been observed that for devices with step barrier layer, the luminance at 200 mA/cm(2) is increased from 1992 cd/m(2) to 3281 cd/m(2) for device with Alq3, and from 1745 cd/m(2) to 2876 cd/m(2) for devices with BPhen, respectively. The highest luminance reaches 3420 cd/m(2) in devices with Alq(3) as ETL and 3176 cd/m(2) in devices with BPhen as ETL after the introduction of step barrier. The phenomena are explained by using tunnel theory. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
