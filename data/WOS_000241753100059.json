Its first stage uses the autocorrelation property of the desired source signal, and the second stage exploits the independence assumption. The algorithm is suitable to extract periodic or quasi-periodic source signals, without requiring that they have distinct periods. It outperforms many existing algorithms in many aspects, confirmed by simulations. Finally, we use the proposed algorithm to extract the components of visual event-related potentials evoked by three geometrical figure stimuli, and the classification accuracy based on the extracted components achieves 93.2%.", "paper_title": "Two-stage temporally correlated source extraction algorithm with its application in extraction of event-related potentials", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100059"}
