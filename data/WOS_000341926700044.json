So that the optimal management of DFR problem can lead to several profits such as load balance improvement, power loss reduction, voltage profile intensification, etc. Also, this paper aims to take the positive effect of the DFR strategy on the network performance under investigation. In this regard, an evolutionary algorithm based on bat algorithm (BA) is suggested to study the DFR problem deeply. The total active power losses, voltage deviation and load balance are considered as objective functions. Thus, a new self-adaptive modification is implemented to search the multi-objective problem space globally. Other than that, in order to satisfy all the objective functions efficiently, a fuzzy-based interactive method is applied. This idea will give the operator the capability to decide the satisfying degree of each objective function. In the end, the proposed algorithm is tested on the 32-bus IEEE radial distribution system to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method.", "paper_title": "A new modified bat algorithm to solve optimal management of multi-objective reconfiguration problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000341926700044"}
