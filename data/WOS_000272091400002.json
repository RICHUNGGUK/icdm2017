Recently bounds for the exact Outputs of interest have been obtained for both the Poisson equation and the advection-diffusion-reaction equation. In this work, we extend this approach to the Stokes problem where a novel formulation of the method also leads to a simpler flux calculation based on the directly equilibrated flux method. To illustrate this technique, bounds on the flowrate are calculated for an incompressible creeping flow driven by a pressure gradient in an endless square channel with an array of rectangular obstacles in the center.
