Although both processes are defined separately, it is possible to apply them simultaneously. This paper proposes an evolutionary model to perform feature and instance selection in nearest neighbor classification. It is based on cooperative coevolution, which has been applied to many computational problems with great success. The proposed approach is compared with a wide range of evolutionary feature and instance selection methods for classification. The results contrasted through non-parametric statistical tests show that our model outperforms previously proposed evolutionary approaches for performing data reduction processes in combination with the nearest neighbor rule.
