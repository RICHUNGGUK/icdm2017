However, these types of methods are not generally available in the form of high-quality parallel implementations, especially for the case of non-Hermitian eigenproblems. We present our implementation of various Davidson-type methods in SLEPc, the Scalable Library for Eigenvalue Problem Computations. The solvers incorporate many algorithmic variants for subspace expansion and extraction, and cover a wide range of eigenproblems including standard and generalized, Hermitian and non-Hermitian, with either real or complex arithmetic. We provide performance results on a large battery of test problems.", "paper_title": "A Parallel Implementation of Davidson Methods for Large-Scale Eigenvalue Problems in SLEPc", "paper_id": "WOS:000333653400005"}
