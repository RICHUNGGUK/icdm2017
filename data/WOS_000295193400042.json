Recently, much attention has been given to stochastic demand due to uncertainty in the real world. Conflicting objectives also exist between profit, service level and resource utilization. In this study, the relationship between the expected profit and the number of trials as well as between the expected profit and the combination of mutation and crossover rates are investigated to identify better parameter values to efficiently run the Genetic Algorithm. Pareto optimal solutions and return on investment are analyzed to provide decision makers with the alternative options of achieving the proper budget and service level. The results show that the optimal value for the return on investment and the expected profit are obtained with a certain budget and service level constraint. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
