Their key distinguishing feature is the extraction of meaning from users' queries without the use of syntactic or semantic representations. Three approaches to identifying the users' intended meanings were investigated: keyword-based systems, Jaro-based string similarity algorithms and matching based on very shallow syntactic analysis. These were measured against a corpus of queries contributed by users of a WWW-hosted infobot for responding to questions about applications to MSc courses. The most effective system was Jaro with stemmed input (78.57%). It also was able to process ungrammatical input and offer scalability.", "paper_title": "An evaluation of keyword, string similarity and very shallow syntactic matching for a university admissions processing infobot", "paper_id": "WOS:000327912000010"}
