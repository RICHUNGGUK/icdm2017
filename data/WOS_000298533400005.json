The model is represented as a system of coupled equations, and combines both the distributed and lumped parameter description. It involves electrostatics, solid mechanics and gas dynamics. The bending effect of the micromirror suspensions is also considered. Based on the model, the micromirror behavior has been simulated and the simulation results are presented. The model is applicable for wide class of electrostatic MEMS actuators. Moreover, the great advantage of the presented model is enormous reduction in computational time in comparison with the model completely based on the finite element analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
