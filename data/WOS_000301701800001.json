In the subjective measurement, comparison tests with 24 subjects were conducted and the semantic differential method with factor analysis was carried out for six TVs with different room luminance and length of watching time. The comparison test yielded identification of the most preferable display, which showed little connection with the TV luminance for any length of watching time and room luminance. From the statistical factor analysis of semantic differential method, significant factors were extracted for describing human visual preference. In the objective measurement, the eye motion tracking camera was used to detect the eye response and thus generated physiological data corroborated the significant factors extracted from the subjective measurement. This study allows the human perceptual preference and fatigue of electronic displays to be quantitatively measured with psychological and physiological factors and will tell which parameters are significant and guide the manufacturer in making the optimum TVs.
