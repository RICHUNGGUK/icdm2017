A latest predictor is adopted to achieve better data hiding capability for the first predicative reversible data hiding scheme, whereas another scheme utilizes a new approach by considering the nature of different images to classify the smoothness for each piece of image blocking regions such that more secret data can be hidden into the smooth regions rather than the non-smooth ones resulting in a better embedding capability. The experiments verify that these schemes outperform the original reversible data hiding algorithms and some state-of-the-art reversible data hiding schemes. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
