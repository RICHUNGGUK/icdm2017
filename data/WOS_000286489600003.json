These include: (1) claims about the evolution and role of design science research in the broader IS community and its position in the so-called 'Anglo-Saxon community', (2) the journal reviewing standards applied to design science research and what is perceived to be a sole focus on behavioral 'descriptive' research in certain IS journals. This commentary also discusses how such journals operate and set up their missions, review principles, a id standards.
