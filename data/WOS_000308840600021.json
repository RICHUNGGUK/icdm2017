Design/methodology/approach - An artificial system which can effectively model, simulate and recur the main features and behaviors of a real R&D system of complex equipment is established at first. The structure and function of the system and its subsystems, and the relation of factors in the system are analyzed. Then one can perform computation experiment, modeling and simulation in the artificial system to obtain the optimal solutions. Finally, practice these solutions in a real system and at the same time perform the solutions in artificial system, forecasting and warning the possible new situations and problems in a realistic process, and provide controlling scheme. Findings - The typical characteristics and solutions of the R&D system of complex equipment are analyzed. The sketch scheme of ACPI, the system frame of ACPI for R&D management of complex equipments are proposed, and the key technologies used in implementing ACPI of R&D system of complex equipment are studied. Practical implications - The outcome of this paper can be used in computation experiments, management and optimization of R&D systems of complex equipment. Originality/value - The sketch scheme of ACPI, the system frame of ACPI for R&D management of complex equipments are proposed first.
