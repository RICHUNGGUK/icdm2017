With the help of the fuzzy set theory, this article proposes a new constrained predictive control algorithm based on Fuzzy Decision-Making Method (FDMPC). Compared with the other traditional constrained predictive control, this new algorithm replaces the conventional objective function with the appropriate fuzzy index function. As a result, it is easy to integrate the constraints into the fuzzy index function, which can greatly reduce the complexity of the optimization. Then a new evolutionary computation method named particle swarm optimization is firstly applied into the design of a model predictive controller. Moreover, this article also demonstrates that the conventional predictive control is actually a particular case of the proposed algorithm even though in the MIMO case, so this new algorithm is an extension of the traditional constrained predictive control strategy. At last, the proposed FDMPC has been applied into a real once-through power unit model, and the simulation results have validated the good control performance of the proposed FDMPC.", "paper_title": "A pso-based multivariable Fuzzy Decision-Making predictive controller for a once-through 300-mw power plant", "paper_id": "WOS:000237848300002"}
