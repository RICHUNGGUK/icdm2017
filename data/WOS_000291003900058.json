The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator is widely used to estimate states of this hidden Markov model through available observations. The MAP path estimator based on a finite number of observations is calculated by the Viterbi algorithm, and is often referred to as the Viterbi path. It was recently shown in [2], [3] and [16], [17] (see also [12] and [15]) that under mild conditions, the sequence of estimators of a given state converges almost surely to a limiting regenerative process as the number of observations approaches infinity. This in particular implies a law of large numbers for some functionals of hidden states and finite Viterbi paths. The aim of this paper is to provide the corresponding large deviation estimates.", "paper_title": "Large Deviation Bounds for Functionals of Viterbi Paths", "paper_id": "WOS:000291003900058"}
