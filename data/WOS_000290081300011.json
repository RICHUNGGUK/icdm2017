The contribution of this paper is two fold, (i) incorporating within-cluster ranks in censored data analysis, and (ii) applying the induced smoothing of Brown and Wang (2005, Biometrika) for computational convenience. Asymptotic properties of the resulting estimating functions are given. We also carry out numerical studies to assess the performance of the proposed approach and conclude that the proposed approach can lead to much improved estimators when strong clustering effects exist. A dataset from a litter-matched tumorigenesis experiment is used for illustration. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.
