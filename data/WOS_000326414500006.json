One of their significant advantages is that they can directly optimize the Pareto front by evolving a population of solutions, where the recombination (also called crossover) operators are usually employed to reproduce new and potentially better solutions by mixing up solutions in the population. Recombination in multi-objective evolutionary algorithms is, however, mostly applied heuristically. In this paper, we investigate how from a theoretical viewpoint a recombination operator will affect a multi-objective EA. First, we employ artificial benchmark problems: the weighted LPTNO problem (a generalization of the well-studied LOTZ problem), and the well-studied Cocz problem, for studying the effect of recombination. Our analysis discloses that recombination may accelerate the filling of the Pareto front by recombining diverse solutions and thus help solve multi-objective optimization. Because of this, for these two problems, we find that a multi-objective EA with recombination enabled achieves a better expected running time than any known EAs with recombination disabled. We further examine the effect of recombination on solving the multi-objective minimum spanning tree problem, which is an NP-hard problem. Following our finding on the artificial problems, our analysis shows that recombination also helps accelerate filling the Pareto front and thus helps find approximate solutions faster.
