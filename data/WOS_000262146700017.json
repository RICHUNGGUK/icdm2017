The procedure can help identify physical considerations that are initially overlooked. The general algorithm is applied to an initial model of an electro-hydraulic actuator which cannot produce a known transfer function. The same approach is used in the case of a hand held medical instrument inconsistent with user's specifications. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
