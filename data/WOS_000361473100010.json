The question whether there exists a 0/1 polytope with high positive semidefinite extension complexity was left open. We answer this question in the affirmative by showing that there is a 0/1 polytope such that any spectrahedron projecting to it must be the intersection of a semidefinite cone of dimension and an affine space. Our proof relies on a new technique to rescale semidefinite factorizations.", "paper_title": "On the existence of 0/1 polytopes with high semidefinite extension complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000361473100010"}
