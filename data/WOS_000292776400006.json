The most reliable way is by subjective evaluation. Thus, to design an objective metric by simulating human visual system (HVS) is quite reasonable and available. In this paper, the video quality assessment metric based on visual perception is proposed. Three-dimensional wavelet is utilized to decompose video and then extract features to mimic the multichannel structure of HVS. Spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity function (S-T CSF) is employed to weight coefficient obtained by three-dimensional wavelet to simulate nonlinearity feature of the human eyes. Perceptual threshold is exploited to obtain visual sensitive coefficients after S-T CSF filtered. Visual sensitive coefficients are normalized representation and then visual sensitive errors are calculated between reference and distorted video. Finally, temporal perceptual mechanism is applied to count values of video quality for reducing computational cost. Experimental results prove the proposed method outperforms the most existing methods and is comparable to LHS and PVQM.", "paper_title": "A Video Quality Assessment Metric Based on Human Visual System", "paper_id": "WOS:000292776400006"}
