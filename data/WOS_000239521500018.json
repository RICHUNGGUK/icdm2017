Although new standards in databases have appeared in the last years, most databases are still based on SQL-92, and are thus true legacy systems. Most of the services offered by information systems are based on the information stored in their databases. In order to allow interoperability, current trends advise exposing some of these services to the Web, making them available for other users and also for the information system itself. Since dealing with old databases and their associated software is difficult, a methodology to discover services from SQL-92 databases and to offer them via Web Services is proposed. This methodology is based on the MDA approach and implements a reengineering process, which starts from an SQL-92 database and obtains a set of services that can be exposed as Web Services.", "paper_title": "A methodology for database reengineering to Web Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000239521500018"}
