[1]. In this paper we focus on the case where all the jobs share a common deadline. Such a problem is denoted as CD-LBSP, which has been considered by Esfahbod et al. [2]. We first show that the worst-case ratio of the algorithm SJF (Shortest Job First) is two under the objective function [min-time-spent], and thus answer an open question posed in [2]. We further present two approximation schemes A(k) and B-k both having worst-case ratio of k+1/k, for any given integer k > 0, under the objective function [min-makespan] and [min-time-spent] respectively. Finally, we prove that the problem CD-LBSP remains NP-hard under several objective functions, even if all jobs share the same release time.", "paper_title": "Common deadline lazy bureaucrat scheduling revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000236886100048"}
