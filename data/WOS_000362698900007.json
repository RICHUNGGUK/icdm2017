In this paper, we propose an efficient block-structured incoherent dictionary learning algorithm for sparse representations of image signals. The constrained minimization of dictionary learning is achieved by iteratively alternating between sparse coding and dictionary update. Without relying on any prior knowledge of the group structure for the input data, we develop a two-stage clustering method that identifies the underlying block structure of the dictionary under certain restricted constraints. The two-stage clustering method mainly consists of affinity propagation and agglomerative hierarchical clustering. To meet the conditions of both the upper bound and the lower bound of the mutual coherence of dictionary atoms, we introduce a regularization term for the objective function to adjust the block coherence of the overcomplete dictionary. The experiments on synthetic data and real images demonstrate that the proposed dictionary learning algorithm has lower representation error, higher visual quality and better reconstructed results than most of the state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Learning block-structured incoherent dictionaries for sparse representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000362698900007"}
