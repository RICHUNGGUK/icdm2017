As these systems support higher and higher resolutions with more complex 3D graphics, a high-throughput and low-power memory system is essential for the mobile GPU. In this article, we propose to improve throughput/watt in a mobile GPU memory system by using intelligent scheduling to reduce power and multi-band radio frequency interconnect (MRF-I) to offset any throughput degradation caused by our intelligent scheduling. Overall, we are able to improve throughput 17% up to 66% while increasing throughput per watt by an average of 18% up to 26%.", "paper_title": "Utilizing RF-I and Intelligent Scheduling for Better Throughput/Watt in a Mobile GPU Memory System", "paper_id": "WOS:000299995000034"}
