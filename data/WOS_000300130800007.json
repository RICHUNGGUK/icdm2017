The Grobman-Hartman theorem states that, near hyperbolic equilibria, there exists a homeomorphism between the nonlinear system's trajectories and the linearized correspondent system's trajectories. That is, these systems are topologically equivalent. A theorem similar to Grobman-Hartman theorem to fuzzy flows is the main result in this article. For fuzzy flows obtained from each system it states that the nonlinear and the linearized are topologically equivalent. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
