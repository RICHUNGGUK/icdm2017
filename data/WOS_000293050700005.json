However, the segmentation of SAR images utilizing this model still fails to resolve the misclassifications due to the inaccuracy of edge location. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised multi-class segmentation algorithm by fusing the traditional energy function of TMF model with the principle of edge penalty. Through the introduction of the penalty function based on local edge strength information, the new energy function could prevent segment from smoothing across boundaries. Then we optimize the objective function that stems from the new energy function to obtain an iterative multi-region merging Bayesian maximum posterior mode (MPM) segmentation equation for the new segmentation algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by application to simulated data and real SAR images. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
