In particular, we identify several individual procedures that the algorithms are assembled from and show how to assemble a new and more efficient algorithm, called Recursive OBF (OBFR), to solve the decomposition problem. We also report on a thorough experimental study to evaluate the new algorithm. It shows that it is possible to perform SCC decomposition in parallel efficiently and that OBFR, if properly implemented, is the best choice in most cases.", "paper_title": "Distributed Algorithms for SCC Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000286911500003"}
