The dynamic range of an HDR image needs to be mapped on output devices, which is called tone compression or tone mapping. The iCAM06, the representative HDR rendering algorithm, uses tone compression for image reproduction on the low dynamic range of output devices. However, color saturation reduction occurs during its tone compression process. We propose a saturation correction method using the inverse compensation in order to recover the saturation reduction in the iCAM06. Experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance than the iCAM06 from the view-point of saturation accuracy and rendering preference.", "paper_title": "Color Saturation Compensation in iCAM06 for High-Chroma HDR Imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000296673300036"}
