A model is presented which evaluates one source of renewable generation, off-shore wind energy. The model analyzes different wind turbine design characteristics, assigns significance to potential synergistic effects of one design feature on another, and provides an optimized design relative to the cost, environment, robustness, and overall efficiency of an off-shore wind turbine.
