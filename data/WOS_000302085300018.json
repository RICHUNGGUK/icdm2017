It is well known that the Viterbi decoder (VD) is the dominant module determining the overall power consumption of TCM decoders. We propose a pre-computation architecture incorporated with T-algorithm for VD, which can effectively reduce the power consumption without degrading the decoding speed much. A general solution to derive the optimal pre-computation steps is also given in the paper. Implementation result of a VD for a rate-3/4 convolutional code used in a TCM system shows that compared with the full trellis VD, the precomputation architecture reduces the power consumption by as much as 70% without performance loss, while the degradation in clock speed is negligible.", "paper_title": "High-Speed Low-Power Viterbi Decoder Design for TCM Decoders", "paper_id": "WOS:000302085300018"}
