We show a double-exponential size increase when converting a constant height nondeterministic pushdown automaton into an equivalent deterministic device. Moreover, we prove that such a double-exponential blow-up cannot be avoided by certifying its optimality. As a direct consequence, we get that eliminating nondeterminism in classical finite state automata is single-exponential even with the help of a constant height pushdown store. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
