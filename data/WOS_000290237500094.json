General sorting is adopted to elicit initial product platform and generate initial design options. Designers' importance ratings are gathered and used to deal with cost- and time-related concerns. The restricted coulomb energy neural network is used for classifying and selecting design options. A case study on wood golf club design is conducted to illustrate the proposed approach.
