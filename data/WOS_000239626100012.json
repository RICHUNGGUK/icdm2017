On the basis of BGIPDC logic, this paper proposes a model of agent architecture as a concrete realization of it, called PDC-agent. PDC-agent is an extension of traditional BDI agent, by adding a policy engine, a contract engine and a goal maintenance component into agent's interpreter. Besides, PDC-agent has two characteristics. First, the operation of PDC-agent is based on an event-driven mechanism. Various events drive the components of the interpreter. Second, the representation of PDC-agent is on the basis of ontology.", "paper_title": "An extended BDI agent with policies and contracts", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100012"}
