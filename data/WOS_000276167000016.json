Trying to generalize this approach we arrived at the concept of convex measures. We prove the negative result that convex measures are bounded by O(n(2)) and show that several measures considered for proving lower bounds on the formula size are convex. We also prove quadratic upper bounds on a class of measures that are not necessarily convex. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
