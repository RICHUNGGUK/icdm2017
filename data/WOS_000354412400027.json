This can help remote healthcare among other applications in a great deal. This paper proposes a cloud based framework for speech enabling healthcare. In the proposed framework, the patients or any healthy person seeking for some medical assistance can send his/her request by speech commands. The commands are managed and processed in the cloud server. Any doctor with proper authentication can receive the request. By analyzing the request, the doctor can assist the patient or the person. This paper also proposes a new feature extraction technique, namely, interlaced derivative pattern (IDP), to automatic speech recognition (ASR) system to be deployed into the cloud server. The IDP exploits the relative Melfilter bank coefficients along different neighborhood directions from the speech signal. Experimental results show that the proposed IDP-based ASR system performs reasonably well even when the speech is transmitted via smart phones.", "paper_title": "Automatic speech recognition using interlaced derivative pattern for cloud based healthcare system", "paper_id": "WOS:000354412400027"}
