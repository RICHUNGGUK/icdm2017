In this paper an advanced paradigm, combining linearising action and repetitive control (RC), is developed to suppress tremor using functional electrical stimulation (FES) applied to wrist extensors/flexors. This innovative biomechanical approach to tremor suppression embeds learning from experience, and its effectiveness is confirmed in tests performed with nine healthy adults who attended a single one-hour session. Using FES, pathological wrist tremors (2.5, 3 or 4 Hz) were induced via extensor digitorum and a validated mechanical wrist-rig was used to collect data. Results confirmed statistically significant reduction in pathological movement, measured by path-length wrist movement and single peak amplitude of tremor. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
