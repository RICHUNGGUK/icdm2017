This new code's characteristics should drive future CPU design and architecture. Post-GPU code has lower instruction-level parallelism, more difficult branch prediction, and loads and stores that are significantly harder to predict. Post-GPU code exhibits much smaller gains from the availability of multiple cores, owing to reduced thread-level parallelism.", "paper_title": "REDEFINING THE ROLE OF THE CPU IN THE ERA OF CPU-GPU INTEGRATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000312020700002"}
