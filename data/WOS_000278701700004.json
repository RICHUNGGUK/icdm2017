Existing (global) analysis techniques tend to mandate every domain-specific application to unveil all private behaviors for scientific collaboration In practice, it is infeasible for a domain-specific application to disclose its process details (as a private workflow fragment) for privacy or security reasons. Consequently, it is a challenging endeavor to coordinate scientific workflows and its distributed domain-specific applications To address this problem, we propose a collaborative scheduling approach that can deal with temporal dependencies between a scientific workflow and a private workflow fragment. Under this collaborative scheduling approach, a private workflow fragment could maintain the temporal consistency with a scientific workflow in resource sharing and task enactments Further, an evaluation is also presented to demonstrate the proposed approach for coordinating multiple scientific workflow executions in a concurrent environment.
