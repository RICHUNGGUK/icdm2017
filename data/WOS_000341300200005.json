However, in many situations, the expert is unable to provide his assessment with certainty or he is unwilling to quantify his preferences. To deal with such situations, a new MCDM model under uncertainty is introduced. In fact, we focus here on the problem of modeling expert opinions despite the presence of incompleteness and uncertainty in their preference assessments. Besides, our proposed solution suggests to model these preferences qualitatively rather than exact numbers. Therefore, we propose to incorporate belief preference relations into a MCDM method. The expert assessments are then formulated as a belief function problem since this theory is considered as a useful tool to model expert judgments.", "paper_title": "Multi-Criteria Decision Making Method with Belief Preference Relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000341300200005"}
