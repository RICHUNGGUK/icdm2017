The MPI is implemented with MOS capacitors, which provide the required gain by switching from inversion in the sampling phase into depletion in the amplification phase. Analysis along with simulation results illustrate that MPI consumes very low power dissipation compared to the conventional active integrators with some negligible performance changes. To verify this, the MPI is used in two wideband I I\" pound modulators, one with 8-bit resolution and the other with 13-bit resolution with input bandwidth and sampling frequency of 12.5 and 200 MHz, respectively. The first one is a second order single stage I I\" pound modulator and the second one is a MASH 2-2 modulator, both implemented in 0.18-mu m CMOS technology. Simulation results indicate that these modulators save a significant amount of power consumption when their second integrator is replaced by MPI.", "paper_title": "A low-power parametric integrator for wideband switched-capacitor Sigma Delta modulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000330207600019"}
