Therefore, UVVB user could reach its best performance regarding to transmission rate, while the coexisting IEEE 802.11n user tends to work normally with permissible interference from UVVB user. Simulation results show that the optimal power allocation scheme significantly increases the capacity of UWB user compared with equal power allocation scheme.", "paper_title": "Capacity Optimization of IR Ultra-wide Band System Under the Coexistence with IEEE 802.11n", "paper_id": "WOS:000332680400003"}
