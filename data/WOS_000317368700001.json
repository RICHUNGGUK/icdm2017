Basic elements of integrated passive devices (IPDs), including inductors, capacitors, and resistors, could dramatically save the footprint of the system, optimize the form factor, and improve the performance of radio frequency (RF) systems. In this paper, IPDs using thin film built-up technology are introduced, and the design and characterization of coplanar waveguides (CPWs), inductors, and capacitors are presented.", "paper_title": "Electrical characterization of integrated passive devices using thin film technology for 3D integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000317368700001"}
