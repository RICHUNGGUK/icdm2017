Energy-aware accounting and billing benefits LSCF owners and users. This article makes a case for accurate cost accounting and billing, which accounts for user-specific energy usage, and identifies the hardware-and software-level changes necessary to support energy-aware accounting.", "paper_title": "ENERGY-AWARE ACCOUNTING AND BILLING IN LARGE-SCALE COMPUTING FACILITIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000291445700006"}
