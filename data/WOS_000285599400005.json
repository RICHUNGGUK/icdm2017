Despite the remarkable advances in formal methods, the intricacies of this operation and its implementation often render these inapplicable. Simulation-based methods remain the primary means for verification of division. FPgen is a test generation framework targeted at the floating point datapath. It has been successfully used in the simulation-based verification of a variety of hardware designs. FPgen comprises a comprehensive test plan and a powerful test generator. A proper response to the difficulties posed by division constitutes a major part of FPgen's capabilities. We present an overview of the relevant verification tasks supplied with FPgen and the underlying algorithms used to target them.", "paper_title": "Simulation-Based Verification of Floating-Point Division", "paper_id": "WOS:000285599400005"}
