We propose a MiniMax epsilon-stable cluster validity index based on the uncertainty associated with the level of fuzziness within the framework of interval valued Type 2 fuzziness. If the data have a clustered structure, the optimum number of clusters may be assumed to have minimum uncertainty under upper and lower levels of fuzziness. Upper and lower values of the level of fuzziness for Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) clustering methodology have been found as m = 2.6 and 1.4, respectively, in our previous studies. Our investigation shows that the stability of cluster centers with respect to the level of fuzziness is sufficient for the determination of the number of clusters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
