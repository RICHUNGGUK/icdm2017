The combination of the two architectures allows for richer dynamics that take advantage of neural and symbolic aspects of cognition and provides mutual constraints that promote convergence towards models that are both neurophysiologically and psychologically valid. We present a hybrid model that makes use of multi-level and multi-system integration to allow an instructed assembly task to be carried out in way that is robust to noise and error. Specifically, the model shows how higher-level error recovery routines can interface with lower-level sensory, motor, and error detection processes and result in a robustness to noise and noise-induced errors. The benefits of an integrated cognitive architecture, in which multiple systems and processes operating at multiple levels are recruited to provide a way around the limitations of simpler systems composed of isolated modules that do not allow information to be propagated as easily, provide motivation for the adoption of a generally integrated approach to cognitive systems.
