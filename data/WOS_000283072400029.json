While several examples are known of constant channels that achieve more than 1 degree-of-freedom, these special cases only span a subset of measure zero. In other words, for almost all channel coefficient values, it is not known if more than 1 degree-of-freedom is achievable. In this paper, we settle the Host-Madsen-Nosratinia conjecture in the negative. We show that at least 1.2 degrees-of-freedom are achievable for all values of complex channel coefficients except for a subset of measure zero. For the class of linear beamforming and interference alignment schemes considered in this paper, it is also shown that 1.2 is the maximum number of degrees-of-freedom achievable on the complex Gaussian 3 user interference channel with constant channel coefficients, for almost all values of channel coefficients. To establish the achievability of 1.2 degrees-of-freedom we use the novel idea of asymmetric complex signaling - i.e., the inputs are chosen to be complex but not circularly symmetric. It is shown that unlike Gaussian point-to-point, multiple-access and broadcast channels where circularly symmetric complex Gaussian inputs are optimal, for interference channels optimal inputs are in general asymmetric. With asymmetric complex signaling, we also show that the 2 user complex Gaussian channel with constant channel coefficients achieves the outer bound of 4/3 degrees-of-freedom, i.e., the assumption of time-variations/frequency-selectivity used in prior work to establish the same result, is not needed.", "paper_title": "Interference Alignment With Asymmetric Complex Signaling-Settling the Host-Madsen-Nosratinia Conjecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000283072400029"}
