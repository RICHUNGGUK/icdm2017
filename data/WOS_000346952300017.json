This paper models dynamic ensemble pruning as a multi-label classification task, by considering the members of the ensemble as labels. Multi-label training examples are constructed by evaluating whether ensemble members are accurate or not on the original training set via cross-validation. We show that classification accuracy is maximized when learning algorithms that optimize example-based precision are used in the multi-label classification task. Results comparing the proposed framework against state-of-the-art dynamic ensemble pruning approaches in a variety of datasets using a heterogeneous ensemble of 200 classifiers show that it leads to significantly improved accuracy.
