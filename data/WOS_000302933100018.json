Moment methods are an important class of approximate models derived from kinetic equations, but require closure to truncate the moment set. In quadrature-based moment methods (QBMM), closure is achieved by inverting a finite set of moments to reconstruct a point distribution from which all unclosed moments (e. g. spatial fluxes) can be related to the finite moment set. In this work, a novel moment-inversion algorithm, based on 1-D adaptive quadrature of conditional velocity moments, is introduced and shown to always yield realizable distribution functions (i.e. non-negative quadrature weights). This conditional quadrature method of moments (CQMOM) can be used to compute exact N-point quadratures for multi-valued solutions (also known as the multivariate truncated moment problem), and provides optimal approximations of continuous distributions. In order to control numerical errors arising in volume averaging and spatial transport, an adaptive 1-D quadrature algorithm is formulated for use with CQMOM. The use of adaptive CQMOM in the context of QBMM for the solution of kinetic equations is illustrated by applying it to problems involving particle trajectory crossing (i.e. collisionless systems), elastic and inelastic particle-particle collisions, and external forces (i.e. fluid drag).
