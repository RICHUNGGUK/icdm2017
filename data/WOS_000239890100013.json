Despite their popularity, there is no dedicated language flexible enough to support the specifications of an unbound variety of views including those preexisting and needing to be newly created on demand. In this paper, we propose a novel view description language intended for specifying any arbitrary views, using a uniform set of conventions for constructing views and how to use them. The highly adaptable nature of the new language results from its built-in mechanisms to define different types of views in a systematic and repeatable manner. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
