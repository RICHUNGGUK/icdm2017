In particular, the paper deals with one of the problems which could arise when performing collaborative knowledge integration, namely detecting knowledge overlaps. The solution to the overlapping problem relies on the use of matching algorithms embedded in DSSim (short for Dempster-Shafer Similarity). To illustrate the approach, a case study of a computer configuration problem is presented. The solution to the knowledge overlap problem is important as it has the promise to become an alternative approach for the current knowledge integration solutions. Through our approach the real cost of integration can be reduced as it is not necessary to invest a great amount of resources beforehand a truly integrated system can be operational.", "paper_title": "A FRAMEWORK FOR DETECTING AND REMOVING KNOWLEDGE OVERLAPS IN A COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT: CASE OF STUDY A COMPUTER CONFIGURATION PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000324004200005"}
