They have the ability to manage descriptive data and make identifications through interactive keys. They are essential for both authors and users of biodiversity information. Xper(2) version 2.0 is one of the most user-friendly tools in its category and provides a complete environment dedicated to taxonomic management.", "paper_title": "Xper(2): introducing e-taxonomy", "paper_id": "WOS:000274973800024"}
