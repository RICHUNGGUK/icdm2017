In these situations, an alternative is resorting to the estimators based on the minimum density power divergence criterion for which feasible, computationally closed-form expressions can be derived, so that solutions can be achieved by any standard nonlinear optimization code. But since the function to be minimized is often ill-behaved, the convergence of the algorithm to optimal solutions strongly depends on the choice of the configuration of the initial values. A new procedure based on a heuristic local search approach is introduced in order to survey the parameters space and hence obtaining an accurate set of starting guesses for the gradient-method minimization routine.", "paper_title": "The heuristic approach in finding initial values for minimum density power divergence estimators", "paper_id": "WOS:000288260600007"}
