The algorithm starts by detecting the face of the signer using a Gaussian skin color model. The centroid of the detected face is then used as a reference point for tracking the hands' movements. The hands regions are segmented using a region growing algorithm assuming the signer wears a yellow and an orange colored gloves. From the segmented hands regions. an optimal set of features is extracted. To represent the time varying feature patterns, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is then used. Before using HMM in testing, the number of states and the number of Gaussian mixtures are optimized. The proposed system was implemented for both signer dependent and signer independent conditions. The experimental results show that an accuracy of more than 95% can be achieved with a large database of 300 signs. The results outperform previous work on ArSL mainly restricted to small vocabulary size. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
