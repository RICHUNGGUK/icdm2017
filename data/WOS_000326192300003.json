To prevent the same problems, a different-level simultaneous minimization scheme is proposed in this paper for robotic redundancy resolution, which combines the minimum two-norm joint-velocity and joint-torque solutions via two weighting factors. Physical constraints such as joint-angle limits, joint-velocity limits and joint-acceleration limits are also taken into consideration in such a scheme-formulation. Moreover, the proposed different-level simultaneous minimization scheme is resolved at the joint-acceleration level and reformulated as a general quadratic program (QP). Computer-simulation results based on the PUMA560 robot manipulator performing different types of end-effector path-tracking tasks demonstrate the validity and advantage of the proposed different-level simultaneous minimization scheme. Furthermore, experimental verification conducted on a practical six-link planar robot manipulator substantiates the effectiveness and the physical realizability of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Different-Level Simultaneous Minimization of Joint-Velocity and Joint-Torque for Redundant Robot Manipulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000326192300003"}
