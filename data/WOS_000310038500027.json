To compare a representative number of state-of-the-art sketch-based mesh cutting methods, we conduct a large scale user study which was carried out via extensive user experiments. To address the objective assessment of the performances of different algorithms, a complete framework with various intuitive sketch-based interfaces was developed to enable interactive mesh cutting by simply drawing sketches on mesh surface. To address the subjective assessment of user's experience, we presented the analysis of the user's responses, where the analytic hierarchy process was employed to quantify the performance of algorithms in terms of multiple criteria. Our results suggest that human in general agree on the evaluation of the performance of algorithms, and some sketch-based mesh cutting methods are consistently more favorable than others. The importance of our work lies in studying users' experience on operating various sketch-based mesh cutting tools, to motivate more practical interactive systems in the future.
