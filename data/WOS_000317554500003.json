We commence with the analysis of the distributions and amplitudes of eye-movement saccades, performed across two different image-viewing tasks: free viewing and visual search. Our working hypothesis is that the complexity of image information and task demands should interact. This should be reflected in the Markovian pattern of short and long saccades. We compute high-order Markovian models of performing a large saccade after many short ones and also propose a novel method for quantifying image complexity. The analysis of the interaction between high-order Markovianity, task and image complexity supports our hypothesis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
