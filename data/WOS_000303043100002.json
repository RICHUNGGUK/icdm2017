One of these challenges is to guarantee stability and motion coordination in the presence of inherent communication and input delays as well as system nonlinearities in the multi-agent system. Addressing this challenge herein, we report on a model reference robust control framework that guarantees stability, motion coordination, and formation control of N output strictly passive, nonlinear Lagrangian systems with arbitrarily large, nonuniform control input delays. The control framework is comprised of a reference model coupled to the nonlinear systems via the use of N modified scattering transformation blocks. It is shown that the overall control architecture is stable for any large constant delay, robust to system uncertainties, and that the control parameters are delay-independent. A numerical example with four nonlinear planar manipulators and another example with six ground vehicles are finally presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller.", "paper_title": "Teleoperation of multi-agent systems with nonuniform control input delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000303043100002"}
