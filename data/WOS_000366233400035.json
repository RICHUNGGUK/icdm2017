The presented model seeks to minimize total cost as the first objective function, and time as the second one in the considered network. Due to the NP-Hard nature of the model, a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm based on Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is presented to solve the problem in large scales. Finally, applicability of the proposed model is tested via a real case study and the results are analyzed in depth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
