This algorithm is based on a discrete version of the Complex Continuous Wavelet Transform (CCWT) which analyzes the input signal in a frame-to-frame approach and under variable frequency resolution per octave. After summarizing several Time-Frequency Distributions (TFD), concretely the standard Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), the Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (PWVD), reassignment and complex wavelets, a comparative study of the accuracy in the instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation is shown. The comparative study includes three different signal processing tools ( based on the summarized TFD): the Time-Frequency Toolbox (TFTB) of Fran, cois Auger, the High Resolution Spectrographic Routines (HRSR) of Sean Fulop and the proposed CWAS algorithm. A set of eight synthetic signals have been analyzed using six different methods: the regular STFT spectrogram, the PWVD, their corresponding reassigned versions, the Nelson crossed spectrum method and finally the Complex Continuous Wavelet Transform (CCWT). Finally, two-and three-dimensional Time-Frequency representations of the IF provided by the CWAS algorithm are presented.", "paper_title": "Instantaneous frequency estimation and representation of the audio signal through Complex Wavelet Additive Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000336657900008"}
