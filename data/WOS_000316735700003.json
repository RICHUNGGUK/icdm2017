The time fractional derivative is described in the Riemann-Liouville sense. In the proposed scheme we discretize the space derivative with a fourth-order compact scheme and use the Grunwald-Letnikov discretization of the Riemann-Liouville derivative to obtain a fully discrete implicit scheme. We analyze the solvability, stability and convergence of the proposed scheme using the Fourier method. The convergence order of method is O(tau + h(4)). Numerical examples demonstrate the theoretical results and high accuracy of the proposed scheme. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
