The paper presents a robust and effective approach for speech/music discrimination, which relies oil a two-stage cascaded classification scheme. The cascaded classification scheme is composed of a statistical pattern recognition classifier followed by a genetic fuzzy system. For the first stage of the classification scheme, other widely used classifiers. Such as neural networks and support vector machines, have also been considered in order to assess the robustness of the proposed classification scheme. Comparison with well-proven signal features is also performed. In this work, the most commonly used genetic learning algorithms (Michigan and Pittsburgh) have been evaluated in the proposed two-stage classification scheme. The genetic fuzzy system gives rise to an improvement of about 4% in the classification accuracy rate. Experimental results show the good performance of the proposed approach with a classification accuracy rate of about 97% for the best trial. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
