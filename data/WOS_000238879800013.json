The application uses the user controlled lightpaths (UCLP) software to create on-demand, end-to-end, high-bandwidth dedicated connections to access remote computers. The converted MPEG-2 files can be distributed much faster and further than the source files to these dispersed computers, for reassembly into the higher resolution format. This paper describes the demonstration that took place last September at the iGrid 2005 conference held in San Diego. As a proof of concept, we successfully demonstrated that a video transfer in a Grid network environment can be integrated with a user-controlled lightpath provisioning system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
