The typical feature of these nets is that a control of the firing dates of the transitions is required for the controlled system to behave as close as possible to the specified outputs and to ensure the liveness of tokens, when possible. This paper aims at designing a control law which is obtained by using residuated and dual residuated mappings. An example is given to illustrate the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A precompensator synthesis for P-temporal event graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239627400050"}
