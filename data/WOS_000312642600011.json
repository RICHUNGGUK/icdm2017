To this purpose, a nonlinear mathematical model of the GLMAV is firstly presented for hover and near hover flight conditions. Then, an approximate backstepping control law is derived, allowing the trajectory tracking and the stabilization of the vehicle's position and orientation while on-line estimating the unknown aerodynamics efforts. The main idea of the control law is to separate the controller into a position controller in cascade with an orientation controller. The control design will be extended such that the interconnection term between the cascaded sub-systems is minimised. Finally, numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the control law's good performance.", "paper_title": "An Approximate Backstepping Based Trajectory Tracking Control of a Gun Launched Micro Aerial Vehicle in Crosswind", "paper_id": "WOS:000312642600011"}
