Precision agriculture provides means for obtaining desirable business goals like product quality, reduced labor cost, and balanced product mix. This study describes the use of a dairy management information system implemented by S. A. E. Afikim to illustrate the applicability of systems in precision agriculture. Findings suggest that the adoption of Six Sigma-based dairy management information system supports four of five propositions: reduced product defect, optimal product mix, quality, and efficiencies.", "paper_title": "Using a Dairy Management Information System to Facilitate Precision Agriculture: The Case of the AfiMilk (R) System", "paper_id": "WOS:000315204900003"}
