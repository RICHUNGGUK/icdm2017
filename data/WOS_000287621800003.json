The automatically selected features were evaluated using literature and clinical experience. It was observed that a significant part of the automatically selected features correspond to what is known from the literature and clinical experience. We conclude that automatic feature selection is a useful tool to obtain relevant and possibly interesting features, but evaluation of the obtained features remains necessary. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
