The heart phonocardiogram is analyzed by employing ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) combined with kurtosis features to locate the presence of S-1, S-2, and extract them from the recorded data, forming the proposed HSS scheme, namely HSS-EEMD/K. Its performance is evaluated on an experimental dataset of 43 heart sound recordings performed in a real clinical environment, drawn from 11 normal subjects, 16 patients with aortic stenosis, and 16 ones with mitral regurgitation of different degrees of severity, producing 2608 S-1 and S-2 sequences without and with murmurs, respectively. Experimental results have shown that, overall, the HSS-EEMD/K approach determines the heart sound locations in a percentage of 94.56% and segments heart cycles correctly for the 83.05% of the cases. Moreover, results from a noise stress test with additive Gaussian noise and respiratory noises justify the noise robustness of the HSS-EEMD/K. When compared with four other efficient methods that mainly employ wavelet transform, energy, simplicity, and frequency measures, respectively, using the same experimental database, the HSS-EEMD/K scheme exhibits increased accuracy and prediction power over all others at the level of 7-19% and 4-9%, respectively, both in controls and pathological cases. The promising performance of the HSS-EEMD/K paves the way for further exploitation of the diagnostic value of heart sounds in everyday clinical practice.", "paper_title": "Efficient Heart Sound Segmentation and Extraction Using Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition and Kurtosis Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000340119000005"}
