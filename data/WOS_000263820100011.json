The aim of the proposed modelling approach is to provide a fuzzy set-based representation of the cascade sliding mode control of an induction motor fed by PWM voltage source inverter, which operates in a fixed reference frame. For this purpose, a new decoupled and reduced model is first proposed. Then, a set of simple surfaces and associated control laws are synthesised. A piecewise smooth control function with a threshold is adopted. However, the magnitude of this function depends closely on the upper bound of uncertainties, which include parameter variations and external disturbances. This bound is difficult to obtain prior to motor operation. To solve this problem, a fuzzy modelling approach is presented to improve the design and tuning of a fuzzy logic controller using variable structure control theory. The robust fuzzy control design is made feasible without resorting to model simplification or imposing restrictive conditions on the system uncertainty. The fuzzy controller is designed in order to improve the control performances and to reduce the control energy and the chattering phenomenon. Simulation results reveal some very interesting features and show that the proposed fuzzy sliding mode controller could be considered as an alternative to the conventional sliding mode control of induction motors.", "paper_title": "Cascade fuzzy variable structure control of induction motor based on the approach of fuzzy modelling of Ben-Ghalia", "paper_id": "WOS:000263820100011"}
