The key features of CPSS are: (1) simulation of multiuser immersive driving in a three-dimensional (3D) virtual environment; (2) integration of traffic and communication simulators with human driving based on dedicated middleware; and (3) accessibility of multiuser driving simulator on popular software and hardware platforms. This combination of features allows us to easily collect large-scale data on interesting phenomena regarding the interaction between multiple user drivers, which is not possible with current single-user driving simulators. The core original contribution of this article is threefold: (1) we introduce a multiuser driving simulator based on DiVE, our original massively multiuser networked 3D virtual environment; (2) we introduce OpenV2X, a middleware for simulating vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication; and (3) we present two experiments based on our CPSS platform. The first experiment investigates the \"rubbernecking\" phenomenon, where a platoon of four user drivers experiences an accident in the oncoming direction of traffic. Second, we report on a pilot study about the effectiveness of a Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems advisory system.", "paper_title": "A Cyber-Physical System Simulator for Risk-Free Transport Studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000340466600002"}
