We use this method to show that all the ternary patterns whose avoidability index was left open in Cassaigne's thesis are 2-avoidable. We also prove that there exist exponentially many 7/4(+)-free ternary words and 7/5(+)-free 4-ary words. Finally we give small morphisms for binary words containing only the squares 0(2), 1(2) and (01)(2) and for binary words avoiding large squares and fractional repetitions.", "paper_title": "A generator of morphisms for infinite words", "paper_id": "WOS:000242238600003"}
