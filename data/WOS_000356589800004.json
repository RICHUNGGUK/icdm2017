The proposed scheme combines prediction error expansion with the sorting technique for embedding EPR into ROI, and the recovery information is embedded into the region of non-interest (RONI) using histogram shifting (HS) method which hardly leads to the overflow and underflow problems. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme not only can embed a large amount of information with low distortion, but also can localize and recover the tampered area inside ROI.", "paper_title": "ROI-Based Reversible Data Hiding Scheme for Medical Images with Tamper Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000356589800004"}
