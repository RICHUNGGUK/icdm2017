The first method computes the Pareto-optimal tradeoffs of competing performances at full simulator accuracy. Additionally, it identifies and evaluates the technological and structural constraints that prevent further performance improvement. The second method computes linear approximations to the feasible performance regions of circuits with a large number of performances. Both techniques allow a comparison of different circuit topologies with respect to their performance capabilities and contribute to hierarchical circuit sizing. The presented methods are validated by experimental results of Pareto-front computation and feasible performance region computation of operational amplifiers and hierarchical sizing of filters.", "paper_title": "Analog performance space exploration by normal-boundary intersection and by Fourier-Motzkin elimination", "paper_id": "WOS:000258768200001"}
