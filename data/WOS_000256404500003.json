Unfortunately, the need to transmit a large number of sensor measurements over a network negatively affects the timing parameters of the control loop. This paper presents a solution to this problem by representing sensor measurements with an approximate representation-an interpolation of sensor measurements as a function of space coordinates. A priority-based medium access control (MAC) protocol is used to select the sensor messages with high information content. Thus, the information from a large number of sensor measurements is conveyed within a few messages. This approach greatly reduces the time for obtaining a snapshot of the environment state and therefore supports the real-time requirements of feedback control loops.", "paper_title": "A scalable and efficient approach for obtaining measurements in CAN-based control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000256404500003"}
