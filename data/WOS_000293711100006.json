A 16-segment parabolic polynomial interpolation is adopted to replace the traditional ROM-based phase-to-amplitude conversion methods. Besides, the proposed parabolic polynomial interpolation is realized in a multiplier-less structure such that the speed can be significantly improved. This work is manufactured by a standard 0.13 mu m CMOS cell-based technology. The maximum clock rate is 161 MHz, the core area is 0.33 mm(2), and the spurious free dynamic range (SDRF) is 117 dBc by physical measurements on silicon.", "paper_title": "A ROM-less DDFS Based on a Parabolic Polynomial Interpolation Method with an Offset", "paper_id": "WOS:000293711100006"}
