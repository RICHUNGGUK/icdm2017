The aim was to develop a method for comparison of stress distribution in various fixation devices, to determine whether the use of multibody musculoskeletal input in such model is applicable and to report the approach. The focus was on realistic loading and the motivation for the work is that the treatment can be enhanced by a better understanding of the loading of the clavicle and fixation device. The method can be used to confirm the strength of customised plates, for optimisation of new plates and to complement experimental studies. A finite element (FE) mesh of the clavicle geometry was created from computed tomography data and imported into the FE solver where the model was subjected to muscle forces and other boundary conditions from a multibody musculoskeletal model performing a typical activity of daily life. A reconstruction plate and screws were also imported into the model. The combination models returned stresses and displacements of plausible magnitudes in all included parts and the result, upon further development and validation, may serve as a design guideline for improved clavicle fixation.", "paper_title": "Combined finite element and multibody musculoskeletal investigation of a fractured clavicle with reconstruction plate", "paper_id": "WOS:000345141700006"}
