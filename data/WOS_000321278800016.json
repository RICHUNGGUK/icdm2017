Based on vertical handover (VHO) experiments conducted between Long Term Evolution (LTE) and heterogeneous accesses over the evolved packet core (EPC) using FPMIPv6, it was recognized that consistently reliable seamless VHO operations were difficult to accomplish due to limitations in FPMIPv6. Noticeably, VHO performance degradation resulted from the serving network (SN) lacking information of the target network (TN) when the TN is a heterogeneous protocol domain, packet congestion and loss problems occurring on specific network gateway interfaces, and also from using long packet-forwarding paths. In this article, an enhanced FPMIPv6 technique is proposed to solve these problems and improve the VHO operation by using shorter data-paths and improved coordination of buffered packet-forwarding and TN switching, which results in a significantly reduced packet-delay.", "paper_title": "ENHANCEMENTS TO FPMIPV6 FOR IMPROVED SEAMLESS VERTICAL HANDOVER BETWEEN LTE AND HETEROGENEOUS ACCESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000321278800016"}
