These drawings should contain certain depth cues, such as perspective and overlapping. Until recently, parallax has not been used as a depth cue. Nevertheless, new technologies allow it to be incorporated. This forms the background to our study of the design of interactive educational resources and stereoscopic graphics. The results obtained demonstrate that (1) the use of parallax cues improves the interpretation of the figures and (2) that the assistance they afford is most appreciated by the students with less highly developed spatial perception.
