To this end, neighbor discovery research has been conducted, but it still has room for improvement in terms of discovery delay. Furthermore, prior work has overlooked energy efficiency, which is considered as the critical factor in wireless devices or appliances. For better performance with respect to the discovery delay and energy efficiency, we proposed a novel p-persistent-based neighbor discovery protocol and devised a simple and light algorithm estimating the number of neighbor nodes to support the proposed protocol. Our protocol requires a lower delay and a smaller number of messages for the discovery process than the existing protocols. For extensive performance evaluation, we adopted extra comparison targets from other research areas within the same context.
