Deformational potential energy profiles (PEPs), and pathways between the different isomeric conformational energies were calculated using DFT/B3LYP/6-31G. The relative conformational energies of Delta(lambda lambda lambda), Delta(lambda lambda delta), Delta(lambda delta delta) and Delta(delta delta delta) are 10.48, 7.08, 3.56, and 0.0 kcal/mol, respectively, which are small compared to the barrier heights for reversible phase transitions (49.56, 49.55, 49.52 kcal/mol, respectively). Frequency assignment was carried out by decomposing Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra using Gaussian and Gaussview. The theoretical IR and vibrational dichroism spectroscopy (VCD) absorption spectra are presented for all conformations within the range of 400-3,500 cm(-1).", "paper_title": "Conformational stabilities, infrared, and vibrational dichroism spectroscopy studies of tris(ethylenediamine) zinc(II) chloride", "paper_id": "WOS:000261065300003"}
