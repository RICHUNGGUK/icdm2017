Text mining aims to automatically extract facts from literature. Since authors write in natural language, text mining is a great natural language processing challenge, which is far from being solved. We propose an alternative: If authors and editors summarize the main facts in a controlled natural language, text mining will become easier and more powerful. To demonstrate this approach, we use the language Attempto Controlled English (ACE). We define a simple model to capture the main aspects of protein interactions. To evaluate our approach, we collected a dataset of 459 paragraph headings about protein interaction from literature. 56% of these headings can be represented exactly in ACE and another 23% partially. These results indicate that our approach is feasible.", "paper_title": "Improving text mining with controlled natural language: A case study for protein interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000239622300005"}
