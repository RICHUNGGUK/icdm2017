Given a geometric model represented as a point cloud, we construct a domain manifold which is a smooth surface blended from simple local patches. The original points are then projected on to the local patches and their displacements are adjusted so that the final displaced surface approximates the given point data with high precision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various applications, including multi-resolution representations and skeleton-driven shape deformation.", "paper_title": "A surface displaced from a manifold", "paper_id": "WOS:000239567900056"}
