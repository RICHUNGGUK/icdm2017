Relative to single image denoising techniques, denoising of sequences aims to also utilize the temporal dimension. This assists in getting both faster algorithms and better output quality. This paper focuses on utilizing sparse and redundant representations for image sequence denoising. extending the work reported in [1], [2]. In the single image setting, the K-SVD algorithm is used to train a sparsifying dictionary, for the corrupted image. This paper generalizes the above algorithm by, offering several extensions: i) the atoms used are 3-D; ii) the dictionary is propagated from one frame to the next. reducing the number of required iterations. and iii) averaging is done on patches in both spatial and temporal neighboring locations. These modifications lead to substantial benefits in complexity, and denoising performance, compared to simply, running the single image algorithm sequentially. The algorithm's performance is experimentally, compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating comparable or favorable results.", "paper_title": "Image Sequence Denoising via Sparse and Redundant Representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000262221900003"}
