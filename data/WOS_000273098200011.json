Particular attention is devoted to the non-quasi-static effects, which play a crucial role at microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies. The advantages and disadvantages of these different equivalent circuit topologies are analyzed from both theoretical and experimental standpoints. This study clearly proves that best choice among these model representations depends on the specific device technology besides the investigated frequency range. (c) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
