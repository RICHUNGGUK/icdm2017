A class of efficient methods and software for solving large-scale trust-region subproblems (TRSs) is based on a parametric-eigenvalue formulation of the subproblem. The solution of a sequence of large symmetric eigenvalue problems is the main computation in these methods. In this work, we study the robustness and performance of eigenvalue-based methods for the large-scale TRS. We describe the eigenvalue problems and their features, and discuss the computational challenges they pose as well as some approaches to handle them. We present results from a numerical study of the sensitivity of solutions to the TRS to eigenproblem solutions.", "paper_title": "Computational and sensitivity aspects of eigenvalue-based methods for the large-scale trust-region subproblem", "paper_id": "WOS:000320093700012"}
