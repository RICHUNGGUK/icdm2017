This brief proposes a near-V-th 9T SRAM cell implemented in a 22-nm FinFET technology. The read buffer of the proposed cell ensures read stability by decoupling the stored node from the read bit-line and improves read performance using a one-transistor read path. Energy and standby power are reduced by eliminating the sub-V-th leakage current in the read buffer. For accurate sensing yield estimation, a new yield-estimation method is also proposed, which considers the dynamic trip voltage. The proposed SRAM cell can achieve a minimum operating voltage of 0.3 V.", "paper_title": "Single-Ended 9T SRAM Cell for Near-Threshold Voltage Operation With Enhanced Read Performance in 22-nm FinFET Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000364209000044"}
