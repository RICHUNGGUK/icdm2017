Analyzing mixed-type data to extract the hidden patterns valuable to decision-making is therefore beneficial and critical for corporations to remain competitive. In addition, visualization facilitates exploration in the early stage of data analysis. In the paper, we present a visualized approach to analyzing multivariate mixed-type data. The proposed framework based on an extended self-organizing map allows visualized data cluster analysis as well as classification. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by analyzing two real-world datasets and compare with other existing models to show its advantages. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
