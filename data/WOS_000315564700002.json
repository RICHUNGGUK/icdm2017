We propose three algorithms for Problem (i). The first one runs in O(nklogn) time and O(n) space. The second one is efficient where k << n; it runs in O(nlogn+nk+k(2)log(3)n) time and O(nlogn) space. The third one is based on parametric search and it runs in O(nlogn+klog(4)n) time. For Problem (ii), the time and space complexities of the proposed algorithm are O(nk) and O(n) respectively. For Problem (iii), our proposed algorithm runs in O(nlogn) time and O(n) space.", "paper_title": "Some variations on constrained minimum enclosing circle problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000315564700002"}
