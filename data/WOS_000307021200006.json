The major hypothesis of this paper is that different online product presentation strategies have a different impact on the customer's choice and that this impact can be measured. The research was conducted using an experimental method based on 6 product groups of 8 products per group. The products were presented with different combinations of several audio and visual elements: text, picture, video, animation, speech, special sound, and background music. The impact of each combination on the customer's choice was tested on a customer sample of 46 examinees. The most important conclusion is that besides text and a picture of the product, it is highly recommendable to include a video of the product in the product's online presentation. Regarding the number of multimedia elements, it is better to include more than less elements in a product presentation on the Internet, in contrast to some findings in connection with e-Learning.", "paper_title": "Product Presentation Strategy for Online Customers", "paper_id": "WOS:000307021200006"}
