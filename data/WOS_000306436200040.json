A number of enterprise modeling methods have been developed in recent years mainly to offer support for enterprise design and help specify systems requirements and solutions. However, those methods are inefficient in providing sufficient support for quality systems links and assessment. The implementation parts of the processes linked to the standards remain unclear and ambiguous for the practitioners as a result of new standards introduction. This paper proposed to integrate new revision of AS/EN9100 aerospace quality elements through systematic integration approach which can help the enterprises in business re-engineering process. The assessment capability model is also presented to identify impacts on the existing system as a result of introducing new standards.", "paper_title": "An integrated modeling method for assessment of quality systems applied to aerospace manufacturing supply chains", "paper_id": "WOS:000306436200040"}
