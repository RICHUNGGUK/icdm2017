The code provides the mass spectrum, cross-sections, relic density and exotic fluxes of gamma rays, positrons and antiprotons. The propagation of charged particles in the Galactic halo is handled with a new module that allows to easily modify the propagation parameters.

Phys. Comm. 180 (2009) 747 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Calculation of the relic density and detection rates of the lightest stable particle in a generic new model of particle physics. Solution method: In numerically solving the evolution equation for the density of dark matter, relativistic formulas for the thermal average are used. All tree-level processes for annihilation and coannihilation of new particles in the model are included. The cross-sections for all processes are calculated exactly with CalcHEP after definition of a model file. The propagation of the charged cosmic rays is solved within a semi-analytical two-zone model. Reasons for new version: There are many experiments that are currently searching for the remnants of dark matter annihilation. In this version we perform the computation of indirect signals from dark matter annihilation in any new model with a stable weakly interacting particle. We include the propagation of charged particles in the Galactic halo. Summary of revisions: Annihilation cross-sections for all 2-body tree-level processes and for radiative emission of a photon for all models. Annihilation cross-sections into polarised gauge bosons. Annihilation cross-sections for the loop induced processes gamma gamma and gamma Z(0) in the MSSM. Modelling of the DM halo with a general parameterization and with the possibility of including DM clumps. Computation of the propagation of charged particles through the Galaxy, including the possibility of modifying the propagation parameters. Effect of solar modulation on the charged particle spectrum. Model independent predictions of the indirect detection signals. Unusual features: Depending on the parameters of the model, the program generates additional new code. compiles it and loads it dynamically. Running time: 3 sec (C) 2010 Elsevier By.
