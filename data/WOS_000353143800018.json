Wireless devices report on each event using one of multiple reporting formats. Each format has a different quality and uses different data lengths. Delivering all data in the highest-quality format can overload system resources. The goal is to make intelligent format selection and routing decisions to maximize time-averaged information quality subject to network stability. Lyapunov optimization theory can be used to solve such a problem by repeatedly minimizing the linear terms of a quadratic drift-plus-penalty expression. To reduce delays, this paper proposes a novel extension of this technique that preserves the quadratic nature of the drift minimization while maintaining a fully separable structure. In addition, to avoid high queuing delay, paths are restricted to at most 2 hops. The resulting algorithm can push average information quality arbitrarily close to optimum, with a tradeoff in queue backlog. The algorithm compares favorably to the basic drift-plus-penalty scheme in terms of backlog and delay.", "paper_title": "Quality of Information Maximization for Wireless Networks via a Fully Separable Quadratic Policy", "paper_id": "WOS:000353143800018"}
