We present a novel approach for descreening color scanned documents aimed at providing an efficient solution to the Moire problem in practical imaging devices, including copiers and multifunction printers. The algorithm works by combining two nonlinear image-processing techniques, resolution synthesis-based denoising (RSD), and modified smallest univalue segment assimilating nucleus (SUSAN) filtering. The RSD predictor is based on a stochastic image model whose parameters are optimized beforehand in a separate training procedure. Using the optimized parameters, RSD classifies the local window around the current pixel in the scanned image and applies filters optimized for the selected classes. The output of the RSD predictor is treated as a first-order estimate to the descreened image. The modified SUSAN filter uses the output of RSD for performing an edge-preserving smoothing on the raw scanned data and produces the final output of the descreening algorithm. Our method does not require any knowledge of the screening method, such as the screen frequency or dither matrix coefficients, that produced the printed original. The proposed scheme not only suppresses the Moire artifacts, but, in addition, can be trained with intrinsic sharpening for deblurring scanned documents. Finally, once optimized for a periodic clustered-dot halftoning method, the same algorithm can be used to inverse halftone scanned images containing stochastic error diffusion halftone noise.", "paper_title": "Training-based descreening", "paper_id": "WOS:000244311100017"}
