This paper addresses a new online error handling approach or named per-sample-error-counting (PSeC) technique that tends to replace native error handling protocol in controller area network (CAN). The mechanism is designed to manage transmission errors of both sensor and control data in networked control system (NCS) used in controlling dynamic system such that the stability of the feedback system is preserved. A new parameter denoted as maximum allowable number of error burst (MAEB) is introduced in which MAEB is selected based on available bandwidth of the CAN network. MAEB serves as the maximum number of attempt of re-transmission of erroneous data per sample which allows the maximum transmission period to be known and guaranteed for time-critical control system. The efficacy of the proposed method is verified by applying the algorithm on the fourth order inverted pendulum system simulated on Matlab/Truetime simulator and the performance is benchmarked with the existing CAN error management protocol. The simulation run under various systems conditions demonstrate that the proposed method results in superior system performance in handling data transmission error as well as meeting control system requirement.
