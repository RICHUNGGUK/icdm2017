This implicit representation is useful in performing many mesh processing operations such as mesh fusion and mesh filtering in object surface reconstruction. Setting an appropriate grid resolution is mandatory for obtaining good quality results from these operations. Grid resolution is usually set experimentally by operators until satisfying results are obtained. An automated process is demonstrated that improves this parameter setting step. We also introduce a new marching cube triangulation adaptation to the vector field distance transform. Unlike the previous adaptation, our algorithm allows vertex interpolation on cube faces instead of only on cube edges. We compare our new design to the previous one using a reliable error metric evaluation. Results show our triangulation outperforms the previous one in terms of mesh quality and runtime performances. The new algorithm takes advantage of the more accurate vector field definition to better approximate the implicit isosurface.", "paper_title": "Automatic Grid Resolution and Efficient Triangulation of Implicit Vector Field", "paper_id": "WOS:000285500900012"}
