The basic idea is to allow arbitrary vehicles to broadcast ad hoc messages (e.g. traffic accidents) to other vehicles. However, this raises the concern of security and privacy. Messages should be signed and verified before they are trusted while the real identity of vehicles should not be revealed, but traceable by authorized party. Existing solutions either rely too heavily on a tamper-proof hardware device, or do not have an effective message verification scheme. In this paper, we propose a multiple level authentication scheme which still makes use of tamper-proof devices but the strong assumption that a long-term system master secret is preloaded into all tamper-proof devices is removed. Instead the master secret can be updated if needed to increase the security level. On the other hand, messages sent by vehicles are classified into two types - regular messages and urgent messages. Regular messages can be verified by neighboring vehicles by means of Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) while urgent messages can only be verified with the aid of RSUs nearby by means of a conditional privacy-preserving authentication scheme. Through extensive simulation, we show that our multiple level authentication scheme is much more efficient that those RSU-aided authentication scheme as long as the proportion of urgent messages is less than 100%. The verification delay required can be up to 110 times smaller than other protocols. Our implementation shows that batch verification may not be as efficient as expected. In case without batch verification, the verification delay required by our scheme can even be up to 173 times smaller. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
