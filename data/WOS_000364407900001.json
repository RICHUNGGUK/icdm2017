These two operators consider the interactive characteristics between elements and that of their ordered positions. Meanwhile, some important cases and desirable properties are studied. To simplify the complexity of solving a fuzzy measure, the uncertain induced generalized lambda-Shapley averaging (UIG lambda SA) operator and the uncertain induced generalized hybrid lambda-Shapley averaging (UIGH lambda SA) operator based on lambda-fuzzy measures are presented. Finally, two new approaches to uncertain multi-attribute group decision making are developed, and a numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed procedures.", "paper_title": "Some uncertain generalized Shapley aggregation operators for multi-attribute group decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000364407900001"}
