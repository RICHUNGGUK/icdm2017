With the definition of this language, we hope to have a common framework for developing applications that allow multimodal interaction at 3D stages. Thus we have defined the basis of an architecture that allows us to integrate the components of such multimodal interaction applications in 3D virtual environments.", "paper_title": "Multimodal interaction with virtual worlds XMMVR: eXtensible language for MultiModal interaction with virtual reality worlds", "paper_id": "WOS:000361736700001"}
