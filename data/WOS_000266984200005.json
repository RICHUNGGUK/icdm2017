The proportional differentiation model is very convenient for network operators to quantitatively adjust the quality differentiation among service classes. To provide proportional differentiated services for OBS networks, a proportional differentiation scheme based on batch scheduling is proposed in this article. The scheme adopts the batch scheduling idea to reserve data channel resources for a batch of data bursts. It helps to decrease burst dropping probability. When some data bursts are unsuccessfully scheduled, a preemption method is used to keep a proportional burst dropping probability among service classes according to the expected burst dropping probability equations given by the proportional differentiation model. The scheme has low computational complexity. Simulation results show that the scheme can provide proportional differentiated services and efficiently decrease the burst dropping probability.", "paper_title": "A new proportional differentiation scheme based on batch scheduling for optical burst switching networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000266984200005"}
