These are all found to be problem flows for URANS models. For DES fifth-order upwinding is found too dissipative and the use of, for high speed flows, instability prone centred differencing essential. An existing hybrid ILES-RANS modelling approach, intended for flexible geometry, relatively high numerical dissipation codes is tested along with differential wall distance algorithms. The former gives promising results. The standard turbulence modelling approaches are found to give perhaps a surprising results variation. Results suggest that for the problem flows, the explicit algebraic stress and Menter shear stress transport (SST) URANS models are more accurate than the economical Spalart-Allmaras (SA). However, the explicit algebraic stress model (EASM) in its k-epsilon. form is impractically expensive to converge. Here, SA predictions lack a rotation correction term and this is likely to improve these results.
