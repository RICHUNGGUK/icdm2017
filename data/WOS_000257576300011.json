The algorithm was developed in HSI space where the intensity component was not very sensitive to noise. First, an initial decision map was generated by computing the classical SML (sum-modified-laplacian) as the pixels' focus measure using the intensity component; second, by subtracting one of multi-focus images from another, a coarse edge map was obtained to refine the initial decision map: third, a fast region-filling method was used to build the final decision map; fourth, a soft fusion strategy was applied to the transition zone between focused and clefocused regions and a nice-looking fused image was generated. Experiments showed that the algorithm was effective and the results were acceptable. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
