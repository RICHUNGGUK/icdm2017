Therefore, meta-heuristic algorithms are extensively adopted to solve such problems efficiently. This study proposes a regression-based particle swarm optimization for feature selection problem. The proposed algorithm can increase population diversity and avoid local optimal trapping by improving the jump ability of flying particles. The data sets collected from UCI machine learning databases are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Classification accuracy is used as a criterion to evaluate classifier performance. Results show that our proposed approach outperforms both genetic algorithms and sequential search algorithms.", "paper_title": "A new particle swarm feature selection method for classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000336277700008"}
