The new smoothing tries to fit a given domain by the parallelograms. We present several numerical examples and compare our results against the traditional Laplacian smoothing. Presented numerical work shows that the new approach is superior to the Laplacian smoothing.", "paper_title": "A new smoothing algorithm for quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400032"}
