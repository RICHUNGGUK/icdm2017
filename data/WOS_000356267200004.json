This paper proposes CCCloud: a context-aware and credible cloud service selection model based on the comparison and aggregation of subjective assessments extracted from ordinary cloud consumers and objective assessments from quantitative performance testing parties. We propose a novel approach to evaluate cloud users' credibility, which not only can accurately evaluate how truthfully they assess cloud services, but also resist user collusion. In addition, in our model, objective assessments are used as benchmarks to filter out potentially biased subjective assessments, and then objective assessments and subjective assessments are aggregated to evaluate the overall performance of a cloud service. Furthermore, our model takes the contexts of objective assessments and subjective assessments into account. By calculating the similarity between different contexts, the benchmark level of objective assessments is dynamically adjusted according to context similarity, and the aggregated final scores of alternative cloud services are weighted by the similarity between the contexts of a potential cloud consumer and every testing party. This makes our cloud service selection model reflect potential cloud consumers' customized requirements more effectively. Finally, our proposed model is evaluated through the experiments conducted under different conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the existing work, especially in the resistance of user collusion.", "paper_title": "CCCloud: Context-Aware and Credible Cloud Service Selection Based on Subjective Assessment and Objective Assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000356267200004"}
