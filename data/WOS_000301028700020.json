We introduce IBAR, a new software package for calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the IBM-1 Hamiltonian, for large numbers of bosons. Energies and wavefunctions of the nuclear states, as well as transition strengths between them, are calculated using these values. Numerical errors in the recursive calculation of reduced matrix elements of the d-boson creation operator are reduced by using an arbitrary precision mathematical library. This software has been tested for up to 1000 bosons using comparisons to analytic expressions. Comparisons have also been made to the code PHINT for smaller system sizes.

Solution method: Reduced matrix elements of the d-boson creation operator have been stored in data files at machine precision, after being recursively calculated with higher than machine precision. The Hamiltonian matrix is calculated and diagonalized, and the requested transition strengths are calculated using the eigenvectors. Restrictions: The 1000 boson coefficients for L = 0 and L = 20 have been included in the IBAR distribution and the 7.3 GB of data that make up the remaining coefficients for L = 21 to L = 2000 are available upon request. Running time: If the provided example is changed to include 100 bosons, the calculation requires about 1 second of run time. For 1000 bosons, the calculation requires about 9 minutes of run time.
