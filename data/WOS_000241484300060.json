Since each vehicle has an exclusion volume and moves by itself not being ruled by the Newton's laws of motion, CA is quite suitable for modelling traffic flow. In the present paper, we propose a stochastic CA model for traffic flow and show the availability of CA modelling for the complex phenomena that occur in real traffic flow.", "paper_title": "Stochastic cellular-automaton model for traffic flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000241484300060"}
