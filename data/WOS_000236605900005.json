Based on the existence of a pair of adjoint functors between the topos of presheaves of the Boolean kind of structure and the category of the quantum kind of structure, we establish a twofold complementarity scheme which constitutes an instance of the concept of adjunction. It is further argued that the established scheme is inextricably connected with a realistic philosophical attitude, although substantially different from the classical one.", "paper_title": "Category-theoretic analysis of the notion of complementarity for quantum systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000236605900005"}
