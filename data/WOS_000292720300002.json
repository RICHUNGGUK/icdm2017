It was shown that if the processor can run at arbitrary speeds and uses power sa when running at speed s(alpha) the online heuristic AVR has a competitive ratio (2 alpha)(alpha)/2. In this paper we first study the online heuristics for the discrete model where the processor can only run at d given speeds. We propose a method to transform online heuristic AVR to an online heuristic for the discrete model and prove a competitive ratio 2(alpha-1)(alpha-1)(alpha-1)(delta(alpha)-1)(alpha)/(delta-1)(delta(alpha)-delta)(alpha-1) + 1, where delta is the maximum ratio between adjacent non-zero speed levels. We also prove that the analysis holds for a class of heuristics that satisfy certain natural properties. We further study the throughput maximization problem when there is an upper bound for the maximum speed. We propose a greedy algorithm with running time O(n(2) log n) and prove that the output schedule is a 3-approximation of the throughput and a (alpha-1)(alpha-1)(3(alpha)-1)(alpha)/2 alpha(alpha)(3(alpha-1)-1)(alpha-1) approximation of the energy consumption.
