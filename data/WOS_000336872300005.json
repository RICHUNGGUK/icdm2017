The smaller the sensing interval and the greater the amount of service time, the more accurate the service, but the more energy is consumed. Thus, use of context-aware applications always involves a trade-off. In this paper, we propose an automatic method of optimizing the level of personalization involving the sensing cycle and service time of a personalized application. The method proposes a quadratic form of total cost curve which demonstrated that the minimum identified value is always the global optimum. This eliminates the necessity of an exhaustive search for the minimum value for all levels of personalization. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
