To this end, considering users spatial distribution, we propose a new interference control (IC) model, which guarantees SINR (signal to interference plus noise ratio) requirements of different services and ensures the coverage performance of base stations (BSs). Under such an IC model, we formulate the DSA scheme as a combinatorial optimization problem. Since the problem is computationally intractable, we design an algorithm for its solution based on graph coloring. Simulation results indicate that the proposed DSA scheme can increase the total spectrum utility while effectively controlling the interference among BSs and meeting SINR requirements of users.", "paper_title": "Coverage probability driven dynamic spectrum allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000323665900020"}
