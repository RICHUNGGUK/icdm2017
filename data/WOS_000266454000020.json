Present observations of geophysical fields (temperature, velocity) are incorporated in a three-dimensional dynamic model to determine the initial conditions of the fields. We present and compare numerical techniques for solving the inverse problem: backward advection, variational (adjoint), and quasi-reversibility methods. The methods are applied to restore the evolution of the mantle structures such as rising plumes and descending lithospheric plates. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
