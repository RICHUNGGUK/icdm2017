It operates under the framework of hierarchical finite capacity shop-floor modelling and discrete event simulation. HBS applies a set of transformation relations in order to convert a finite capacity forwards scheduling method (FS) that can employ different assignment policies to their backward counterparts. These policies include both single criterion conventional dispatching rules, as well as an adjustable multiple-criteria decision making technique that can take into consideration a number of different conflicting criteria, such as flowtime, tardiness and manufacturing cost. Performance of the HBS method was studied through a set of simulation experiments in a typical textile industry and was evaluated through a number of relevant performance indicators.", "paper_title": "A simulation-based hybrid backwards scheduling framework for manufacturing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242761900002"}
