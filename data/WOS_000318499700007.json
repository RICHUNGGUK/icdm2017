The peculiarity of the triangular structure to exhibit multiple resonances is usually proposed for dual and three-band purposes, to obtain efficient unit cells for high performance microwave tunable oscillators. One more characteristic of the triangular shape is the meta-material behavior, which allows a significant size decrease of the device. Coupled resonating configurations are proposed in this contribution, to be manufactured in Microsystem Technology by using polymeric layers as spacers between individual resonators organized in a vertical stack. Electromagnetic simulations have been performed to study narrow-band filters characterized by reduced dimensions, low insertion loss and steep band edges. Lumped element models are presented which can be easily implemented in commercial circuital software packages for the design of networks using these resonators.", "paper_title": "Design of single and coupled microwave meta-material resonators in microsystem technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000318499700007"}
