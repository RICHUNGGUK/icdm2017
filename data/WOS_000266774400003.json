Spatial data were used to describe a range of landscape features and processes that influence the risk of salinity occurring. The data were compiled into three core components: biophysical hazard, current management influence and salinity stage. A salinity risk rating was developed for 43 individual surface hydrological sub-catchments within the Condamine catchment by combining the three component rankings in a structured rule framework. The underlying data, decision rules and all associated documents were packaged in an ArcGIS personal geodatabase for use by the client. This allowed the results to be viewed spatially and ensured that the risk assessment process was transparent to users.", "paper_title": "Implementation of an adaptive salinity risk framework in the Condamine catchment, Queensland Murray-Darling Basin, Australia", "paper_id": "WOS:000266774400003"}
