Numerical simulation switches back and forth between real and Fourier spaces to handle dipolar field effects in three-dimensional sample. The iMQC signals of each component of two-component systems can be obtained respectively when the second pulse of the CRAZED pulse sequence is selective. Simulation results show that chemical shift provides an edge detection method to regions containing spins with chemical shift offset and selected by the second RF pulse, and different gray value is related to different chemical shift in detected regions. These results indicate that chemical shift may provide new imaging information helpful for iMQC magnetic resonance imaging.", "paper_title": "Numerical simulations of contribution of chemical shift in novel magnetic resonance imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100046"}
