In this paper, we propose Triple Space Computing as a new communication and coordination framework for Semantic Web and Semantic Web Services. We identify the value added by TSC and propose the overall architecture of TSC and the interactions among different components.", "paper_title": "Triple Space Computing: Adding semantics to space-based computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800030"}
