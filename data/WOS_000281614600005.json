Recently, this topic was also investigated in the framework of spiking neural P systems. One of the small universality results is that a small weakly universal extended spiking neural P system with 12 neurons was constructed. In this paper, a new way is introduced for simulating register machines by spiking neural P systems, where only one neuron is used for all instructions of the register machine; in this way, we can use less neurons to construct universal spiking neural P system. Specifically, we give a smaller weakly universal spiking neural P system that uses extended rules and has only 9 neurons. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
