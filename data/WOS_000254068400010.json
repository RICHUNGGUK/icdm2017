Ail idea is introduced using a circle, where ail arc-intersecting polyline is used instead of the traditional inner-arc polyline. The approach is then generalized to arbitrary 2D curves. The method is extended into 3D, where the approximation of spherical surface is developed based oil surface-intersecting facets. Finally, a method is described for approximating the general curved surface. Theoretical analysis and the experimental results showed that the new algorithm requires considerably less geometric data at the same approximation error than the traditional one.
