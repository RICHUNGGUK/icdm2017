Based on a method of directly comparing the energies of the subdivision trees given in [1], together with using some computer-aided calculations and using some results provided by Andriantiana in [2], we prove that the conjecture proposed in [2] on the first 3n - 84 (when n is odd) and 3n - 87 (when n is even) largest energy trees is true.", "paper_title": "Proof of a Conjecture on Trees with Large Energy", "paper_id": "WOS:000312622900005"}
