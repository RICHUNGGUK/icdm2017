In this paper, a new methodology called distributed augmented reality for visualizing collaborative construction tasks (DARCC) is proposed. Using this methodology, virtual models of construction equipment can be operated and viewed by several operators to interactively simulate construction activities on the construction site in augmented reality mode. The paper investigates the design issues of DARCC including tracking and registration, object modeling, engineering constraints, and interaction and communication methods. The DARCC methodology is implemented in a prototype system and tested in a case study about a bridge deck rehabilitation project.", "paper_title": "Distributed Augmented Reality for Visualizing Collaborative Construction Tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270913900013"}
