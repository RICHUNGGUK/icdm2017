In this method, activity in different groups of axons is discriminated by their propagation velocity. A multi-electrode cuff and an array of amplifiers produce multiple neural signals; if artificial delays are inserted and the signals are added, the activity in axons of the matched velocity are emphasized. We call this intrinsic velocity selective recording. However, simulation shows that interpreting the time signals is then not straight-forward and the selectivity Qv is low. New theory shows that bandpass filters improve the selectivity and explains why this is true in the time domain. A simulation study investigates the limits on the available velocity selectivity both with and without additive noise and with reasonable sampling rates and analogue-to-digital conversion parameters. Bandpass filters can improve the selectivity by factors up to 7 but this depends on the speed of the action potential and the signal-to-noise ratio.", "paper_title": "The theory of velocity selective neural recording: a study based on simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000302263100011"}
