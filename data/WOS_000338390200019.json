Firstly, by using the concept of IFSS, we present the concept of intuitionistic nested set (INS) and show that an IFS can be determined by an INS. Secondly, we introduce the concept of lambda-cut sets of IFS and show that lambda-cut sets of IFS have the same properties as the cut sets of Zadeh fuzzy set. Thirdly, by using the concepts of lambda-cut set of IFS and INS, we build up the decomposition theorem, representation theorem and extension principle of IFS. Finally, we apply our theory to intuitionistic fuzzy algebra and obtain the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy subgroup. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
