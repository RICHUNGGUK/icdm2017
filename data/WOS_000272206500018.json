Two FMCDM methods are proposed for solving the MCDM problem: Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is applied to determine the relative weights of the evaluation criteria and the extension of the Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS) is applied to rank the alternatives. Empirical results show that the proposed methods are viable approaches in solving the problem. When the performance ratings are vague and imprecise, this Fuzzy MCDM is a preferred solution.
