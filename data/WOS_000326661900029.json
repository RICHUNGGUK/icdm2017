Such propagation modeling is typical of ground-level networking along with node mobility. The metrics of main interest are the probability of having a reliable multi-hop path plus the temporal statistics of such availability under a Markovian model. Such availability is an indicator for the suitability of the network to carry delay-sensitive applications (push-to-talk voice, streaming video) in uninterrupted manner. It is shown that high levels of diversity are necessary in such adverse environments, as obtained either by multiple independent paths or via concurrent cooperative transmission. Analytical and simulation comparisons of typical routing options are presented on the above metrics, plus on the required nodal engagement for supporting such diversity.
