We propose in this paper a novel framework of shape segmentation using deformation models learned from multiple shapes. The deformation model from the target image to every other image is then estimated. Finally, normalized-cut graph partition is applied to the graph constructed based on the similarity of local patches in the target image, and a segmentation of the shape is carried out. Experimental results for images from MPEG7 shape database show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Segmenting Shape Using Deformation Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000267639600009"}
