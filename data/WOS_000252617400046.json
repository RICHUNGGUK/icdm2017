This paper considers checkpointing recovery services for a mobile computing system based on the ad-hoe network environment. Since potential problems of this new environment are insufficient power and limited storage capacity, the proposed scheme tries to reduce disk access frequency for saving recovery information, and also the amount of information saved for recovery. A brief simulation study has been performed and the results show that the proposed scheme takes advantage of the existing checkpointing recovery schemes.", "paper_title": "Fault-tolerance for the mobile ad-hoc environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000252617400046"}
