We introduce the Skyline algorithm, which traces the graph corresponding to the maximal surface. The algorithm has both a complete and an iterative version, which we present, along with the classical Lark's algorithm, in terms of the basic dictionary-based simplex iteration from linear programming. We discuss computational complexity results, and present comparative experiments on both randomly-generated and well-known POMDP benchmarks.", "paper_title": "The Skyline algorithm for POMDP value function pruning", "paper_id": "WOS:000305908200003"}
