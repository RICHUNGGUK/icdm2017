Roldan et al. showed a unified version of these results for nonlinear mappings in any number of variables (which were not necessarily permuted or ordered) introducing the notion of multidimensional coincidence point. Very recently, Choudhury et al. proved coupled coincidence point results in the context of fuzzy metric spaces in the sense of George and Veeramani. In this paper, using the idea of coincidence point for nonlinear mappings in any number of variables, we study a fuzzy contractivity condition to ensure the existence of coincidence points in the framework of fuzzy metric spaces provided with Hadzic type t-norms. Then, we present an illustrative example in which our methodology leads to the existence of coincidence points but previous theorems cannot be applied. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
