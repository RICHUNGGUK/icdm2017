Cloud computing can be regarded as the general principle for using and providing web and grid services. First, we provide a meta-study, where we evaluate existing and published empirical studies. Furthermore, we conduct and evaluate an own empirical study with a representative group of European and International enterprises. Key findings of the work include the significantly higher importance of Business Drivers for the adoption of cloud computing, as compared to Technical Drivers.", "paper_title": "A survey on IT-governance aspects of cloud computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000296796900003"}
