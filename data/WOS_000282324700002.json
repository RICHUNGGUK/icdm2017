Based on the coherence multiplexing (CM) and spatial division multiplexing (SDM) techniques, this hybrid sensing network can support more than 40 sensors for quasi-distributed detection. It is demonstrated experimentally that the multiplexed sensing signal of each sensor can be clearly distinguished by an optical low-coherence reflectometry (OLCR). Methane concentration is detected with maximum sensitivities of an intensity variation of 10.92% and a concentration variation of 1%, using a well-designed sensor structure. Strain and temperature are also detected by this system, which also exhibits good results in the experiment.", "paper_title": "Quasi-distributed sensing network based on coherence multiplexing and spatial division multiplexing for coal mine security monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000282324700002"}
