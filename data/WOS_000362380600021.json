Unfortunately, nearby vehicles often go unnoticed because of various obstacles such as other vehicles, buildings, or poor weather. In this paper, we study Moving range k-nearest neighbor (MRkNN) queries as a tool for continuously monitoring nearby moving objects. A simple approach to processing MRkNN queries is to have each object periodically broadcast information regarding its movements (i.e., location and velocity at a particular time) to other objects. However, this simple technique cannot be used to process MRkNN queries owing to the limited network bandwidth in mobile peer-to-peer environments. Therefore, we address this bandwidth limitation by proposing a probabilistic algorithm, called MINT, for Moving range k-NN queries with qualiTy guarantee over uncertain moving objects. MINT provides users with approximate answers with a quality guarantee, rather than exact answers, with near optimal communication costs. Using a series of simulations, we demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of MINT in evaluating MRkNN queries with a quality guarantee. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
