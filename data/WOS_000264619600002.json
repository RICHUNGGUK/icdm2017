This has been a reaction that can be attributed to the ability to develop techniques which are detail-preserving. Space deformation techniques, on the other hand, received less attention, but nevertheless they have many advantages over surface-based techniques. This paper explores the potential of these two approaches to deformation and discusses the opportunities that the fusion of the two may lead to.", "paper_title": "Space Deformations, Surface Deformations and the Opportunities In-Between", "paper_id": "WOS:000264619600002"}
