The number and complexity of such ontologies make hard to ontology and tool developers to select which ontologies to use and reuse. So far, there are no mechanism for making such decisions in an informed manner. Consequently, methods for evaluating ontology quality are required. OQuaRE is a method for ontology quality evaluation which adapts the SQuaRE standard for software product quality to ontologies. OQuaRE has been applied to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different ontologies but, so far, this framework has not been evaluated itself. Therefore, in this paper we present the evaluation of OQuaRE, performed by an international panel of experts in ontology engineering. The results include the positive and negative aspects of the current version of OQuaRE, the completeness and utility of the quality metrics included in OQuaRE and the comparison between the results of the manual evaluations done by the experts and the ones obtained by a software implementation of OQuaRE.
