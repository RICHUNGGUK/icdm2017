The static analysis is the basic approach for every mechanical model which may provide more detailed results successively. The illustrated approach can help the easy interpretation of the structural behaviour of helical stairs and suggests procedures for decision and design of refurbishment interventions in the professional practice. In the final part of the paper sample results are shown to illustrate the approach to the problem and some relevant solutions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
