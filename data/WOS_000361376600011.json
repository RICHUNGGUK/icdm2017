But, what is cheap and easy, isn't always safe. Storing important data on cloud means that you give up a certain control of privacy. Privacy protection is a very important issue in cloud computing. In this paper, we focus on the need of cloud users managed services and propose an approach for data protection based trust mechanism, which using adaptive mapping resources based on trust to ensure the user data protection initiative, and data security. The analysis shows that the cloud user can independently controls the content and manner of services by using the approach, which can achieve the free deployment of resources and the balance of user data protection and service provided.", "paper_title": "Research on Privacy Protection Approach for Cloud Computing Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000361376600011"}
