Our system automatically detects and tracks both the projection screen and the presenter whenever they are visible in the video. By analyzing the image content of the tracked screen region, our system is able to detect slide progressions and extract a high-quality, non-occluded, geometrically-compensated image for each slide, resulting in a list of representative images that reconstruct the main presentation structure. Afterwards, our system recognizes text content and extracts keywords from the slides, which can be used for keyword-based video retrieval and browsing. Experimental results show that our system is able to generate more stable and accurate screen localization results than commonly-used object tracking methods. Our system also extracts more accurate presentation structures than general video summarization methods, for this specific type of video.", "paper_title": "Structuring Lecture Videos by Automatic Projection Screen Localization and Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000354377100009"}
