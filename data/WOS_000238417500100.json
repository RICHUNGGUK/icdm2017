The paper explains how software engineering activities can be viewed as a search for solutions that balance many competing constraints to achieve an optimal or near optimal result. The aim of Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) research is to move software engineering problems from human-based search to machine-based search, using a variety of techniques from the metaheuristic search, operations research and evolutionary computation paradigms. As a result, human effort moves up the abstraction chain to focus on guiding the automated search, rather than performing it. The paper briefly describes the search based approach, providing pointers to the literature.", "paper_title": "Search Based Software Engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500100"}
