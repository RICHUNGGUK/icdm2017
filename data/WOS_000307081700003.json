The quantification is achieved through the integration of two models: one that concentrates more on the structure of the power grid and its physical quantities and one that concentrates on the behavior of the control system supported by the II. The modeling approach is exemplified on a scenario whose goal is to study the effects of an II partial failure (a denial of service attack that compromises the communication network) on the remote control of the El. The approach has been initially developed as part of the European project CRUTIAL. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
