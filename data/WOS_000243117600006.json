Petri nets have been widely used as a workflow modeling technique. Workflow nets (WF-nets), introduced by van der Aalst [LNCS 1248 (1997) 407-426], are a class of Petri nets tailored towards workflow analysis. Soundness is used as the least correctness criterion for WF-nets in order to ensure that a process can terminate properly. This paper extends WF-nets by considering resources and allowing for multi-cases in a process. For the extended model, the relationship between soundness and standard behavior properties of Petri nets is investigated. A compositional method to construct and verify sound WF-nets is introduced.", "paper_title": "Compositional verification for workflow nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000243117600006"}
