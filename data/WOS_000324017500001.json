In particular, it is shown that the improvement of accuracy of viscous terms in the Navier-Stokes equations leads to the improvement of accuracy of higher-order statistics and various spectra. It is emphasized that increase in required computational cost will not be crucial when incompressible flow is simulated, because the introduction of a higher-order scheme into the viscous terms does not increase computational cost for solving the Poisson equation. We introduced fourth-order and eighth-order central compact schemes for discretizing the viscous terms in DNS of a fully developed turbulent channel flow. The results are compared with those using second-order and fourth-order central-difference schemes applied to the viscous terms and those obtained by the spectral method. The results show that accuracy improvement of the viscous terms improve accuracy of higher-order statistics (i.e., skewness and flatness factors of streamwise velocity fluctuation) and various spectra of velocity and pressure fluctuations in the high-wavenumber region.
