However, it is challenging to secure such distributed sensing due mainly to the unique features of dynamic spectrum access networks-openness of low-layer protocol stacks in software-defined radio devices and the absence of interactions/coordination between primary and secondary devices. To meet this challenge, we propose an attack-tolerant distributed sensing protocol (ADSP) for DTV signal detection in IEEE 802.22 WRANs, under which sensors in close proximity are grouped as a cluster, and sensors within a cluster cooperate to safeguard the integrity of sensing. The heart of ADSP is a novel filter based on shadow-fading correlation, by which the fusion center cross-validates reports from the sensors to identify and penalize abnormal sensing reports. By realizing this correlation filter, ADSP significantly reduces the impact of an attack on the performance of distributed sensing, while incurring minimal processing and communication overheads. ADSP also guarantees the detectability requirements of 802.22 to be met even with the presence of sensing report manipulation attacks by scheduling sensing within the framework of sequential hypothesis testing. The efficacy of ADSP is validated on a realistic 2D shadow-fading field. Our extensive simulation-based study shows that ADSP reduces the false-alarm rate by 99.2 percent while achieving 97.4 percent of maximum achievable detection rate, and meets the detection requirements of IEEE 802.22 in various attack scenarios.", "paper_title": "Secure Cooperative Sensing in IEEE 802.22 WRANs Using Shadow Fading Correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000293968000006"}
