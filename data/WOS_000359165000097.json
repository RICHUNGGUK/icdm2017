Alpha and beta (mode) currents generated by Clarke's transformation were used to convert the signal of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to get the wavelet transform coefficients (WTC) and the wavelet energy coefficient (WEC). Daubechies4 (Db4) was used as a mother wavelet to decompose the high frequency components of the signal error. The simulation was performed using PSCAD/EMTDC for transmission system modeling. Simulation was performed at different locations along the transmission line with different types of fault and fault resistance, fault location and fault initial angle on a given power system model. Four statistic methods utilized are in the present study to determine the accuracy of detection and classification faults. The results show that the best Clarke transformation occurred on the configuration of 12-24-48-4, respectively. For instance, the errors using mean square error method, the errors of BPNN, Pattern Recognition Network and Fit Network are 0.03721, 0.13115 and 0.03728, respectively. This indicates that the BPNN results are the lowest error. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
