Two novel detector set updating strategies are proposed in this paper as approaches to the self-tolerant problem in Hardware Immune Systems. Compared with previous detector set updating strategies, results of simulation experiments show that the detector sets being updated by the new strategies are less affected by the growing of the self set, and have a better coverage on the non-self space. Moreover, the improvement is notable when the self set is unavailable during the updating of the detector set.", "paper_title": "A comparative study on self-tolerant strategies for hardware immune systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472800016"}
