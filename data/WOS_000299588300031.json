To provide seamless connectivity under Access Points (AP), this paper proposes an adaptive handoff triggering method to minimize communication time for a vehicle with an AP switch (i.e., whether and when to trigger a handoff process). In the proposed method, combined with an improved data transmission rate based trigger, handoff triggering decision is executed based on three different communication methods (called C-Dire, C-Relay and C-ALLRelay) to minimize the transmission delay when a vehicle moves from an AP to another. Transmission delay is derived through considering vehicle mobility and transmission rate diversity. The simulation results show that the proposed method is proven to be adaptive to vehicular networks.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Handoff Triggering Mechanism for Vehicular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000299588300031"}
