Those algorithms may suffer serious performance drop or even fail to work if only one training sample per person is available to the systems. In this paper, we present a multiple-SOMs-based fusion method to address this problem. Based on the localization of the face, multiple Self-Organizing Maps are constructed in different manners, and then fused to obtain a more compact and robust representation of the face, through which the discrimination and class-specific information can be easily explored from the single training image among a large number of classes. Experiments on the FERET face database show that the proposed fusion method can significantly improve the performance of the recognition system, achieving a top 1 matching rate of 90.0%.", "paper_title": "Recognition from a single sample per person with multiple SOM fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000020"}
