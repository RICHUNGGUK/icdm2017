In order to reduce test data volume (TDV), the approach utilizes three templates, i.e., all 0, all 1, and the previously applied test data, for generating the subsequent test data by flipping the inconsistent bits. The approach employs a small number of test channels I to supply a large number of internal scan chains 2(I) - 3 such that it can achieve significant reduction in test application time (TAT). Furthermore, as a non-intrusive and automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) independent solution, the approach is suitable for IP core testing because it requires neither redesign of the core under test (CUT) nor running any additional ATPG for the encoding procedure. In addition, the decoder has low hardware overhead, and its design is independent of the CUT and the given test set. Theoretical analysis and experimental results for ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits have proven the efficiency of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Low-cost IP core test using tri-template-based codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000243703600035"}
