While it is known that d(S, T) <= 2n - 6, a well-known conjecture states that there are trees for which this bound is sharp for any value of n >= 11. We are unable to prove the conjecture, but we give here some simple criteria for lower bound evaluation, leading for example to individuate some \"regular\" tree structures for which d(S, T) = 3n/2 - O(1), or d(S, T) = 5n/3 - O(1).
