A wide variety of time-series comparison methods, coefficients and criteria can be found in the literature that are all very specific, and hence apply only for a small fraction of applications. Instead of designing a new criteria we propose to combine the existing ones in an intelligent way by using a neural network. The approach aims to the goal of making the neural network to learn to compare the similarity between two time-series as a human would do. Therefore, we have implemented a set of comparison methods, the neural network and an extension to the learning rule to include a human as a teacher. First results are promising and show that the approach is valuable for learning human judged time-series similarity with a neural network.", "paper_title": "Learning time-series similarity with a neural network by combining similarity measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000241475200013"}
