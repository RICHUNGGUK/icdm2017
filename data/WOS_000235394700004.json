If that methodology were developed, its complexity would hinder its success. The solution, therefore, would be an approach in which techniques and models defined by the most accepted model standards were extended by integrating the necessary security aspects that at this moment in time are not covered by the existing methodologies. In this paper, we will focus on solving confidentiality problems in the conceptual modelling of data warehouses by defining a profile using the UML 2.0 extensibility mechanisms. In addition, we define an OCL extension that allows us to specify the security constraints of the elements in conceptual modelling of data warehouses and we apply this profile to an example.", "paper_title": "A UML 2.0/OCL extension for designing secure data warehouses", "paper_id": "WOS:000235394700004"}
