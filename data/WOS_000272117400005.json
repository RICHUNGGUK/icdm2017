The architecture was designed as a generic agent model and instantiated with decision knowledge acquired from naval domain experts and was specified as an executable agent-based model which has been used to perform a number of simulations. To evaluate the simulation results, relevant properties for the planning decision were identified and formalized. These properties have been validated for the simulation traces.
