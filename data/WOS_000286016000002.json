Although much of previous research has included subjective norm as an adoption factor, the results obtained are not consistent. This study suggests that subjective norm is salient when adoption involves people living in collectivist societies. Trust in the ability of the technology is also important, particularly for people who are unfamiliar with new technologies. The proposed model was tested in the context of electronic ticketing for air travelers in China. Implications of the results in terms of both theory and practice are discussed.", "paper_title": "Including Subjective Norm and Technology Trust in the Technology Acceptance Model: A Case of E-Ticketing in China", "paper_id": "WOS:000286016000002"}
