When projection data are available only in an angular range, the incomplete data problem can be attributed to the limited angle problem, which is a severely ill-posed inverse problem. In this paper, a numerical method for the treatment of inverse problems based on an adaptive wavelet-Galerkin method is introduced and investigated. The paper focuses especially on how to avoid inverse crimes in numerical simulations. The method used here combines numerical simplicity and characteristics of adapting to the unknown smoothness of a reconstructed image, which leads to significant reduction in the Computational cost. The reconstruction strategy has a comparable performance with a significant reduction in computational time. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.
