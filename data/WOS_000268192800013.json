Having identified three missing links in the current Internet architecture based on our long-term experiences of designing and operating large-scale backbones, we put forward a new, but incrementally deployable, network scheme-address switching. The address switching has both the advantages of packet switching and circuit switching; it supplies the missing links in the current Internet architecture and can reform the Internet traffic. Our analysis, protocol design and experiments indicate that the address switching can greatly improve the quality of service (QoS), security and routing scalability of today's Internet. So it can provide flexible, high-performance and \"per-service\" networking for the scientific research communities. Moreover, it can provide a fairer and more sustainable business model for the commodity Internet.", "paper_title": "Address switching: Reforming the architecture and traffic of Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000268192800013"}
