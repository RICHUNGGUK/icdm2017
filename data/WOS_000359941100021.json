The key indicators of success currently used on most construction projects include meeting project duration, cost, and quality targets. Project decision makers seldom consider customer expectations related to project-related environmental impact. Quantitative assessments of project-related emissions should be conducted during the project-planning phase. Trade-off optimization among project duration (time), project cost, and project environmental impact is necessary to enhance the overall construction project benefit. This paper develops a novel optimization algorithm, the opposition-based multiple-objective differential evolution (OMODE), to solve the time-cost-environmental impact tradeoff (TCET) problem. This novel algorithm uses an opposition-based learning technique for population initialization and for generation jumping. Opposition numbers are used to improve the exploration and convergence performance of the optimization process. A numerical case study of tunnel construction demonstrates the ability of OMODE-generated nondominated solutions to assist project managers in selecting a plan to optimize TCET, an operation that is otherwise difficult and time-consuming. Comparisons with the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), multiple-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), and multiple-objective differential evolution (MODE) verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
