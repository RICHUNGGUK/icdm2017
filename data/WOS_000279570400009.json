However, this method needs to learn the original object image. In this study, constructive solid geometry is combined with genetic programming as a new technique that does not require prior learning To confirm the effectiveness of this technique, the image of an object from a deteriorated ultrasonic image is reconstructed to the original image", "paper_title": "A reconstruction method for ultrasonic deterioration image by the combination of constructive solid geometry and strongly typed genetic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000279570400009"}
