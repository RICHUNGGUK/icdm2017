The finite element method is employed to generate simulated data pertaining to changes in the stator current signatures under different motor conditions. The MCSA method is then used to process the stator current signatures. Specifically, the power spectral density is employed to extract harmonics features for fault detection and classification with the FMM network. Various types of induction motor faults, which include stator winding faults and eccentricity problems, under different load conditions are experimented. The results are analyzed and compared with those from other methods. The outcomes indicate that the proposed technique is effective for fault detection and diagnosis of induction motors under different conditions.", "paper_title": "Application of the fuzzy min-max neural network to fault detection and diagnosis of induction motors", "paper_id": "WOS:000330030100015"}
