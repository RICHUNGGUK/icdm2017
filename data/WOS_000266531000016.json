The protocol employs techniques that enable it to perform better than both fixed assignment protocols like TDMA as well as dynamic bandwidth allocation protocols like LTDMA. HyTDMA/HTS can smoothly operate in diverse traffic environments of very high loads and bursty traffic, and it can still maintain maximum shared medium utilization while maintaining low packet delay times. Built into the protocol is also a simple yet effective heuristic mechanism that regulates the traffic of hosts flooding the network with an excessive number of packets larger than the average.
