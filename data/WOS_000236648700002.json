The on-line inspection of machining accuracy using a spindle probe has an inherent shortcoming because the same machine-produced parts are used for inspection. In order to use the spindle probe measurement as a means of correcting deviations in machining, the magnitude of measurement errors needs to be quantified. The empirical verification was made by conducting three sets of cutting experiments, followed by a design of experiment with three levels and three factors on a state-of-the-art CNC machining center. Three different material types and parameter settings were selected to simulate a diverse cutting condition. During the cutting, the cutting force and spindle vibration sensor signals were collected and a tool wear was recorded using a computer vision system. The bore tolerance was gauged by a spindle probe as well as a coordinate-measuring machine. The difference between the two measurements was defined as a closed-loop measurement error and the subsequent analysis was performed to determine the significant factors affecting the errors. The analysis results showed the potential of improving production efficiency and improved part quality. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
