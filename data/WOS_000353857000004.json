The objective is to minimize the sum of the total job flow time and the batching cost. We first show that the case with a given number of batches is strongly NP-hard and we present a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for this case. We then show that the case with an arbitrary number of batches is also strongly NP-hard and there is no polynomial-time approximation algorithm with a constant upper bound for this case unless P = NP.
