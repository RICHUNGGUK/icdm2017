Adaptation of Multivariate Curve Resolution to PARAFAC and TUCKER3 type of models showed the flexibility of this method to handle different data structures and also to fulfill different constraint types. Although the way the results were obtained using these different chemometric methods varied, similar environmental interpretations and conclusions were derived independently of the chemometric method used for data analysis.
