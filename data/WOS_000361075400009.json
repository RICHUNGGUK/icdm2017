We devised a hardware/software approach to fault detection that enables a system-level Fault Awareness by implementing a hierarchical Mutual Watchdog. It relies on an improved high performance Network Interface Card (NIC), implementing an n-dimensional mesh topology and a Service Network. The hierarchical watchdog mechanism is able to quickly detect faults on each node, as the Host and the high performance NIC guard each other while every node monitors its own first neighbours in the mesh. Duplicated and distributed Supervisor Nodes receive communication by means of diagnostic messages routed through either the Service Network or the N-dimensional Network, then assemble a global picture of the system status. In this way our approach allows achieving a Fault Awareness with no-single-point-of-failure. We describe an implementation of this hardware/software co-design for our high performance 3D torus NIC, with a focus on how routed diagnostic messages do not affect the system performances.
