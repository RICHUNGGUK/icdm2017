Numerically simulated rock specimens containing a pre-existing flaw were subjected to uniaxial compression until failure. The initiation and propagation of wing cracks, anti-wing cracks, and shell-like cracks were reproduced by numerical simulations. The numerically simulated results demonstrate that the further propagation of wing cracks and shell-like cracks stop due to their wrapping (curving) behavior in three-dimensional spaces, even if the applied loads continue to increase. Furthermore, rock heterogeneity could significantly influence crack propagation patterns and the peak uniaxial compressive strengths of rock specimens. Moreover, anti-wing cracks only appeared in relatively heterogeneous rocks, and the peak uniaxial compressive strengths of the specimens were observed to depend on the inclination of the pre-existing flaw. Finally, the mechanism of surface crack propagation is discussed in the context of numerically simulated anti-plane loading tests, wherein it was identified that Mode III loading (anti-plane loading) does not lead to Mode III fracture in rocks due to their high ratio of uniaxial compressive strength to tensile strength. This finding could explain the lateral growth of an existing flaw in its own plane, which is a phenomenon that has not been observed in laboratory experiments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
