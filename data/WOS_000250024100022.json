Our proposal here is a remote laboratory on a behavioural test (open field test), with the aim of introducing learners to the observation and analysis of stereotyped behaviour in animals. A real-time video of a mouse in an experimental arena is streamed over the Internet from a server computer connected with the laboratory apparatus to a client computer managed by an instructor. Learners observe the video projected by the client computer and record on their PCs the positions of the mouse in the arena and the behavioural patterns produced. Input-output interactions with the test apparatus are made possible by a remote, concurrently operated digital interface. Learners' recordings can be individually and collectively analysed, to assess behavioural trends and effects induced by client-commanded experimental treatments; the quality and the improvements in accuracy of the learners' recordings can also be estimated. A first implementation of the remote laboratory, carried out on two groups of undergraduate students, gave positive indications on the feasibility and the efficiency of the project, and on its didactic efficacy.
