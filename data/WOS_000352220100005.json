Our approach applies to Hilbert calculi extending the positive fragment of propositional classical logic with axioms of a certain general form that contain new unary connectives. Our work encompasses various results already obtained for specific logics. It can be applied to new logics, as well as to known logics for which an analytic calculus or a useful semantics has so far not been available. A Prolog implementation of the method is described.", "paper_title": "Taming Paraconsistent (and Other) Logics: An Algorithmic Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000352220100005"}
