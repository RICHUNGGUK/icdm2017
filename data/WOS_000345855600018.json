Our approach builds on the idea of implicit skinning in which the character is approximated by a 3D scalar field and mesh-vertices are appropriately re-projected. Instead of being bound by an initial skinning solution used to initialize the shape at each time step, we use the skin mesh to directly track iso-surfaces of the field over time. Technical problems are two-fold: firstly, all contact surfaces generated between skin parts should be captured as iso-surfaces of the implicit field; secondly, the tracking method should capture elastic skin effects when the joints bend, and as the character returns to its rest shape, so the skin must follow. Our solutions include: new composition operators enabling blending effects and local self-contact between implicit surfaces, as well as a tangential relaxation scheme derived from the as-rigid-as possible energy to solve the tracking problem.", "paper_title": "Robust Iso-Surface Tracking for Interactive Character Skinning", "paper_id": "WOS:000345855600018"}
