In this paper, the optimal rule of value modification under a payload-distortion criterion is found by using an iterative procedure, and a practical reversible data hiding scheme is proposed. The secret data, as well as the auxiliary information used for content recovery, are carried by the differences between the original pixel-values and the corresponding values estimated from the neighbors. Here, the estimation errors are modified according to the optimal value transfer rule. Also, the host image is divided into a number of pixel subsets and the auxiliary information of a subset is always embedded into the estimation errors in the next subset. A receiver can successfully extract the embedded secret data and recover the original content in the subsets with an inverse order. This way, a good reversible data hiding performance is achieved.", "paper_title": "Reversible Data Hiding With Optimal Value Transfer", "paper_id": "WOS:000313875500008"}
