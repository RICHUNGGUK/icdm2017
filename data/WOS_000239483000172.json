The dynamics of mobile robot based on improved radial basis function neural network (IRBFNN) is modeled online by the improved algorithm of resource allocating network (IRAN). The control scheme of mobile robot integrates a velocity controller based on backstepping technology and a torque controller based on the IRBFNN and robust compensator. The simulations have shown that the control system is competent for the robust tracking control of mobile robot.", "paper_title": "Dynamic tracking control of mobile robots using an improved radial basis function neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000172"}
