Electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, and electrooculography signals were recorded continuously while the operator was performing safety-critical process control operations in a simulated human-machine system. In coarse-grained analysis, the adaptive exponential smoothing (AES) technique is used to smooth the psychophysiological data and to remove strong artifacts without requiring templates. The MWL level is classified every 30 s by using bounded support vector machine (BSVM) and tenfold cross-validation techniques. Locality preservation projection (LPP) technique is utilized to derive salient psychophysiological features by means of feature reduction. By combining the AES-LPP and BSVM methods, the accuracy of the coarse-grained MWL classification was significantly improved by 11-13%. On the other hand, to perform MWL classification with higher temporal resolution and cross-subject and cross-trial generalizability, finer-grained data analysis is also conducted to recognize MWL levels every 5 s based on a combination of adaptive BSVM (ABSVM) and AES techniques. In comparison with the use of the BSVM algorithm alone, a significant performance improvement by 10-20% is achieved by using the AES-ABSVM method in the finer-grained MWL classification.", "paper_title": "Recognition of Mental Workload Levels Under Complex Human-Machine Collaboration by Using Physiological Features and Adaptive Support Vector Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000351468500005"}
