The original nonlinear systems are approximated by a fuzzy T-S model based on which a state-feedback controller is constructed by using the linear matrix inequalities. The approximating error is eliminated by an adaptive compensator based on fuzzy logic systems. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated by a simulation example. The main advantage is that the designer makes milder constraint assumption for the approximation error and the uncertainties in nonlinear systems.", "paper_title": "A New Approach to Nonlinear Tracking Control Based on Fuzzy Approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000298514500005"}
