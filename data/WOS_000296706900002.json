The short-term learning addresses the small sample problem by incorporating additional image blocks to enlarge the training set. Specifically, it applies the nearest neighbor mechanism to choose additional similar blocks. A fuzzy metric is computed to measure the fidelity of the actual class information of the additional blocks. The FSVM is finally applied on the enlarged training set to learn a more accurate decision boundary for classifying images. The long-term learning addresses the large storage problem by building dynamic semantic clusters to remember the semantics learned during all query sessions. Specifically, it applies a cluster-image weighting algorithm to find the images most semantically related to the query. It then applies a DSC technique to adaptively learn and update the semantic categories. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed short-term, long-term, and collaborative learning methods outperform their peer methods when the erroneous feedback resulting from the inherent subjectivity of judging relevance, user laziness, or maliciousness is involved. The collaborative learning system achieves better retrieval precision and requires significantly less storage space than its peers.
