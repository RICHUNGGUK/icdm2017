Our software architecture provides a range of services that allow to create customized applications with minimum implementation effort that are easy to administrate. We present its open architecture, the most important design decisions, and discuss its distinct features and functionalities. jWebDust will allow heterogeneous components to operate in the same sensor network, and the integrated management and control of multiple such networks by defining web-based mechanisms to visualize the network state, the results of queries, and a means to inject queries in the network.", "paper_title": "The Design of an Environment for Monitoring and Controlling Remote Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000265991300005"}
