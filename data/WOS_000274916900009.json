Using operators theory and methods of functional analysis, we give some characterizations of a g-frame or a g-Riesz basis in a complex Banach space. We also give a result about the stability of g-frame in a complex Banach space.", "paper_title": "GENERALIZED p-FRAME IN SEPARABLE COMPLEX BANACH SPACES", "paper_id": "WOS:000274916900009"}
