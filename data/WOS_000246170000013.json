We prove that the problem of minimizing total tardiness is NP-hard even if the machine capacity is two jobs and we develop a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm for an NP-hard special case of this problem. We also develop a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm for the NP-hard problem of minimizing weighted number of tardy jobs, which suggests that this problem cannot be strongly NP-hard unless P = NP.
