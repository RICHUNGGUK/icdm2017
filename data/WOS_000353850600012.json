Here, we answer two questions remained open: we state the order of convergence of this method and provide some sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the solution both of the discrete and the continuous problem. Finally, we compare the performances of the method for different choices of the iteration procedure to solve the non-standard nonlinearity. (C) 2013 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
