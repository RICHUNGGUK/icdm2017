The goal is to estimate the hydrogen partial pressure in the anode channel of the PEMFC, using the measurements of stack voltage, stack current, anode pressure and anode inlet pressure. The proposed observer employs a nonlinear error injection term, where the error is obtained from the difference between the system voltage output obtained from an experimental validated nonlinear model and estimated voltage output obtained from the designed observer. The robustness of this observer against parametric uncertainties and load variations is studied, and the finite time convergence property is proved via Lyapunov analysis. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
