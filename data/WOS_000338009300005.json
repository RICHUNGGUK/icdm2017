This paper critically analyses the prospects for machine ethics, identifying several inherent limitations. While machine ethics may increase the probability of ethical behaviour in some situations, it cannot guarantee it due to the nature of ethics, the computational limitations of computational agents and the complexity of the world. In addition, machine ethics, even if it were to be 'solved' at a technical level, would be insufficient to ensure positive social outcomes from intelligent systems.", "paper_title": "Limitations and risks of machine ethics", "paper_id": "WOS:000338009300005"}
