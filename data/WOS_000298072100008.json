We have gathered all GKA protocols that require 1,2,3,4 and 5 rounds and examined their efficiency. In particular, we calculated each protocol's computation and communication complexity and using proper assessments we compared their total energy cost. The evaluation of all protocols, interesting on its own, can also serve as a reference point for future works and contribute to the establishment of new, more efficient constant round protocols.
