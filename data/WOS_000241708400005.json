On the one hand, as a significant improvement on previous simulators, the new kernel is based on the Common Component Architecture (CCA). The use of such a high-performance computing oriented component technology, together with a novel algorithm to automatically resolve simulation data dependencies, allows the efficient execution of both parallel and sequential simulation models. On the other hand, RT-CORBA is employed in the development of the rest of the applications that comprise the simulator. This real-time communication middleware not only makes the management of communications easier, but also provides the applications with real-time capabilities. Software components used in these two ways, simulation models integrating the kernel and distributed applications from which the simulator is comprised, improve the evolution and maintenance of the entire system, as well as promoting code reusability in other projects.
