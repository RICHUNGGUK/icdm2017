Based on the multi-stroke philosophy and analogy principle, 26 lowercase characters are described. Trails of stylus movement are segmented dynamically and best approximated through the three captured points. Then, each segment is rendered immediately using hardware-accelerated OpenVG APIs. Finally, combination of the types of all segments flows into the small LUT-based recognizer, using some additional bits. Thus, this new method is easy, efficient and quick to use. Implementation and evaluation of such system are presented. Prototype of mobile game, WordCollection, is demonstrated to help users experience functions of both education and entertainment.", "paper_title": "Multi-stroke freehand text entry method using OpenVG and its application on mobile devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300093"}
