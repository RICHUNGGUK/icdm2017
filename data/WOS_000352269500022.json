Accurate SNV calls can better reveal early-stage tumors, identify mechanisms of cancer progression or help in drug targeting. Results: We present SNV-PPILP, a fast and easy to use tool for refining GATK's Unified Genotyper SNV calls, for multiple samples assumed to form a phylogeny. We tested SNV-PPILP on simulated data, with a varying number of samples, SNVs, read coverage and violations of the perfect phylogeny assumption. We always match or improve the accuracy of GATK, with a significant improvement on low read coverage.", "paper_title": "SNV-PPILP: refined SNV calling for tumor data using perfect phylogenies and ILP", "paper_id": "WOS:000352269500022"}
