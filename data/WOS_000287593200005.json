For a consistent decision table (U,A boolean OR {D}) an equivalence relation r on the conditional attribute set A and a congruence relation R on the power set of A are constructed, respectively. Two closure operators, T(r) and T(R), and two families of closed sets, C(r) and C(R); are then constructed with respect to the two equivalence relations. After discussing the properties of C(r) and C(R); the necessary and sufficient condition for C(r) = C(R) is obtained and employed to formulate an approach to attribute reduction in consistent decision tables. It is also proved, under the condition C(r) = C(R); that a relative reduct is equivalent to a R-reduction defined by Novotny and Pawlak (Fundam Inform 16: 275-287, 1992).", "paper_title": "Dependence-space-based attribute reduction in consistent decision tables", "paper_id": "WOS:000287593200005"}
