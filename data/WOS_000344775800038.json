By using a linear state transformation, the original system is transformed to a new system for which control design becomes feasible. Then a novel adaptive neural network (NN) output feedback control strategy, which only contains one adaptive parameter, is developed for such systems by combining the input-driven filter design, the backstepping technique, the NN's parameterization, the Nussbaum gain function method and the Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach. The proposed control design guarantees that all signals in the closed-loop systems are 4-moment (or 2-moment) semi-globally uniformly bounded. Finally, two simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed control design.", "paper_title": "Adaptive neural output feedback control for stochastic nonlinear time-delay systems with unknown control directions", "paper_id": "WOS:000344775800038"}
