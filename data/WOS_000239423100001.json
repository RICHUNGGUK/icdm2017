Then protection goals as well as their synergies and interferences are described. After pointing out some basic facts about security technology in general, a structured overview of technologies for multilateral security is given. An evaluation of the maturity and effectiveness of these technologies shows that some should be applied immediately, while others need quite a bit of further research and development. Finally, a vision for the future is given.", "paper_title": "Multilateral security: Enabling technologies and their evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239423100001"}
