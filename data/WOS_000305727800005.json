Users want to be able to customize software behavior through reference to terms familiar to their diverse needs and experience. We present a requirements-driven approach to behavioral customization of software systems. Goal models are constructed to represent alternative behaviors that users can exhibit to achieve their goals. Customization information is then added to restrict the space of possibilities to those that fit specific users, contexts, or situations. Meanwhile, elements of the goal models are mapped to units of source code. This way, customization preferences posed at the requirements level are directly translated into system customizations. Our approach, which we apply to an on-line shopping cart system and an automated teller machine simulator, does not assume adoption of a particular development methodology, platform, or variability implementation technique and keeps the reasoning computation overhead from interfering with the execution of the configured application.
