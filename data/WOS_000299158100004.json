In particular, spectral analysis allows a detailed study of the dispersion error, as well as anisotropic effects introduced by the mesh. When performing this analysis, many authors assume that the waves making up the solution are always orientated in the same direction as the partial differential equation's characteristics. While this is a valid assumption in some cases, it is not correct in other situations, especially for analysis of the convectiondiffusion equation and similar transport phenomena. This paper addresses this issue, and resolves some long-standing misconceptions resulting from it. In particular, it is shown that for convection simulations on a regular mesh of squares, the overall level of dispersion error is not affected by the convection direction.
