In this paper, we propose a novel Minimum Projection Area-based (MPA) alignment method for pose normalization. Our method finds three principal axes to align a model: the first principal axis gives the minimum projection area when we perform an orthographic projection of the model in the direction parallel to this axis, the second axis is perpendicular to the first axis and gives the minimum projection area, and the third axis is the cross product of the first two axes. We devise an optimization method based on Particle Swarm Optimization to efficiently find the axis with minimum projection area. For application in retrieval, we further perform axis ordering and orientation in order to align similar models in similar poses. We have tested MPA on several standard databases which include rigid/non-rigid and open/watertight models. Experimental results demonstrate that MPA has a good performance in finding alignment axes which are parallel to the ideal canonical coordinate frame of models and aligning similar models in similar poses under different conditions such as model variations, noise, and initial poses. In addition, it achieves a better 3D model retrieval performance than several commonly used approaches such as CPCA, NPCA, and PCA.", "paper_title": "3D model alignment based on minimum projection area", "paper_id": "WOS:000290767600015"}
