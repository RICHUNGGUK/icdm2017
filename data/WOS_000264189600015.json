In contrast to the massive effort that has gone into automated deconvolution of biological networks, relatively little effort has been invested in benchmarking the proposed algorithms. The rate at which new network inference methods are being proposed far outpaces our ability to objectively evaluate and compare them. This is largely due to a lack of fully understood biological networks to use as gold standards. Results: We have developed the most realistic system to date that generates synthetic regulatory networks for benchmarking reconstruction algorithms. The improved biological realism of our benchmark leads to conclusions about the relative accuracies of reconstruction algorithms that are significantly different from those obtained with A-BIOCHEM, an established in silico benchmark.", "paper_title": "Benchmarking regulatory network reconstruction with GRENDEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000264189600015"}
