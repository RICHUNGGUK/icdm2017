Sustainable supplier performance evaluation and selection plays a significant role in establishing an effective SSCM. One of the techniques that can be used for sustainable supplier performance evaluation and selection is data envelopment analysis (DEA). In real world problems, the inputs and outputs might be imprecise. This paper develops an integrated DEA enhanced Russell measure (ERM) model in fuzzy context to select the best sustainable suppliers. A case study is presented to exhibit the efficacy of the proposed method for sustainable supplier selection problem in a resin production company. The case study demonstrates that the proposed model can measure effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity in uncertain environment with different a levels. Also, it shows that the proposed model aids decision makers to deal with economic, social, and environmental factors when selecting sustainable suppliers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
