We consider the best approximations to parametric derivatives in a sequence of approximation spaces generated by a general approximation scheme, and we show that these approximations are convergent provided that the best approximation to the function itself is convergent. We also provide estimates for the convergence rates. We present numerical results with spaces generated by a particular approximation scheme-the Empirical Interpolation Method-to confirm the validity of the general theory.", "paper_title": "Approximation of Parametric Derivatives by the Empirical Interpolation Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000324819700003"}
