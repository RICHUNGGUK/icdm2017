A key feature that sets Vis-Tails apart from previous visualization and scientific workflow systems is a novel action-based mechanism that uniformly captures provenance for data products and workflows used to generate these products. This mechanism not only ensures reproducibility of results, but it also simplifies data exploration by allowing scientists to easily navigate through the space of workflows and parameter settings for an exploration task.", "paper_title": "Managing rapidly-evolving scientific workflows", "paper_id": "WOS:000241462000002"}
