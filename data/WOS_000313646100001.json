These results guarantee that if a uniform quantizer of step size delta is used to quantize m measurements y=I broken vertical bar x of a k-sparse signal xaa\"e (N) , where I broken vertical bar satisfies the restricted isometry property, then the approximate recovery x (#) via a\"\" (1)-minimization is within O(delta) of x. The simplest and commonly assumed approach is to quantize each measurement independently. In this paper, we show that if instead an rth-order I I\" pound (Sigma-Delta) quantization scheme with the same output alphabet is used to quantize y, then there is an alternative recovery method via Sobolev dual frames which guarantees a reduced approximation error that is of the order delta(k/m)((r-1/2)alpha) for any 0 <alpha < 1, if ma parts per thousand(3) (r,alpha) k(logN)(1/(1-alpha)). The result holds with high probability on the initial draw of the measurement matrix I broken vertical bar from the Gaussian distribution, and uniformly for all k-sparse signals x whose magnitudes are suitably bounded away from zero on their support.", "paper_title": "Sobolev Duals for Random Frames and Sigma Delta Quantization of Compressed Sensing Measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000313646100001"}
