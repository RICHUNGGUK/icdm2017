To simultaneously consider symmetry, wirelength, area utilization, and current/signal paths during analog placement, this paper explores the feasibilities of symmetry islands and monotonic current paths in slicing trees for analog placement optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed formulation and algorithms can generate much more compact layouts resulting in similar or even better circuit performance compared with the previous work.", "paper_title": "Exploring Feasibilities of Symmetry Islands and Monotonic Current Paths in Slicing Trees for Analog Placement", "paper_id": "WOS:000338136100007"}
