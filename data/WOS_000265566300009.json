We show how these results can be used to obtain better approximate solutions to three related problems, multiobjective constrained [optimal] path and non-additive shortest path, that have important applications in QoS routing and in traffic optimization. We also show how to obtain a FPTAS to a natural generalization of the weighted multicommodity flow problem with elastic demands and values that models several realistic scenarios in transportation and communication networks.", "paper_title": "Multiobjective Optimization: Improved FPTAS for Shortest Paths and Non-Linear Objectives with Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000265566300009"}
