A nonparametric local likelihood estimator is proposed, and this is more precise than the often used dummy variables method. The empirical analysis reveals that errors are considerably non-Gaussian, and that a Student distribution with time-varying scale and degrees of freedom does well in explaining deviations of prices from their expectation. The art price index is a smooth function of time and has a variability that is comparable to the volatility of stock indices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
