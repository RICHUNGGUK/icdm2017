An ITS incorporates a variety of equipment and devices all working in mutual harmony. However, each piece of equipment or device has its own data format and protocol so they cannot exchange data with each other directly. In this paper, a platform of data exchange in an ITS is proposed that can receive data from several types of equipment external to automobiles, repackage the received data, and then dispatch the data to different devices inside the vehicles.
