The model consists of a network of processor-sharing queues. The vector of service rates, which is constrained by some compact, convex capacity set representing the network resources, is a function of the number of customers in each queue. This function determines the way network resources are allocated. We show that this model is representative of a rich class of wired and wireless networks. We give in this general framework the stability condition of max-min fairness, proportional fairness and balanced fairness and compare their performance on a number of toy networks.", "paper_title": "A queueing analysis of max-min fairness, proportional fairness and balanced fairness", "paper_id": "WOS:000237505400006"}
