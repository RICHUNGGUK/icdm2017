The first testbed uses eight rovers and two blimps operated indoors to emulate a heterogeneous feet of aircraft. The second testbed has eight UAVs. own autonomously with commercial autopilots, which are also used to perform sophisticated hardware-in-the-loop simulations. Future missions will require that teams of UAVs cooperate in dynamic and uncertain environments, and these testbeds can be used to compare various control approaches. A hierarchical configuration of task assignment, trajectory design, and low-level waypoint following uses a receding horizon framework to control the team of vehicles. The resulting demonstrations of the high-level planning algorithms on scaled vehicles operating in uncertain environments represent key steps towards transitioning them to future UAV missions.", "paper_title": "Experimental demonstration of coordinated control for multi-vehicle teams", "paper_id": "WOS:000239237700006"}
