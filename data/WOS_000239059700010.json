DartGrid is built upon several techniques from both Semantic Web and Grid research areas, and is intended to offer a semantic grid toolkit for data integration. In this paper, a Semantic Grid for E-leaning based on DartGrid is introduced, and it provides a Semantic-based distributed infrastructure for E-learning resource sharing. We explore the essential and fundamental roles played by RDF semantics for e-learning, and implement a set of semantically enabled tools and grid services for E-learnng such as semantic browser, ontology service, semantic query service, and semantic registration service.", "paper_title": "Towards building a semantic Grid for E-learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000239059700010"}
