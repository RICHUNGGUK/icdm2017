A so-called sample separation margin based minimum classification error criterion is used in both classifier training and adaptation, while an Rprop algorithm is used for optimizing the objective function. Formulations for both model-space and feature-space adaptation are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed by a series of experiments for adaptation of font styles and low-quality text, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
