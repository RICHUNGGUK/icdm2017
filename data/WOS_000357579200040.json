However, there is currently no data centric software architecture that takes into account the scale and complexity of data involving numerous sensors. To address this issue, the authors have developed an in-vehicle data-stream management system for automotive embedded systems (eDSMS) as data centric software architecture. Providing the data stream functionalities to drivers and passengers are highly beneficial. This paper describes a vehicle embedded data stream processing platform for Android devices. The platform enables flexible query processing with a dataflow query language and extensible operator functions in the query language on the platform. The platform employs architecture independent of data stream schema in in-vehicle eDSMS to facilitate smoother Android application program development. This paper presents specifications and design of the query language and APIs of the platform, evaluate it, and discuss the results.", "paper_title": "Vehicle Embedded Data Stream Processing Platform for Android Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000357579200040"}
