A discrete event system (DES) or a fuzzy discrete event system (FDES) approach with a fuzzy rule-base may resolve the ambiguity in a fault diagnosis problem especially in the case of multiple faults. In this study, an FDES approach with a fuzzy rule-base is used as a means of indicating the degree and priority of faults, especially in the case of multiple faults. The fuzzy rule-base is constructed using event-fault relations. Fuzzy events occurring any time with different membership degrees are obtained using k-means clustering algorithm. The fuzzy sub-event sequences are used to construct super events. The study is concluded by giving some examples about the distinguishability of fault types (parameter, actuator) in an unmanned small helicopter.", "paper_title": "Fault diagnosis with dynamic fuzzy discrete event system approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000239585200014"}
