Here, we consider manipulating perspective in stereoscopic pairs. A straightforward approach based on depth recovery is unsatisfactory: Instead, we use feature correspondences between stereoscopic image pairs. Given a new, user-specified perspective, we determine correspondence constraints under this perspective and optimize a 2D warp for each image that preserves straight lines and guarantees proper stereopsis relative to the new camera. Experiments verify that our method generates new stereoscopic views that correspond well to expected projections, for a wide range of specified perspective. Various advanced camera effects, such as dolly zoom and wide angle effects, can also be readily generated for stereoscopic image pairs using our method.", "paper_title": "Changing Perspective in Stereoscopic Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000320658600004"}
