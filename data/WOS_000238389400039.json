First, the original mesh (two-manifold any genus) is decomposed into several patches, each patch is homeomorphic to a 2D triangle. The goal of this decomposition process is that the decomposed patches are size-equally. First, a mesh is manually cut into a few disk-like patches. With the help of weighted centroidal Voronoi diagram (WCVD), each patch is then automatically partitioned into more triangular patches with nearly equal size. Recursively subdividing these triangular patches, we finally get a semi-regular mesh.", "paper_title": "Multiresolution remeshing using weighted centroidal Voronoi diagram", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400039"}
