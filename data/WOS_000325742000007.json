In this paper, we present an optimization framework for batch scheduling within a block booking system that maximizes the expected utilization of operating room resources subject to a set of probabilistic capacity constraints. The algorithm iteratively solves a series of mixed-integer programs that are based on a normal approximation of cumulative surgery durations. This approximation is suitable for high-volume medical specialities but might not be acceptable for the specialties that perform few procedures per block. We test our approach using the data from the ophthalmology department of the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System. The performance of the schedules obtained by our approach is significantly better than schedules produced by simple heuristic scheduling rules.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Operating Room Scheduling for High-Volume Specialties Under Block Booking", "paper_id": "WOS:000325742000007"}
