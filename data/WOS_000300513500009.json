The method relies on a linear time-varying approximation of the large-signal transient response of the switched circuits. It is shown how switched-capacitor-circuit noise and quantization noise, due to the presence of harsh comparators, can be analyzed in a unified frame where the data converter is modeled as a discrete-time system.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Analysis of Switched-Capacitor Circuits for Sampled Data Converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000300513500009"}
