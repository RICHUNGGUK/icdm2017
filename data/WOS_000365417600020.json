More detailed, we extend timed automata with a pushdown stack. In this way, we obtain a strong model that may for instance be used to model real-time programs with procedure calls. It is long known that the reachability problem for this model is decidable. The goal of this paper is to identify subclasses of timed pushdown automata for which the language inclusion problem and related problems are decidable.", "paper_title": "VERIFICATION FOR TIMED AUTOMATA EXTENDED WITH UNBOUNDED DISCRETE DATA STRUCTURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000365417600020"}
