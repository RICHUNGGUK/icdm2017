This reduces mean-payoff games to the weak automatizability of Sigma(2)-Frege, and to the interpolation problem for Sigma(2.2)-Frege. Since the interpolation problem for Sigma(1)-Frege (i.e. resolution) is solvable in polynomial time, our result is close to optimal up to the computational complexity of solving mean-payoff games. The proof of the main result requires building low-depth formulas that compute the bits of the sum of a constant number of integers in binary notation, and low-complexity proofs of the required arithmetic properties.
