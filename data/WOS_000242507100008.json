The blocks cannot match well if their corresponding ID projection does not match well, with this as foundation 2D block matching problem is translated to a simpler ID matching, which eliminates majority of potential pixel participation. This projection method is combined with adaptive window size selection in which, appropriate search window for each block is determined on the basis of motion vectors and prediction errors obtained for the previous block, which makes this novel method several. times faster than exhaustive search with negligible performance degradation. Encoding QCIF size video by the proposed method results in reduction of computational complexity of motion estimation by roughly 45% and over all encoding by 23%, while maintaining image/video quality.", "paper_title": "Projection based adaptive window size selection for efficient motion estimation in H.264/AVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100008"}
