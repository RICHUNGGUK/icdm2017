Its material properties were tested by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and Instron, and simulated using fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD). The glass transition temperature (T-g) of SMPU60 determined by DMA is 316 K, which is slightly lower than that estimated through MD simulations (T-g = 328 K), showing the calculated Tg is in good agreement with experimental data. A complex hydrogen bonding network was revealed with the calculation of radial distribution functions (RDFs). The C=O center dot center dot center dot H bond is the predominant hydrogen-bonding interaction. With increasing temperature, both the hydrogen bonding and the moduli decreased, and the dissociation of intermolecular hydrogen bonding induced the decrease of the moduli.", "paper_title": "A combined experimental and computational study on the material properties of shape memory polyurethane", "paper_id": "WOS:000303540700002"}
