To obtain better solutions of concrete problems, global migration strategy with moving colony is proposed in this paper. In global migration based on the proposed strategy, migration object is subpopulation which moves between groups. Such global migration can increase the efficiency of thereafter local migration. Moreover, realizing it even needs no communication because it can be executed by regrouping subpopulations. In our experiments, the basement of parallelism is an EA for the Traveling Salesman Problem. Outcomes of HDEAs based on proposed scheme which have different global migration topology are compared with those of traditional ones on nine benchmark instances. The results show that a HDEA based on the proposed strategy having the ring global topology performs better than traditional HDEAs for high difficulty instances. However, the advantage of that having the random global topology is not so significant because of conflicting migrations arisen from this topology.", "paper_title": "Global migration strategy with moving colony for hierarchical distributed evolutionary algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000343889900007"}
