Our algorithm both improves the time bound of Eschen and Spinrad, and fixes some flaws in it. Our algorithm is simpler than the earlier linear-time recognition algorithm of McConnell (Algorithmica 37(2):93-147, 2003), which is the only linear time recognition algorithm previously known.", "paper_title": "A Simpler Linear-Time Recognition of Circular-Arc Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000293962400009"}
