The presence of unreliable components in SN P systems can be considered in many different aspects. In this paper we focus on two types of unreliability: the stochastic delays of the spiking rules and the stochastic loss of spikes. We propose the implementation of elementary SN P systems with DRAM-based CMOS circuits that are able to cope with these two forms of unreliability in an efficient way. The constructed bio-inspired circuits can be used to encode basic arithmetic modules.", "paper_title": "The Stochastic Loss of Spikes in Spiking Neural P Systems: Design and Implementation of Reliable Arithmetic Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000345457100013"}
