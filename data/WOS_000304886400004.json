This quantum potential is simulated by using a real time retroactive loop involving a measurement of density, a calculation of the potential in function of the measured density, then an application of the calculated potential through a classical force. This general experimental concept is exemplified here by the case of a nonspreading oscillating wave packet in a harmonic oscillator potential. We find signatures of a quantum-like behavior which are stable against various perturbations. Finally, the feasability of a realization of this concept in an actual plasma experiment is analyzed.", "paper_title": "NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF A MACRO-QUANTUM EXPERIMENT: OSCILLATING WAVE PACKET", "paper_id": "WOS:000304886400004"}
