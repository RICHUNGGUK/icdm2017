In this paper we explain a new conception of t-learning experiences where TV programs and learning contents are combined. In order for its creation to be possible we will use Adaptive Hypermedia techniques and Semantic Reasoning to design an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) whose tasks consist in selecting, combining and personalizing the contents to construct these learning experiences.", "paper_title": "A model for personalized learning through IDTV", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424300069"}
