Grey system theory is one of the approaches to deal with this issue, as it uses fairly small sets to construct forecasting models. Among published grey models, the current non-equigap grey models can deal with data having unequal gaps, and have been applied in various fields. However, these models usually use fixed modeling procedures that do not consider data growth trend differences. This paper utilizes the trend and potency tracking method to determine the parameter a of the background value to build an adaptive non-equigap grey model to improve forecasting performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method considers that data occurrence properties can obtain better forecasting results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
