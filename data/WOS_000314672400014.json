The latter case presents an interesting challenge for such algorithms, especially when they are applied to real-world data mining (DM) problems. The present investigation departs from the popular approach of applying accuracy-based LCS to single-step classification and aims to uncover the potential of strength-based LCS in such tasks. Although the latter family of algorithms have often been associated with poor generalization and performance, we aim at alleviating these problems by defining appropriate extensions to the traditional strength-based LCS framework. These extensions are detailed and their effect on system performance is studied through the application of the proposed algorithm on a set of artificial problems, designed to challenge its scalability and generalization abilities. The comparison of the proposed algorithm with UCS, its state-of-the-art accuracy-based counterpart, emphasizes the effects of our extended strength-based approach and validates its competitiveness in multi-class problems with various class distributions. Overall, our work presents an investigation of strength-based LCS in the domain of supervised classification. Our extensive analysis of the learning dynamics involved in these systems provides proof of their potential as real-world DM tools, inducing tractable rule-based classification models, even in the presence of severe class imbalances.
