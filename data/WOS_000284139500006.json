This solution is superior to the existing universal remote controllers in that it can be used by the users with physical and vision impairments in a natural manner. By combining diverse interaction techniques in a single device, the GeeAir enables different user groups to control home appliances effectively, satisfying even the unmet needs of physically and vision-impaired users while maintaining high usability and reliability. The experiments demonstrate that the GeeAir prototype achieves prominent performance through standardizing a small set of verbal and gesture commands and introducing the feedback mechanisms.", "paper_title": "GeeAir: a universal multimodal remote control device for home appliances", "paper_id": "WOS:000284139500006"}
