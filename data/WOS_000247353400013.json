Using these metrics, we show that systems with heavy-tailed lifetime distributions are more resilient than those with light-tailed (e.g., exponential) distributions and that for a given average degree, k-regular graphs exhibit the highest level of fault tolerance. As a practical illustration of our results, each user in a system with n = 100 billion peers, 30-minute average lifetime, and 1-minute node-replacement delay can stay connected to the graph with probability 1 - 1/n using only 9 neighbors. This is in contrast to 37 neighbors required under previous modeling efforts. We finish the paper by observing that many P2P networks are almost surely (i.e., with probability 1 - o(1)) connected if they have no isolated nodes and derive a simple model for the probability that a P2P system partitions under churn.", "paper_title": "On lifetime-based node failure and stochastic resilience of decentralized peer-to-peer networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000247353400013"}
