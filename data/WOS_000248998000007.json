In order to demonstrate test-bed schemes, analysis for the semi-physical simulation platform must be carried out. First, impacting model of docking mechanism and mathematic model of two spacecrafts motion are set up in this paper. Then, determination methods of passive spacecraft impacting torques are analyzed when adopting single-sensor scheme. Finally, representative conditions are simulated adopting single-sensor and double-sensor schemes separately. Simulation results indicate that the declinations of position, velocity of two spacecrafts and that of two docking mechanisms are less, so the single-sensor scheme for the semi-physical simulation platform is presented in this paper.
