With the proposed scheme, vehicles can verify a batch of signatures once instead of in a one-by-one manner. Hence the message verification speed can be tremendously increased. To identify invalid signatures in a batch of signatures, this paper adopts group testing technique, which can find the invalid signatures with few number of batch verifications. In addition, a trust authority in our scheme is capable of tracing a vehicle's real identity from its pseudo identity, and therefore conditional privacy preserving can also be achieved. Moreover, since identity-based cryptography is employed in the scheme to generate private keys for pseudo identities, certificates are not required and thus transmission overhead can be significantly reduced.", "paper_title": "On batch verification with group testing for vehicular communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000295683600009"}
