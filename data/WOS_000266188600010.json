Despite its vast popularity, it has several drawbacks such as heavy information loss, difficulty of supporting marginal publication, and so on. To overcome these drawbacks, we develop ANGEL, 1 a new anonymization technique that is as effective as generalization in privacy protection, but is able to retain significantly more information in the microdata. ANGEL is applicable to any monotonic principles (e.g., l-diversity, t-closeness, etc.), with its superiority (in correlation preservation) especially obvious when tight privacy control must be enforced. We show that ANGEL lends itself elegantly to the hard problem of marginal publication. In particular, unlike generalization that can release only restricted marginals, our technique can be easily used to publish any marginals with strong privacy guarantees.", "paper_title": "ANGEL: Enhancing the Utility of Generalization for Privacy Preserving Publication", "paper_id": "WOS:000266188600010"}
