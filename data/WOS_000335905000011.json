Yet, wrong conclusions may be drawn due to errors in assignments of authors to institutions. To improve existing techniques of institution name disambiguation (IND) based on word similarity or editing distance, a rule-based algorithm is proposed in this study. One-to-many relationships between an institution and many variant names under which it is referred to in bylines of publications are recognized with the aid of statistical methods and specific rules. The performance of the rule based IND algorithm is evaluated on large datasets in four fields. These experimental results demonstrate that the precision of the algorithm is high. Yet, recall should be improved.", "paper_title": "Institution name disambiguation for research assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000335905000011"}
