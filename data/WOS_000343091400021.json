However, BP and HR values may not sufficient be to explain specific ANS events and other parameters like the electrocardiogram (ECG), BP waves, the respiratory rate and the electroencephalogram (EEG) are mandatory. Although ANS behaviour and its response to stimuli are well-known, their clinical evaluation is often based on individual medical training and experience. As a result, ANS laboratories have been customized, making it impossible to standardize procedures and share results with colleagues. The aim of our study was to build a powerful versatile instrument easy-to-use in clinical practice to standardize procedures and allow a cross-analysis of all the parameters of interest for ANS evaluation. Methods: The new ANScovery System developed by neurologists and technicians is a two-step device: (1) integrating physiological information from different already existing commercial modules, making it possible to cross-analyse, store and share data; (2) standardizing procedures by an innovative tutor monitor able to guide the patient throughout ANS testing. Results and conclusions: The daily use of the new ANScovery System in clinical practice has proved it is a versatile easy to use instrument. Standardization of the manoeuvres and step-by-step guidance throughout the procedure avoid repetitions and allow intra and interpatient data comparison. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
