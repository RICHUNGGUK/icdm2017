The interval matrix and vector in both methods are expanded by the first-order Taylor series. The interval matrix inverse in IPFEM is approximated by the first-order Neumann series: however, the interval matrix inverse in MIPFEM is approximated by a modified Neumann expansion in which the higher order terms of Neumann series are considered. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of MIPFEM to evaluate the intervals of sound pressure response in acoustic field. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
