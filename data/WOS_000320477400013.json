The accuracy of k NN can be improved by means of Prototype Selection (PS), that is, we provide k NN with a reduced but reinforced dataset to pick its neighbours from. We use fuzzy rough set theory to express the quality of the instances, and use a wrapper approach to determine which instances to prune. We call this method Fuzzy Rough Prototype Selection (FRPS) and evaluate its effectiveness on a variety of datasets. A comparison of FRPS with state-of-the-art PS methods confirms that our method performs very well with respect to accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
