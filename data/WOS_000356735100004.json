Hence the projection may go to a remote point on the efficient frontier which may be inappropriate as a reference point. In this paper we propose a new variant for the improvement of efficiency scores in SBM models. It is based on the determination of strong hyperplanes of the production possibility set (PPS). The approach presented here improves the currently used Tone method both, from the time consumption and computational points of view. Comparative examples, as well as a case study, are given to illustrate the new procedure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
