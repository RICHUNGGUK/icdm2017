Recently, it has been introduced a general technique to prove the easiness of lambda-terms through the semantical notion of simple easiness. Simple easiness implies easiness and allows to prove consistency results via construction of suitable filter models of lambda-calculus living in the category of complete partial orderings: given a simple easy term M and an arbitrary closed term N, it is possible to build (in a canonical way) a non-trivial filter model which equates the interpretation of M and N. The question whether easiness implies simple easiness constitutes Problem 19 in the TLCA list of open problems. In this paper we negatively answer the question providing a non-empty co-r.e. (complement of a recursively enumerable) set of easy, but not simple easy, lambda-terms.", "paper_title": "EASY LAMBDA-TERMS ARE NOT ALWAYS SIMPLE", "paper_id": "WOS:000303447600005"}
