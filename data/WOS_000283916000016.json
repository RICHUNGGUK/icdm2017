Taking college students who had no real interaction with a prospective eportfolio system, this study investigated both their perceptions of the system and the perceptions' association with attitude towards and intention of using the system. A pre-implementation value-assessment model was proposed, and the results indicate that for prospective users, attitudes appear to have the strongest significant direct effect on usage intentions. Perceived functional value serves as the preliminary conditions that mediate the effect of the perceived epistemic value on attitude. Perceived contextual value influences users' attitude and intention via the mediation of perceived epistemic value and perceived functional value. This model provides a systemic understanding of prospective users' perceptions of the system, and such an understanding can help change agents to examine their assumptions about prospective users' perceptions concerning the value and acceptance of a new technology.
