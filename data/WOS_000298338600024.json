Semi-layer MINs are a special case of MINs. A performance evaluation of semi-layer MINs (using simulation models) is presented in this paper. The configurations of the under study networks apply a conflict drop resolution mechanism. The proposed architecture's performance is studied under uniform traffic conditions and various offered loads, buffer-lengths and MIN sizes. In this paper, the improvements on semi-layer MIN performance, in terms of throughput and latency, are demonstrated quantitatively. These performance measures can be valuable tools for designers of parallel multiprocessor systems and networks, in order to minimize the overall deployment costs and help deliver efficient systems.
