Based on the studies of the phase graph, the power spectrum, the correlation dimension and the Lyapunov exponents, the paper reveals the general features of the C-K map transforming from regularity. Meanwhile, using the periodic scanning technology proposed by Welstead and Cromer, a series of Mandelbrot-Julia (M-J) sets of the complex C-K map are constructed. The symmetry of M-J set and the topological inflexibility of distributing of periodic region in the Mandelbrot set are investigated. By founding the whole portray of Julia sets based on Mandelbrot set qualitatively, we find out that Mandelbrot sets contain abundant information of structure of Julia sets.", "paper_title": "CHAOS AND FRACTALS IN C-K MAP", "paper_id": "WOS:000260270100008"}
