The previously best approximation algorithm for this NP-hard problem has a worst-case performance ratio of Here we present a novel scheme to partition the edge set of a 4-matching into a number of subsets, such that the union of each of them and a given matching is an acyclic 2-matching. Such a partition result takes advantage of a known structural property of the optimal solution, leading to a -approximation algorithm for the Bandpass-2 problem.", "paper_title": "A 0.5358-approximation for Bandpass-2", "paper_id": "WOS:000360388300013"}
