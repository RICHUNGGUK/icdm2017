This paper argues that the conventional block retirement and sparing approach-a block is retired as soon as it shows faulty behavior-is overly conservative and inefficient. We observe that it is highly unlikely that all faulty bits in a storage block manifest errors. Consequently, we propose data dependent sparing, a relaxed block retirement and sparing approach that recycles faulty storage blocks. At small management cost and with less than 1% sparing, data dependent sparing achieves the same lifetime as the conventional approach with 20% sparing.", "paper_title": "Data Dependent Sparing to Manage Better-Than-Bad Blocks", "paper_id": "WOS:000328935900002"}
