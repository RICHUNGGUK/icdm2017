However, when using only access control, including role-based access control (RBAC), a system is vulnerable to a low-level or physical attack. In addition, when using only a cryptographic file system, a system also has a weakness that it is unable to protect itself. To overcome these vulnerabilities, we integrated a cryptographic file system into the access control, and developed a prototype.", "paper_title": "Integration of a cryptographic file system and access control", "paper_id": "WOS:000237498000017"}
