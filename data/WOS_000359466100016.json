Using a very sharp timing metric obtained from the preamble, the proposed algorithm shows very robust time synchronization performance for various channel models in an airport. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves an SNR gain of 2 to 3 dB at the failure rate of 10(-2) to 10(-3) compared with previous algorithms.", "paper_title": "Robust Time Synchronization for Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communication Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466100016"}
