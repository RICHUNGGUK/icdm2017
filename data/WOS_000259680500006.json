In-depth determination of stakeholder needs entails analysis of their intentions; the overall aim of the work reported in this article is to establish a framework of intentional analysis, and its associated methods and techniques for improving traceability of design practice during the early phases of the design process. The specific aim of this article is to present a conceptual framework for design rationale systems. The framework built upon the cross-fertilization of approaches and methods drawn from systems engineering and philosophy, focussing on the notions of antecedence and consequence. It was developed in the course of tackling design problems originating in industrial contexts. The methods developed were thus evaluated, updated, and refined in real applications. Two application cases are described that have been drawn from the aerospace and power sectors, respectively. The applications showed that the framework's central antecedent/consequent scheme provides a cell from which to develop either a history of actual successive changes, or a tree of alternative possible projected designs.", "paper_title": "Antecedence and consequence in design rationale systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000259680500006"}
