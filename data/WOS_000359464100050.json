Based on the basis expansion model (BEM), the problem of estimation of power spectral density (PSD) is transformed to estimation of BEM coefficients. The sparsity both in frequency domain and space domain is used to construct a sparse estimation structure. The theory of L-1/2 regularization is used to solve the compressed sensing problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Collaborative Spectrum Sensing via L-1/2 Regularization", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464100050"}
