In the proposed model, the longitudinal effect is incorporated by introducing a time dimension into the existing house of quality structure. As a consequence of explicitly considering the longitudinal effect, the proposed model yields not only an optimal set of DRs but also the timing of their selection. The proposed model is demonstrated through a case study for improving customer loyalty in the high-speed internet service. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
