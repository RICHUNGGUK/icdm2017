The optimal order symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin discretization which has previously been developed for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in two dimensions is extended to three dimensions. Symmetry boundary conditions are given which allow to discretize and compute symmetric flows on the half model resulting in exactly the same flow solutions as if computed on the full model. Using duality arguments, an error estimation is derived for estimating the discretization error with respect to the aerodynamic force coefficients. Furthermore, residual-based indicators as well as adjoint-based indicators for goal-oriented refinement are derived. These refinement indicators are combined with anisotropy indicators which are particularly suited to the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization. Two different approaches based on either a heuristic criterion or an anisotropic extension of the adjoint-based error estimation are presented. The performance of the proposed discretization, error estimation and adaptive mesh refinement algorithms is demonstrated for 3d aerodynamic flows. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
