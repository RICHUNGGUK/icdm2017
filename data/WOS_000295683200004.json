Some statistical diagnostics based on the models under a proposed elliptical error structure are developed in this work. It is well known that the class of elliptical distributions offers a more flexible framework for modelling since it contains both light-and heavy-tailed distributions. Iterative procedures for the maximum-likelihood estimates of the model parameters are presented. Score tests for the presence of autocorrelation and the homogeneity of autocorrelation coefficients among individuals are constructed. The properties of test statistics are investigated through Monte Carlo simulations. The local influence method for the models is also given. The analysed results of a real data set illustrate the values of the models and diagnostic statistics.", "paper_title": "Diagnostics for elliptical linear mixed models with first-order autoregressive errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000295683200004"}
