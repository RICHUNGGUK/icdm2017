In order to speed up the iteration in the reconstruction, we discuss how to specify the initial shapes so as to reflect the geometric information and the topology structure of the given data. The basic idea is based on the combination of the distance function and the generalized eigenvector fitting model.", "paper_title": "Specification of initial shapes for dynamic implicit curve/surface reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000236292700016"}
