It is the science of concealed communication. The term hiding can refer to keeping the very existence of the embedded messages imperceptible. Intuitively, a technique that introduces less embedding distortion to the cover object will generally cause changes that are more difficult to detect, and will therefore provide more security. In this paper, we propose a data hiding method based on VQ compressed images. To improve communication security, Hamming codes are applied for increasing the embedding efficiency (the number of bits embedded per embedding change). Experimental results indicate that our proposed scheme provides improved steganographic security and better image quality compared with existing schemes based on VQ compressed images.", "paper_title": "DATA HIDING BASED ON VQ COMPRESSED IMAGES USING HAMMING CODES AND DECLUSTERING", "paper_id": "WOS:000267923200024"}
