The procedure is based on the extension of the Hough transform concept to the definition of Hough transform of special classes of algebraic curves. We first introduce a catalogue of curves that satisfy the conditions to be automatically extracted from an image and the recognition algorithm, then we illustrate the power of this method to identify skeleton profiles in clinical X-ray tomography maps and front ends of solar eruptions in astronomical images provided by the NASA solar dynamics observatory satellite.", "paper_title": "Profile Detection in Medical and Astronomical Images by Means of the Hough Transform of Special Classes of Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000350241300005"}
