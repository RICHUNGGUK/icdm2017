A partial layerwise theory is utilized to define the displacement field of beams with an arbitrary number of elastic, viscoelastic and piezoelectric layers attached to both surfaces, and a fully coupled electro-mechanical theory is considered for modelling the behavior of the piezoelectric layers. The damping of the viscoelastic layers is modelled by the complex modulus approach. The weak forms of the analytical formulation, governing the motion and electric charge equilibrium, are presented. Based on the weak forms, a one-dimensional finite element (FE) model is developed, with the nodal mechanical degrees of freedom being the axial displacement, transverse displacement and the rotation of the mid-plane of the host beam and the rotations of the individual layers, and the electrical elemental degrees of freedom being the electrical potential difference of each piezoelectric layer. Frequency response functions were measured experimentally and evaluated numerically for a freely suspended aluminium beam with an ACLD patch. In order to validate the FE model the results are presented and discussed. (c) 2006 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.
