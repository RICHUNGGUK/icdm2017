We show how to answer such queries in constant time with O(n log(4) n) preprocessing time and O(n log n) space. We use a Gomory-Hu tree to represent all the pairwise min cuts implicitly. Previously, no subquadratic time algorithm was known for this problem. Since all-pairs min cut and the minimum-cycle basis are dual problems in planar graphs, we also obtain an implicit representation of a minimum-cycle basis in O(n log(4) n) time and O(n log n) space. Additionally, an explicit representation can be obtained in O(C) time and space where C is the size of the basis. These results require that shortest paths are unique. This can be guaranteed either by using randomization without overhead or deterministically with an additional log(2) n factor in the preprocessing times.", "paper_title": "Min st-Cut Oracle for Planar Graphs with Near-Linear Preprocessing Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000348204800001"}
