In our implementation, we use mixed data/task parallelism to achieve data distribution and workload balance. Numerical tests show that our implementation is efficient, scalable and computes eigenpairs to prescribed accuracy. We compare the performance of our parallel eigensolver with that of the ScaLAPACK divide-and-conquer eigensolver on block-tridiagonal matrices.", "paper_title": "A parallel symmetric block-tridiagonal divide-and-conquer algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000250967300004"}
