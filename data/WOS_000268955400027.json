In this paper, a modification of the CORDIC method for decimal arithmetic is proposed so as to improve calculations. The algorithm works with BCD operands and no conversion to binary is needed. A significant reduction in the number of iterations in comparison to the original decimal CORDIC method is achieved. The experiments showing the advantages of the new method are described. Also, the results with regard to delay obtained by means of an FPGA implementation of the method are shown. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
