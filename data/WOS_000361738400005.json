In the proposed algorithm, to select individuals which are best suited for a new time from the historical optimal sets, an orthogonal predictive model is presented to predict the new individuals after the environment change is detected. Also, to converge to optimal front more quickly, an modified multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition is adopted. The proposed method has been extensively compared with other three dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithms over several benchmark dynamic multi-objective optimization problems. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive results.", "paper_title": "An orthogonal predictive model-based dynamic multi-objective optimization algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000361738400005"}
