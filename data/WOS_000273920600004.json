The original purpose of text categorization is to recognize, understand and organize different types of texts or documents. The general categorization approaches are treated as supervised learning, which infers similarity among a collection of categorized texts for training purposes. The existing categorization approaches are obviously not content-oriented and constrained at single word level. This paper introduces an innovative content-oriented text categorization approach named as CogCate. Inspired by cognitive situation models, CogCate exploits a human cognitive procedure in categorizing texts. In addition to traditional statistical analysis at word level, CogCate also applies lexical/semantical analysis. which ensures the accuracy of categorization. The evaluation experiments have testified the performance of CogCate. Meanwhile, CogCate remarkably reduces the time and effort spent on software training and maintenance of text collections. Our research work attests that interdisciplinary research efforts benefit text categorization. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
