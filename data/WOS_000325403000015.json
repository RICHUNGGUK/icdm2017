Aggregation of multiple DTN bundles within a data transport block, which was proposed to resist space channel asymmetry, has been a controversy for years. In this paper, an experimental investigation of whether or not the aggregation of multiple DTN bundles within a single data transport block has performance advantage is presented. The investigation focuses on a space SoS internetworking scenario characterized by an asymmetric data rate. A model is developed for the minimum number of data bundles that should be aggregated within a Licklider transmission protocol block to avoid delay of acknowledgment transmission caused by channel asymmetry in the space SoS internetworking system.", "paper_title": "Aggregation of DTN Bundles for Space Internetworking Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000325403000015"}
