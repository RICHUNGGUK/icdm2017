Classical CA properties as surjectivity, injectivity, sensitivity, expansivity, transitivity, dense periodic orbits and equicontinuity have been adapted to the asynchronous case. We also deal with stability of properties with respect to perturbations on some update sequences which produce a significant dynamical behaviour.", "paper_title": "Asynchronous cellular automata and dynamical properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000304589800012"}
