For example, \"Microsoft Patch Tuesday\" is often followed by \"Exploit Wednesday\" during which yet unpatched systems become vulnerable to patch-based exploits. Part of the patch engineering includes the identification of the vulnerable binary code by means of reverse-engineering tools and diffing add-ons. In this article we present a feedback-driven compiler tool flow that iteratively transforms code until diffing tools become ineffective enough to close the \"Exploit Wednesday\" window of opportunity. We demonstrate the tool's effectiveness on a set of real-world patches and against the latest version of BinDiff.", "paper_title": "Feedback-Driven Binary Code Diversification", "paper_id": "WOS:000313911800001"}
