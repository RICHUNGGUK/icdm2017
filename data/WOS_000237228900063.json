This paper describes the current state of an ongoing project which takes a machine learning approach to this problem. We discuss the challenges that are presented by this, discuss various strategies for tackling this problem, and explain some experimental work. In particular our approach is focused on the creation of a system that uses an analysis-synthesis cycle to learn and then produce such timbre changes.", "paper_title": "Synthesising timbres and timbre-changes from adjectives/adverbs", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228900063"}
