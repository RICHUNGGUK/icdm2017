The edge grafting operation on a graph is a kind of edge moving between the two pendent paths starting from the same vertex. In this paper we show how the graph energy change under the edge grafting operations. As the applications of this grafting method, we also obtain some new results on a conjecture about the tree of order is with the fourth maximal energy.", "paper_title": "Graph energy change due to edge grafting operations and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000281508800003"}
