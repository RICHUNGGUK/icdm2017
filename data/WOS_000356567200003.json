In this paper, the notion of soft relation is introduced which is a generalization of the notion of soft set relation, and some related properties are examined. Furthermore, the connections between soft relations and fuzzy sets are analyzed. It is shown that fuzzy relation and fuzzy soft set may be considered as special cases of soft relation.", "paper_title": "Redefined soft relations and soft functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000356567200003"}
