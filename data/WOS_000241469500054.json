To solve this problem, we have proposed a skeletal framework on two-dimensional arrays based on the theory of constructive algorithmics. It supports users, even with little knowledge about parallel machines, to develop systematically both correct and efficient parallel programs on two-dimensional arrays. In this paper, we apply our framework to the matrix-convolutions often used in image filters and difference methods. We show the efficacy of the framework by giving a general parallel program for the matrix-convolutions described with the skeletons, and a theorem that optimizes the general program into an application-specific one.", "paper_title": "Surrounding theorem: Developing parallel programs for matrix-convolutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241469500054"}
