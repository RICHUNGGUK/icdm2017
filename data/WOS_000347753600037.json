Firstly, by using homeomorphism theory and inequality technique, the LMI-based sufficient condition on the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium point for above inertial BAM neural networks is obtained. Secondly, a LMI-based condition which can ensure the global exponential stability of equilibrium point for the system is obtained by using LMI method and inequality technique. In our results, the boundedness assumption on the activation functions in Ke and Miao (2013) [19,20] is removed. Hence, our result on global exponential stability of equilibrium point for above system is less conservative. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
