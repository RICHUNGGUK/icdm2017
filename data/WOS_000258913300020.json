These footprints consist of pixel defects, of unevenness of the responses in the charge-coupled device sensor, black current noise, and may originate from proprietary interpolation algorithms involved in color filter array. Various imaging device (camera, scanner, etc.) identification methods are based on the analysis of these artifacts. In this paper, we set to explore three sets of forensic features, namely binary similarity measures, image-quality measures, and higher order wavelet statistics in conjunction with SVM classifiers to identify the originating camera. We demonstrate that our camera model identification algorithm achieves more accurate identification, and that it can be made robust to a host of image manipulations. The algorithm has the potential to discriminate camera units within the same model.", "paper_title": "Blind identification of source cell-phone model", "paper_id": "WOS:000258913300020"}
