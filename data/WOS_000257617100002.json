The enormous amount of valuable data generated by the stock market has attracted researchers to explore this problem domain using different methodologies. This paper investigates stock market investment issues on Taiwan stock market using a two-stage data mining approach. The first stage A priori algorithm is a methodology of association rules, which is implemented to mine knowledge and illustrate knowledge patterns and rules in order to propose stock category association and possible stock category investment collections. Then the K-means algorithm is a methodology of cluster analysis implemented to explore the stock cluster in order to mine stock category clusters for investment information. By doing so, this paper proposes several possible Taiwan stock market portfolio alternatives under different circumstances. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
