The software integrates the thermohydraulics analysis based on Kern method with the mechanical design based on Tubular Exchanger Manufacturing Association (TEMA) Class \"C\" standard. The software allows the user to experiment with different design specifications and visualize the solutions in the form of performance data and engineering drawings. Technical drawings on the parts of the heat exchanger, like the shell, tube, front and rear header, tube sheet and baffle plate, are produced by the software to assist the user in appreciating issues relating to practical fabrication and costing. Through the correlation of the thermo-hydraulic performance, configurations and dimensions with respect to the technical specifications, it is hoped that the user could better appreciate the fundamentals of heat exchanger design.
