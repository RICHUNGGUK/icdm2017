We compare the behavior of our numerical simulations with simple experiments and theoretical results obtained from the Saint-Venant equation, the partial differential equation commonly used to describe water flow in irrigation canals. The case study we consider are (1) the height of water along the canal in a stationary regime and (2) a draining experiment. The comparisons show that the two-fluid LB approach captures correctly the draining speed and the qualitative water profile.", "paper_title": "Modeling of irrigation channels - A comparative study", "paper_id": "WOS:000251316000037"}
