Different algorithms have been implemented and compared on the CPU and the GPU in order to show the speedup gained by moving the computation to the graphics card. The results were evaluated for accuracy using the test available on the Middlebury website for stereo vision. An assessment of the runtime performance was done by a script which examined the runtime behaviour of the individual steps of the stereo matching algorithm.", "paper_title": "Runtime Analysis of GPU-Based Stereo Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000369851900039"}
