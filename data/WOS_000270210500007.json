According to the state-of-the-art, it is confirmed that for problems with unattainable targets, strict design consistency cannot be achieved with finite weighting factors. This paper aims to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach - A new formulation is proposed to improve the ATC convergence. The weighted sum of deviation metric is transformed into a multi-objective formulation. An original optimization problem with a single global optimal solution is used as a benchmark. Findings - It is found that carrying out an industrial application to design optimally a tram traction system demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed solution. Originality/value - This paper is of value in showing how to improve the convergence of a multi-level optimization algorithm by best management of the consistency constraints.", "paper_title": "Multi-level design optimization using target cascading, an improvement of convergence", "paper_id": "WOS:000270210500007"}
