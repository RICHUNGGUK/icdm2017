Design/methodology/approach - First, the model of 2D workspace with some obstacles is expressed in regularity grids. The optimal path is planned by using the improved D* algorithm by searching in the neighbor grid cells in 16 directions. It makes the robot that the smallest turning angle drops to pi/8. The robot moving angle discrete precision is raised and the unnecessary cost of path planning is reduced so the robot motion path is smoother. Then, the improved D* algorithm is simulated in MOBOTSIM software environment and is tested by the WiRobotX80 mobile robot. Findings - To search in the neighbor grid cells in 16 directions instead of eight directions by using D* algorithms for path planning. Research limitations/implications - The map should be expressed in regularity grids. Originality/value - The improved D* algorithm is effective and it can result in a higher quality path than the conventional D* algorithm at the same map environment.", "paper_title": "A study of improvement of D* algorithms for mobile robot path planning in partial unknown environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000280732800011"}
