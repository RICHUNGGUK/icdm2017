Such an attack poses serious threats to both key authentication and key confirmation properties of a key agreement protocol, and it seems practical because the adversary could obtain the victim's ephemeral secret in a number of methods: for example, by installing some Trojan horse into the victim's computer platform or by exploiting the imperfectness of the pseudo-random number generator in the platform. We demonstrate that the 3-pass HMQV protocol, which is secure against the standard KCI attack, is vulnerable to this new attack. Furthermore, we show a countermeasure to prevent such an attack.
