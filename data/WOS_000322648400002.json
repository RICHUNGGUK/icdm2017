Thus, the traditional network management pattern, in which the sink is responsible for managing the entire network, reveals many problems in terms of both performance and efficiency. We propose an energy-efficient scheme to improve the performance of online network management and diagnosis services based on the quality of interactive communications in large-scale sensor networks. By abstracting the uncertain network model from our deployed sensor systems, we define the manageable nodes. Under different practical constraints, we then design algorithms in which multiple management centers can work in cooperation to cover as many manageable nodes as many as possible. Using the data obtained from our urban sensing sensor network system, CitySee with 494 nodes, we conduct trace-driven simulations. The experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of this design.", "paper_title": "Quality of Interaction for Sensor Network Energy-Efficient Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000322648400002"}
