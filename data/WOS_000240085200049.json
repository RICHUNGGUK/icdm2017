In this paper, a method to evaluate knowledge transfer ability in organization is proposed. Firstly, the main factors which affect the knowledge transfer ability to be found out through the analysis of the relevant research of domestic and international knowledge transfer, then, an index system is set up to evaluate knowledge transfer ability using the method of questionnaire investigation and statistical analysis as knowledge transmission ability, knowledge receptive ability, interactive ability and organizational supporting ability, etc.. According to the index system and the characteristics of linguistic assessment information provided by experts, a multi-index linguistic decision-making method based on linguistic assessment information is proposed using LWD operator and LOWA operator developed in recent years. Finally, an example is given to explain the method.", "paper_title": "A method for evaluating the knowledge transfer ability in organization", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085200049"}
