The transfer delays and packet loss that are induced by the limited bandwidth of communication networks are considered. The focus of this paper is on the analysis and design of a full-order H-infinity filter, such that the filtering-error dynamics are stochastically stable, and a prescribed H-infinity attenuation level is guaranteed. Sufficient conditions are established for the existence of the desired filter in terms of linear-matrix inequalities (LMIs). An example is given to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed design method.", "paper_title": "H-infinity-Filter Design for a Class of Networked Control Systems Via T-S Fuzzy-Model Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000274217500018"}
