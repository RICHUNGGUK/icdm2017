Besides those scenarios, PAISs can be used also in mobile and pervasive scenarios, where process participants can be only equipped with smart devices, such as personal digital assistants. None of existing PAISs can be entirely deployed on smart devices, making unfeasible its usage in highly mobile scenarios. This paper presents ROME4EU, a mobile PAIS developed for being applied to the coordination of emergency operators, and an extensive validation of the system, both in term of performances and usability/acceptability by the users.
