The model is inspired by corpus-based examples of overlapping utterances of several sorts, including backchannels and completions. The model has also been partially implemented within a virtual human system that includes incremental understanding, and can be used to track grounding and provide overlapping verbal and non-verbal behaviors from a listener, before a speaker has completed her utterance.", "paper_title": "A model for incremental grounding in spoken dialogue systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000337753000006"}
