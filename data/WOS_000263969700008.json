The basic procedure for the methodology consists of four steps: (1) constructing a database of mix designs; (2) establishing appropriate models for strength and workability; (3) optimizing mix proportion using the modified HS algorithm; and (4) refining the mixture using NNs. The proposed methodology could be a useful decision-making tool for concrete mix design.", "paper_title": "Modified Harmony Search Algorithm and Neural Networks for Concrete Mix Proportion Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000263969700008"}
