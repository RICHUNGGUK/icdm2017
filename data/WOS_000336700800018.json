Although a number of online algorithms have been proposed in the literature, no strategy has been engaged in efficient usage of reconfigurable resources by orchestrating multiple hardware versions of tasks. By exploring this flexibility, on one hand, the algorithms can be potentially stronger in performance; however, on the other hand, they can suffer much more runtime overhead in selecting dynamically the best suitable variant on-the-fly based on its runtime conditions imposed by its runtime constraints. In this work, we propose a fast efficient online task scheduling and placement algorithm by incorporating multiple selectable hardware implementations for each hardware request; the selections reflect trade-offs between the required reconfigurable resources and the task runtime performance. Experimental studies conclusively reveal the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of not only scheduling and placement quality but also faster runtime decisions over rigid approaches.
