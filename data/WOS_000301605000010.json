In this paper, based on the dynamic model of a one-stage gearbox with spur gears and one tooth crack, statistical indicators and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) technique are investigated to identify effective and sensitive health indicators for reflecting the crack propagation level. The results suggest that the root mean square (RMS) indicator is a better statistical indicator than the Kurtosis indicator to reflect the crack propagation in the early stage; the RMS indicator based on the residual signal segments that are strongly affected by the crack is more sensitive; the proposed DWT approach can improve the sensitivity of the RMS indicator, and the RMS indicator becomes more sensitive with the increase of the DWT level up to a best DWT level, beyond which either the monotonicity is lost or the sensitivity decreases; the proposed approach is effective with the presence of noise; with the increase of the noise level, the DWT level at which the best performance is achieved, and thus the sensitivity, decreases. Gearbox systems with different sizes and different input shaft frequencies are also investigated, and it is found that the observations presented above hold for different gearbox system settings.", "paper_title": "Crack propagation assessment for spur gears using model-based analysis and simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000301605000010"}
