The SLFSMC system automatically tunes the rule bases using a rule modifier and the updating value of each rule is based on the fuzzy firing weight. In addition, this controller can be used for on-line learning in real-time control systems. In order to illustrate the performance of the proposed control method, it is compared with a proportional derivative-type fuzzy control (PDFC) and a gaintuning fuzzy control (GTFC). These three algorithms are applied to a water bath temperature control and are simulated under the same conditions. The effect of load disturbance, the response to control, the tracking performance, and suitable sampling time are determined for each system. The simulation results show that the SLFSMC has superior characteristics, is more simple to use and has a fast response, so the SLFSMC performs better than the PDFC and GTFC.", "paper_title": "Self-Learning Fuzzy Sliding-Mode Control for a Water Bath Temperature Control System", "paper_id": "WOS:000356334900004"}
