In the near future, this portion is likely to dominate total chip power consumption due to higher clock frequency and deeper pipeline design trend. Traditionally, two approaches have been used: ( 1) to reduce power consumption in the clock tree, several low-swing clock flip-flops and double-edge flip-flops have been introduced; ( 2) to reduce power consumption in flip-flops, conditional capture, clock-on-demand, data-transition look-ahead techniques have been developed. Recently, pulsed latch type flip-flops are introduced in several high-performance microprocessors to reduce E x D. In this paper, these flip-flops are described with their pros and cons. Then, a new circuit technique is described along with simulation results. The proposed pulsed latch reduces E x D by 82.6% to 95.4% compared to conventional flip-flops.", "paper_title": "Sptpl: A new pulsed latch type flip-flop in high-performance system-on-a-chip (SoC)", "paper_id": "WOS:000250969900002"}
