Organizations have static and dynamic aspects that are relevant to identify in order to predict the group behaviour, such as changes in member roles. Modelling the organizational structure facilitates the precise description of the responsibilities of each member and the dependences among them, guiding the software analysis and design. This paper proposes the definition and application of organizational patterns to improve the organization modelling. This technique is incorporated in AMENITIES, a complete methodology, developed in our research group, for analysis and design of cooperative systems.", "paper_title": "Supporting social organization modelling in cooperative work using patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800012"}
