The types of fuzzy numbers are triangular, trapezoidal, and L-R type. In the literature, there are many methods developed for ranking fuzzy numbers. These methods may produce different ranking results. Many of these methods necessitate graphical representations, complex and tedious calculations. The method developed in this paper has some advantages with respect to the other methods in both graphical representations and calculations. Applicability of the proposed method to multi-criteria decision-making methods, i.e. fuzzy scoring, fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS methods, is shown in the paper.", "paper_title": "An Alternative Ranking Approach and Its Usage in Multi-Criteria Decision-Making", "paper_id": "WOS:000272257300004"}
