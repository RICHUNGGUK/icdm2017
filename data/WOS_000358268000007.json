Such problems are quite common in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. In particular, this paper pays special attention to the chipset production in the semiconductor Assembly and Test Manufacturing (ATM) factory and constructs a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model for the problem. The primal problem is decomposed into a lot-sizing subproblem and a set of single-machine scheduling subproblems by Lagrangian decomposition. A Lagrangian-based heuristic algorithm, which incorporates the simulated annealing algorithm aimed at searching for a better solution during the feasibility construction stage, is proposed. Computational experiments show that the proposed hybrid algorithm outperforms other heuristic algorithms and meets the practical requirement for the tested ATM factory. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
