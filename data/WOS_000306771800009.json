To overcome this problem, a method devoted to the improved evaluation of initial condition for the MSFA is presented. In particular, the method is based on the algebraic derivative approach in the frequency domain. Numerical and experimental tests confirm the potentiality of the method and the advantages in term of higher accuracy, in comparison with others methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
