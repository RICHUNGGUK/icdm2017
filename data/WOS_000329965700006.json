A local representation of the OT boundary conditions is combined with a finite difference scheme for the Monge-Ampere equation. Newton's method is implemented, leading to a fast solver, comparable to solving the Laplace equation on the same grid several times. Theoretical justification for the method is given by a convergence proof in the companion paper [4]. Solutions are computed with densities supported on non-convex and disconnected domains. Computational examples demonstrate robust performance on singular solutions and fast computational times. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
