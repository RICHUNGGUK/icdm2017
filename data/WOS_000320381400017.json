This algorithm has been submitted to different contests where it showed good performance in comparison to the state of the art. In addition, this method is scale invariant and fast enough to be used in real-time applications. The method is based on a double-threshold edge detection approach that makes it possible to detect small details while remaining robust against noise. The performance of the proposition is evaluated on several types of degraded document images where considerable background noise or variation in contrast and illumination exist.", "paper_title": "FAIR: A Fast Algorithm for Document Image Restoration", "paper_id": "WOS:000320381400017"}
