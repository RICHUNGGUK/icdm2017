In this process, a designer represents a hypothetical concept on each design alternative, deploys and verifies the concept from multiple viewpoints considering other alternatives, and modifies it. An advanced integrated design environment should be based on a representation framework that embodies this process of reflection in concept development, which usually remains in the realm of the designer's tacit knowledge. This paper proposes a knowledge representation framework for an integrated design environment, named DRIFT (Design Representation Integration Framework of Three layers), which interactively captures and manages reflection processes of generating and verifying design concepts. The core of DRIFT is a three-layered design process model of actions, operations, and argumentation. This model integrates various design tools and captures performed design activities. The action level captures the sequence of design operations. The model operation level captures the transition of design states, recording a design snapshot over design tools, which are integrated through ontology-based representation of design concepts. The argumentation level captures the process of defining problems and corresponding alternative solutions. Integration of three levels with a template of design operation extracted from Design-For-X approaches enables a proposed system to interactively and efficiently capture and manage the process of design concept development through operations over design tools. A design operation template works to limit the number of links between the three levels remaining easy to manage its semantics. This paper also demonstrates a prototype implementation of DRIFT and its application to conceptual design of a small mechatronic system with a system modeling method. The paper concludes with a discussion of some future issues. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
