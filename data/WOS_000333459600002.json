As is well known, affine arithmetic is robust for calculating the surface intersection because it is able to not only find every branch of the intersection, but also deal with some singular cases, such as surface tangency. However, the classical affine arithmetic is defined only for the globally supported polynomials, and its computation is very time consuming, thus hampering its usefulness in practical applications, especially in geometric design. In this paper, we extend affine arithmetic to calculate the range of recursively and locally defined B-spline basis functions, and we accelerate the affine arithmetic-based surface intersection algorithm by using a GPU. Moreover, we develop efficient methods to thin the strip-shaped intersection regions produced by the affine arithmetic-based intersection algorithm, calculate the intersection points, and further improve their accuracy. The many examples presented in this paper demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of this method.", "paper_title": "Affine Arithmetic-Based B-Spline Surface Intersection with GPU Acceleration", "paper_id": "WOS:000333459600002"}
