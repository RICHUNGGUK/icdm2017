In practice, changing network conditions such as inter-AS traffic demand variation, link failures and inter-AS routing changes occur dynamically. These changes can make fixed outbound TE solutions inadequate and may subsequently cause inter-AS links to become congested. In order to overcome this problem, we propose the deployment of a closed-loop control traffic engineering system that makes outbound traffic robust to inter-AS link failures and adaptive to changing network conditions. The objective is to keep the inter-AS link utilization balanced under unexpected events while reducing service disruptions and reconfiguration overheads. Our evaluation results show that the proposed system can successfully achieve better load balancing with less service disruption and re-configuration overhead in comparison to alternative approaches.", "paper_title": "A Closed-Loop Control Traffic Engineering System for the Dynamic Load Balancing of Inter-AS Traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000272574500001"}
