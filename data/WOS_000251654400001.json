For this purpose, different techniques based on the clustering graph model are proposed in the literature. In this work, we show that the state-of-the-art clustering graph model is not able to correctly capture the disk access costs of aggregate network operations. Moreover, we propose a novel clustering hypergraph model that correctly captures the disk access costs of these operations. The proposed model aims to minimize the total number of disk page accesses in aggregate network operations. Based on this model, we further propose two adaptive recursive bipartitioning schemes to reduce the number of allocated disk pages while trying to minimize the number of disk page accesses. We evaluate our clustering hypergraph model and recursive bipartitioning schemes on a wide range of road network datasets. The results of the conducted experiments show that the proposed model is quite effective in reducing the number of disk accesses incurred by the network operations. (C) 2007 Elsevier BN.
