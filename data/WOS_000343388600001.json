In particular, the influence of distal traits tied to social activity has not been incorporated into the nomological network surrounding information technology (IT) use. Addressing this literature gap, the authors develop their research model using Social Cognitive Theory and examine how two distal traits, social aversion (SA) and institution-based trust (TRIT), influence computer self-efficacy (CSE) and other proximal state-like differences related to IT use. The authors' results show that SA and TRIT demonstrated influence on CSE and CA at the general and specific levels of analysis, and that CSE mediates the influence of SA and TRIT on PU and PEOU, yet does not fully mediate the influence of CA on PU and PEOU. The implications of their findings for research and practice are discussed, as well as avenues for future research.", "paper_title": "The Influence of Social Aversion and Institution-Based Trust on Computer Self-Efficacy, Computer Anxiety and Antecedents to IT Use", "paper_id": "WOS:000343388600001"}
