According to the data obtained from some simple questionnaires, we could measure fuzzy relation among the members of a group and observe its human structure by applying fuzzy graph. In this paper, we would not only discuss the fuzzy sociometry analysis system, but also describe the decision method applying the fuzzy decision. Moreover, we also illustrate its practical effectiveness with the case study.", "paper_title": "Sociometry analysis applying fuzzy theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000253944000004"}
