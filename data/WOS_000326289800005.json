The software incorporates a newly developed equation-by- equation strategy that significantly improves the efficiency of the closedness subspace algorithm and substantially reduces the storage requirement. The equation-by-equation strategy is actually based on a variable-by-variable closedness subspace approach. As a result, the algorithm and software can handle much larger nonlinear systems and higher multiplicities than their predecessors, as shown in computational experiments on the included test suite of benchmark problems.", "paper_title": "Algorithm 931: An Algorithm and Software for Computing Multiplicity Structures at Zeros of Nonlinear Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000326289800005"}
