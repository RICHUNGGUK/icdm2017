However, its role and effectiveness in financial markets is still not well understood both theoretically and empirically. By use of agent-based modeling method, the purpose of this paper is to present a new artificial stock market model with self-adaptive agents, which allows the assessment of the impacts from various levels of STTs in distinctive market environments and thus a comprehensive understanding of the effects of STTs is achieved. Design/methodology/approach - In the model, agents are allowed to employ the strategies used by the following five types of investors: contrarians, random traders, momentum traders, fundamentalists and exit strategy holders. Specifically, the authors start with the investigation of the dynamics of a tax free benchmark market; then the patterns of market behaviors and the behaviors of various types of investors are discussed with different levels of STTs in markets with mild and high fluctuations. Findings - The simulation results consistently show that a moderate transaction tax does contribute to market stabilization in terms of reducing market volatility while with a price of mild decrease of market efficiency and liquidity. The findings suggest that a balance between market stability and efficiency could be reached if regulatory authorities introduce STTs to markets discreetly. Originality/value - This paper enriches the comprehensive understanding of the effects of STT, and gives good explanation about the controversy between Tobin's proponents and anti-Tobin group.", "paper_title": "Transaction tax, heterogeneous traders and market volatility", "paper_id": "WOS:000359057900007"}
