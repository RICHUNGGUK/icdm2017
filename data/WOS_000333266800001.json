This strategy firstly uses support vector regressors ensemble (SVRM) to establish the mapping of node position to radio parameters by supervising learning. Then by modelling the noise as the adversary of position estimator, a game between position estimator and noise is constructed. After that the position estimation from SVRM is smoothed by game theory. Simulations show that the proposed strategy results in the more accurate performance, especially in the harsh environment.", "paper_title": "Mobile Tracking Based on Support Vector Regressors Ensemble and Game Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000333266800001"}
