With the emergence of Storage Area Networks (SANs), storage can be network-based and consolidated, and mass data movements via Fiber Channels (FCs) can be of very high speed. Based on these features, this paper introduces a dual-node storage cluster designed for remote mirroring as a concurrent data replication method to protect data during system failures. This design takes full advantage of a SAN system's benefits, and it adopts a synchronous protocol to guarantee a fully up-to-date data copy on the remote site. By developing a Linux kernel module to control the I/O flow and by using the technologies of software Logic Unit Number (LUN) masking, background online resynchronization and a self-management daemon, we have achieved a reliable mirroring system with the characteristics of server-free data replication, fault tolerance, online disaster recovery and high performance. In this study, we implemented the design in a remote mirror subsystem built on a software Fiber Channel Storage Area Network (FC-SAN) system.", "paper_title": "Distributed storage cluster design for remote mirroring based on storage area network", "paper_id": "WOS:000248356900004"}
