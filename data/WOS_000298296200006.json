The received signal strength (RSS) measured by pairs of nodes can be used to obtain either range estimates or connectivity information. It is not clear, however: 1) when a range-based scheme should be used in favor of a connectivity-based one, and 2) how to optimally convert the RSS into connectivity data. This paper uses analysis of the Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) to answer these questions. Solutions are found by comparing the network connectivity against two values: the critical connectivity (CC) and the optimal connectivity (OC). After discussing the properties of both values, we show how their approximation can be used to improve the performance of RF-based localization systems.", "paper_title": "Understanding the Limits of RF-Based Collaborative Localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000298296200006"}
