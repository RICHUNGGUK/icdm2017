A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used to learn the temporal dynamics of the training video sequences of each subject and classification of the test video sequences is performed using the likelihood scores obtained from the HMMs. We apply this method to a video database containing 55 subjects showing extreme expression variations and demonstrate that the HMM-based method performs much better than identification based on the still images using an Individual PCA (IPCA) classifier, achieving more than 30% improvement.", "paper_title": "Human face identification from video based on frequency domain asymmetry representation using hidden Markov models", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800004"}
