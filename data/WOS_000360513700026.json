In this method, the modified stiffness can be classified as three parts: influenced region, stationary region and an interface region between them. The main computation cost concentrates on the influenced region by this specific blocked strategy. Compared with popular reanalysis methods, the proposed method can achieve an accurate response for large modification with lower computation cost. Several practical engineering problems are analyzed and the results are exactly as that performed by full analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
