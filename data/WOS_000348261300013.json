By adopting a local discontinuous Galerkin predictor method, a high order one-step time discretization is obtained, with no need for Runge-Kutta sub-steps. This turns out to be particularly advantageous in combination with space-time adaptive mesh refinement, which has been implemented following a \"cell-by-cell\" approach. As in existing second order AMR methods, also the present higher order AMR algorithm features time-accurate local time stepping (LTS), where grids on different spatial refinement levels are allowed to use different time steps. We also compare two different Riemann solvers for the computation of the numerical fluxes at the cell interfaces. The new scheme has been validated over a sample of numerical test problems in one, two and three spatial dimensions, exploring its ability in resolving the propagation of relativistic hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical waves in different physical regimes. The astrophysical relevance of the new code for the study of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability is briefly discussed in view of future applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
