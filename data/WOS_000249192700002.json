The importance of GPCRs has led to their becoming the targets of more than 50% of prescription drugs. However, drug compounds that do not differentiate between receptor subtypes can have considerable side effects and efficacy problems. An accurate classification of GPCRs can solve the side effect problems and raise the efficacy of drugs. Here, we introduce an approach that combines a fingerprint method, statistical profiles and physicochemical properties of transmembrane (TM) domains for a highly accurate classification of the receptors. The approach allows both the recognition and classification for GPCRs at the subfamily and subtype level, and allows the identification of splice variants. We found that the approach demonstrates an overall accuracy of 97.88% for subfamily classification, and 94.51% for subtype classification. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
