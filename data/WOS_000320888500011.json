The A center dot 3 ILFD circuit is realized with a ST cross-coupled n-core MOS LC-tank oscillator. Two direct-injection MOSFETs in series are used as a frequency doubler and a dynamic linear mixer to widen the locking range. The power consumption of the ILFD core is 10.56 mW. The divider's free-running frequency is tunable from 3.529 to 3.828 GHz by tuning the varactor's control bias, and at the incident power of 0 dBm the maximum locking range is 2.3 GHz (21.6 %), from the incident frequency 9.5 to 11.8 GHz. The operation range is 2.5 GHz (23.7 %), from 9.3 to 11.8 GHz.", "paper_title": "Wide-locking range A center dot 3 series-tuned injection-locked frequency divider", "paper_id": "WOS:000320888500011"}
