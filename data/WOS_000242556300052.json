To solve the equivalent problem effectively, firstly, a genetic algorithm is incorporated with Lemke algorithm. For x fixed, the optimal solution y of the follower's problem can be obtained by Lemke algorithm, then (x, y) is a feasible or approximately feasible solution of the transformed problem and considered as a point in the population; secondly, based on the best individuals in the population, a special crossover operator is designed to generate high quality individuals; finally, a new hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed for solving this class of bilevel programming problems. The simulation on 20 benchmark problems demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A hybrid genetic algorithm for solving a class of nonlinear bilevel programming problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300052"}
