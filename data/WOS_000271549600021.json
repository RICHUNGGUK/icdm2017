In this paper, we discuss the extended version of EVM (EVM/LC) that addresses the effect of learning on the performance of project teams. These effects have so far been ignored in most EVM applications. We present a spreadsheet-based decision support tool that automates the calculations and analyses in EVM/LC. Using this tool would save the project manager from having to perform complicated calculations while still taking advantage of the relatively accurate estimates generated by EVM/LC. Consequently, this paper contributes to both research and practice in project management. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
