The family of deterministic context-free languages is closed under a homomorphism h if and only if h is either a code of bounded deciphering delay, or the images of all symbols under h are powers of the same string. The same characterization holds for LL context-free languages. The unambiguous context-free languages are closed under h if and only if either h is a code, or the images of all symbols under h are powers of the same string.", "paper_title": "HOMOMORPHISMS PRESERVING DETERMINISTIC CONTEXT-FREE LANGUAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000332114100008"}
