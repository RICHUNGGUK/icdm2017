The general goal of AAL solutions is to apply ambient intelligence technology to enable people with specific demands, e.g., handicapped or elderly, to live in their preferred environment longer. The term \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) is used as an umbrella keyword for covering various aspects related to the extension of the Internet and the Web into the physical realm, by means of the widespread deployment of spatially distributed devices with embedded identification, sensing and/or actuation capabilities. In this context, we propose a new methodology based on self organizing maps (SOMs) and fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithms for profile generation as regards the activities of the user and their correlation with the available sensors. Moreover, we utilize the provided context to assign the generated profiles to more contextually complex activities. Our methodology is being evaluated into an AAL structure equipped with several sensors. More precisely, we assess the proposed method in a data set generated by accelerometers and its performance over a number of everyday activities.", "paper_title": "A New Method for Profile Generation in an Internet of Things Environment: An Application in Ambient-Assisted Living", "paper_id": "WOS:000373098800003"}
