Following the main idea of the Method of Variational Imbedding (MVI), we. \"imbed\" the inverse problem into a fourth-order elliptic boundary value problem for the Euler-Lagrange equation being the necessary condition for minimization of the quadratic functional of the original equation. The fourth-order boundary value problem becomes well-posed with the two boundary conditions considered here. The Euler-Lagrange equation for the unknown coefficient provides an explicit equation for the coefficient. A featuring example is elaborated numerically.", "paper_title": "Coefficient identification in elliptic partial differential equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236456400042"}
