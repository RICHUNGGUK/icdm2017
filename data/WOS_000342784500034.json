Acoustic models trained from various speakers and noise conditions are decomposed to build the bases that capture the interaction between the two factors. The model for the target speaker and noise is represented as a product of bases and two weight vectors. In experiments using the AURORA4 corpus, the bilinear model outperforms the linear model.", "paper_title": "Adaptation of Acoustic Models in Joint Speaker and Noise Space Using Bilinear Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784500034"}
