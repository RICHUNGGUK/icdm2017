Spectrum sensing is of the utmost importance in CRN to find and use the available spectrum without harmful interference to the PUs. Conventionally, to implement spectrum utilization, SUs are required to sense the primary spectrum first and then transmit data on the available spectrum. In this paper, we propose a dedicated wireless spectrum sensing network (WSSN), eliminating sensing overhead from SUs with the aim of improving achievable throughput. With WSSN assistance, we eliminate sensing time from the SUs frame, hence increasing the transmission time, which maximizes the achievable throughput. Additionally, the sensing duration is increased by deploying a dedicated WSSN, decreasing the probability of false alarm and achieving a targeted high probability of detection. A low probability of false alarm increases the spectrum utilization, improving the achievable throughput, while a high detection probability ensures PUs protection. Moreover, the proposed technique also addresses hidden and exposed terminal problems along with smooth spectrum mobility. Finally, we provide simulation results to demonstrate the proposed techniques, effectiveness. In the results, we have compared the achievable throughput of the proposed scheme with that of conventional CRN.", "paper_title": "Maximizing Throughput with Wireless Spectrum Sensing Network Assisted Cognitive Radios", "paper_id": "WOS:000358208600001"}
