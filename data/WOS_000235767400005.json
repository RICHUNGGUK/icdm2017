The location information of mobile nodes in a Voronoi zone is summarized using bloom filters and distributed among the location servers in the zones. In the integrated system, the destination's location is learned during routing in the overlay network of the hierarchy. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed system reduces the routing time by about 25% over traditional location-aided routing techniques for transaction-type traffic while incurring only small management overhead and low storage requirement.
