Contrast-enhanced MSCT angiography with high spatial resolution allows for a segmentation of the coronary artery tree. We present an automatically adapted transfer function (TF) specification to highlight pathologic changes of the vessel wall based on the segmentation result of the coronary artery tree. The TFs are combined with common visualization techniques, such as multiplanar reformation and direct volume rendering for the evaluation of coronary arteries in MSCT image data. The presented TF-based mapping of CT values in Hounsfield Units (HU) to color and opacity leads to a different color coding for different plaque types. To account for varying HU values of the vessel lumen caused by the contrast medium, the TFs are adapted to each dataset by local histogram analysis. We describe an informal evaluation with three board-certified radiologists which indicates that the represented visualizations guide the user's attention to pathologic changes of the vessel wall as well as provide an overview about spatial variations.", "paper_title": "Automatic Transfer Function Specification for Visual Emphasis of Coronary Artery Plaque", "paper_id": "WOS:000274388400015"}
