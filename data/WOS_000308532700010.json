Then, it is applied for solving L-R fuzzy linear system (L-R-FLS) with fuzzy right-hand side, so that L-R-FLS is transformed to the minimization problem. The solution of the mentioned non-linear programming problem is our favorite fuzzy number vector solution. Two constructive Algorithms are proposed in detail and the method is illustrated by solving several numerical examples.", "paper_title": "A new metric for L-R fuzzy numbers and its application in fuzzy linear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000308532700010"}
