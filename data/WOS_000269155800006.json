Since such prevalent home network environments frequently deal with private and sensitive information, it is crucial to legitimately provide access control for protecting such emerging environments. As a result, the open services gateway initiative (OSGi) attempted to address this critical issue. However, the current OSGi authorization mechanism is not rigorous enough to fulfill security requirements involved in dynamic OSGi environments. In this paper, we provide a systematic way to adopt a role-based access control (RBAC) approach in OSGi environments. We demonstrate how our authorization framework can achieve important RBAC features and enhance existing primitive access control modules in OSGi service environments. Also, we describe a proof-of-concept prototype of the proposed framework to discuss the feasibility of our approach using an open source implementation of OSGi framework known as Knopflerfish.", "paper_title": "Security-Enhanced OSGi Service Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000269155800006"}
