In this study, the development potential of digital archives resource into outdoor environmental education is focused with mobile learning-based educational theory. In this study, we adopt Kelly Repertory Grid as the tool for constructing the learners' knowledge mind maps and build the mobile learning system over cloud network to supply the learners to observe the others' learning results. At the same time, Natural Theory, Cone of Experience Theory and Hierarchy Map of Outdoor Education are also introduced to help students complete their learning programs of digital archives of environmental education. And then the learners' beneficial results of consciousness, attitude, and participation are gathered from the system. It makes the learners learn the essence of environmental education, in order to appreciate the valuable resources of nature paid to understand the sustainable ecological coexistence, thus protect the human treasure of natural resources. To verify the feasibility of our approach, the grade five students were invited to participate in the cooperative learning activity. The experimental results show that the effect of mobile community interactive learning is better than the general outdoor learning methods and the cooperative learning theory can improve the efficiency of learners' knowledge effectively. These results interpret the effectiveness of the proposed learning mode and could be referred to other teaching activities in the future.", "paper_title": "Establishment and Application for a Mobile Learning Communities System over Cloud Network: A Case Study of Digital Archives Resource into Outdoor Environmental Education", "paper_id": "WOS:000327912200013"}
