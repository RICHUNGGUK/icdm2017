The first cell structure results in reduced gate voltages for the NMOS pass transistors, and thus lowers the gate leakage current. It reduces the subthreshold leakage current by increasing the ground level during the idle (inactive) mode. The second cell structure makes use of PMOS pass transistors to lower the gate leakage current. In addition, dual threshold voltage technology with forward body biasing is utilized with this structure to reduce the subthreshold leakage while maintaining performance. Compared to a conventional SRAM cell, the first cell structure decreases the total gate leakage current by 66% and the idle power by 58% and increases the access time by approximately 2% while the second cell structure reduces the total gate leakage current by 27% and the idle power by 37% with no access time degradation.", "paper_title": "Design and Analysis of Two Low-Power SRAM Cell Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000270037400016"}
