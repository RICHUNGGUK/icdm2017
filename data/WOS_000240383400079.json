The data mining process (DM) as a knowledge extraction method also needs filtering to remove unnecessary or erroneous data. Sometimes filtering also needs to cover processing or representational limits, especially in visual data mining. Common approaches for filtering or shrinking the database are - discard records, prune attributes from the database or reduce dimensionality. In this paper we propose an approach where we have applied single dimension DM process on each individual attribute to select only those attributes which are good for future full-scale DM and prune the non prospective attributes. In this process we check several properties of a single attribute like data distance, clustering tendency and cluster density. According to the result, we formulate a scale that will rank all attributes to indicate their importance for future knowledge extraction schema. The main observation that helps us to build this approach is -'An attribute that has no data pattern itself will not help to find a pattern in a multidimensional environment'.", "paper_title": "Intelligent yardstick, an approach of ranking to filter non-promising attributes from schema in data mining process", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400079"}
