A two-step matching strategy from sparse to dense is developed. Firstly, an improved seeds-growing algorithm is utilized to acquire sparse matching of high confidence. Secondly, based on the control points method and piecewise dynamic programming, the dense matching is completed. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can produce smooth and dense 3D points cloud model of the human face.", "paper_title": "3D reconstruction of human face based on an improved seeds-growing algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000293961900012"}
