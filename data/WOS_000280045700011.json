This technique allows for opaque and emissive particles to render translucent volumes without visibility sorting. Our CPU acceleration of PBVR provides the multi-volume rendering feature while remaining compatible with both regular and irregular volumes. We also reduce the memory cost required for storing all sub-pixel values by proposing a pixel repetition technique for a large sub-pixel level. By adjusting the repetition level, we achieved a very smooth level of detail (LOD) control for trading quality for speed. Our work demonstrates a full-detail rendering rate from 5 to 10 fps for irregular volume data with mega-scale cell numbers on an NVIDIA GeForce 8800GTS. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
