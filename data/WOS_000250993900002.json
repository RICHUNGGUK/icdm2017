With the advent of advanced wireless broadband technologies, TCP must be properly tuned and enhanced from traditional networks made up of purely wired links to wired-cum-wireless networks. As a result of high bit error rate (BER) in wireless links, TCP halves down its congestion window unnecessarily caused by random packet loss event continuously, and the performance is significantly degraded in wireless networks. The problem about differentiating congestion loss and random loss has been investigated recently by a number of wireless TCP solutions, such as JTCP (jitter-based TCP). While the existing solutions are accomplishing fundamental efforts to distinguish packet losses, some unavoidable events may occur to make TCP timeout frequently. Hence, we amend JTCP scheme to design a smooth transmission scheme to increase the correctness of loss distinction and avoid burst transmission. Besides, a novel channel aware scheme is designed to deal with dynamic modulation changing in 802.16 Wireless MAN. The experimental results show that our scheme, enhanced JTCP (EJTCP), unrolls significantly better performance than other algorithms over wired-cum-wireless network.", "paper_title": "EJTCP: Enhanced jitter-based TCP for wireless broadband networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000250993900002"}
