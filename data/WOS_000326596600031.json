We introduce a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) scheme for the discretization of the problem based on a tetrahedrization of the computational domain. The discrete system of the HDG method on each subdomain is solved by an optimized sparse direct (LU factorization) solver. The solution of the interface system in the domain decomposition framework is accelerated by a Krylov subspace method. The formulation and the implementation of the resulting DD-HDG (Domain Decomposed-Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin) method are detailed. Numerical results show that the resulting DD-HDG solution strategy has an optimal convergence rate and can save both CPU time and memory cost compared to a classical upwind flux-based DD-DG (Domain Decomposed-Discontinuous Galerkin) approach.
