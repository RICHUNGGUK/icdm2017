Unfortunately, decisions by experts are hampered by the complexity of the network, which can mask errors in the inferred network. In order to aid an expert in making sense out of the thousands of reactions in the organism's metabolism, we developed a method for knowledge-based generalization that provides a higher-level view of the network, highlighting the particularities and essential structure, while hiding the details. In this study, we show the application of this generalization method to 1,286 metabolic networks of organisms in Path2Models that describe fatty acid metabolism. We compare the generalised networks and show that we successfully highlight the aspects that are important for their curation and comparison.", "paper_title": "Knowledge-based generalization of metabolic networks: A practical study", "paper_id": "WOS:000348346700001"}
