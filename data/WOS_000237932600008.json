The Shannon limit for the capacity of these links is at least an order of magnitude higher than the data rate of the current state-of-the-art designs. Channel coding can be used to approach the theoretical Shannon limit. Although there are numerous capacity-approaching codes in the literature, the complexity of these codes prohibits their use in high-speed interchip applications. This work studies several suitable coding schemes for chip-to-chip communication and back-plane application. These coding schemes achieve 3-dB coding gain in the case of an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) model for the channel. In addition, a more realistic model for the channel is developed here that takes into account the effect of crosstalk, jitter, reflection, inter-symbol interference (ISI), and AWGN. Interestingly, the proposed signaling schemes are significantly less sensitive to such interference. Simulation results show coding gains of 5-8 dB for these methods with three typical channel models. In addition, low-complexity decoding architectures for implementation of these schemes are presented. Finally, circuit simulation results confirm that the high-speed implementations of these methods are feasible.", "paper_title": "Coding schemes for chip-to-chip interconnect applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000237932600008"}
