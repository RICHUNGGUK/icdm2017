The full-scale building, whose roof pitch could be adjusted ranging from 0 degrees to 30 degrees, is 10 m in length, 6 m in width and 8 m in eave's height. It is employed to study the wind pressure on the gable roof of low-rise building with different roof pitches. This paper explicitly and concretely discusses the filed facility, data measurement system, data acquisition system, and tap location to provide references for related researchers. Besides, two pieces of time-histories of ten-minute-length wind pressures are analyzed at 0 degrees and 20 degrees roof pitches respectively to compare with those of a wind tunnel test on a rigid model of 1:30 scale. The results show that the tendency for the mean and fluctuating wind pressure distributions between the two kinds of tests is nearly similar.", "paper_title": "Field Experiments for Wind Loads on a Low-Rise Building with Adjustable Pitch", "paper_id": "WOS:000309539800001"}
