The discrete operator, however, need not be derived from the divergence form of the continuous equations. Indeed, conservation law equations that are split into linear combinations of the divergence and product rule form and then discretized using any diagonal-norm skew-symmetric summation-by-parts (SBP) spatial operator, yield discrete operators that are conservative. Furthermore, split-form, discretely conservation operators can be derived for periodic or finite-domain SBP spatial operators of any order. Examples are presented of a fourth-order, SBP finite-difference operator with second-order boundary closures. Sixth-and eighth-order constructions are derived, and are supplied in an accompanying text file.
