Potential improvement in the predictive accuracy of the simulation that can be gained through improving a constituent model depends not only on the relative importance, but also on the inherent uncertainty and inaccuracy of that particular constituent. A need exists for prioritization of code development efforts to cost-effectively allocate available resources to the constituents that require improvement the most. This article proposes a novel and quantitative code prioritization index to accomplish such a task and demonstrates its application on a case study of a steel frame with semirigid connections. Findings show that as high-fidelity constituent models are integrated, the predictive ability of model-based simulation is improved; however, the rate of improvement is dependent upon the sequence in which the constituents are improved.", "paper_title": "Prioritization of Code Development Efforts in Partitioned Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000315859700004"}
