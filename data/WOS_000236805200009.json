Words are compressed using straight-line programs, i.e., context-free grammars that generate exactly one word. For several classes of finitely presented monoids we obtain completeness results for complexity classes in the range from P to EXPSPACE. As a by-product of our results on compressed word problems we obtain a fixed deterministic context-free language with a PSPACE-complete compressed membership problem. The existence of such a language was open so far. Finally, we will investigate the complexity of the compressed membership problem for various circuit complexity classes.", "paper_title": "Word problems and membership problems on compressed words", "paper_id": "WOS:000236805200009"}
