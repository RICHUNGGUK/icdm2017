When performing classification on multilabel data, existing methods using traditional classifiers, such as support vector machines (SVMs), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and decision trees, have relatively poor accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by this, we present a new algorithm adaptation method, namely, a decision tree-based method for multilabel classification in domains with large-scale data sets called decision tree for multi-label classification (DTML). We build an incremental decision tree to reduce the learning time and divide the training data and adopt the k-NN classifier at leaves to improve the classification accuracy. Extensive studies show that our algorithm can efficiently learn from multilabel data while maintaining good performance on example-based evaluation metrics compared to nine state-of-the-art multilabel classification methods. Thus, we draw a conclusion that we provide an efficient and effective incremental algorithm adaptation method for multilabel classification especially in domains with large-scale multilabel data.", "paper_title": "AN INCREMENTAL DECISION TREE FOR MINING MULTILABEL DATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000365582600004"}
