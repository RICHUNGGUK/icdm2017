With Moore's law behavior still lasting, core-count growth creates typical non-uniform memory accesses (NUMA). Existing schedulers assume that the underlying architecture is homogeneous, and as consequence, they may not be well suited for AMP and NUMA systems, since they, respectively, do not properly explore hardware elements asymmetry, while improving memory utilization by avoid multi-processes data starvation. In this paper we propose a new scheduler, namely NUMA-aware Scheduler, to accommodate the next generation of AMP architectures in terms of architecture asymmetry and processes starvation. Experimental results show that the average speedup is 1.36 times faster than default Linux scheduler through evaluation using PARSEC benchmarks, demonstrating that the proposed technique is promising when compared to other prior studies.
