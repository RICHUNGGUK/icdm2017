The interpolation of low-pass signals with this algorithm can be done if the signal bandwidth is known. In practice, the signal bandwidth is unknown and has to be estimated by the user, preventing an automatic application of the Papoulis-Gerchberg algorithm. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically find this parameter, avoiding the need of the user intervention during the reconstruction process. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "The Papoulis-Gerchberg algorithm with unknown signal bandwidth", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700041"}
