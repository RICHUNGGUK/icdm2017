The question is: how many processors are required in such a network to recognise a given language L? Two answers are proposed for the most general case, when L is a recursively enumerable language, and both answers improve on the previously known bounds. In the first case the network has a number of processors that is linearly bounded by the cardinality of the tape alphabet of a Turing machine recognising the given language L. In the second case we show that an AHNEP with a fixed underlying structure can accept any recursively enumerable language. The second construction has another useful property from a practical point of view as it includes a universal AHNEP as a subnetwork, and hence only a limited number of its parameters depend on the given language.", "paper_title": "On the size complexity of universal accepting hybrid networks of evolutionary processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000249229800005"}
