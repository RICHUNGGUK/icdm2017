In this paper, we propose a multi-level 3-D shape feature extraction framework by using deep learning. The low-level 3-D shape descriptors are first encoded into geometric bag-of-words, from which middle-level patterns are discovered to explore geometric relationships among words. After that, high-level shape features are learned via deep belief networks, which are more discriminative for the tasks of shape classification and retrieval. Experiments on 3-D shape recognition and retrieval demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Learning High-Level Feature by Deep Belief Networks for 3-D Model Retrieval and Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000345571300007"}
