To realize this, we focus on characteristics of user's perceptual quality evaluation on 3D objects. We propose an effective QoS control scheme for QuViE/P by introducing relationships between system's internal quality parameters and user's perceptual quality parameters. This scheme can appropriately maintain the QoS of the 3DVE system and it is expected to improve convenience when using 3DVE system where resources are insufficient. We designed and implemented a prototype of QuViE/P using a multiagent framework. The experiment results show that even when the computer resource is reduced to 20% of the required amount, the proposed scheme can maintain the quality of important objects to a certain level.", "paper_title": "An effective QoS control scheme for 3D virtual environments based on user's perception", "paper_id": "WOS:000256861100003"}
