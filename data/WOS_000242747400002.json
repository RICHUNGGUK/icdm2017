The polynomial f can be represented by Ax(m) where A is a real mth order n-dimensional supersymmetric tensor. In this paper, we define rank, base index and eigenvalues for the polynomial f, the hypersurface S and the tensor A. The rank is a nonnegative integer r less than or equal to n. When r is less than n, A is singular, f can be converted into a homogeneous polynomial with r variables by an orthogonal transformation, and S is a cylinder hypersurface whose base is r-dimensional. The eigenvalues of f, A and S always exist. The eigenvectors associated with the zero eigenvalue are either recession vectors or degeneracy vectors of positive degree, or their sums. When c not equal 0, the eigenvalues with the same sign as c and their eigenvectors correspond to the characterization points of S, while a degeneracy vector generates an asymptotic ray for the base of S or its conjugate hypersurface. The base index is a nonnegative integer d less than m. If d = k, then there are nonzero, degeneracy vectors of degree k - 1, but no nonzero degeneracy vectors of degree k. A linear combination of a degeneracy vector of degree k and a degeneracy vector of degree j is a degeneracy vector of degree k + j - m if k + j : m. Based upon these properties, we classify such algebraic hypersurfaces in the nonsingular case into ten classes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
