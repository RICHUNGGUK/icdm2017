We are given a bundle of sticks all having integer lengths. The total sum of their lengths is n(n + 1)/2. Can we break the sticks so that the resulting sticks have lengths 1,2,..., n? The problem is known to be NP-hard. We consider an optimization version of the problem which involves cutting the sticks and placing them into boxes. The problem has a trivial polynomial time algorithm with an approximation ratio of 2. We present a greedy algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of root 2. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
