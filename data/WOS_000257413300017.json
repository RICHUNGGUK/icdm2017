In this paper, we investigate gender classification from human gaits in image sequences, a relatively understudied problem. Moreover, we propose to fuse gait and face for improved gender discrimination. We exploit canonical correlation analysis (CCA), a powerful tool that is well suited for relating two sets of measurements, to fuse the two modalities at the feature level. Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal gender recognition system achieves the superior recognition performance of 97.2% in large data sets. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
