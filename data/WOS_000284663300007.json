Electrostatics is one of the techniques used for such task with its non-intrusive, robust, and low cost natures. The passive electrostatic meters measure charge induced on the detecting electrodes. As it is known that the induced signal is not only dependent on the solids mass flow rate, but also affected by solids velocity. However, the velocity of particles usually referred to is the axial velocity. In reality, the solids velocity is a vector, its projections in both the radial and tangential directions also need to be investigated. This paper analyses the dynamic sensitivity of ring-shaped electrostatic sensors using the finite element method (FEM), and investigates the influence of the axial and radial velocities on the induced signal on the electrodes.
