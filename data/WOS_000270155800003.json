Different weights and types of CIs are used and compared by computer simulation using a logistic growth function and error terms following an AR(1) model. The results indicate that bias correction reduces the bias of a point estimator but fails for CI calculations. A bootstrap percentile method and a normal approximation method perform well for two weights when used without bias correction. Taking both coverage and lengths of CIs into consideration, a non-bias-corrected percentile method with an unweighted estimator performs best.", "paper_title": "Bootstrap methods for bias correction and confidence interval estimation for nonlinear quantile regression of longitudinal data", "paper_id": "WOS:000270155800003"}
