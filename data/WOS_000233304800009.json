This paper proposes a (t, k)-diagnosis algorithm for matching composition networks, which include many well-known interconnection networks such as hypercubes, crossed cubes, twisted cubes, and Mobius cubes. It is shown that matching composition networks of n dimensions are (Omega(2(n)*log n/n),n)-diagnosable, where n > 5.", "paper_title": "(t, k)-diagnosis for matching composition networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000233304800009"}
