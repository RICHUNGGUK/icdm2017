A main advantage is the structured staggered grid, making it simple and efficient on modern computer architectures. A downside to this is the difficulty in approximating oblique boundaries, having to resort to staircase approximations. In this paper we present a method to improve the boundary treatment in two dimensions by, starting from a staircase approximation, modifying the coefficients of the update stencil so that we can obtain a consistent approximation while preserving the energy conservation, structure and the optimal CFL-condition of the original Yee scheme. We prove this in L (2) and verify it by numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "On energy preserving consistent boundary conditions for the Yee scheme in 2D", "paper_id": "WOS:000308234600006"}
