Consider the mapping L : S ---> S-l; f --> (L(l)f,...,L(l)f), where L-l,...,L-l is an element of Theta. For g = (g(1),...,g(l)) is an element of S-L(l) = im L, it is natural to ask how to solve the system Lf = g. In this paper, we will effectively characterize S-L(l) and show how to compute a so called distinguished right inverse L-1 : S-L(l) --> S of L. We will also characterize the solution space of the homogeneous equation Lh = 0.
