Geostatistics models phenomena with spatial variation, but restricted to homogeneous prediction regions. The presence of barriers such as buildings introduces discontinuities in prediction areas. In this paper we investigate how to incorporate information of a geographical nature into the process of geostatistical prediction. In addition, we study the use of a Cost-Based distance to quantify the correlation between locations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
