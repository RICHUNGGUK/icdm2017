For a carrier, the pricing planning problem with inverse demand function requires simultaneous determination of the demand for its service and development of an operating plan to fill the available network capacity in a manner which maximizes its profit. In an oligopolistic market, the Cournot-Nash price equilibrium is all of the carriers achieving the highest individual profit with respect to the market shares and operational plans of the other carriers. This model is applicable to an integral-constrained spatially separated oligopolistic market. We chose the path formulation and proposed a diagonalization algorithm to determine the Coumot-Nash price equilibria. The time-definite freight delivery market in Taiwan was used for numerical testing. The results showed that this approach is suitable for determining the market equilibria for the industry. In addition we discussed the sensitivity on parameters of this approach and the economic implications for carriers. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
