The framework is hardware vendor independent and uses speckle tracking (endocardial border detection) on ultrasound (MRI) imaging data in the form of DICOM. Standard American Heart Association segment-based strain analysis can be performed using a browser-based interface. The speckle tracking, border detection and model fitting methods are implemented in C++ using open-source tools. They are wrapped as web services and orchestrated via a JBOSS-based application server.", "paper_title": "ICMA: an integrated cardiac modeling and analysis platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000354453700033"}
