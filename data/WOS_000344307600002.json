Indeed, such platforms have been used as a means of sharing and republishing information, leading to a large collection of content that users must sift through. We consider the problem of curating this vast catalogue of content such that aggregators or publishers can offer readers content that is of interest to them, with minimal spam. Under a game-theoretic model we obtain several results on the optimal content selection and on the efficiency of distributed curation.", "paper_title": "Distributed Content Curation on the Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000344307600002"}
