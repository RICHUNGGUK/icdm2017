Through characterizing the primal and dual optimal solutions as the saddle points of the Lagrangian function associated with the problem, we propose a distributed algorithm, named the distributed primal-dual subgradient method, to provide approximate saddle points of the Lagrangian function, based on the distributed average consensus algorithms. Under Slater's condition, we obtain bounds on the convergence properties of the proposed method for a constant step size. Simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Distributed Primal-Dual Subgradient Method for Multiagent Optimization via Consensus Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000297342100022"}
