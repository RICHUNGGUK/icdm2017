Both types of service process requests dynamically join and leave a system at run time. During the admission test, the schedulability of a periodic task is determined by using its fixed task capacity. Aperiodic tasks are admitted using the available capacity after admitted periodic tasks. At run time, the earliest deadline first (EDF) scheduling is used to schedule the mixed periodic and aperiodic workloads. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm may achieve up to 90% in system utilization, while incurring a low admission overhead for each service request.", "paper_title": "An On-Line Capacity-Based Admission Control for Real-Time Service Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000343886200003"}
