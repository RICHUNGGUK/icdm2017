Inferring genetic networks from a large-scale expression data is very important to understand the underlying biological systems. Thus in this paper, we review the state of the art in genetic network research field. First we focus on the latest techniques developed for processing raw expression data for reconstructing genetic networks. We next discuss a number of significant impacting factors of regulatory networks. Third, we present several popular models for inferring genetic networks and analyse the advantages and disadvantages of each model.", "paper_title": "Genetic networks: processing data, regulatory network modelling and their analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000242550300012"}
