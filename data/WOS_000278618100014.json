The Weibull-exponential distribution is used to model the L-shaped hazard rate function that is commonly observed for electronic devices. The optimal burn-in time is selected to minimize the prior or posterior total expected costs, which explicitly consider the uncertainties on all the model parameters. The proposed approach is illustrated using an experimental data set consisting of failure times of a nano-scale high-k gate dielectric film.", "paper_title": "Bayesian Analysis of Hazard Rate, Change Point, and Cost-Optimal Burn-In Time for Electronic Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000278618100014"}
