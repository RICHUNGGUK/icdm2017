To minimize the redistribution data transfer cost, processor mapping techniques were proposed to reduce the amount of redistributed data elements. Theses techniques demand that the beginning data elements on a processor not be redistributed in the redistribution. On the other hand, for satisfying practical computation needs, a programmer may require other data elements to be un-redistributed (localized) in the redistribution. In this paper, we propose a flexible processor mapping technique for the Block-Cyclic redistribution to allow the programmer to localize the required data elements in the redistribution. We also present an efficient redistribution method for the redistribution employing our proposed technique. The data transfer cost reduction and system performance improvement for the redistributions with data localization are analyzed and presented in our experimental results.", "paper_title": "A flexible processor mapping technique toward data localization for block-cyclic data redistribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000256914700001"}
