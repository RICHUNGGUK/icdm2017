We then use the proposed algorithm to segment the spots in the microarray images, and compare our results with those obtained by commercial software. Our algorithm is automatic because the parameters are adaptively estimated from the data without human intervention.", "paper_title": "Automatic microarray spot segmentation using a snake-Fisher model", "paper_id": "WOS:000256354600011"}
