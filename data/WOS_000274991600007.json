In this paper, given a tolerance epsilon > 0 and an epsilon-irreducible algebraic affine plane curve C of proper degree d, we introduce the notion of epsilon-rationality, and we provide an algorithm to parametrize approximately affine epsilon-rational plane curves by means of linear systems of (d - 2)-degree curves. The algorithm outputs a rational parametrization of a rational curve (C) over bar of degree d which has the same points at infinity as (C) over bar. Moreover, although we do not provide a theoretical analysis, our empirical analysis shows that and C are close in practice. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
