In our work, we address the problem of policy distribution and provisioning in MANETs. Previously, we have proposed a policy provisioning architecture that enables the operator, e.g., a military command and control center, to maintain a logically centralized control of the network as a whole, while allowing a physically decentralized and self-managing implementation essential for a MANET environment. In this paper, we present an analytical model of the availability of the policy distribution service in a MANET and analyze the performance using stochastic Petri nets (SPNs). We develop the model at two levels of complexity: as a simple Markovian model with Poisson assumptions and as a more accurate non-Markovian model with general distributions obtained using statistical parameterization. We compare and cross-validate the analytical results with simulation and experimental results. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the architecture for managing QoS for soft real-time applications, using an emulated mobile ad-hoc network testbed.", "paper_title": "Modeling and evaluation of a policy provisioning architecture for mobile ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000242533000006"}
