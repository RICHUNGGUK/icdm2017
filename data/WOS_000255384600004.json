These services must typically be assembled into short-term service collections that, together with code execution services, are combined into a meta-application to perform a particular task. To address the metadata requirements 14 of these problems, we introduce a hybrid Information Service to manage both stateless and stateful (transient) metadata. We leverage the two widely used Web Service standards: Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) and Web Services Context (WS-Context), in our design. We describe our approach and experiences when designing 'semantics'. We report the results from a prototype of the system that is applied to a mobile environment for optimizing Web Service communications.
