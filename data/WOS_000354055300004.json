By transmitting only the action potential (AP) data, the system power consumption is scaled based on the activity of the neural signal. By detecting an AP event prior to digitization, the ASIC can reduce the power consumed in all subsequent stages and yet conserves the entire AP shape without affecting the classification performance. The complete 2.5 cm(3) head stage weighing below 7 g can operate for 3 h. The ASIC achieves < 3.5 A mu Vrms noise (both in AP and LFP band) and > 70 dB CMRR.", "paper_title": "24 Channel dual-band wireless neural recorder with activity-dependent power consumption", "paper_id": "WOS:000354055300004"}
