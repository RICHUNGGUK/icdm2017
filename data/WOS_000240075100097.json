A decision model of eye location is instituted by the priori knowledge of template facial features. After roughly detection of face, we apply three steps for system to locate eyes. Firstly, the Bayesian eye detector is used to find eye patterns in the upper region of the face image. This vector based Bayesian classifier adopts Haar transform as vectorize because we know that is robust at illumination variation. Secondly, merging and arbitration strategy are applied. It can manage variations of around eye regions due to spectacle rims or eye brows. Finally, Gaussian-projection function can locate robust precision eye position. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve higher performance at any test data.", "paper_title": "Merging and arbitration strategy applied Bayesian classification for eye location", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100097"}
