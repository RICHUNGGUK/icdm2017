It was shown in Cerny et al., (Ann Inst Henri Poincare Probab Stat 47 (2011) 929-968) that this so-called vacant set exhibits a phase transition at u = u(star) : there is a giant component if u < u(star) and only small components when u > u(star). In this paper we show the existence of a critical window of size n(-1/3) around u(star). In this window the size of the largest cluster is of order n(2/3).
