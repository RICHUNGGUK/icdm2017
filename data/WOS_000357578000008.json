The IULA Spanish LSP Treebank is the first technical corpus of Spanish annotated at surface syntactic level, following the dependency grammar theory. We present the method we used to create the resource and the linguistic annotations that the treebank provides, using examples and comparing with similar resources. We also provide the statistics of the treebank and the evaluation results.", "paper_title": "Dependency structure annotation in the IULA Spanish LSP Treebank", "paper_id": "WOS:000357578000008"}
