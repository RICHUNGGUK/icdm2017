In this paper we describe a new method called Symmetry Breaking by Nonstationary Optimisation, which interleaves local search in the symmetry group with backtrack search on the constraint problem. It can be tuned to break each symmetry with an arbitrarily high probability with high runtime overhead, or as a lightweight but still powerful method with low runtime overhead. It has negligible memory requirement, it combines well with static lex-leader constraints, and its benefit increases with problem hardness.", "paper_title": "Partial symmetry breaking by local search in the group", "paper_id": "WOS:000302063800003"}
