First, a RGB image inputted from a frame grabber is converted into a HSV image. Then, the coarse facial region is extracted using the hue(H) and saturation(S) components except intensity(V) component which is sensitive to the environmental illumination. Next, the fine facial region extraction process is performed by matching with the edge and gray based templates. To make a light-invariant and qualified facial image, histogram equalization and intensity compensation processing using illumination plane are performed. The finally extracted and enhanced facial images are used for training the pattern classification models. The proposed hierarchical ART2 pattern classification model which has the Max-Min cluster selection strategy makes it possible to search clustered reference patterns effectively. Experimental results show that the proposed face recognition system is as good as the SVM model which is famous for face recognition field in recognition rate and even better in classification speed.", "paper_title": "Design an effective pattern classification model", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000001"}
