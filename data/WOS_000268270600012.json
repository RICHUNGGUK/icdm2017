It enhances productivity and quality management, and is flexibility, efficient, fast, inexpensive, reliable and robust. This study presents a new translation, rotation and scaling-free object recognition method for 2D objects. The proposed method comprises two parts: KRA feature extractor and GRA classifier. The KRA feature extractor employs K-curvature, re-sampling, and autocorrelation transformation to extract unique features of objects, and then gray relational analysis (GRA) classifies the extracted invariant features. The boundary of the digital object was first represented as the form of the K-curvature over a given region of support, and was then re-sampled and transformed with autocorrelation function. After that, the extracted features own the unique property that is invariant to translation, rotation and scaling. To verify and validate the proposed method, 50 synthetic and 50 real objects were digitized as standard patterns, and 10 extra images of each object (test images) which were taken at different positions, orientations and scales, were acquired and compared with the standard patterns. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method with either GRA or MD methods is effective and reliable for part recognition. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
