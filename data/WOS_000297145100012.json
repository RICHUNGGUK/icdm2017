The main motivation is to avoid the expensive factorizations that are often needed by Krylov solvers when the problem is generalized or interior eigenvalues are desired. In Davidson-type methods, the factorization is replaced by iterative linear solvers that can be accelerated by a smart preconditioner. Jacobi-Davidson is one of the most effective variants. However, parallel implementations of this method are not widely available, particularly for non-symmetric problems. We present a parallel implementation that has been included in SLEPc, the Scalable Library for Eigenvalue Problem Computations, and test it in the context of a highly scalable plasma turbulence simulation code. We analyze its parallel efficiency and compare it with a Krylov-Schur eigensolver.
