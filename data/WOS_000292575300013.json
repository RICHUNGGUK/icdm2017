As is well known, waiting time depends on a number of quantities, such as the system arrival rate, service rate, type of services, time of the day, and efficiency of the servers. In this paper, we propose a service model appropriate in the Indian banking industry and discuss the effectiveness of various solutions using simulation. The best solution found from the alternatives has been implemented. In this paper, we summarize the efforts and the results thereof. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
