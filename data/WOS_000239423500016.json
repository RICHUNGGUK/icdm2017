In such hierarchical networks, sensor nodes are clustered into groups, and their roles are divided into master and slave nodes for more efficient structuring of network traffic. The operational complexity of each sensor node and the amount of data to be transmitted across sensor nodes strongly influence the energy consumption of the nodes, which ultimately determines the network lifetime. This paper provides a new way of reducing data traffic across nodes by deterridning and exploiting the lowest data token delivery points within an application graph that is distributed across a network. The technique divides an application graph into two sub-graphs and then distributes each divided subgraph over a master node and its associated slave nodes. The buffer costs of the graph edges over the cutting line corresponds to the amount of data to be transmitted between nodes after allocating the two partial subgraphs such that one subgraph executes on a master node, and the other subgraph is distributed across the associated slave nodes. Since the energy consumption on each node is dominated by the transceiver, the reduced data traffic allows for reducing the turn-on time of the transceivers, and thereby leads to high energy savings. This technique also distributes the workload of sensor nodes in a systematic manner. The more balanced workload also contributes to efficient battery usage, and also improves the latency for processing the data frames captured by the sensor nodes.", "paper_title": "Energy-driven partitioning of signal processing algorithms in sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239423500016"}
