Our research aims at maximising the automation of acquisition of user knowledge, thus providing an effective solution for multi-faceted user modeling. This paper presents an approach to eliciting a user's conceptualization by engaging in an ontology-driven dialog. This is implemented as an OWL-based domain-independent diagnostic agent. We show the deployment of the agent in a use case for personalized management of learning content, which has been evaluated in three studies with users. Currently, the system is being deployed in a cultural heritage domain for personalized recommendation of museum resources.", "paper_title": "Interactive ontology-based user knowledge acquisition: A case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000238574900038"}
