The consumed moisture content by self-desiccation could be firstly calculated according to evolved hydration degree of cement and mineral admixtures. Furthermore, the finite differential method was adopted to solve the moisture transport model by linearizing the nonlinear moisture diffusion coefficient. The comparison between experimental and calculated results showed a good agreement, which indicated that the proposed moisture model could be used to predict moisture content evolution in underground concrete members with drying-wetting boundaries.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear calculation of moisture transport in underground concrete", "paper_id": "WOS:000337301900004"}
