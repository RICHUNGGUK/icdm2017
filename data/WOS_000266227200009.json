The face slab, the key seepage-proof structure of great concern, has a strong interaction with the neighboring gravel cushion layer due to a significant difference in their stiffness. An elasto-plasticity damage interface element, a numerical format of the EPDI model, is described for numerical analysis of a CFRD that can trace the separation and re-contact between the face slab and the cushion layer at the interface. As verified by simulating slide block and direct shear interface tests, this element was confirmed to capture effectively the primary monotonic and cyclic behaviors of the interface. This element can easily be extended to the finite element method (FEM) programs that involve the Goodman interface element. The analysis of a typical CFRD showed that the interface model describes a significant effect on the stress response of the face slab under different conditions, including dam construction, water storage, and earthquake. Treatments of the cushion layer, such as an asphalt layer, changed the behavior of the interface between it and the face slab, which resulted in a significant effect on the stress response of the face slab. The top of the face slab exhibited a significant separation from the cushion layer during construction, induced mainly by construction of the neighboring dam body. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
