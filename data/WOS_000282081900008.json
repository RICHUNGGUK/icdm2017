The present study is significant in several ways. First, this study reveals the characteristics of structural identification from the optimization perspective. Second, the \"switch point\" from global search to local search is determined with due consideration in convergence speed and avoidance of local optima. Finally, the combined strategy based on Part I and Part II with a particular local search (BFGS) is found to achieve substantial improvement in identification efficiency and accuracy.
