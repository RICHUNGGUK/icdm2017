A possibility to attack hard optimization problems is the design of approximation algorithms. Based on the well-known double minimum spanning tree heuristic, the first implicit approximation algorithm is designed for an NP-hard problem, the metric traveling salesperson problem. Priority functions are used in a new approach for the computation of the shortcuts and three different variants are experimentally evaluated with respect to the approximation quality. Furthermore, the worst case complexity of the approximation algorithm is investigated in more detail. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
