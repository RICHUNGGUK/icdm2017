A flux estimation model and rotor current sensor are no longer required. The controller is developed from the DFIG nonlinear-coupled model. Moreover, the global stability and the DFIG states' boundedness when our low-cost sliding mode control is applied are established analytically. It is revealed that the (dq) components of the rotor flux remain near their nominal values. Our approach is validated via simulation in the case of a WECS based on DFIG rating at 1.5 MW. The robustness and the performances are verified with the presence of parametric variations and disturbances in the case of an unbalanced grid.", "paper_title": "Low-cost sliding mode control of WECS based on DFIG with stability analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000365508200015"}
