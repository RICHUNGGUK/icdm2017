The new scheme is capable of reproducing the well-known four-point based interpolation subdivision in the quad region but does not reproduce Butterfly subdivision in the triangular part. The new scheme defines rules that produce surfaces both at the regular quad/triangle vertices and isolated, extraordinary points. We demonstrate the visually satisfying of our surfaces through several examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
