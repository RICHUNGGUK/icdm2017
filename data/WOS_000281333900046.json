Nonparametric techniques that circumvent these issues by using local moment information, thereby extending the piecewise-polynomial histograms, are developed. These methods utilize not only binned data counts, but also their conditional moments in order to better estimate the underlying density of the data. A particular polynomial spline density estimator can be found via penalized least-squares optimization with a roughness penalty. Two issues exist in regards to the original algorithm: (1) local moments for empty bins are undefined and (2) all moment information is treated equally, despite the fact that lower-order moments are more accurate than higher-order moments. Solutions to both issues are provided by using unconditional moments and incorporating a weight matrix into the optimization problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
