Thus, understanding its value realization in the proper business context is a vitally important issue. This study examines the impact of initial mandatory adoption of XBRL on organizations' cost of capital and transaction costs in PR China. As transaction cost theory predicts, the uncertainty related to the unproven technology increases transaction costs and the cost of capital during the early adoption period. Implications have immediate benefits for regulators, filing organizations, information consumers, the accounting profession, and other stakeholders. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
