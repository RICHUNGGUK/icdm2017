It has proved to be a useful technology because it is able to improve retrieval performance frequently. However, in almost all prior research in data fusion, static search environments have been used, and dynamic search environments have generally not been considered. In this article, we investigate adaptive data fusion methods that can change their behavior when the search environment changes. Three adaptive data fusion methods are proposed and investigated. To test these proposed methods properly, we generate a benchmark from a historic Text REtrieval Conference data set. Experiments with the benchmark show that 2 of the proposed methods are good and may potentially be used in practice.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Data Fusion Methods in Information Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000342346500007"}
