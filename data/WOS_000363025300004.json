The adaptation strategy is triggered by the overall communication choreography, represented by a global type. When the global type is dynamically updated, its projections define new monitors, which set-up novel communication protocols for the participants. The key result of this paper is that self-adaptations are performed in a type-safe way, while providing a high degree of flexibility. Subject Reduction and Progress properties are proven: any session executes all required communications in a type-safe way and never gets stuck.", "paper_title": "Self-adaptive multiparty sessions", "paper_id": "WOS:000363025300004"}
