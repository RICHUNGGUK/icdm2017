Because we use image based,method for identification, the accurate position of the face is required. First, face features are detected, and the face region is determined using the features. Then, by registering the face region to the average face, the horizontal position of the face is adjusted. Finally, the size of the face region is adjusted based on the distance of two eyes determined from all input frames. If the sizes of images for all faces are normalized into one size, the face length feature is lost in the normalized face image. The face is classified into three categories according to the face length, and the subspace is generated in each category so that the face length feature is preserved. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by experiments.", "paper_title": "Robust face recognition under various illumination conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000238961900023"}
