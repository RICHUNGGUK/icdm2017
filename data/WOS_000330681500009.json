However, in reality, different services have different delay constraints. In this paper, two new network selection policies are proposed for heterogeneous wireless communication systems using effective capacity, which incorporate delay in the transmission rate. Users can access the proper network after considering the delay demands of different services. Our proposed policies aim to maximize the entire throughput with different delay constraints. Both the mathematical analysis and simulations show that the proposed network selection policies can improve network throughput while providing quality-of-service guarantees.", "paper_title": "Network selection policy based on effective capacity in heterogeneous wireless communication systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000330681500009"}
