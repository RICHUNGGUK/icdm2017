This work shows the integration of trust and reputation model and WSMO in two ways: 1) how agents use WSMO as ontology to define their requirements, responses, domain-dependent features and metrics; and 2) how the Web services discovery process in WSMO may be improved using trust and reputation criteria given by the model from data stored by consumer agents in previous interactions.", "paper_title": "A new model for trust and reputation management with an ontology based approach for similarity between tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123300015"}
