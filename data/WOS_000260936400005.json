However, the medium itself usually moves in the real world. We introduce this effect by adding an advection term to the reaction-diffusion equation. This can be considered the natural generalization of the reaction-diffusion system. In this study. mutual coupling between pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems and convective flow is investigated. Since the scales of the flow velocity and propaggating-wave velocity are comparable, novel phenomena can be observed in both experiments and numerical calculations. In the present article, some experimental results are given and a theoretical discussion and/or numerical modeling are presented from the viewpoint of reaction-diffusion systems with convective effects.", "paper_title": "Convective Effects in a Reaction-Diffusion System: Marangoni Effects and Spontaneous Motion", "paper_id": "WOS:000260936400005"}
