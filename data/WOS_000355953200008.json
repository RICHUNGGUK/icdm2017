The studied gamma-GYs consist of hexagon carbon rings connected by linear chains with C atoms n=0-22. We predict that the even-numbered C chains of gamma-GYs consist of alternating single and triple C-C bonds (polyyne), energetically more stable than the odd-numbered C chains made of continuous C-C double bonds (polycumulene). The calculated electronic structures indicate that gamma-GYs can be either metallic (odd n) or semiconductive (even n) depending on the parity of the number of C chain atoms. The semiconducting gamma-GYs are predicted to have similar to 1.2 eV direct band gaps and 0.1-0.2 effective electron masses independent of the chain length. Thus introducing sp carbon atoms into sp(2)-based graphene provides a novel way to open up band gaps without doping and defects while maintaining small electron masses critical to good transport properties.", "paper_title": "Energetic stability, atomic and electronic structures of extended gamma-graphyne: A density functional study", "paper_id": "WOS:000355953200008"}
