To minimize the crosstalk effect, a technique for permuting wire is used which contains the following steps. First, product terms are partitioned into long and short sets, and then the product terms in the long and short sets are interleaved. After that, we take advantage of the crosstalk immunity of product terms in the long set to further reduce the maximum coupling capacitance of the PLA. Finally, synthesis techniques such as local and global transformations are taken into consideration to search for a better result. The experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively minimize the maximum coupling capacitance of a circuit by 51% as compared with the original area-minimized PLA without crosstalk effect minimization.", "paper_title": "Crosstalk minimization in logic synthesis for PLAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000243147500005"}
