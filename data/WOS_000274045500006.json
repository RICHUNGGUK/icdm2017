This study proposed a recommendation framework containing two reasoning mechanisms: experience-based and capability-based reasoning, to provide a personalized IT certification path suggestion. The experienced-based reasoning provides personalized suggestions based on the sophisticated examinees experiences, while the capability-based reasoning considers the learner's background only. Both reasoning mechanisms arc, developed based on case-based reasoning (CBR). A scenario is presented to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed framework. The proposed framework can be integrated with e-Learning systems and provide the beneficial certification path to examinees.", "paper_title": "Personalized Recommendation for IT Certification Test in e-Learning Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000274045500006"}
