In our method, objects are decomposed into different geometric parts whose spatial arrangement is represented by a graph. The matching and searching of graphs representing the objects is sped up by using a hash table which contains possible spatial configurations of the different parts that constitute the objects. Additive feature descriptors are used to label partially or completely visible object parts. In this work we categorize objects into five geometric shapes: sphere, box, flat, cylindrical, and disk/plate, as these shapes represent the majority of objects found on tables in typical households. Moreover, we reconstruct complete 3D models that include the invisible back-sides of objects as well, in order to facilitate manipulation by domestic service robots. Finally, we present an extensive set of experiments on point clouds of objects using an RGBD camera, and our results highlight the improvements over previous methods.", "paper_title": "Part-Based Geometric Categorization and Object Reconstruction in Cluttered Table-Top Scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000342212600004"}
