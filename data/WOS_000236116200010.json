Five of these heuristics become epsilon-approximation algorithms when their parameters are appropriately set. The performance of our new heuristics is compared experimentally with that of two recently proposed heuristics for the same problem.", "paper_title": "Approximation algorithms for multiconstrained quality-of-service routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000236116200010"}
