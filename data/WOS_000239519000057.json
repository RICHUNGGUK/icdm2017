We present some of the work of the AGRIP project - an effort to develop techniques to render modern first-person shooter games accessible to the blind and vision- impaired. We discuss some of the low-level accessibility infrastructure employed in the game AudioQuake and compare it to other contemporary research. The project's ultimate goals of generalisation and use of the technology in educational settings are also introduced.", "paper_title": "Making the mainstream accessible: What's in a game?", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000057"}
