We describe an algorithm to construct optimal ate pairings on all parametrized families of pairing friendly elliptic curves. Finally, we conjecture that any nondegenerate pairing on an elliptic curve without efficiently computable endomorphisms different from powers of Frobenius requires at least log(2) r/phi(k) basic Miller iterations.", "paper_title": "Optimal Pairings", "paper_id": "WOS:000273134100033"}
