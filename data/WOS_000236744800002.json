This information takes different forms, such as mail messages, software releases, version control logs, defect reports, etc. softChange is a tool that retrieves this information, analyses and enhances it by finding new relationships amongst it, and then allows users to navigate and visualize this information. The main objective of softChange it to help programmers, their management and software evolution researchers in understanding how a software product has evolved since its conception.", "paper_title": "Visualizing the evolution of software using softchange", "paper_id": "WOS:000236744800002"}
