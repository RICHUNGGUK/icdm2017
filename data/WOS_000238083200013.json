As too many news sources provide independent news information and each has its own preference, detecting unbiased important news might be very useful for users to keep up to date with what are happening in the world. In this paper we present a novel method to identify important news in web environment which consists of diversified online news sites. We observe that a piece of important news generally occupies visually significant place in some homepage of a news site and import news event will be reported by many news sites. To explore these two properties, we model the relationship between homepages, news and latent events by a tripartite graph, and present an algorithm to identify important news in this model. Based on this algorithm, we implement a system TOPSTORY to dynamically generate homepages for users to browse important news reports. Our experimental study indicates the effectiveness of proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Ranking web news via homepage visual layout and cross-site voting", "paper_id": "WOS:000238083200013"}
