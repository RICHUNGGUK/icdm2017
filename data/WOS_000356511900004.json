We propose to use a single body-worn wireless inertial node placed on the chest of a patient. The experimental investigation is carried out considering 24 PD patients, comparing the obtained results directly with the kinematic characterization of the leg agility (LA) task performed by the same set of patients. We show that i) the S2S and LA tasks are rather unrelated and ii) the UPDRS distributions (for both S2S and LA tasks) across the patients have a direct impact on the observed system performance.", "paper_title": "Automatic UPDRS Evaluation in the Sit-to-Stand Task of Parkinsonians: Kinematic Analysis and Comparative Outlook on the Leg Agility Task", "paper_id": "WOS:000356511900004"}
