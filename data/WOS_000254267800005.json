ORGAN aims to enhance and ease log analysis by using semantic knowledge. It is able to offer typical statistical analysis of Web usage logs taking into consideration at the same time site's underlying semantics. We evaluated ORGAN using Web site data for different cases to verify and exhibit its promising behavior. The experimental outcomes were encouraging and valuable conclusions for the Web site usage under analysis were reached. Consequently, we believe and show paradigms that ORGAN could become a useful tool for Web log analysts and assist the Web site managers in the decision-making for reorganization tasks. Finally, we discuss open problems to motivate further research efforts towards the incorporation of semantic Web technologies into Web site log mining analysis.", "paper_title": "An integrated technique for web site usage semantic analysis: The organ system", "paper_id": "WOS:000254267800005"}
