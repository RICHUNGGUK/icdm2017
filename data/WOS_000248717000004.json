The composite subdivision scheme generalizes 4-direction box spline surfaces for processing irregular quadrilateral meshes and is realized through various atomic operators. Several well-known subdivisions based on root 2 splitting operator and based on 1-4 splitting operator for quadrilateral meshes are properly included in the newly proposed unified scheme. Typical examples include the midedge and 4-8 subdivisions based on the root 2 splitting operator that are now special cases of the unified scheme as the simplest dual and primal subdivisions, respectively. Variants of Catmull-Clark and Doo-Sabin subdivisions based on the 1-4 splitting operator also fall in the proposed unified framework. Furthermore, unified subdivisions as extension of tensor-product B-spline surfaces also become a subset of the proposed unified subdivision scheme. In addition, Kobbelt interpolatory subdivision can also be included into the unified framework using VV-type (vertex to vertex type) averaging operators. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
