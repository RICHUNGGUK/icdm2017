This paper presents an improvement on and upon the local view FF model by simulating pedestrian flow in more complex scenarios with typical goals and obstacles that may block or assist the sight of the pedestrian. In addition this model will also provide a detailed analysis entailing the simulation of multi-goal selections. This involves the visibility information on each cell being set, and a dynamic priority list of goals for every pedestrian being updated as he/she moves. The pedestrians select the convenient goal according to the priority of goals, the distances to the candidate goals and the degree of congestion. To aid in the theory of this and to make a better understanding of reality, a simulation scenario is conducted on a virtual MTR station, where parameter settings are discussed and some regular phenomena helpful to the designers of stations is put forward.", "paper_title": "OUT FLOW IN A VIRTUAL MTR STATION USING A LOCAL VIEW FLOOR FIELD MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000318526700005"}
