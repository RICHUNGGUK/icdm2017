The algorithm functions by building upon any serial Voronoi tessellation algorithm. The output of such a serial tessellator is used to determine the connectivity of the distributed domains without any assumptions about how points are distributed across those domains, and then in turn to build the portion of the global tessellation local to each domain using information from that domains neighbors. The result is a generalized methodology for adding distributed capabilities to serial tessellation packages. Results from several two-dimensional tests are presented, including strong and weak scaling of its current implementation. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
