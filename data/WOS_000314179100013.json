Evaluation of quantitative issues like performance and dependability of these systems is of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose a generalized methodology to formally reason about probabilistic systems within a theorem prover. We present a formalization of measure theory in the HOL theorem prover and use it to formalize basic concepts from the theory of probability. We also use the Lebesgue integration to formalize statistical properties of random variables. To illustrate the practical effectiveness of our methodology, we formally prove classical results from the theories of probability and information and use them in a data compression application in HOL.", "paper_title": "Formalization of Measure Theory and Lebesgue Integration for Probabilistic Analysis in HOL", "paper_id": "WOS:000314179100013"}
