To collect color emotion data, 20 subjects are required to report their emotion responses, using a valence-arousal emotion model, to 52 color samples that are chosen from CIELAB Lch color spaces. Qualitative analysis, including analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson's correlation and Spearman's rank correlation, shows that significant differences exist between responses to achromatic and chromatic stimuli, but there are no significant differences between chromatic samples. There is a positive linear relationship between lightness/chroma and valence-arousal dimensions. Subsequently, several classic predictors are used to quantitatively predict emotion induced by color attributes. Furthermore, several explicit color emotion models are developed by using multiple linear regression with stepwise and pace regression. Experimental results show that chroma and lightness have stronger effects on emotions than hue, which is consistent with our qualitative results and other psychological studies. Arousal has greater predictive value than valence.", "paper_title": "A qualitative and quantitative study of color emotion using valence-arousal", "paper_id": "WOS:000307266300012"}
