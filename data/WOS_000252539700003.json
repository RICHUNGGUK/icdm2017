Every expert has his own formalisms and tools leading to a high heterogeneity of information systems supporting design activities. Interoperability became a major challenge to avoid information incompatibility along the product life cycle. To synchronise heterogeneous representations of product will be a major step to integrate expert activities. In this paper, the authors propose a meta-model framework to connect together heterogeneous design models. This meta-model framework is used to formalise possible interactions between heterogeneous representations. Interaction formalisation is considered as a key point to synchronise heterogeneous models and to provide more interoperability between various computer assisted systems. The synchronisation loop is also presented as a major sequence of activities to manage collaborative design. Tools to support synchronisation are proposed. However, through a basic case study, authors highlight what can be automated and where human intervention is still expected.", "paper_title": "A generic architecture to synchronise design models issued from heterogeneous business tools: towards more interoperability between design expertises", "paper_id": "WOS:000252539700003"}
