This rate region is achieved by a simple architecture that separates the analog and digital aspects of the compression. Furthermore, this architecture requires higher rates to send a Gaussian source than it does to send any other source with the same covariance. Our techniques can also be used to determine the sum-rate of some generalizations of this classical problem. Our approach involves coupling the problem to a quadratic Gaussian \"CEO problem.\"", "paper_title": "Rate region of the quadratic Gaussian two-encoder source-coding problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000255505700006"}
