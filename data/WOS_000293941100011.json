A criterion for adaptive filtering is proposed with algorithm provided. A new buffer domain technique based on adaptive filtering is developed and demonstrated for flow past a stationary cylinder for different Reynolds numbers. This technique also allows calculations in a reduced domain, showing another use of adaptive filtering. Rotary oscillation of a circular cylinder at different forcing parameters show excellent match with results in the literature, demonstrating potential benefits of adaptive filtering.
