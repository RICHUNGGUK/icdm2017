The main result is that the class of models of a generalized geometric theory is set-generated. Here, a class chi of subsets of a set is set-generated if there exists a subset G of chi such that for each alpha is an element of chi, and finitely enumerable subset tau of alpha there exists a subset beta is an element of G such that tau subset of beta subset of alpha. We show the main result in the constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (CZF) with an additional axiom, called the set generation axiom which is derivable in CZF, both from the relativized dependent choice scheme and from a regular extension axiom. We give some applications of the main result to algebra, topology and formal topology.", "paper_title": "Generalized geometric theories and set-generated classes", "paper_id": "WOS:000360469600002"}
