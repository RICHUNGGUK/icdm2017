Several approaches to building an index on queries rather than data records, called a query index, have been proposed to evaluate continuous queries over streaming data. EPCglobal proposed an Event Cycle Specification (ECSpec) model, which is a de facto standard query interface for RFID applications. Continuous queries based on ECSpec consist of a large number of segments that represent the query conditions. The problem when using any of the existing query indexes on these continuous queries is that it takes a long time to build the index, because it is necessary to insert a large number of segments into the index. To solve this problem, we propose a transform method that converts a group of segments into compressed data. We also propose an efficient query index scheme for the transformed space. Comparing with existing query indexes, the performance of proposed index outperforms the others on various datasets.", "paper_title": "A query index for continuous queries on RFID streaming data", "paper_id": "WOS:000260770400010"}
