First, some properties of the model with some graphs of the density and hazard function are discussed. Next, the identifiability property of the MTIWD is proved. In addition, the estimates of the unknown parameters via the EM Algorithm are obtained. The performance of the findings in the paper is showed by demonstrating some numerical illustrations through Monte Carlo simulations. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
