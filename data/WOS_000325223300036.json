However, the correlations among prediction-errors are not considered and utilized in current PEE based methods. Specifically, in PEE, the prediction-errors are modified individually in data embedding. In this paper, to better exploit these correlations, instead of utilizing prediction-errors individually, we propose to consider every two adjacent prediction-errors jointly to generate a sequence consisting of prediction-error pairs. Then, based on the sequence and the resulting 2D prediction-error histogram, a more efficient embedding strategy, namely, pairwise PEE, can be designed to achieve an improved performance. The superiority of our method is verified through extensive experiments.", "paper_title": "Pairwise Prediction-Error Expansion for Efficient Reversible Data Hiding", "paper_id": "WOS:000325223300036"}
