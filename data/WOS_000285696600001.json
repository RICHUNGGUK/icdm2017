It is well known from the literature that a crucial point that hampers the development and wide adoption of mediation systems lies in the high entry and maintenance costs of such systems. To overcome these barriers, the FORUM project investigates three main research issues: (i) automatic discovery of semantic correspondences (ii) consistency maintenance of mappings, and (iii) tolerant rewriting of queries in the presence of approximate mappings.", "paper_title": "FORUM: A Flexible Data Integration System Based on Data Semantics", "paper_id": "WOS:000285696600001"}
