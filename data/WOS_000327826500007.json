We use the channel learning scheme to estimate the channel information from cognitive radio transmitter (CR-TX) to PR and then make beamforming to transmit signal. Considering the interference from CR-TX to PR caused by the imperfect channel learning, we intend to maximize CR throughput under the interference power constraint at PR and CR transmit power constraint. A nearly optimal subcarrier and power allocation algorithm with linear complexity is proposed. The proposed algorithm is global optimal when the maximum transmit power is beyond certain threshold. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has a good performance very close to the global optimal algorithm.", "paper_title": "Resource allocation for MIMO-OFDMA downlink based cognitive radio systems with imperfect channel learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000327826500007"}
