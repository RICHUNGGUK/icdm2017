The image is filtered and converted into a binary image first. Then the contour of touching grain kernels is extracted and divided into contour segments (CS) with the concave points on it. The next step is to merge the contour segments, which is the main contribution of this work. The distance measurement (DM) and deviation error measurement (DEM) are proposed to test whether the contour segments pertain to the same kernel or not. If they pass the measurement and judgment, they are merged as a new segment. Finally with these newly merged contour segments, the ellipses are fitted as the representative ellipses for touching kernels. To verify the proposed algorithm, six different kinds of Korean grains were tested. Experimental results showed that the proposed method is efficient and accurate for the separation of the touching grain kernels.", "paper_title": "New separation algorithm for touching grain kernels based on contour segments and ellipse fitting", "paper_id": "WOS:000286548900006"}
