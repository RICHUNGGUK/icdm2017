The problem is known to be -complete even when all gene clusters are of size two and the corresponding problem () admits efficient constant-factor approximation algorithms. In this paper, for the first time, we consider the more general case when the gene clusters can have size either two or three (). Let be a parameterized version of where the parameter is the size of solution. We present a linear kernel for of size that when combined with a bounded search-tree algorithm, gives an FPT algorithm running in time. For we present a bounded search tree algorithm which runs in time, greatly improving the previous bound using weak kernels.", "paper_title": "Radiation hybrid map construction problem parameterized", "paper_id": "WOS:000330209400002"}
