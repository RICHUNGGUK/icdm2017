In 1996 Fan and Kierstead proved the path version of Posa's Conjecture. They also proved that it would suffice to show that G contains the square of a cycle of length greater than 2/3 n. Still in 1996, Komlos, Sarkozy, and Szemeredi proved Posa's Conjecture, using the Regularity and Blow-up Lemmas, for graphs of order n >= n(0), where n(0) is a very large constant. Here we show without using these lemmas that n(0) := 2 x 10(8) is sufficient. We are motivated by the recent work of Levitt, Sarkozy and Szemeredi, but our methods are based on techniques that were available in the 90's. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
