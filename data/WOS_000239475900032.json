Using recent results about solutions to recursive domain equations in parametric models of PILLY, we show how to interpret FPC in these. Of particular interest is a model based on \"admissible\" pers over a reflexive domain, the theory of which can be seen as a domain theory for (impredicative) polymorphism. We show how this model gives rise to a parametric and computationally adequate model of PolyFPC, an extension of FPC with impredicative polymorphism. This is the first model of a language with parametric polymorphism, recursive terms and recursive types in a non-linear setting.", "paper_title": "Interpreting polymorphic FPC into domain theoretic models of parametric polymorphism", "paper_id": "WOS:000239475900032"}
