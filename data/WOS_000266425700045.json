Both temporal and energy costs are measured and compared with the basic functional costs of a device. We demonstrate that cryptographic power costs are not a limiting factor of the autonomy of a device and explain how processing delays can be conveniently managed to minimize their impact.", "paper_title": "Cryptographic Energy Costs Are Assumable in Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000266425700045"}
