The approach of mapping packet deadline to a velocity is adopted as that in SPEED; however, our routing decision is made based on the novel two-hop velocity integrated with energy balancing mechanism. Initiative drop control is embedded to enhance energy utilization efficiency, while reducing packet deadline miss ratio. Simulation and comparison show that the new protocol has led to lower packet deadline miss ratio and higher energy efficiency than two existing popular schemes. The result has also indicated a promising direction in supporting real-time quality-of-service for wireless sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Enhancing Real-Time Delivery in Wireless Sensor Networks With Two-Hop Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000265936100005"}
