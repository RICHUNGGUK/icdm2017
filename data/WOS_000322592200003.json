In this article we present a much more transparent proof. We first give a new proof of the classical theorem from which we then can derive the computable version easily. As in [Lu and Weihrauch(2007)] we use the framework of TTE, the representation approach for computable analysis, which allows to define natural concepts of computability for the operators under consideration.", "paper_title": "The Riesz Representation Operator on the Dual of C[0;1] is Computable", "paper_id": "WOS:000322592200003"}
