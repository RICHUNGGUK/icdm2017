They adopt different modeling and measurement techniques. In this article, we aim to review a wide range of such energy profilers for mobile devices. First, we introduce the terminologies and describe the power modeling and measurement methodologies applied in model-based energy profiling. Next, we classify the profilers according to their implementation and deployment strategies, and compare the profiling capabilities and performance between different types. Finally, we point out their limitations and the corresponding challenges.", "paper_title": "Modeling, Profiling, and Debugging the Energy Consumption of Mobile Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000373852800007"}
