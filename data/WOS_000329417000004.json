It presents an overview of the research being currently performed in the scope of the European project ASAM of the ARTEMIS program. The paper briefly presents the results of our analysis of the main challenges to be faced in the design of such heterogeneous MPSoCs. It explains which system, design, and electronic design automation (EDA) concepts seem to be adequate to address the challenges and solve the problems. Finally, it discusses the ASAM design-flow, its main stages and tools and their application to a real-life case study. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
