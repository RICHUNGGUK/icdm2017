Such a problem exists when a high-resolution image or video is to be displayed on low-resolution display terminals. Limited by the low-resolution display, we have to shrink the image. Signal-processing theory tells us that optimal decimation requires low-pass filtering with a suitable cutoff frequency, followed by downsampling. In doing so, we need to remove many useful image details causing blurring. Subpixel-based downsampling, taking advantage of the fact that each pixel on a color LCD is actually composed of individual red, green, and blue subpixel stripes, can provide apparent higher resolution. In this paper, we use frequency-domain analysis to explain what happens in subpixel-based downsampling and why it is possible to achieve a higher apparent resolution. According to our frequency-domain analysis and observation, the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter for subpixel-based decimation can be effectively extended beyond the Nyquist frequency using a novel antialiasing filter. Applying the proposed filters to two existing subpixel downsampling schemes called direct subpixel-based downsampling (DSD) and diagonal DSD (DDSD), we obtain two improved schemes, i.e., DSD based on frequency-domain analysis (DSD-FA) and DDSD based on frequency-domain analysis (DDSD-FA). Experimental results verify that the proposed DSD-FA and DDSD-FA can provide superior results, compared with existing subpixel or pixel-based downsampling methods.", "paper_title": "Antialiasing Filter Design for Subpixel Downsampling via Frequency-Domain Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000300510800039"}
