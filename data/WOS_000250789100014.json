A BbNN consists of a 2-D array of modular component NNs with flexible structures and internal configurations that can be implemented using reconfigurable digital hardware such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Signal flow between the blocks determines the internal configuration of a block as well as the overall structure of the BbNN. Network structure and the weights are optimized using local gradient-based search and evolutionary operators with the rates changing adaptively according to their effectiveness in the previous evolution period. Such adaptive operator rate update scheme ensures higher fitness on average compared to predetermined fixed operator rates. The Hermite transform coefficients and the time interval between two neighboring R-peaks of ECG signals are used as inputs to the BbNN. A BbNN optimized with the proposed evolutionary algorithm (EA) makes a personalized heartbeat pattern classifier that copes with changing operating environments caused by individual difference and time-varying characteristics of ECG signals. Simulation results using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Bet Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmia database demonstrate high average detection accuracies of ventricular ectopic beats (98.1 %) and supraventricular ectopic beats (96.6%) patterns for heartbeat monitoring, being a significant improvement over previously reported electrocardiogram (ECG) classification results.", "paper_title": "Block-based neural networks for personalized ECG signal classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000250789100014"}
