The online input data is also converted into an offline image, and parallely recognized by both online and offline strategies. Features are proposed for offline recognition and a disambiguation step is employed in the offline system for the samples for which the confidence level of the classifier is low. The outputs are then combined probabilistically resulting in a classifier out-performing both individual systems. Experiments are performed for Kannada, a South Indian Language, over a database of 295 classes. The accuracy of the online recognizer improves by 11% when the combination with offline system is used.", "paper_title": "Fusion of Complementary Online and Offline Strategies for Recognition of Handwritten Kannada Characters", "paper_id": "WOS:000289721400007"}
