It calculates the underlying Feynman rules and outputs them to a form appropriate for various programs such as CALCHEP, FEYNARTS, MADGRAPH, SHERPA and WHIZARD. Since the original version, many new features have been added: support for two-component fermions, spin-3/2 and spin-2 fields, superspace notation and calculations, automatic mass diagonalization, completely general FEYNARTS output, a new universal FEYNRULES output interface, a new WHIZARD interface, automatic 1 --> 2 decay width calculation, improved speed and efficiency, new guidelines for validation and a new webbased validation package. With this feature set, FEYNRULES enables models to go from theory to simulation and comparison with experiment quickly, efficiently and accurately.

Computer: Platforms on which Mathematica is available. Operating system: Operating systems on which Mathematica is available. Classification: 11.1, 11.6. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEDI_v1_1 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 182 (2011) 2404 Nature of problem: The program computes the Feynman rules of any quantum field theory, expressed in four-dimensional space-time, directly from the Lagrangian of the model. Various interfaces to Feynman diagram calculators are included that allow the exportation of the interaction vertices in a format readable by different Monte Carlo event generators or symbolic calculation tools. Solution method: FeynRules works in three steps: 1. If necessary, the model Lagrangian is written in terms of four-component fermions and the usual fields of particle physics, instead of Weyl fermions or superfields. 2. Derivation of the Feynman rules directly form the Lagrangian using canonical commutation relations among fields and creation operators. 3. Implementation of the new physics model into FeynArts as well as into various Monte Carlo programs via dedicated interfaces. Reasons for new version: Bug fixes. Summary of revisions: cleaning of unnecessary files bug related to epsilon tensors bug with multiple interaction order fixed bug when we have one mass parameter for several particles in the UFO Restrictions: Mathematica version 7.0 or higher. The Lagrangian must fulfill basic quantum field theory requirements, such as locality and Lorentz and gauge invariance. Fields with spin 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2 and 2 are supported. Unusual features: Translation interfaces to various Feynman diagram generators exist. Superfields are also supported and can be expanded in terms of their component fields, which allows the performance of various sets of superspace computations. Running time: The computation of the Feynman rules from a Lagrangian varies with the complexity of the model, and runs from a few seconds to several minutes.
