We deal with curve subdivision in the presence of obstacles, in surfaces, in Riemannian manifolds, and in the Euclidean motion group. We show how to model kinematic surfaces and motions in the presence of obstacles via subdivision. As to numerics, we consider the sensitivity of the limit's smoothness to sloppy computing.", "paper_title": "Intrinsic subdivision with smooth limits for graphics and animation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238447200009"}
