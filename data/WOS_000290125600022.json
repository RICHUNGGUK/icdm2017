The proposed technique is based on a simple charge distribution and partial charge transfer which is applicable to various integrator topologies. An implementation example on an existing integrator topology and a design example of a 2nd-order SC low-pass filter are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique. A design example of an SC filter show that the filter designed using the proposed technique has an approximately 23% less total capacitance than the one of SC low-pass filter with conventional capacitance spread reduction technique.", "paper_title": "Capacitance Reduction Technique for Switched-Capacitor Circuits Based on Charge Distribution and Partial Charge Transfer", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125600022"}
