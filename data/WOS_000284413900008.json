Two different states have to be taken into account: when the clutch is locked and when the clutch is slipping. Moreover the clutch has often to be controlled automatically in parallel hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). An energetic macroscopic representation (EMR) of a clutch system has been developed. Both clutch states are genuinely taken into account in a physical way. In this article, EMR leads to organise the control scheme of the clutch system using an inversion methodology. An experimental validation is provided on a conventional vehicle before being implemented on parallel HEVs. Experimental results are provided to validate the clutch model and the inversion-based control.", "paper_title": "Inversion-based control of a vehicle with a clutch using a switched causal modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000284413900008"}
