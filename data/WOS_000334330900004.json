We describe a case study of using a task-parallel Message Passing Interface version of AutoDock4 to run a virtual high-throughput screen of one million compounds on the Jaguar Cray XK6 Supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We include a description of scripts developed to increase the efficiency of the predocking file preparation and postdocking analysis. A detailed tutorial, scripts, and source code for this Message Passing Interface version of AutoDock4 are available online at .
