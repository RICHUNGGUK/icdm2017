Data centers with high performance are the key to realize real-time services for worldwide users. For the users travelling in global, data mobility between cloud data centers is essential to offer quality-ensured cloud services. However, existing transmission protocols such as TCP, do not support high speed and high throughput transmission on long-distance networks. Legacy TCP lacks of the ability to efficiently transport data between distant data centers. In this paper, an adaptive Fast TCP is proposed to move data faster between data centers of cloud services. The proposed approach adapts the operational parameter of Fast TCP connections to improve the throughput and the rapidness of TCP connections. Numeric results show that the throughput is improved by 2.5 times and the rapid response of flow control eliminates packet loss. The better data mobility contributes the service quality of travelling users in clouds.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Approach to High-Throughput Inter-Cloud Data Transmission Based on Fast TCP", "paper_id": "WOS:000312045300012"}
