While being able to produce convincing results, however Reinhard et al.'s pioneering work has two problems-mixing up of colors in different regions and the fidelity, problem. Many local color transfer algorithms have been proposed to resolve the first problem, but the second problem was paid few attentions. In this paper, a novel color transfer algorithm is presented to resolve the fidelity, problem of color transfer in terms of scene details and colors. It's well known that human visual system is in ore sensitive to local intensity, differences than to intensity itself. We thus consider that preserving the color gradient is necessary for scene fidelity We formulate the color transfer problem as an optimization problem and solve it in two steps-histogram matching and a gradient-preserving optimization. Following the idea of the fidelity, in terms of color and gradient, we also propose a metric for objectively evaluating the performance of example-based color transfer algorithms. The experimental results show the validity and high fidelity of our algorithm and that it can be used to deal with local color transfer.", "paper_title": "Gradient-Preserving Color Transfer", "paper_id": "WOS:000270778100017"}
