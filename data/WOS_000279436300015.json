After introducing various mathematical structures in terms of systems of nonlinear integro-differential equations with quadratic type nonlinearities and variable number of equations, the relative qualitative analysis of the initial value problem is presented. Finally, the paper deals with the derivation of macroscopic equations based on the underlying description at the microscopic scale delivered by the kinetic theory models. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
