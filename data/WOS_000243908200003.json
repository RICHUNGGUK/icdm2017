A cloth draping method is incorporated in a silhouette based motion capture system. This leads to a simultaneous estimation of pose, joint angles, cloth draping parameters and wind forces. An error functional is formalized to minimize the involved parameters simultaneously. This allows for reconstruction of the underlying kinematic structure, even though it is covered with fabrics. Finally, a quantitative error analysis is performed. Pose results are compared with results obtained from a commercially available marker based tracking system. The deviations have a magnitude of three degrees which indicates a reasonably stable approach.", "paper_title": "A system for articulated tracking incorporating a clothing model", "paper_id": "WOS:000243908200003"}
