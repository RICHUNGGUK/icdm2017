The challenging aspect of the approach proposed in this work relies in the quality evaluation of virtual prototypes of new industrial products (i.e. concept designs) by adopting a statistical procedure previously applied to service industries. Following this approach.. the optimal concept design is defined at the end of a process consisting of five phases: identification of the quality elements of the concept design, classification of the quality elements, generation and quality evaluation of product concepts and, finally, definition of the optimal concept. Currently, virtual reality (VR) environment offers the opportunity to evaluate the characteristics of different virtual prototypes by involving experts and/or customers, overcoming the need for several physical prototypes. On the other side, the dynamics of simulation and the stereoscopic visualization in VR environment provides a more realistic and impressive interaction with virtual prototypes than in CAD environment. The proposed methodology is fully exploited through two case studies: the choice of the optimal design for a traditional Neapolitan coffee maker, addressed by the Italian designer Riccardo Dalisi, and for a subassembly of a new minicar.
