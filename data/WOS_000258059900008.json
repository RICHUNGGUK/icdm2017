From this model, the equations of the rotational angle and the deformation are deduced, the general matrix and procedure are developed. The correlation between the roller forces and axis deflections of no. 2 rotary kiln is derived. To improve kiln performance by kiln axis alignment, taking roller forces equilibrium and relative axis deflection minimum as the optimization goal, considering the fuzzy constraints of axis alignment, the fuzzy optimization model of kiln axis alignment is set up. The optimization model is solved with the max-min approach. The results show that fuzzy optimization alignment of rotary kiln can make kiln axis as straight as possible and can distribute kiln loads equally.", "paper_title": "General solution to kiln support reactions and multi-objective fuzzy optimization of kiln axis alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000258059900008"}
