The abrupt change is located at the midsection of the beam of finite length. Two analytical approaches are implemented. In the first one, the response is obtained by finite integral transformations incorporating global modes of vibration, while in the second the analytical responses of each half of the beam are linked by continuity conditions. The values obtained are used to study the influence of the abrupt change on the critical velocities. The analyses carried out enable to reach results and draw conclusions directly related to the knowledge of ground vibrations induced by high-speed trains. (C) 2008 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.
