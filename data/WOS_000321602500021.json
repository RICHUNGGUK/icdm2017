The two-dimensional size distribution of the complexes composed by different numbers of positively or negatively charged polyelectrolytes is calculated based on the scaling model of block copolymer aggregation and Poisson-Boltzmann theory for electrostatic interactions [V.A. Baulin, E. Trizac, Self-assembly of spherical inter-polyelectrolyte complexes from oppositely charged polymers, Soft Matter 8 (25) (2012) 6755-6766]. Salt effects, charge distribution and distributions of labile cations and anions around the complexes are calculated numerically as a function of chain composition and solvent properties.
