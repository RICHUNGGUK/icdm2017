Low cost installation, flexibility and no fixed infrastructures have made it possible home environments rapidly to adopt this technology. In this paper we introduce the use of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) for large in-home environments, such as hospitals, government buildings, office and industrial buildings, etc. Thus, we define an information gathering mechanism in order to provide a context aware QoS framework, relaxing some restrictions that are inherited from traditional ad-hoc networks scenarios ( battlefield, catastrophic disaster, etc.) to better fit the specific characteristics of this new application field. In particular, we propose an adaptive QoS architecture oriented to provide context-aware quality of service to the traffic generated in a smart-building network.", "paper_title": "Context-aware QoS provision for mobile ad-hoc network-based ambient intelligent environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000237295500007"}
