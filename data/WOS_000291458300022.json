Successful manufacturing of ultra-precision micro-structured freeform surface not only relies on the high precision of machine tools, but also largely depends on comprehensive consideration of advanced optics design, modelling and optimization of the machining process, freeform surface measurement and characterization. This paper presents the theoretical basis for the establishment of an integrated platform for design, fabrication, and measurement of ultra-precision micro-structured freeform surfaces. The platform mainly consists of four key modules, which are Optics Design Module, Data Exchange Module, Machining Process Simulation and Optimization Module and Freeform Measurement and Evaluation Module. A series of experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the platform and its capability is realized through a trial implementation in design, fabricating and measurement of a microlens array. The results predicted by the system are found to agree well with the experimental results. These show that the proposed integrated platform not only helps to shorten the cycle time for the development of microlens array components but also provides an important means for optimization of the surface quality in ultra-precision machining of micro-structured surfaces. With this successful development of the system, optimal machining parameters, the best cutting strategy, and optimization of the surface quality of the ultra-precision freeform surfaces can be obtained without the need for conducting time-consuming and expensive cutting tests.
