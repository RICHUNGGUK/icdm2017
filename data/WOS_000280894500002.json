These changes lead to some difficulties in object lookup and object update. We present a system called stable content distribution network (SCDN) to form a stable double-layer structure based on peers' demands. In this structure, (1) the efficiency of object lookup can be improved even under frequent arrival and departure of participant peers by using the long-distance connections provided by object update, (2) all contents and their replicas can keep consistency after object update by forming a hierarchy structure, while the stability of the network can be monitored and fixed during object update. We use both theoretical and experimental analysis and compare SCDN with other P2P networks. Results show that SCDN is efficient in object lookup and object update, and can provide consistency and robustness. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
