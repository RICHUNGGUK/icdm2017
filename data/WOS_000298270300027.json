In this paper the code is applied to ten different test cases specific to hydraulic problems encountered in the fluvial environment, with the purpose of proving the capability of XBeach in rivers. Results show that the performance of XBeach is acceptable, comparing well to other commercially available codes specifically developed for fluvial modelling. Some advantages and deficiencies of the codes are identified and recommendations for adaptation into the fluvial environment are made. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
