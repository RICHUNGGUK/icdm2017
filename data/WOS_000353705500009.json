Using the method of stochastic Lyapunov functionals construction, it is shown that impulses can stabilise the original impulse-free unstable systems. Moreover, the stability property of the impulse-free systems can be retained in the cases of appropriately large impulsive time interval. Some numerical examples are exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Robust stochastic stability of uncertain discrete-time impulsive Markovian jump delay systems with multiplicative noises", "paper_id": "WOS:000353705500009"}
