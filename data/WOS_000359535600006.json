Its recently solved, highly divergent crystallographic structures in complex either with nucleotides (full or partial agonist) or with a nonnucleotide antagonist raise the question of which structure is more useful to understand ligand recognition. Therefore, we performed extensive molecular modeling studies based on these structures and mutagenesis, to predict the binding modes of major classes of P2Y(12)R ligands previously reported. Various nucleotide derivatives docked readily to the agonist-bound P2Y(12)R, but uncharged nucleotide-like antagonist ticagrelor required a hybrid receptor resembling the agonist-bound P2Y(12)R except for the top portion of TM6. Supervised molecular dynamics (SuMD) of ticagrelor binding indicated interactions with the extracellular regions of P2Y(12)R, defining possible meta-binding sites. Ureas, sulfonylureas, sulfonamides, anthraquinones and glutamic acid piperazines docked readily to the antagonist-bound P2Y(12)R. Docking dinucleotides at both agonist- and antagonist-bound structures suggested interactions with two P2Y(12)R pockets. Thus, our structure-based approach consistently rationalized the main structure-activity relationships within each ligand class, giving useful information for designing improved ligands.", "paper_title": "Modeling ligand recognition at the P2Y(12) receptor in light of X-ray structural information", "paper_id": "WOS:000359535600006"}
