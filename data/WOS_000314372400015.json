The system of partial differential equations that follows by using the mass and momentum conservation principles is hyperbolic and characterized by a nonconservative nature. This feature, as well as the highly nonlinear relationship between the conserved and the primitive variables, is particularly challenging in the framework of finite-volume, explicit Godunov-type numerical approaches. This paper presents our effort to enhance the capabilities of the TRENT2D model (acronym for Transport in Rapidly Evolutive, Natural Torrent, see Armanini et al., Computers and Geosciences, 2009). Firstly, from a mathematical point of view, the eigenstructure of the original system has been analysed in detail in order to obtain useful information for improving the numerical scheme. Moreover, some previously neglected physical mechanisms, leading to a diffusive behavior, have been investigated and a new term has been added in order to account for them. On the other hand, from a numerical point of view, the original Riemann solver (LHLL), which satisfies only the C-property, has been substituted with a more accurate well-balanced Generalized Roe solver and the discretization of the diffusive terms has been introduced in the numerical scheme. The application of the two versions of TRENT2D to a set of test cases, both theoretical and real, allows to appreciate the improvement of the new version of the model. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
