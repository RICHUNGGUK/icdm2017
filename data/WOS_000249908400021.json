We also develop a comprehensive design methodology involving mechanisms of genetic optimization and information granulation. In the sequel, the genetically optimized FPNN (gFPNN) is formed with the use of fuzzy set-based polynomial neurons (FSPNs) composed of fuzzy setbased rules through the process of information granulation. This granulation is realized with the aid of the C-means clustering (C-Means). The design procedure applied in the construction of each layer of an FPNN deals with its structural optimization involving the selection of the most suitable nodes (or FSPNs) with specific local characteristics (such as the number of input variable, the order of the polynomial, the number of membership functions, and a collection of specific subset of input variables) and address main aspects of parametric optimization. Along this line, two general optimization mechanisms are explored. The structural optimization is realized via genetic algorithms (GAs) and HCM method whereas in case of the parametric optimization we proceed with a standard least square estimation (learning). Through the consecutive process of structural and parametric optimization, a flexible neural network is generated in a dynamic fashion. The performance of the designed networks is quantified through experimentation where we use two modeling benchmarks already commonly utilized within the area of fuzzy or neurofuzzy modeling.
