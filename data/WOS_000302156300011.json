However, in such environments, news variety and quantity can have an overwhelming effect. New-event detection and topic-tracking studies address this problem. They examine news streams and organize stories according to their events; however, several tracking stories of an event/topic may contain no new information (i.e., no novelty). We study the novelty detection (ND) problem on the tracking news of a particular topic. For this purpose, we build a Turkish ND test collection called BilNov-2005 and propose the usage of three ND methods: a cosine-similarity (CS)-based method, a language-model (LM)-based method, and a cover-coefficient (CC)-based method. For the LM-based ND method, we show that a simpler smoothing approach, Dirichlet smoothing, can have similar performance to a more complex smoothing approach, Shrinkage smoothing. We introduce a baseline that shows the performance of a system with random novelty decisions. In addition, a category-based threshold learning method is used for the first time in ND literature. The experimental results show that the LM-based ND method significantly outperforms the CS- and CC-based methods, and category-based threshold learning achieves promising results when compared to general threshold learning.", "paper_title": "Novelty Detection for Topic Tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000302156300011"}
