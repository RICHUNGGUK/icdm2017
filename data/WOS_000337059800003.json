For e-Learning with 3D interactive curricular contents, an ideal note-taking approach should be intuitive and tightly coupled with the curricular contents. Particularly, augmented reality (AR) technology is capable of displaying virtual contents in real-life images. Combining head-mounted displays with cameras and wearable computers, AR provides chances and challenges to improve note-taking for situated learning in contextual surroundings. We propose an AR-based note-taking system tailored for 3D curricular contents. A learner can take notes on a physical tabletop by finger writing, manipulate curricular contents using hand gestures and embed the complete notes in the corresponding contents in a 3D space. An analytic hierarchy process demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed 3D note-taking system. Especially, note-taking using finger writing and hand gestures with 3D maneuver is better than other alternatives in terms of relevance, usefulness, intuition and novelty.", "paper_title": "Note-Taking for 3D Curricular Contents using Markerless Augmented Reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000337059800003"}
