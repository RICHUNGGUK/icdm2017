The algorithm sequentially solves a set of sub-problems that result from decomposing the original design problem. A novel efficient heuristic is developed to solve the waveband assignment sub-problem that is the bottleneck among the sub-problems. Numerical experiments prove that, by employing wavelength conversion, hierarchical optical path networks will be more cost effective than the single layer optical path network even in the small traffic demand area, where cost-effectiveness cannot be realized without using wavelength conversion, as well as in the relatively large traffic demand area.
