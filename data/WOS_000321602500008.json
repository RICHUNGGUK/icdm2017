Here we present an extended technique-a variable-cell NEB (VC-NEB) technique combined with the ab initio method, implemented in the USPEX code. Our technique is applied to reconstructive solid-solid phase transitions of GaN: from wurtzite to rocksalt (B4 -> B1) and from zincblende to rocksalt (B3 -> B1). As a more challenging application, we study the mechanism of the recently predicted insulator-metal phase transition of BH. The results reveal that the VC-NEB technique is an efficient and general method and should have wide applications for studying the paths and mechanisms of reconstructive phase transitions. Results of the VC-NEB method can be considered as a starting point for a more sophisticated treatment using the transition path sampling method, the main prerequisite of which is to have an initial transformation trajectory.
