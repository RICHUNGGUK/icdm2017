This algorithm is based on the combination of greedy and limited search strategies. The algorithm provides a required balance between the computational complexity and quality of assignments by limiting the maximum allowed search depth. Theoretical and experimental results of investigating its features are presented.", "paper_title": "Algorithm for resource allocation in data centers with independent schedulers for different types of resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000345847900008"}
