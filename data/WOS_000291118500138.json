Such complex systems are social-technical systems with time-varying boundary and topology due to the dynamic demands in an emergency situation. The emergency management of the Networked Safe Service System thus becomes a very complex problem. In this paper, we present a study aimed at developing a general methodology for emergency response management to Networked Safe Service Systems. The general idea is to view response management as a process and control problem, then to apply system engineering technology into the emergency response situation. Particularly, a framework to integrate various decision bodies is developed. Also the implementation of the framework towards a computer-based human-in-the-loop management system with RFID is outlined. Finally, a case study on emergency evacuation management is presented, which is networked emergency scenario to illustrate how the proposed approach works. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
