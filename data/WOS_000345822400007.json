To address these issues, assuming the availability of quantum computers capable of performing Grover search, we explore their constructive influence on post-quantum cryptography. In particular, we show how a reasonably small quantum computer can assist in generating secure Courtois-Finiasz-Sendrier (CFS) signatures based on Goppa codes. This could be a step towards a practical implementation of full-fledged cryptosystems in a truly post-quantum scenario. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
