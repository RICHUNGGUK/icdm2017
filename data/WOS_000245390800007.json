Since spam evolves continuously and most practical applications are based on online user feedback, the task calls for fast, incremental and robust learning algorithms. In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to spam filtering based on adaptive statistical data compression models. The nature of these models allows them to be employed as probabilistic text classifiers based on character-level or binary sequences. By modeling messages as sequences, tokenization and other error-prone preprocessing steps are omitted altogether, resulting in a method that is very robust. The models are also fast to construct and incrementally updateable. We evaluate the filtering performance of two different compression algorithms; dynamic Markov compression and prediction by partial matching. The results of our empirical evaluation indicate that compression models outperform currently established spam filters, as well as a number of methods proposed in previous studies.", "paper_title": "Spam filtering using statistical data compression models", "paper_id": "WOS:000245390800007"}
