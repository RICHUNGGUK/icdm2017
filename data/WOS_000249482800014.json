The following paper will describe the rationale for segregating policies, user preferences and clinical monitoring rules into \"advanced notification\" and\" clinical\" components, which together form a novel and complex CDSS. Notification rules and hospital policies are respectively abstracted from care-provider roles and alerting mechanisms. User-defined preferences determine which devices are to be used for receiving notifications. Our design differs from previous notification systems because it integrates a versatile notification platform supporting a wide range of mobile devices with a XML/HL-7 compliant communication protocol.
