A level set approach for computing solutions to incompressible twophase flow. J Comput Phys 1994; 114:146-59] on coupling the level set method of [Osher S, Sethian J. Fronts propagating with curvature-dependent speed: algorithms based on Hamilton-Jacobi formulations. J Comput Phys 1988;79:12-49] to the equations for two-phase incompressible flow, there has been a great deal of interest in this area. That work demonstrated the most powerful aspects of the level set method, i.e. automatic handling of topological changes such as merging and pinching, as well as robust geometric information such as normals and curvature. Interestingly, this work also demonstrated the largest weakness of the level set method, i.e. mass or information loss characteristic of most Eulerian capturing techniques. In fact, [Sussman M, Smereka P, Osher S. A level set approach for computing solutions to incompressible two-phase flow. J Comput Phys 1994; 114:146-59] introduced a partial differential equation for battling this weakness, without which their work would not have been possible. In this paper, we discuss both historical and most recent works focused on improving the computational accuracy of the level set method focusing in part on applications related to incompressible flow due to both of its popularity and stringent accuracy requirements. Thus, we discuss higher order accurate numerical methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi WENO [Jiang G-S, Peng D. Weighted ENO schemes for Hamilton-Jacobi equations. SIAM J Sci Comput 2000;21:2126-43], methods for maintaining a signed distance function, hybrid methods such as the particle level set method [Enright D, Fedkiw R, Ferziger J, Mitchell I. A hybrid particle level set method for improved interface capturing. J Comput Phys 2002;183:83-116] and the coupled level set volume of fluid method [Sussman M, Puckett EG. A coupled level set and volume-of-fluid method for computing 3d and axisymmetric incompressible two-phase flows. J Comput Phys 2000;162:301-37], and adaptive gridding techniques such as the octree approach to free surface flows proposed in [Losasso F, Gibou F, Fedkiw R.
