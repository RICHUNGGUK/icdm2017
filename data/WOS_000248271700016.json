The program imports nucleotide or amino acid sequence multiple alignment files in standard formats, and permits users to view two translations of the same multiple alignment simultaneously. Edits in one view are instantaneously reflected in the other, and the scoring cost of the changes are shown in real-time. Progressive multiple alignments, using a variety of alignment parameters, can be performed on any block of sequences, including blocks embedded in the existing alignment.", "paper_title": "SQUINT: a multiple alignment program and editor", "paper_id": "WOS:000248271700016"}
