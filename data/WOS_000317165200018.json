Such formulations include a variety of interesting and realistic models of which two are highlighted: a market-clearing auction typical in electric power markets but suitable in other more general contexts, and a network equilibrium suitable to energy markets as well as other grid-based industries. A mixed-integer, linear program is used to solve the DC-MLCP in which both complementarity as well as integrality are allowed to be relaxed. Theoretical and numerical results are provided to validate the approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
