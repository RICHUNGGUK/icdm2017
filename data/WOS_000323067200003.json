In this model, the first stage aims to find a basis path for the trip over all the scenarios, and the second stage intends to generate the remainder path adaptively when the realizations of random link travel times are updated after a pre-specified time threshold. The GAMS optimization software is introduced to find the optimal solution of the proposed model. The numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "STOCHASTIC SCENARIO-BASED TIME-STAGE OPTIMIZATION MODEL FOR THE LEAST EXPECTED TIME SHORTEST PATH PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000323067200003"}
