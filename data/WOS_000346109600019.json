The performance of previously presented 2-D and 3-D eddy current models will be assessed when the steady-state models are coupled to a dynamic mechanical model. Design/methodology/approach - The previously presented 2-D analytic model was formulated in terms of the magnetic vector potential in conductive region and magnetic scalar potential in non-conductive region whereas the 3-D model was formulated in terms of the magnetic vector potential in both the conductive and non-conductive regions. Findings - This paper experimentally confirms that incorporating the heave velocity term is important for accurately predicting the forces under dynamic mechanical motion while using a steady-state eddy current solution. A close agreement between the experimental and the dynamic analytic-based eddy current solution was achieved. Research limitations/implications - The force results presented from the previously developed 3-D analytic model assume that the width of the guideway is larger than that of the magnetic source and the magnetic source is placed at the center of the guideway along the z-axis. Practical implications - The rotational and translational motion of a permanent magnet rotor above a conductive plate create lift and thrust force that are suitable for magnetic levitated (maglev) transportation. The previously developed 2-D and 3-D analytic models are fundamental to such maglev research as the models can quickly compute the electromagnetic forces acting on the maglev vehicle. This paper is of immense importance as the paper experimentally validates the analytic models. Originality/value - The quasi-static analytic eddy current force models that are validated in this paper are different to analogous models developed by prior authors in that the heave velocity as well as the translational velocity of a magnetic source is incorporated into the eddy current force equation.", "paper_title": "Dynamic electromechanical eddy current force modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000346109600019"}
