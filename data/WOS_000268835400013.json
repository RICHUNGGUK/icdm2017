Design/methodology/approach - This new approach consists to convert the constrained multicriteria problem into an unconstrained global optimization problem. Then, the Alienor method coupled to the optimization preserving operators* (OPO*) technique is used to solve the transformed problem. Findings - A determinist algorithm for solving general MOLP problem contributes to research in the decision-makers area. Research limitations/implications - Some improvements could probably be obtained. In future work, other scalarized functions will be used and this algorithm's complexity will be studied. Practical implications - The new algorithm, can be advantageously compared with other methods To illustrate this new approach, an example is studied. Originality/value - A new algorithm is given which guarantees all efficient solutions are easily obtained in most cases.", "paper_title": "Alienor method to solve multi-objective linear programming (MOLP)", "paper_id": "WOS:000268835400013"}
