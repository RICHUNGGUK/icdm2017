The objective is to obtain the maximum cell size, given a set of services with their corresponding constraints, in terms of quality of service (QoS), binary rate, etc. To achieve this, we have to find the optimal services' load factors which maximizes the cell radius of the system under traffic criteria. We apply an evolutionary programming algorithm to solve the problem, which codifies and evolves the services' load factors. We have compared our approach with an existing algorithm in several multiservice scenarios, improving its solutions in terms of cell size. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
