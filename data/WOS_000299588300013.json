In this paper, efficient schemes which serve as both at the same time are presented. The schemes find their typical application in anonymous auction where the winner cannot deny her bid; nobody can pretend to be the winner; and the anonymity of all losers is preserved. The security of the schemes is proved in the common reference string model under discrete logarithm type assumptions.", "paper_title": "Undeniable and Unpretendable Signatures", "paper_id": "WOS:000299588300013"}
