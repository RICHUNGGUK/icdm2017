The static quantiser ranges are fully considered here for practical transmission channels requirements. A quantised H infinity filter design strategy is proposed, where a convex optimisation method is developed to minimise static quantiser ranges. The resulting design guarantees that the quantised augmented system is asymptotically stable and with a prescribed H infinity performance bound. The effectiveness of the proposed filter design method is demonstrated by a numerical example.", "paper_title": "H infinity filter design for continuous-time systems with quantised signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000311479000007"}
