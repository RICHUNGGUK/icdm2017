The method uses Strang splitting to separate propagation in spatial and velocity coordinates, and is second-order accurate in spatial and velocity spaces and in time. The method has been implemented on general-purpose graphics processing units for faster computations and has been parallelised using the message passing interface. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
