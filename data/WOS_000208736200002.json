A realization of such an approach requires coordinating and maintaining the causality of the users' activities. We propose the Collaborative DEVS Modelling (CDM) approach and its realization based on the Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) and the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) concepts and technologies. The CSCW concepts are introduced into the DEVS modelling framework in order to support model development in virtual team settings. A set of modelling rules and tasks enabling collaborative, visual, and persistent model construction and synthesis is developed. To support separate groups of modellers to independently develop models, the realization of CDM supports independent modelling sessions. An illustrative example is developed to demonstrate collaborative and incremental model development. The design of the CDM realization and future research are briefly described.", "paper_title": "Towards collaborative component-based modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000208736200002"}
