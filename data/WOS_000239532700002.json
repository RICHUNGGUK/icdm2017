It is a standard for connecting computers to form a local area network and provides a common method for the exchange of data. In this paper, we propose a Linux solution, Bonding-Plus, to support real-time control and boost bandwidth using multiple network interface cards connected to regular switching hubs in an Ethernet environment. Bonding-Plus schedules packets in the data link layer without modification to the hardware or operating system in the host machine. Real-time packets can be transmitted via one or several dedicated bonding Ethernet interfaces, and there is no competition with low priority packets. Transmission delay and network jitter for real-time packets can be dramatically reduced. Furthermore, bandwidth can be increased in proportion to the number of bonding Ethernet interfaces under both TCP and UDP transmission. Various types of systems, such as clustering and parallel systems, can be enhanced at minimal hardware cost.", "paper_title": "Boosting Ethernet using regular switching hubs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239532700002"}
