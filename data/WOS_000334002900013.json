Under the long-term private key assumption, this scheme not only satisfies most important security requirements proposed before, such as fairness, eligibility, uniqueness, accuracy, anonymity and so on, but also prevents bribery and coercion. Furthermore, the scheme offers voters mobility and convenience so they can securely and easily cast their vote from any location and on any device using a stable Internet connection, which has a potential for raising voter turnout rates and facilitating the voting process.
