The results apply to any linear data modulation and spreading scheme. The interference components, including the interchip interference (ICI) of a linear receiver output, are shown to be asymptotically jointly Gaussian random variables conditioned on the phases and delays of the interfering signals. Expressions for the error probabilities of band-limited systems are also developed from this result.", "paper_title": "An asymptotic analysis of band-limited DS/SSMA communication systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000234944700031"}
