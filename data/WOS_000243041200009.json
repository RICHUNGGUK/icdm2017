Currently, Internet routing protocols select only a single path between a source and a destination. However, due to many policy routing decisions, single-path routing may limit the achievable throughput. In this paper, we envision a scenario where multi-path routing is enabled in the Internet to take advantage of path diversity. Using minimal congestion feedback signals from the routers, we present a class of algorithms that can be implemented at the sources to stably and optimally split the flow between each source-destination pair. We then show that the connection-level throughput region of such multi-path routing/congestion control algorithms can be larger than that of a single-path congestion control scheme.", "paper_title": "Multi-path TCP: A joint congestion control and routing scheme to exploit path diversity in the Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000243041200009"}
