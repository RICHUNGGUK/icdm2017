Both the approximations of algebraic polynomial and trigonometric polynomial functions are discussed in details. For algebraic polynomial functions, an one-hidden-layer FNN with chosen number of hidden-layer nodes and corresponding weights is established by a constructive method to approximate the polynomials to a remarkable high degree of accuracy. For trigonometric functions, an upper bound of approximation is therefore derived by the constructive FNNs. In addition, algorithmic examples are also included to confirm the accuracy performance of the constructive FNNs method. The results show that it improves efficiently the approximations of both algebraic polynomials and trigonometric polynomials. Consequently, the work is really of both theoretical and practical significance in constructing a one-hidden-layer FNNs for approximating the class of polynomials. The work also paves potentially the way for extending the neural networks to approximate a general class of complicated functions both in theory and practice.", "paper_title": "Approximation of algebraic and trigonometric polynomials by feedforward neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000299177300008"}
