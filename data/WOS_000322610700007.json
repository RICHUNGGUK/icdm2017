This paper addresses the implementation of parallel algorithms with bidirectional 3-ary n-cube communication patterns on a bidirectional linear array WDM optical networks when the information is transmitted one dimension after another. By giving an embedding scheme phi, we prove the optimal number of wavelengths under phi and design a routing and wavelength assignment strategy of it. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
