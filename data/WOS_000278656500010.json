It is important to manage the CPU utilization, via feedback control, to avoid severe overload or underutilization even in the presence of dynamic workloads. However, it is challenge to model a real-time system for feedback control, as computer systems cannot be modeled via physics laws. In this paper, we present a novel closed-loop approach for utilization control based on formal fuzzy logic control theory, which is very effective to support the desired performance in a nonlinear dynamic system without requiring a system model. We mathematically prove the stability of the fuzzy closed-loop system. Further, in a real-time kernel, we implement and evaluate our fuzzy logic utilization controller as well as two existing utilization controllers based on the linear and model predictive control theory for an extensive set of workloads. Our approach supports the specified average utilization set-point, while showing the best transient performance in terms of utilization control among the tested approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
