The goal of this chapter is to review latest research in the context of audio feature extraction and to give an application-independent overview of the most important existing techniques. We survey state-of-the-art features from various domains and propose a novel taxonomy for the organization of audio features. Additionally, we identify the building blocks of audio features and propose a scheme that allows for the description of arbitrary features. We present an extensive literature survey and provide more than 200 references to relevant high-quality publications.", "paper_title": "Features for Content-Based Audio Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000276037100003"}
