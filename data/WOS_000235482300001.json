In this work, we develop methods to mitigate the consequences of water shortage resulting from destruction of facilities in water networks. These methods integrate search techniques, such as branch-and-bound and genetic algorithms, with a hydraulic solver to check demand feasibilities across a residual water network. The objective is to identify a feasible customer demand pattern that minimizes the consequences of water shortage in the downgraded network. We present a mathematical model of the problem addressed along with an exact solution methodology and several heuristics. We apply these methodologies to three water networks ranging in size from approximately 10-700 nodes and compare the solution quality and computational efficiency.", "paper_title": "Minimizing the consequences of intentional attack on water infrastructure", "paper_id": "WOS:000235482300001"}
