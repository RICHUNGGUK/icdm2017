The corresponding mass matrices are also formulated. In order to define the values of the parameters of the three-parameter model, an analytical method is applied. With the aid of two numerical examples, it is proved that the three-parameter model is capable of yielding natural period values that sufficiently approximate those derived by the solution using 2D finite element soil models.
