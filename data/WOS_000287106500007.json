Prior approaches to limit credential transfer require tamper-resistant user hardware, or are ineffective against closely knit groups of users who are willing to share personal or valuable information with each other. In this paper we propose a scheme to achieve non-transferability for any malicious, but computationally bounded, legitimate credential owner.
