The objective of flood disaster evaluation is to establish hazard assessment model for managing flood and preventing disaster. Base on the chaotic optimization theory, this paper proposes a chaotic differential evolution algorithm to solve a fuzzy clustering iterative model for evaluating flood disaster. By using improved logistic chaotic map and penalty function, the objective function can be solved more perfectly. Two practical flood disaster cases have been taken into account so as to test the effect of novel hybrid method. Simulation results and comparisons show that the chaotic differential evolution algorithm is competitive and stable in performance with simple differential evolution and other optimization approaches presented in literatures.
