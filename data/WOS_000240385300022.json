The all-zero detecting threshold is very critical as a tradeoff between encoder complexity and image quality. So firstly a feasible threshold range is analyzed theoretically, then based on extensive experiments on typical video sequences from the statistical opinion, a better optimal threshold is discussed, which has a better balance than the theoretically optimal threshold between mis-justice and leak-out ratio in detecting all-zero coefficient blocks. In our proposed algorithm, the sum of absolute difference (SAD) of each motion prediction error in the inter block is used, and this SAD is a bypass obtained from motion estimation process, so no additional computation is required. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the computational load significantly, almost without video quality loss.", "paper_title": "Detecting all-zero coefficient blocks before transformation and quantization in H.264/AVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300022"}
