Research works have shown even better reconstructions by taking advantage of prior information from a reference image which has anatomical similarity with the target image. In this work, a novel method for motion-compensated reference-driven MR image reconstruction is presented. The target image is directly reconstructed by solving a convex minimization problem which prompts l(1)-norm sparsity of the target and the motion-compensated difference images. An efficient algorithm is proposed to solve the minimization problem with joint application of Augmented Lagrangian method and alternating direction minimization method. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework provides more accurate reconstructions especially in high under-sampling ratios when comparing with commonly used and state-of-the-art methods.
