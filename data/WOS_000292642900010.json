It is proved that, by using the new scheme, the explosion of the complexity problem in a traditional backstepping design can be eliminated, the semi-global stability of a closed-loop system can be guaranteed and, in particular, by choosing the design parameters and initialising the filters and the update law properly, we show that the L-infinity performance of the system-tracking error can be achieved without over-parametrisation. Another advantage of the proposed scheme compared with those traditional backstepping control and current adaptive DSC schemes, whose adaptive control law is obtained through a series of steps recursively, is that the adaptive law is needed only at the first design step, and therefore significantly reduces the design procedure.", "paper_title": "Adaptive dynamic surface control for a class of output-feedback nonlinear systems with guaranteed L-infinity tracking performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000292642900010"}
