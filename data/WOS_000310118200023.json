These algorithms can embed adaptive robust watermarked bits according to various lengths of linear block codes in a host image of 512 x 512 pixels in size. Instead of using randomly generated reference vectors as arc labels, this algorithm uses the codewords of a linear block code to label the arcs in the trellis structure. The use of linear block code as arc offers two advantages as follows: first, to provide a satisfactory space partition for each trellis section; second, to perform embedding algorithm featuring linear block codes for each trellis section. Moreover, the algorithm proposed algorithm can perform iteration to find a tradeoff between robustness and fidelity by using a number of controllable parameters. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate three objectives as follows: first, to simulate the effect of controllable parameter on the proposed watermarking scheme; second, to report the robustness and fidelity performance of this algorithm in various attack channels, such as Gaussian noise, scaling, low pass filter, and JPEG compression; and third, to simulate computation complexity and the proposed trellis-based informed embedding, which requires less operation complexity compared with Miller's informed embedding method.", "paper_title": "A ROBUST INFORMED EMBEDDING WITH LOW COMPLEXITY FOR DIGITAL WATERMARKING", "paper_id": "WOS:000310118200023"}
