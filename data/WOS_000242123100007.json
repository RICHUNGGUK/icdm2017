It meant that the customer would be stimulated by new need to discover a new concept, which could be merged into his design. Therefore, in designing process how to help the designer quickly designed a creative product that was the important problem. The other was that in interactive creative design the designer had to face the fatigue problem. In this paper, we developed a Bipartite KeyGraph based Interactive Evolutionary Computation (BiKIEC), which could collect the interactive data and ran the KeyGraph analysis to find the key components (chancel). And then the bipartite analysis was used to discover the chance2. Finally, the chance3 was the probability for entering the shot-cut in Small World. The BiKIEC emerged some creative components for helping designer designed the creative product. After analyzing the designer interactive data, we found that the product was created by chance mechanism, which was quickly accepted by designer in his design process. Furthermore, the questionnaire results also indicated that the BiKIEC could significantly help the designer to design his favorite product. Therefore, the BiKIEC was a useful tool for helping the designer discovered his creative chance in interactive design process.", "paper_title": "Creative design by bipartite KeyGraph based interactive evolutionary computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100007"}
