Virtual screening experiments using the MDL Drug Data Report and World of Molecular Bioactivity databases show that the use of such inverse frequency weighting schemes can result, in some circumstances, in marked increases in screening effectiveness when compared with the use of conventional, unweighted fingerprints. Analysis of the characteristics of the various schemes demonstrates that such weights are best used to weight the fingerprint of the reference structure in a similarity search, with the database structures' fingerprints unweighted. However, the increases in performance resulting from such weights are only observed with structurally homogeneous sets of active molecules; when the actives arc diverse, the best results arc obtained using conventional, unweightecl fingerprints for both the reference structure and the database structures.", "paper_title": "Inverse Frequency Weighting of Fragments for Similarity-Based Virtual Screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000281022300003"}
