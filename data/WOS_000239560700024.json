In this research we have given avatars the capacity of having and expressing emotions by means of a computational emotional model based on the cognitive perspective. Once the system knows the emotional expressiveness that the virtual character will show to the user, we also have worked in how to express it through facial animation techniques.", "paper_title": "Virtual characters as emotional interaction element in the user interfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000239560700024"}
