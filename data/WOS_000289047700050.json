Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have been the foundation for economic development and have provided important contributions to job creation. Economic policy makers worldwide are trying to implement actions that will enhance the competitive vitality of SMEs and foster entrepreneurial drive through effective entrepreneurship policy. Surprisingly, prior research has given little attention to the evaluation of entrepreneurship policy. The paper proposes an integrated model that combines the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), analytic network process (ANP), and zero-one goal programming (ZOGP) methods. This model considers the interdependent relationship among complex policy evaluation criteria and alternatives, and addresses the constraints of itemized annual budgets. Then, the paper applies the model to an empirical case study of entrepreneurship policy for SMEs in Taiwan. The evaluation results show that three alternatives (incubator center, financial assistance, and knowledge-sharing platforms) are selected under budget constraints and the model provides an effective solution to help policy makers evaluate and select feasible entrepreneurship policy mix.
