Because of the prevalence of corrupted data in real-world applications, much research has focused on developing robust algorithms. Perhaps surprisingly, these algorithms are unequipped-indeed, unable-to deal with outliers in the high-dimensional setting where the number of observations is of the same magnitude as the number of variables of each observation, and the dataset contains some (arbitrarily) corrupted observations. We propose a high-dimensional robust principal component analysis algorithm that is efficient, robust to contaminated points, and easily kernelizable. In particular, our algorithm achieves maximal robustness-it has a breakdown point of 50% (the best possible), while all existing algorithms have a breakdown point of zero. Moreover, our algorithm recovers the optimal solution exactly in the case where the number of corrupted points grows sublinearly in the dimension.", "paper_title": "Outlier-Robust PCA: The High-Dimensional Case", "paper_id": "WOS:000312896600034"}
