Specifically, understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic individual factors and interaction effects that influence Information and Communications Technology (ICT) acceptance and adoption - in higher education - continues to be a focal interest in learning research. In this regard, one type of affective reactions toward ICT (in our study, the WebCT), perceived affective quality, is an essential dimension in user technology acceptance. A structural equation modelling, specifically partial least square (PLS), is proposed to assess the relationships between the constructs together with the predictive power of the research model. The results demonstrate that the research model significantly predicts the intention to use the WebCT. The results provide strong support for the proposals that (a) perceived usefulness, ease of use and flow lead the learners towards developing high intention to use the WebCT; and (b) perceived affective quality exhibits a relevant interaction effect on the model. This study, therefore, represents a \"crucial test\" of non-utilitarian influences on use of Web-based applications. The model and results can thus be used to assess motivational design aspects during electronic learning process. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
