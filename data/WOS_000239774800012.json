The various methods are compared through their performance on known video sequences. Linear system analysis of interlaced video and de-interlacer are proposed in [1]-[3]. It is well established that the performance of the MC methods outperform the fixed or motion-adaptive methods when the motion vectors used are reliable and true to the scene content. Being an open-loop process the performance of the MC de-interlacers degrade drastically when there are motion vector errors. In this paper, a linear system analysis of MC video upconversion systems is presented and the effects of motion vector accuracy on system performance are analyzed. We investigate the various factors that contribute to the motion vector inaccuracy, such as incorrect motion modelling, acceleration between the frames, and insufficient interpolation kernel.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of motion-compensated de-interlacing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239774800012"}
