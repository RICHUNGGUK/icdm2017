This paper develops a conceptual framework for extending standard business process metamodels to include comprehensive information that is useful for managing and quantifying operational risk in business processes. We provide formal extensions of the Business Process Modeling Notation standard, as well as a step-by-step process for creating a risk-extended process model.", "paper_title": "Incorporating risk into business process models", "paper_id": "WOS:000208259200002"}
