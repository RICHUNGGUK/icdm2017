Without assuming the boundedness and differentiability of the activation functions, based on the properties of M-matrix, by constructing vector Liapunov functions and applying differential inequalities, the sufficient conditions ensuring existence, uniqueness, and global exponential stability of the equilibrium point of fuzzy cellular neural networks with variable delays are obtained.", "paper_title": "Global exponential stability of fuzzy cellular neural networks with variable delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000036"}
