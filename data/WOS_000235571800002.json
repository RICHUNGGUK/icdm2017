However, while the performance increases due to scaling, the power density increases substantially every generation due to higher integration density. Furthermore, the demand for power-sensitive design has grown significantly in recent years due to tremendous growth in portable applications. Consequently, the need for power-efficient design techniques has grown considerably. Several efficient design techniques have been proposed to reduce both dynamic as well as static power in state-of-the-art VLSI circuit applications. In this paper, we discuss different circuit techniques that are used to maintain the power consumption (both static and dynamic) within a limit while achieving the highest possible performance.
