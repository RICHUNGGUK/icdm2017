At the core of our method is a novel field-guided approach to automatically align two input parts in a feature-conforming manner. The key to our field-guided shape registration is a natural continuation of one part into the ambient field as a means to introduce an overlap with the distant part, which then allows a surface-to-field registration. The ambient vector field we compute is feature-conforming; it characterizes a piecewise smooth field which respects and naturally extrapolates the surface features. Once the two parts are aligned, gap filling is carried out by spline interpolation between matching feature curves followed by piecewise smooth least-squares surface reconstruction. We apply our algorithm to obtain feature-conforming shape composition on a variety of models and demonstrate generality of the method with results on parts with or without overlap and with or without salient features.", "paper_title": "Field-Guided Registration for Feature-Conforming Shape Composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000311298900053"}
