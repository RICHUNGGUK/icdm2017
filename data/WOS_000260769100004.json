With variability measure of a phrase, we can estimate how likely a phrase in a given query would appear in relevant documents and control the impact of syntactic phrases in a retrieval model. Various experimental results over different types of queries and document collections show that our retrieval model based on variability of syntactic phrases is very effective in terms of retrieval performance, especially for long natural language queries.", "paper_title": "A novel retrieval approach reflecting variability of syntactic phrase representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000260769100004"}
