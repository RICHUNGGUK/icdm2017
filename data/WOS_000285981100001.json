With the rising interest in competing risks and multi-state models a number of software packages have been developed for the analysis of such models. The present special issue of the Journal of Statistical Software introduces a selection of R packages devoted to competing risks and multi-state models. This introduction to the special issue contains some background and highlights the contents of the contributions.", "paper_title": "Special Issue about Competing Risks and Multi-State Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000285981100001"}
