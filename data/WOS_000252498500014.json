For two given (sets of) compounds, the number of possible paths between them in a metabolic network can be intractably large. It would be informative to rank these paths in order to differentiate between them. Results: Focusing on adjacent pairwise coexpression, we developed an algorithm which, for a specified k, efficiently outputs the top k paths based on a probabilistic scoring mechanism, using a given metabolic network and microarray datasets. Our idea of using adjacent pairwise coexpression is supported by recent studies that local coregulation is predominant in metabolism. We first evaluated this idea by examining to what extent highly correlated gene pairs are adjacent and how often they are consecutive in a metabolic network. We then applied our algorithm to two examples of path ranking: the paths from glucose to pyruvate in the entire metabolic network of yeast and the paths from phenylalanine to sinapyl alcohol in monolignols pathways of arabidopsis under several different microarray conditions, to confirm and discuss the performance analysis of our method.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic path ranking based on adjacent pairwise coexpression for metabolic transcripts analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000252498500014"}
