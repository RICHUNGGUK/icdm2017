These approximations provide a hierarchy of tractable logical systems that indefinitely converge to classical propositional logic. The framework we present here brings to light a general approach to logical inference that is quite different from the standard Gentzen-style approaches, while preserving some of their nice proof-theoretical properties, and is common to several proof systems and algorithms, such as KE, KI and Stalmarck's method.
