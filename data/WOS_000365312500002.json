A single assembly operation was required for both structure models based on DuPont 9K7 \"green\" tapes, after layout design and interactive 3-D electromagnetic optimization processes. Due to LTCC manufacturing technology, a large number of package structures containing cavities, inner vertical and horizontal interconnects, pads for inner components' assembly and external signal connections was manufactured. Surfaces acoustic wave (SAW) resonators and film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) structures have been used with very good results as temperature and, respectively, humidity sensing devices. Input and output signal ports have been define as coplanar transmission line (CPW) configuration for a good impedance matching to the measuring system. Linear behavior of the frequency shift vs. temperature and, respectively, relative humidity was evidenced. Although certain temperature sensitivity reduction is observed, an improved dynamic range of the return loss response is noticed for packaged SAW devices, favorable for subsequent signal processing and temperature value extracting. Very small and complex RF packages, with SMT compatible and solderable AgPt pinout and two different levels of Au pads for Au wire bonding inside the cavity intended to provide handling protection after wire bonding are the main outcome of this paper.", "paper_title": "Development and Experimental Results on LTCC Packages for Acoustic Wave Sensing Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000365312500002"}
