We derive an analytical model capturing the effects of frame aggregation and block acknowledgements, features found in the new IEEE 802.11n standard. We describe the throughput at MAC layer as a function of physical data rate, error rate, aggregation level and path length. While being mathematically tractable, the proposed model is flexible enough to account for complex and realistic error characteristics of the wireless channel, such as long-term fluctuations and burstiness. We further show how to integrate the well-known Gilbert-Elliot channel model into our model and evaluate both models in our indoor wireless testbed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
