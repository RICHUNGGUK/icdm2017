It was assumed in [1] that no measures are taken to ensure that the BIST circuitry is fault-free before launching the functional test. In this paper we assume that a BIST pretest is first conducted in order to get rid of all chips that fail it. Only chips whose BIST circuitry has passed the pretest are kept, while the rest are discarded. The BIST pretest, however, is assumed to have only a limited coverage against its own faults. This paper studies the product quality improvements as induced by the BIST pretest, and provides some insight as to when it may be worthwhile to perform it.", "paper_title": "Effect of BIST pretest on IC defect level", "paper_id": "WOS:000241296100005"}
