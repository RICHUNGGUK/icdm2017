Moreover, we define and study the generalized multiparameter non-central Stirling numbers and generalized Comtet numbers via differential operators. Furthermore, recurrence relations and new explicit formulas for those numbers are obtained. Finally some interesting special cases, new combinatorial identities and a connection between these numbers and some interesting polynomials are deduced. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
