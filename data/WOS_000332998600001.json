Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted among undergraduate and graduate mobile users in a regional university Structural equation modeling procedures were deployed to analyse 323 valid data points. Findings - The study found that among well-educated m-commerce users, user personal imiovativeness as measured by PIIT and perceived usefulness, the determinants of initial adoption, remain as strong determinants of user continuance intention. PUT also remains as the antecedent of perceived ease of use. Social influence has changed the pattern of influence on continuance intention. Research limitations/implications - This study is unable to investigate m-commerce user expectations and satisfaction levels. The small and convenient sample does not offer guarantee of the findings. Practical implications - M-commerce providers should pay adequate attention to personal innovativeness, since it affects mobile user willingness and capability to welcome and adapt to new services and features. They should always utilize social channels to gather feedback, to distribute new changes or features, and to exert positive influence. Originality/value - This study is one of the few examining the effect of PUT in a post-adoption context and confirms its long-term psychological influence on continuance intention toward m-commerce. This study is also one of the initial to use discursive power perspective to study social influence on continuance intention in the mobile context.", "paper_title": "Are personal innovativeness and social influence critical to continue with mobile commerce?", "paper_id": "WOS:000332998600001"}
