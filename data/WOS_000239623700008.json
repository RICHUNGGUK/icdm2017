To find the solution to the difficulties in acquiring and representing existing knowledge in almost systems, we proposed a novel instance-based intrusion detection system called HTTPHunting. It will provide a framework to intrusion detection problem, incorporating several artificial intelligence techniques that help to overcome some of those limitations. HTTPHunting is able to classify in real time, traffic data arriving at the network interface of the host that is protecting, detecting anomalous traffic patterns. From our initial experiments, we can conclude that there are important key benefits of such an approach to network traffic-filtering domain.", "paper_title": "HTTPHunting: An IBR approach to filtering dangerous HTTP traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623700008"}
