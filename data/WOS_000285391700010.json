The goal is to do this in o(n) space, where n is the total number of identities. Straggler identification has applications, for example, in determining the unacknowledged packets in a high-bandwidth multicast data stream. We provide a deterministic solution to the straggler identification problem that uses only O(d log n) bits, based on a novel application of Newton's identities for symmetric polynomials. This solution can identify any subset of d stragglers from a set of nO(log n)-bit identifiers, assuming that there are no false deletions of identities not already in the set. Indeed, we give a lower bound argument that shows that any small-space deterministic solution to the straggler identification problem cannot be guaranteed to handle false deletions. Nevertheless, we provide a simple randomized solution, using O(d log n log(1/epsilon)) bits that can maintain a multiset and solve the straggler identification problem, tolerating false deletions, where epsilon > 0 is a user-defined parameter bounding the probability of an incorrect response. This randomized solution is based on a new type of Bloom filter, which we call the invertible Bloom filter.", "paper_title": "Straggler Identification in Round-Trip Data Streams via Newton's Identities and Invertible Bloom Filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000285391700010"}
