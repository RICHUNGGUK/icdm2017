We build on the LP decoding algorithm of Feldman et al. and introduce a postprocessing step that solves a second linear program that reweights the objective function based on the outcome of the original LP decoder output. Our analysis shows that for some LDPC ensembles we can improve the provable threshold guarantees compared to standard LP decoding. We also show significant empirical performance gains for the reweighted LP decoding algorithm with very small additional computational complexity.", "paper_title": "Reweighted LP Decoding for LDPC Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000307892800024"}
