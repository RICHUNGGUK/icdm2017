The network topology can be directed. The time delay is assumed to be less than the control width. At first, we give some criteria for cluster synchronization under constant pinning control strategy. Furthermore, by applying the adaptive approach, we design a centralized adaptive algorithm on the intermittent control gain, and also prove its validity rigorously. Finally, numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the correctness of obtained theoretical results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
