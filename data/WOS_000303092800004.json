A pre-processing phase is considered to determine the best compression rate for the coding process. We test this scheme in tamper detection analysis on a sample of images by simulating various types of computer attack. The obtained results are good in terms of accuracy for tamper detection with compressed images and of dimensionality of the image dataset to store the original images. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
