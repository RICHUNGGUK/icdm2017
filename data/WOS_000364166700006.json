In literature, several methods are successfully implemented as computer tools, but their use is limited to their developers. There are several useful rules of thumb and heuristics providing useful guidelines, but sometimes these are contradictory. Some authors tried to rank the various alternatives, defining heuristic equations to provide a quantitative parameter to choose among possible solutions. In this paper, mathematical model of distillation columns is simplified, assuming infinite number of stages. The resulting proposed equation has a great similarity to one of the previous heuristic ones. A simple equation not relying on heuristics and easy to use in calculation is provided to evaluate the distillation sequence energy efficiency (DSE) for each alternative. This allows to quantify the advantages derived from process intensification for a given feed composition. The proposed equation is dimensionless, as the Carnot efficiency is used instead of the temperature difference between distillate and bottoms. On the other hand, intermediate results provide also useful information. For instance, the Carnot efficiency of each column indicates when a heat pump or enhanced distillation would be useful. The recovery efficiency for each particular compound allows an easy comparison between alternatives, considering variations on the feed composition. The new equation is verified comparing its results with cases already solved in literature using different methods. The results show that all the methods in literature are able to provide the best sequence, except the heuristics-based ones that are not providing an overall sequence evaluation. The novelty of the proposed DSE method resides in its ease of application, compared to nowadays available methods, and requires only the feed composition and products boiling points.
