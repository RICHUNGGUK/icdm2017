Depending on whether the intervals are given a priori for pre-processing, or during the query along with the pattern or, even in both the cases, we develop efficient solutions for different variants of this problem. In particular, we present efficient indexing schemes for each of the above variants of the problem.", "paper_title": "Finding Patterns In Given Intervals", "paper_id": "WOS:000282465400002"}
