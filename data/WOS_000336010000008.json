The viscoplasticity is modeled by means of a simple (linear) Norton-Hoff's law. Some numerical examples are performed to examine the consistency and relevance of the solutions. Parametric studies illustrate the influence of key parameters such as rock mass viscosity, Poisson's ratio, rock mass permeability, lining emplacement, etc. This analytical approach constitutes a useful reference to facilitate more complex numerical simulation and making it possible to obtain practical estimations of the poromechanical behavior of underground structures.
