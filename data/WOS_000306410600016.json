The present paper provides a new definition for MD-spline curves in a geometric intuitive way based on an efficient and simple evaluation algorithm. MD-spline curves maintain various desirable properties of B-spline curves, such as convex hull, local support and variation diminishing properties. They can also be refined exactly with knot insertion. The continuity between two adjacent segments with different degrees is at least C (1) and that between two adjacent segments of same degrees d is C (d-1). Benefited by the exact refinement algorithm, we also provide several operators for MD-spline curves, such as converting each curve segment into B,zier form, an efficient merging algorithm and a new curve subdivision scheme which allows different degrees for each segment.", "paper_title": "A Geometric Approach for Multi-Degree Spline", "paper_id": "WOS:000306410600016"}
