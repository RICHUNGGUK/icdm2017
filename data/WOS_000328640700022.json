However, unavailability of a large number of trios is the Achilles' heel of many complex diseases, especially for late-onset diseases. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to this problem by means of the Dempster-Shafer method. The simulation studies show that the Dempster-Shafer method has a promising overall performance, in identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the correct association class, as it has 90 percent accuracy even with 60 trios.", "paper_title": "Application of Dempster-Schafer Method in Family-Based Association Studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000328640700022"}
