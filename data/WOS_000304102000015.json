The energy dissipation is derived separately for driver, wire, and receiver termination. The effects of rise time and clock cycle are included. A realizable Pi-model for the driving-point impedance of an RLC current-mode transmission line is derived. The output current of an RLC current-mode transmission line is also derived. The model is extended to multiple parallel coupled interconnects with inductive and capacitive coupling between them. The model is verified by comparing it to HSPICE in 65-nm technology and applied to differential current-mode signaling.", "paper_title": "Modeling of Energy Dissipation in RLC Current-Mode Signaling", "paper_id": "WOS:000304102000015"}
