Doctors need the bone mineral density (BMD) measurements of vertebral bodies in order to diagnose and treat osteoporosis. The authors' objective is to segment the VBs as accurately as possible and hence to increase the accuracy of the BMD measurements and fracture analysis. Three pieces of information (intensity, spatial interaction and shape) are modelled to optimise a probabilistic energy functional. A universal shape prior, which is modelled using the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal regions, is proposed. Volumetric computed tomography data sets with various challenges are used in this study. The authors classify data sets based on some features related to the anatomy, imaging modality and level of the bone health. The proposed framework is one of only a few reported in the literature tested on the data obtained from different imaging devices. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method is robust under various noise levels, less variant to the initialisation and faster than existing vertebrae segmentation reports in the literature.", "paper_title": "Vertebral body segmentation using a probabilistic and universal shape model", "paper_id": "WOS:000352323900008"}
