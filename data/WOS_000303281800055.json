To benefit both producer and customers we attempt to minimize a linear combination of total weighted completion time and total weighted tardiness. Since the problem is shown to be NP-hard, meta-heuristic algorithms based on tabu search are developed to find the optimal/near optimal solution. For some small size yet complex problems, the results from these algorithms are compared to the optimal solutions found by CPLEX. The result obtained in all of these problems is that the tabu search algorithms could find solutions at least as good as CPLEX but in drastically shorter computational time, thus signifying the high degree of efficiency and efficacy attained by the former.
