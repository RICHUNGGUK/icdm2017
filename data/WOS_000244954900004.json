In many DSP systems, some tasks contain conditional instructions that have different execution times for different inputs. Due to the uncertainties in execution time of these tasks, this paper models each varied execution time as a probabilistic random variable and solves the Voltage Assignment with Probability (VAP) Problem. VAP problem involves finding a voltage level to be used for each node of an date flow graph (DFG) in uniprocessor and multiprocessor DSP systems. This paper proposes two optimal algorithms, one for uniprocessor and one for multiprocessor DSP systems, to minimize the expected total energy consumption while satisfying the timing constraint with a guaranteed confidence probability. The experimental results show that our approach achieves significant energy saving than previous work. For example, our algorithm for multiprocessor achieves an average improvement of 56.1% on total energy-saving with 0.80 probability satisfying timing constraint.", "paper_title": "Voltage assignment with guaranteed probability satisfying timing constraint for real-time multiproceesor DSP", "paper_id": "WOS:000244954900004"}
