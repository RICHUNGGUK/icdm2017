The tests utilize an integrated distance involving the empirical characteristic function of properly estimated residuals. These residuals are obtained from an initial estimation step involving a combination of penalized least squares and smoothing techniques. A bootstrap version of the tests is utilized in order to study the small sample behavior of the procedures in comparison with more classical approaches. As an example, the tests are applied on some real data sets.", "paper_title": "Goodness-of-fit tests in semi-linear models", "paper_id": "WOS:000302815400010"}
