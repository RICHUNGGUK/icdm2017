To achieve high average efficiency for a modulated signal the envelope of the complex baseband signal is transformed into pulses such that the CMCD amplifier is operated either at its peak efficiency or completely switched off. The CMCD amplifier has been designed based on single-tone active harmonic load-pull measurements to achieve a power-added efficiency (PAE) of 61.5% with 25 W output power at 900 MHz using LDMOS FETs. Removing the losses of the demodulation filter and of the amplifier a 10% higher efficiency than in an ideal class-B amplifier can be obtained for burst-mode operation with a peak-to-average power ratio of 10 dB.
