Instead of using capacity constraints to limit the amount of flow that can be received by the hubs, we introduce a second objective function to the model (besides the traditional cost minimizing function), that tries to minimize the time to process the flow entering the hubs. Two bi-criteria single allocation hub location problems are presented: in a first model, total time is considered as the second criteria and, in a second model, the maximum service time for the hubs is minimized. To generate non-dominated solutions an interactive decision-aid approach developed for bi-criteria integer linear programming problems is used. Both bi-criteria models are tested on a set of instances, analyzing the corresponding non-dominated solutions set and Studying the reasonableness of the hubs flow charge for these non-dominated Solutions. The increased information provided by the non-dominated solutions of the bi-criteria model when compared to the unique solution given by the capacitated hub location model is highlighted.
