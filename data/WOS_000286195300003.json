In this paper, we propose a topology control method for multi-channel multi-radio wireless mesh networks that use directional antennas. We are given a set of mesh routers installed in a region and some of them are gateway nodes that are connected to the Internet via wired lines. Each router has a traffic demand (Internet access traffic) generated from the end-users. The problem is how to adjust antenna orientations of radios and assign channels to them to construct a logical network topology, such that the minimum delivery ratio of traffic demands of routers is maximized. We first formulate the problem to an equivalent optimization problem with a clearer measurable metric, which is to minimize the largest interfering traffic of links in the network. We then propose a three-step solution to solve the problem. Firstly, we construct a set of routing trees, with the objective to balance the traffic among tree links. Secondly, we assign the radios of a node to the links it needs to serve, such that the total traffic load of the links that each radio serves is as balanced as possible. Thirdly, we do a fine-grained adjustment of antenna orientations and assign channels to them, such that the transmission area of each antenna will cover all the links it serves and the largest interfering traffic of links is minimized.", "paper_title": "Topology control for multi-channel multi-radio wireless mesh networks using directional antennas", "paper_id": "WOS:000286195300003"}
