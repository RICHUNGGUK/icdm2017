The method can be naturally completed by adaptive local mesh refinements and it turns out that the mesh generation is less constrained than when using the competitive cell-centered methods. We illustrate the effectiveness of the scheme by simulating variable density incompressible viscous flows Numerical simulations underline the theoretical predictions and succeed in the computation of high density ratio phenomena such as a water bubble falling in air (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved", "paper_title": "L-infinity-stability of vertex-based MUSCL finite volume schemes on unstructured grids: Simulation of incompressible flows with high density ratios", "paper_id": "WOS:000279569200013"}
