The resulting bounds for the (nonlazy) simple and max-degree walks on a (directed) graph are of the optimal order. It follows that, within a factor of two or four, the worst case of each of these mixing time and eigenvalue quantities is a walk on a cycle with clockwise drift. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
