Here, the focus is on identifying the functional capable of obtaining the best theoretical approximation to experimentally observed maximum absorption wavelength lambda(max) for a series of azobenzene and anthraquinone dyes. The results suggest that a QSPR-based approach can be a valuable strategy for avoiding unnecessary DFT computations, thereby facilitating rapid screening of structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
