The construction is based on a modification of a fifth-order dissipative method recently developed by Franco.(19) Two free parameters are added in order to nullify the phase-lag and the amplification. Numerical results obtained for well-known test problems show the efficiency of the new method when it is compared with other existing codes.", "paper_title": "A phase-fitted and amplification-fitted explicit two-step hybrid method for second-order periodic initial value problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238265800005"}
