The generated driving route targets the minimal traveling distance, but neglects the sightseeing experience of the route. In this study, we propose an augmented GPS navigation system, GPSView, to incorporate a scenic factor into the routing. The goal of GPSView is to plan a driving route with scenery and sightseeing qualities, and therefore allow travelers to enjoy sightseeing on the drive. To do so, we first build a database of scenic roadways with vistas of landscapes and sights along the roadside. Specifically, we adapt an attention-based approach to exploit community-contributed GPS-tagged photos on the Internet to discover scenic roadways. The premise is: a multitude of photos taken along a roadway imply that this roadway is probably appealing and catches the public's attention. By analyzing the geospatial distribution of photos, the proposed approach discovers the roadside sight spots, or Points-Of-Interest (POIs), which have good scenic qualities and visibility to travelers on the roadway. Finally, we formulate scenic driving route planning as an optimization task towards the best trade-off between sightseeing experience and traveling distance. Testing in the northern California area shows that the proposed system can deliver promising results.", "paper_title": "GPSView: A Scenic Driving Route Planner", "paper_id": "WOS:000315457000003"}
