All four multi-class support vector machines (M-SVMs) proposed so far in the literature appear as instances of this model. MSVMpack provides for them the first unified implementation and offers a convenient basis to develop other instances. This is also the first parallel implementation for M-SVMs. The package consists in a set of command-line tools with a callable library. The documentation includes a tutorial, a user's guide and a developer's guide.", "paper_title": "MSVMpack: A Multi-Class Support Vector Machine Package", "paper_id": "WOS:000293757900006"}
