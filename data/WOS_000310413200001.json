However, the main characteristics of grid systems such as dynamicity, large size and heterogeneity, bring new problems to the query processing domain such as resource discovery and resource allocation. In this paper, we provide a survey related to resource allocation methods for query processing in data grid systems. We provide a classification for existing studies considering their approaches to the resource allocation problem. We provide a synthesis of the studies and propose evaluations and comparisons for the different classes of studies.", "paper_title": "Resource allocation for query processing in grid systems: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000310413200001"}
