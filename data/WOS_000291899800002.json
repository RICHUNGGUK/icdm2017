The presented approach is a two phase decoupled method that can provide the desired coordination among the participating robots in offline mode. In the first phase, the collision free path with respect to stationary obstacles for each robot is obtained by employing an A* algorithm. In the second phase, the coordination among multiple robots is achieved by resolving conflicts based on a path modification approach. The paths of conflicting robots are modified based on their position in a dynamically computed path modification sequence (PMS). To assess the effectiveness of the developed methodology, the coordination among robots is also achieved by different strategies such as fixed priority sequence allotment for motion of each robot, reduction in the velocities of joints of the robot, and introduction of delay in starting of each robot. The performance is assessed in terms of the length of path traversed by each robot, time taken by the robot to realize the task and computational time. The effectiveness of the proposed approach for multi-robot motion planning is demonstrated with two case studies that considered the tasks with three and four robots. The results obtained from realistic simulation of multi-robot environment demonstrate that the proposed approach assures rapid, concurrent and conflict free coordinated path planning for multiple robots.
