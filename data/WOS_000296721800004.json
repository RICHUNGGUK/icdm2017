Some properties and the extension for fuzzy information systems of the general relation mappings have been investigated there. In this paper, we point out by counterexamples that several assertions (Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2, Theorems 4.1 and 4.3) in the aforementioned work are not true in general.", "paper_title": "A note on communicating between information systems based on including degrees", "paper_id": "WOS:000296721800004"}
