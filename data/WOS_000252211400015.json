This paper presents a new texture descriptor based on modulus maximum of the wavelet frame representation for texture retrieval, which includes two aspects: the density of modulus maxima and the mean of magnitudes of modulus maxima. Modulus maxima are related to the sharp variations in the texture. So the former is a multiresolution measure of the coarseness of the texture. The latter reflects the distribution of energy of modulus maxima along the frequency axis over scale and orientation. To combine the two different kinds of characterizations, a new dissimilarity measure is proposed. The detailed experiments are Performed over two benchmark texture image databases to verify the effectiveness of the proposed feature and dissimilarity measure.", "paper_title": "Feature based on modulus maxima of wavelet frame representation for texture retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000252211400015"}
