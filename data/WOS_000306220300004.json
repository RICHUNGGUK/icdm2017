The best known exact algorithms solve the problem in reasonable time for rather small graphs. In this paper an algorithm based on the idea of tabu search is constructed. Some properties of the local minima are shown. Exhaustive computational tests for various classes of graphs are performed. The obtained results suggest that the proposed tabu search algorithm quickly outputs optimal solutions for the smaller instances, previously discussed in the existing literature. Furthermore, some arguments that this algorithm performs well also for larger instances are provided.", "paper_title": "A tabu search algorithm for the minmax regret minimum spanning tree problem with interval data", "paper_id": "WOS:000306220300004"}
