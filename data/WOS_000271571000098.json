TTRP is a variant of the well Studied vehicle routing problem (VRP). in TTRP, a fleet of trucks and trailers are used to service a set of customers with known demands. Some customers may be serviced by a truck pulling a trailer, while the others may only be serviced by a single truck. This is the main difference between TTRP and VRP. The number of available trucks and available trailers is limited in the original TTRP but there are no fixed costs associated with the use of trucks or trailers. Therefore, it is reasonable to relax this fleet size constraint to see if it is possible to further reduce the total routing cost (distance). In addition, the resulting RTTRP can also be used to determine a better fleet mix. We developed a simulated annealing heuristic for solving RTTRP and tested it on 21 existing TTRP benchmark problems and 36 newly generated TTRP instances. Computational results indicate that the solutions for RTTRP are generally better than the best Solutions in the literature for TTRP. The proposed SA heuristic is able to find better solutions to 18 of the 21 existing benchmark TTRP instances. The solutions for the remaining three problems are tied with the best so far solutions in the literature. For the 36 newly generated problems, the average percentage improvement of RTTRP solutions over TTRP solutions is about 5%. Considering the ever rising crude oil price, even small reduction in the route length is significant. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
