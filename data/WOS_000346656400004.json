However, the numerical approximation of these models is demanding and imposes a number of computational constraints. In this paper, we introduce Fourier spectral methods as an attractive and easy-to-code alternative for the integration of fractional-in-space reaction-diffusion equations described by the fractional Laplacian in bounded rectangular domains of . The main advantages of the proposed schemes is that they yield a fully diagonal representation of the fractional operator, with increased accuracy and efficiency when compared to low-order counterparts, and a completely straightforward extension to two and three spatial dimensions. Our approach is illustrated by solving several problems of practical interest, including the fractional Allen-Cahn, FitzHugh-Nagumo and Gray-Scott models, together with an analysis of the properties of these systems in terms of the fractional power of the underlying Laplacian operator.", "paper_title": "Fourier spectral methods for fractional-in-space reaction-diffusion equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000346656400004"}
