There are amorphous materials with no ordered atomic arrays and some ordered structures with no translational periodicity, eventually called quasicrystals. This study presents a variety of five-fold symmetry molecular networks with 1-periodicity. The construction and topology (the genus calculation included) of these structures is described in terms of the net parameters, in a crystallographic manner.", "paper_title": "1-Periodic Nanostructures", "paper_id": "WOS:000328007000008"}
