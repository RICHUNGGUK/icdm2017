Although the development and validation of new QoS control strategies based on prototypes is costly and time-consuming, simulation techniques can noticeably reduce the development effort. A simulation model of the application server and its clients is required. Later, any QoS control strategy can be integrated into the model between the clients and the server. The available models are too simplistic to represent the complex applications currently executed in application servers. This article introduces a new model, which is capable of representing the current applications with a high degree of accuracy. As an application representative of the modern B2B environments, the TPC-App (Transaction Processing Performance Council) benchmark has been modeled.", "paper_title": "A simulation model to develop QoS control strategies for application servers", "paper_id": "WOS:000256134400003"}
