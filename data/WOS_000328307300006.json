Our analysis confirms the continued interweaving of hierarchical and regional patterns in the world city network as measured by cities' similarities in the presence of globalized service firms, but equally highlights some of the key changes that have occurred between 2000 and 2010 such as the rise of the BRIC cities, Dubai's leading positions in the Arab Gulf, and the stratification of US cities.
