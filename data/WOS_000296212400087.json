Current methods rasterize facial images as vectors, which result in a loss of spatial structure information of facial images. In this paper, we propose a method called Sp-Tensor to extend TensorFace by applying the sub-pattern technique. Advantages of the proposed method include: (1) a portion of spatial structure and local information of facial images is preserved; (2) dramatically reduce the computation complexity than other existing methods when building the model. The experimental results demonstrate that Sp-Tensor has better performance than the original TensorFace and Sp-PCA1, especially for facial images with un-modeled views and light conditions.
