Since the distribution of sensor nodes is not usually uniform due to random deployment and node failures, the coverage holes are hardly avoided in sensor network. And the coverage holes are important health indicators of the sensor network. This paper firstly proposes a level set based coverage holes detection algorithm for hybrid sensor network. This algorithm could estimate the number of holes and the size of the holes. Then we propose genetic algorithms based coverage holes healing algorithm. This algorithm could leverage mobility to optimize the average coverage rate and the average movement distance of the mobile nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed method could detect the holes efficiently. The holes healing algorithm outperforms the Random and Delaunay methods.", "paper_title": "Level Set Based Coverage Holes Detection and Holes Healing Scheme in Hybrid Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000328056700001"}
