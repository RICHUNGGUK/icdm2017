The overfitting problem is a phenomenon in which the accuracy of the model on unseen data is poor whereas the training accuracy is nearly perfect. This problem is particularly severe in complex models that have a large set of parameters. In this paper, we propose a deep learning neural network model that adopts the support vector data description (SVDD). The SVDD is a variant of the support vector machine, which has high generalization performance by acquiring a maximal margin in one-class classification problems. The proposed model strives to obtain the representational power of deep learning. Generalization performance is maintained using the SVDD. The experimental results showed that the proposed model can learn multiclass data without severe overfitting problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
