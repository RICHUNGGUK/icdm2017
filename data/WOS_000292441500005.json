After the analysis, we found that Tan et al.'s, Lim et al.'s and two protocols of Holbl et al. are insecure against the impersonation attack and the man-in-the-middle attack, Chen et al.'s protocol cannot withstand the key-compromise impersonation attack, one protocol of Holbl et al. is vulnerable to the insider attack, one allows an adversary to compute the private key of any user and one protocol allows her to compute the shared secret key.
