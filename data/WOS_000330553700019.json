The model employs an isophote based operator to detect potential structure and global saliency information related to each pixel, which are then combined with integral image to build up final saliency maps. We show that the proposed model outperforms seven state-of-the-art saliency detectors in experimental studies.", "paper_title": "Isophote Based Center-Surround Contrast Computation for Image Saliency Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000330553700019"}
