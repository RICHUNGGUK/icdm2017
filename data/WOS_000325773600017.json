Handoff across networks often causes delay and loss of packets and make end users vulnerable to security threats that may lead to disruptions. In this paper, we design P-SIGMA , a delay and security-hardened, disruption-tolerant and signalling cost-effective end-to-end mobility management scheme by incorporating paging in SIGMA , an internet protocol diversity-based end-to-end transport layer mobility management scheme. P-SIGMA can detect and mitigate disruptions against two most common security threats: session hijacking and freeloading. We also propose a signalling cost analysis model for paging and a recovery-time model for attacks. To demonstrate performance improvement, we compare P-SIGMA with SIGMA and show the speed at which P-SIGMA can detect attacks (security breaches). We observe that P-SIGMA has lower signalling than SIGMA while maintaining all the benefits of a transport layer mobility management scheme. P-SIGMA can also detect paging related security threats with a small detection time without incurring any additional signalling.", "paper_title": "P-SIGMA: security aware paging in end-to-end mobility management scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000325773600017"}
