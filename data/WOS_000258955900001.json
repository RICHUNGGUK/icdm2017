By abstracting this technique, they present necessary conditions which need to be satisfied for it to be successful in preventing side-channel analysis. They also show that concrete application of the technique via randomised field representation produces more efficient implementations than application of the technique via randomised projective coordinates.", "paper_title": "Randomised representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000258955900001"}
