So using real-time dynamic observation data in the simulation process has become an academic frontier of international research. This paper is a probing research on the data-driven adaptive modeling and automatic refactoring methods of flood routing simulation. A cellular automata (CA) data-driven flooding model was developed using the Hunhe River in Shenyang City as a case study. The proposed model can increase the accuracy of simulations by calculating differences in the water stages using high temporal resolution observational data. Meanwhile, corresponding parameter analysis was carried out based on the proposed CA model and the best lagging time between simulation and observation was discussed.", "paper_title": "Real-time flood simulations using CA model driven by dynamic observation data", "paper_id": "WOS:000355190200001"}
