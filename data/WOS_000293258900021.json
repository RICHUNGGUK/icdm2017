However, this method uses a certain number of topics to construct the final image representation. In such a way, it restricts the image description to one level of visual detail and cannot generate a higher accuracy rate. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel generative model, which is referred to as multi-scale multi-level probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis model (msml-pLSA). This method consists of two parts: multi-scale part, which extracts visual details from the image of diverse resolutions, and multi-level part, which concentrates multiple levels of topic representation to model scene. The msml-pLSA model allows for the description of fine and coarse local image detail in one framework. The proposed method is evaluated on the well-known scene classification dataset with 15 scene categories, and experimental results show that the proposed msml-pLSA model can improve the classification accuracy compared with the typical classification methods.", "paper_title": "Multi-Scale Multi-Level Generative Model in Scene Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000293258900021"}
