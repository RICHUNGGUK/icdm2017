Three possible estimators which are constructed as different combinations of the estimators arising from direct and inverse regression are considered. The efficiency properties of these three estimators are derived and the effect of non-normally distributed measurement errors is analyzed. A Monte-Carlo experiment is conducted to study the performance of these estimators in finite samples. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
