In this system, we find out discriminating words for protein-protein interaction by way of statistics and the results from literatures. A threshold is also evaluated to check if a given literature is related to protein-protein interactions. In addition, a keypage-based search mechanism is used to find related papers for protein-protein interactions from a given document. To expand the search space and ensure better performance of the system, mechanisms for protein name identification and databases for protein names ar e also developed. The system is designed with a web-based user interface and a job-dispatching kernel. Experiments are conducted and the results have been checked by a biomedical expert. The experimental results indicate that by using the proposed mining system, it is helpful for researchers to find out protein-protein literatures from the overwhelming piece of information available on the biomedical databases on the Internet.
