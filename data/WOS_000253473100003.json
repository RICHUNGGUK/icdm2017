We show that two necessary conditions for the \"Max\" operation are actually not satisfied in the moment match, based statistical timing analysis approaches. We propose two correlation-aware block-based statistical timing analysis approaches that keep these necessary conditions, and show that our approaches always achieve the lower bound and the upper bound on the timing yield. Our approach combining with moment-matching based statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) approaches can efficiently estimate the maximal possible errors of moment-matching-based SSTA approaches.", "paper_title": "Fast estimation of timing yield bounds for process variations", "paper_id": "WOS:000253473100003"}
