This study of e-parliament attempts to identify the key factors influencing parliamentary websites worldwide, and research the current global development of digital legislative bodies. The national legislative entities of 31 high economic or high e-government development nations were used as samples, and the extent of development related to their websites was adopted as a dependent variable. We found the overall development of parliamentary websites is a moderate level. The indicators system quality and information disclosure were generally stronger than functions of online service and interactive consultancy. The analysis also showed that development of e-government and degree of democracy are factors positively influence the development of parliamentary websites. More democratic nations may also perform better in development of parliamentary websites, compared to less democratic countries with high e-government development.", "paper_title": "Global Development of Parliamentary Websites and Key Factors of Influence", "paper_id": "WOS:000342605500004"}
