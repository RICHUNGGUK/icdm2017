The system supports two haptic models that provide three degree of freedom (DOF) force feedback and 6DOF posture sensing. Details of five key functions of the system are given: (1) a rendering conversion that uses 3DOF (instead of five) force feedback haptic representation, (2) an efficient force feedback design that allows accurate results to be obtained from the user's manipulation, (3) a fast collision detection scheme that achieves real-time feedback, (4) use of active haptic guidance to assist cutter-path generation, and (5) a design that supports both ball-end and flat-end tools with partial optimization.
