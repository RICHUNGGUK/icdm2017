Temporal awareness of a text, however, involves not only identifying the temporal expressions, but the events which these expressions anchor, as well as other events which must be ordered relative to them. Because of these broader concerns, TimeML has been developed as an annotation specification that encompasses not only temporal expressions, but all temporally relevant aspects of a text. The annotation schemes, however, are not interchangeable, resulting in incompatible corpora and accompanying extraction algorithms for each standard. In this paper, we describe an automatic migration process from the TIMEX2 tags of TIDES to the TIMEX3 tags of TimeML. This transformation procedure has been implemented and evaluated with two different corpora, obtaining 93.3 and 89.2% overall F-Measure respectively.", "paper_title": "Automatic transformation from TIDES to TimeML annotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000296881000005"}
