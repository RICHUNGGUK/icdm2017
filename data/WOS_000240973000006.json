Survey data were collected from 922 students in 51 courses at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. The survey consisted of 65 items broken down into seven areas, namely: (1) student characteristics, (2) learning experiences and course evaluations, (3) learning strategies, (4) instructional techniques, (5) computer use in course, (6) perceived effectiveness of computer use and (7) personal computer use. Contrary to expectations, no significant relationship was found between computer use and global course evaluations, nor was there a relationship between perceived effectiveness of computer use and global course evaluations. However, the results did yield a positive relationship between global course evaluations and the learning experiences that students engaged in. Students also indicated that they valued the use of computer technology for learning. Descriptive statistics on questions related to personal computer use show a strong favorable response to computer use and: facilitation of learning, value-added aspects such as usefulness to other classes and/or career, learning material in a more meaningful way, and working in groups with other students.
