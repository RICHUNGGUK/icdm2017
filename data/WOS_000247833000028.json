A novel stabilization criterion with decentralized parallel distributed compensation (PDC) fuzzy controller is proposed. The criterion contains two inequalities and one negative definite matrix to be satisfied. The effects of all interconnection terms and all decentralized PDC gains are entirely included in the negative definite matrix. The size of the matrix depends on the number of subsystems; the more the number of subsystems is, the larger the size of the matrix is. By using the linear matrix inequality method, the inequalities in the criterion can be solved to synthesize the local feedback gain of each PDC fuzzy controller such that the whole closed-loop large-scale fuzzy system is asymptotically stable. Finally, we give a practical example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed criterion.", "paper_title": "A novel stabilization criterion for large-scale T-S fuzzy systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000247833000028"}
