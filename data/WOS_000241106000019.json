Based on linear matrix inequality approach, a less conservative reliable controller design method is presented. The resulting fuzzy control systems are reliable in the sense that asymptotic stability is achieved not only when all control components are operating well, but also in the presence of some component failures. Moreover, the result is extended to the case of observer-based reliable fuzzy control. Two numerical examples are also given to illustrate the design procedures and their effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Reliable control of fuzzy descriptor systems with time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000019"}
