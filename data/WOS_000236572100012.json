A characterization property giving the coefficient bounds is obtained for this class of functions. The other related properties, which are investigated in this paper, include distortion and the radii of starlikeness And convexity. We also consider several applications of our main results to generalized hypergeometric functions, whose special cases yield some known results given recently by J.-L. Liu, and H. M.
