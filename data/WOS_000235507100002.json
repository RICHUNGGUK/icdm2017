Based on the recent results of Nagle, Schacht, and the authors, we give here solutions to these problems. In particular, we prove the following: Let F be a k-unifonn hypergraph on I vertices and suppose an n-vertex k-uniform hypergraph H contains only o(n') copies of F. Then one can delete o(n(k)) edges of H to make it F-free. Similar results were recently obtained by W. T. Gowers.
