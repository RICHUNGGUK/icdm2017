In the harsh electromagnetic environment of the modern battlefield, it is of the utmost importance to deny the opposing force the opportunity to attack or exploit the detection/interception of friendly communications assets through the deployment of electronic protection (EP) measures in order to attain low probability of detection (LPD), low probability of interception (LPI) and anti-jam (A/J). Given that directional antennas are a suitable means to achieve both extended range and LPD/LPI, this paper proposes mechanisms to optimize the trade-off between these capabilities, minimizing the number of hops and end-to-end delay when routing packets in a multi-hop ad-hoc network, while taking into account stealth requirements. The novel scheme is based on a variant of Fisheye State Routing, coupled with a power control algorithm to guarantee a LPD/LPI beyond the zone covered by the omni-directional radiation footprint of the network. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through computer simulation. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
