We fully classify the complexity of this problem for all values of and in both, the variable embedding and the fixed embedding case. For all problems are simple and for all problems are NP-complete. Our main results are efficient algorithms (with running time for deciding the existence of a -connected, 3-regular augmentation of a graph with a fixed planar embedding for and a corresponding hardness result for . The algorithms are such that for yes-instances a corresponding augmentation can be constructed in the same running time.", "paper_title": "Regular Augmentation of Planar Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000360668100004"}
