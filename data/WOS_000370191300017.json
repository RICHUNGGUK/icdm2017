The authors introduce monotone BI-algebras by loosening the axiomatic system of BCK-algebras. We also extend the algebras of fuzzy logics with weakly-associative conjunction from the case of the real unit interval to the case of a partially ordered set. As the main result of this report, it is proved that the class of monotone BI-algebras with condition (S) coincides with the class of weakly-associative conjunctive algebras.", "paper_title": "An Algebraic Aspect of Correspondences Between Implicational Fragment Logics and Fuzzy Logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000370191300017"}
