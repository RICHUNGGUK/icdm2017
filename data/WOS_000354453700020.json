In this study, we developed a web server, GenomeCons, for manipulating multiple genome sequence alignments and their consensus sequences for high-throughput genome sequence analyses. This server facilitates the visual inspection of multiple genome sequence alignments for a set of genomic intervals at a time. This allows the user to examine how these sites are evolutionarily conserved over time for their functional importance. The server also reports consensus sequences for the input genomic intervals, which can be applied to downstream analyses such as the identification of common motifs in the regions determined by ChIP-seq experiments.", "paper_title": "GenomeCons: a web server for manipulating multiple genome sequence alignments and their consensus sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000354453700020"}
