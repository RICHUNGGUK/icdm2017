The number of codewords in a conflict-avoiding code is the number of potential users that can be supported in the system. In this paper, a new upper bound on the size of constant-weight conflict-avoiding codes is proved. This upper bound is general in the sense that it is applicable to all code lengths and all Hamming weights. Several existing constructions for conflict-avoiding codes, which are known to be optimal for Hamming weights equal to four and five, are shown to be optimal for all Hamming weights in general.", "paper_title": "A General Upper Bound on the Size of Constant-Weight Conflict-Avoiding Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000278812000018"}
