Since our method relies on truncated prior distributions, it is particularly useful when the bounds of the sources and of the mixing coefficients are known in advance; this is the case, for instance, in non-negative matrix factorization. To implement our idea, we consider a Gibbs' sampler equipped with latent variables, which are set to simplify the sampling steps. Experiments with synthetic data point out that the new proposal performs well in situations where classical ICA-based solutions fail to separate the sources. Moreover, in order to illustrate the application of our method to actual data, we consider the problem of separating scanned images.", "paper_title": "Bayesian Source Separation of Linear and Linear-quadratic Mixtures Using Truncated Priors", "paper_id": "WOS:000296798200004"}
