Domain engineering is associated with product-line architecture, which is a core asset of the product-line. One of the key issues of the software product-line, especially in domain engineering, is handling the variability among product families. That is, variation management for the software product-line architecture determines the success of software development. Therefore, this paper proposes processes and artifacts to build the software product-line architecture and to manage uniform variability over the life cycle of software product-lines. Furthermore, a case study, namely, the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, is presented.", "paper_title": "VARIABILITY MANAGEMENT FOR SOFTWARE PRODUCT-LINE ARCHITECTURE DEVELOPMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000299173500002"}
