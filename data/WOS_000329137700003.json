Here, we have determined the binding free energies of cetuximab's Fab V-H-V-L domains and endogenous EGF ligand to wild type and S468R EGFR by high-throughput molecular dynamics. This work provides a possible mechanism of resistance in terms of increased competition, an hypothesis that can be further validated experimentally.", "paper_title": "Computational Modeling of an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Single-Mutation Resistance to Cetuximab in Colorectal Cancer Treatment", "paper_id": "WOS:000329137700003"}
