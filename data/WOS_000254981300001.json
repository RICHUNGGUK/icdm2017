There are distortions in these waveforms that can be represented as a combination of the fundamental frequency, harmonics and high frequency transients. This paper presents a novel approach to identifying harmonics in power system distorted waveforms. The proposed method is based on Genetic Algorithms, which is an optimization technique inspired by genetics and natural evolution. GOOAL, a specially designed intelligent algorithm for optimization problems, was successfully implemented and tested. Two kinds of representations concerning chromosomes are utilized: binary and real. The results show that the proposed method is more precise than the traditional Fourier Transform, especially considering the real representation of the chromosomes.", "paper_title": "GOOAL: A routine based on Genetic Algorithms to track harmonics in electric power systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000254981300001"}
