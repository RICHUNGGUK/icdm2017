A variety of algarithms have been developed for this task, but they are designed for traditional single-processor architectures. The current trend in computer hardware is towards increasingly parallel architecture for which these algorithms are not well suited. We describe a parallel, stochastic algorithm for molecular surface area computation that maps well to the emerging multi-core architectures. Our algorithm is also progressive, providing a rough estimate of surface area immediately and refining this estimate as time goes on. Furthermore, the algorithm generates points on the molecular surface which can be used for point-based rendering. We demonstrate a GPU implementation of our algorithm and show that it compares favorably with several existing molecular surface computation programs, giving fast estimates of the molecular surface area with good accuracy.
