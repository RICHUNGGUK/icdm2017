This method is composed of a feature extraction method, feature selection phase and a classification step. The feature extraction phase derives the features from the electrical impedance spectra. The extracted features consist of the impedivity at zero frequency (I0), the phase angle at 500KHz, the high-frequency slope of phase angle, the impedance distance between spectral ends, the area under spectrum, the normalised area, the maximum of the spectrum, the distance between impedivity at I0 and the real part of the maximum frequency point and the length of the spectral curve. The system uses the information theoretic criterion as a strategy for feature selection and the combining extreme learning machines (ELMs) for the classification phase. The results of several ELMs are combined using the support vector machines classifier, and the result of classification is reported as a measure of the performance of the system. The results indicate that the proposed system achieves high accuracy in classification of breast tissues using the electrical impedance spectroscopy.", "paper_title": "Combining extreme learning machines using support vector machines for breast tissue classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000343606800009"}
