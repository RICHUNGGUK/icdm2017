Deutsch's quantum algorithm has been claimed to be faster than any classical ones solving the same problem, only to be discovered later that this was not the case. Various de-quantised solutions for Deutsch's quantum algorithm-classical solutions which are as efficient as the quantum one-have been proposed in the literature. These solutions are based on the possibility of classically simulating \"superpositions\", a key ingredient of quantum algorithms, in particular, Deutsch's algorithm. The de-quantisation proposed in this note is based on a classical simulation of the quantum measurement achieved with a model of observed system. As in some previous de-quantisations of Deutsch's quantum algorithm, the resulting de-quantised algorithm is deterministic. Finally, we classify observers (as finite state automata) that can solve the problem in terms of their \"observational power\".", "paper_title": "AN OBSERVER-BASED DE-QUANTISATION OF DEUTSCH'S ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612200018"}
