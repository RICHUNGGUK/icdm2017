Our weapons shall be two classical results known for decades: maximum volume minimum (s, t)-cuts by Ford and Fulkerson [11] and isolating cuts by Dahlhaus et al. [9]. We sharpen these old weapons with the help of submodular functions, and apply them to this problem, which enable us to design a more elaborated branching scheme on deciding whether a non-terminal vertex is with a terminal or not. This bounded search tree algorithm can be shown to run in 1.84k . n(O(1)) time, thereby breaking the 2(k) . n(O(1)) barrier. As a by-product, it gives a 1.36(k) . n(O(1)) time algorithm for 3-terminal cut. The preprocessing applied on non-terminal vertices might be of use for study of this problem from other aspects.
