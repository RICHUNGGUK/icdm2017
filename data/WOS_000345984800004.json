The proposed scheme uses time scheduling and bridging via readers to allow for simultaneous operation of heterogeneous wireless networks that operate in the industrial, scientific, and medical frequency band at 2.4GHz. A simple sleep management approach is developed that allows tags to reduce their power consumption as well as collision rate. To provide timely reaction to sudden changes in tag population or reader availability, we devise a scheme where the scheduling parameters are adjustable and readers are mobile. We evaluate the performance of our solution in four scenarios and confirm the flexibility of the proposed approach.
