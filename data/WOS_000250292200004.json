In this paper, we generalize this family by adding a third parameter. We also study the generalized family for specific values of the third parameter. More precisely, we show that for particular values of this parameter, certain properties can be ensured by imposing constraints on the two remaining parameters. To conclude, we examine some members of the presented family of fuzzy similarity measures. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
