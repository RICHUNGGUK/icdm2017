Once the cause of disconnection is solved, the DPGS is able to resynchronize and reconnect with the grid. In these conditions, the universal operation can be successfully implemented through a voltage control. Voltage control is manly adopted in uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and island applications. However, a study that solely focused on the universal operation is missing. The goal of this work is to help in the selection of the most suitable control structure as function of: 1) power dynamics, power quality, and robust stability in grid-connected; 2) voltage regulation and performance under local load steps in island mode; and 3) behavior during the reconnection with the grid. For that purpose, five architectures have been reviewed within a general mathematical framework and with experimental results.", "paper_title": "Voltage Control Architectures for the Universal Operation of DPGS", "paper_id": "WOS:000352290400002"}
