In this paper, we fully utilize PET information to tackle challenging liver segmentation issues including (1) the separation and removal of the surrounding muscles from liver region of interest (ROI), (2) better localization and mapping of the probabilistic atlas onto the low-contrast CT for a more accurate tissue classification, and (3) an improved initial estimation of the liver ROI to speed up the convergence of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for the Gaussian distribution mixture model under the guidance of a probabilistic atlas. The primary liver extraction from the PET volume provides a simple mechanism to avoid the complicated pre-processing of feature extraction as used in the existing liver CT segmentation methods. It is able to guide the probabilistic atlas to better conform to the CT liver region and hence helps to overcome the challenge posed by liver shape variability. Our proposed method was evaluated against manual segmentation by experienced radiologists. Experimental results on 35 clinical PET-CT studies demonstrated that our method is accurate and robust in automated normal liver segmentation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
