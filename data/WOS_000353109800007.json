Signal space alignment at each user and the relay is carefully constructed to ensure that the signals from the same user pair are grouped together. The cross-pair interference can be canceled during both multiple accessing channel phase and broadcasting channel phase. The proposed signal processing scheme achieves the degrees of freedom of eta(K) =K-2 with fewer user antennas.", "paper_title": "The Solution for Cooperative Beamforming Design in MIMO Multi-way Relay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000353109800007"}
