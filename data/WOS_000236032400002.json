This paper studies the problem of clustering binary data. Binary data have been occupying a special place in the domain of data analysis. A unified view of binary data clustering is presented by examining the connections among various clustering criteria. Experimental studies are conducted to empirically verify the relationships.", "paper_title": "A unified view on clustering binary data", "paper_id": "WOS:000236032400002"}
