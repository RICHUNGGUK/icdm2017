More specifically, we demonstrate how to transfer the domain-dependent heuristics acquired by one planner into a second planner Our motivation is to improve the efficiency and the efficacy of the second planner by allowing it to use the transferred heuristics to capture domain regularities that it would not otherwise recognize. Our experimental results show that the transferred knowledge does improve the second planner's performance on novel tasks over a set of seven benchmark planning domains.", "paper_title": "Knowledge Transfer between Automated Planners", "paper_id": "WOS:000292176400007"}
