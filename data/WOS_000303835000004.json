These macro-level phenomena include fixed points, cycles, dynamic patterns, and long transients. In this paper, I explore the link between micro-level characteristics-learning rules, diversity, network structure, and externalities-and the macro-level patterns they produce. I focus on why we need agent-level modeling, on how these models produce emergent phenomenon, and on how agent-based models help understand outcomes of social systems in a way that differs from the analytic, equilibrium approach.", "paper_title": "Aggregation in agent-based models of economies", "paper_id": "WOS:000303835000004"}
