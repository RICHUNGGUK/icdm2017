We study the valued constraint satisfaction problem parametrized by Gamma, denoted by VCSP(Gamma). These are minimization problems given by n variables and the objective function given by a sum of functions from Gamma, each depending on a subset of the n variables. For example, if D = {0, 1} and Gamma contains all ternary {0,infinity}-valued functions, VCSP(Gamma) corresponds to 3-SAT. More generally, if Gamma contains only {0,infinity}-valued functions, VCSP(Gamma) corresponds to CSP(Gamma). If D = {0, 1} and Gamma contains all ternary {0, 1}-valued functions, VCSP(Gamma) corresponds to Min-3-SAT, in which the goal is to minimize the number of unsatisfied clauses in a 3-CNF instance. Finite-valued constraint languages contain functions that take on only rational values and not infinite values. Our main result is a precise algebraic characterization of valued constraint languages whose instances can be solved exactly by the basic linear programming relaxation (BLP). For a valued constraint language Gamma, BLP is a decision procedure for Gamma if and only if Gamma admits a symmetric fractional polymorphism of every arity. For a finite-valued constraint language Gamma, BLP is a decision procedure if and only if Gamma admits a symmetric fractional polymorphism of some arity, or equivalently, if Gamma admits a symmetric fractional polymorphism of arity 2. Using these results, we obtain tractability of several novel classes of problems, including problems over valued constraint languages that are (1) submodular on arbitrary lattices; (2) k-submodular on arbitrary finite domains; (3) weakly (and hence strongly) tree submodular on arbitrary trees.", "paper_title": "THE POWER OF LINEAR PROGRAMMING FOR GENERAL-VALUED CSPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000353967100001"}
