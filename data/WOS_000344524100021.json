Gray codes are important in the context of the rank modulation scheme, which was suggested recently for representing information in flash memories. For a Gray code in this scheme, the codewords are permutations, two consecutive codewords are obtained using the push-to-thetop operation, and distance measure is defined on permutations. In this paper, the Kendall's tau-metric is used as the distance measure. We present a general method for constructing such Gray codes. We apply the method recursively to obtain a snake of length M2n+1 = ((2n +1)(2n)-1)M2n-1 for permutations of S2n+1, from a snake of length M2n-1 for permutations of S2n-1. Thus, we have lim(n ->infinity) M2n+1/S2n+1 approximate to 0.4338, improving on the previous known ratio of lim(n ->infinity) 1/root(pi n). Using the general method, we also present a direct construction. This direct construction is based on necklaces and it might yield snakes of length (2n + 1)!/2-2n + 1 for permutations of S2n+1. The direct construction was applied successfully for S-7 and S-9, and hence lim M2n+1 S2n+1 approximate to 0.4743.", "paper_title": "Constructions of Snake-in-the-Box Codes for Rank Modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000344524100021"}
