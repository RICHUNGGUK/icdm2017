Researches in this area usually focus on pathology, risk-taking, decision-making and addiction. Few works have been done to demonstrate the distribution of the playing time before players go bankrupt. One problem is that it is difficult to get statistics in real world gambling. In this paper, we do simulations in a Blackjack game with a selected strategy. We find the distribution of playing time before players lose a certain amount of money as a power law distribution, indicating the existence of very long playing time players. We also find that double is the most important factor that causes the fat tail. Comparison shows that when removing double, split and three to two payoff, Blackjack goes back to a random walk. The increase of the number of decks somewhat decreases the average playing time. Our results may have pathologic gambling intervention implications.", "paper_title": "HOW LONG CAN YOU ENJOY BLACKJACK WITH 100 CHIPS?", "paper_id": "WOS:000297308200007"}
