MCLPV_SVM, in contrast to SVM and MCVSVM, takes the intrinsic manifold structure of the data space into full consideration and inherits the characteristics of SVM and MCVSVM. We discuss in the paper the linear case, the small sample size case and the nonlinear case of the MCLPV_SVM. Similar to MCVSVM, the MCLPV_SVM optimization problem in the small sample size case is solved by using dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis (PCA) and one in the nonlinear case is transformed into an equivalent linear MCLPV_SVM problem under kernel PCA (KPCA). Experimental results on real datasets indicate the effectiveness of the MCLPV_SVM by comparing it with SVM and MCVSVM. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
