We derive general formulae for second order biases of the maximum likelihood estimators and use them to define bias-corrected estimators. Our formulae generalize the results obtained by Ospina et al. (2006), and are easily implemented by means of supplementary weighted linear regressions. We compare, by simulation, these bias-corrected estimators with three different estimators which are also bias-free to second order: one analytical, and two based on bootstrap methods. The simulation also suggests that one should prefer to estimate a nonlinear model, which is linearizable, directly in its nonlinear form. Our results additionally indicate that, whenever possible, dispersion covariates should be considered during the selection of the model, as we exemplify with two empirical applications. Finally, we also present simulation results on confidence intervals. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
