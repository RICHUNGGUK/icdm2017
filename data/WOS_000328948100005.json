The algorithm is implemented in two major steps: contour manifold construction and object motion synthesis. Contour manifold construction searches for low-dimensional manifolds that represent the temporal-domain deformation of the reference motion sequence. Since the derived manifolds capture the motion information of the reference sequence, the representation is more robust to variations in shape and size. With this compact representation, we can easily modify and manipulate human motions through interpolation or extrapolation in the contour manifold space. In the object motion synthesis step, the proposed algorithm generates a sequence of new shapes of the input human object in the contour manifold space and then renders the textures of those shapes to synthesize a new motion sequence. We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm on different types of practical applications, namely, motion extrapolation and motion repair.", "paper_title": "Example-Based Human Motion Extrapolation and Motion Repairing Using Contour Manifold", "paper_id": "WOS:000328948100005"}
