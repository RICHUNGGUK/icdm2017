In particular, the design of eigenstructure assignment is performed without requiring any conditions on the closed-loop eigenvalues, and provides a simple, complete and analytical parametric approach as well as the most degrees of design freedom for the eigenstructure assignment problem of linear parameter-varying systems. A parameter-varying attitude control system of refueling spacecraft in-orbit is used to demonstrate the usefulness and practicality of the proposed approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
