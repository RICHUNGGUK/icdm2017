In addition, the answer is minimal because any proper subgraph can not be an answer to the query. We provide an approximation algorithm to retrieve these answers efficiently. A special ranking strategy is also proposed so that answers can be appropriately ordered. The experimental results over real datasets show that our model outperforms existing possible solutions with respect to effectiveness and efficiency. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
