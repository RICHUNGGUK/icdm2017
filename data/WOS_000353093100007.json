The algorithm decides equivalence of two given regular expressions through an iterated process of testing the equivalence of their partial derivatives and does not require the construction of the corresponding automata. Recent theoretical and experimental research provides evidence that this method is, on average, more efficient than the classical methods based on automata. We present some performance tests, comparisons with similar approaches, and also introduce a generalization of the algorithm to decide the equivalence of terms of Kleene algebra with tests. The motivation for the work presented in this paper is that of using the libraries developed as trusted frameworks for carrying out certified program verification. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
