The temporal relationships among those durable events are often complex. Processing such complex events has become increasingly important in applications of wireless networks. An important issue of complex event processing is to extract patterns from event streams to support decision making in real-time. However, network latencies and machine failures in wireless networks may cause events to be out-of-order. In this work, we analyze the preliminaries of event temporal semantics. A tree-plan model of out-of-order durable events is proposed. A hybrid solution is correspondingly introduced. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.
