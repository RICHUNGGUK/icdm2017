In particular, if C is unsatisfiable, then (i) implies that C' is unsatisfiable. The Valiant-Vazirani procedure is randomized, and when C is satisfiable, it produces a uniquely satisfiable circuit C' with probability Omega(1/n). Is it possible to have an efficient deterministic witness-isolating procedure? Or, at least, is it possible to improve the success probability of a randomized procedure to a large constant? We prove that there exists a non-uniform randomized polynomial-time witness-isolating procedure with success probability bigger than 2/3 if and only if NP P/poly. We establish similar results for other variants of witness isolation, such as reductions that remove all but an odd number of satisfying assignments of a satisfiable circuit. We also consider a blackbox setting of witness isolation that generalizes the setting of the Valiant-Vazirani Isolation Lemma and give an upper bound of O(1/n) on the success probability for a natural class of randomized witness-isolating procedures.", "paper_title": "Is Valiant-Vazirani's isolation probability improvable?", "paper_id": "WOS:000319168000006"}
