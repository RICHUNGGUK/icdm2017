The free-form deformation algorithm is a well-established technique, but is extremely time consuming. In this paper we present a parallel-friendly formulation of the algorithm suitable for graphics processing unit execution. Using our approach we perform registration of T1-weighted MR images in less than 1min and show the same level of accuracy as a classical serial implementation when performing segmentation propagation. This technology could be of significant utility in time-critical applications such as image-guided interventions, or in the processing of large data sets. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
