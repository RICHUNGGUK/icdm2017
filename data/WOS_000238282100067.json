This method can quickly obtain the global optimal clustering with a clonal operator which combines evolutionary search, global search, stochastic search and local search, then detect abnormal network behavioral patterns with a fuzzy detection algorithm. Simulation results on the data set KDD CUP99 show that this method can efficiently detect unknown intrusions with lower false positive rate and higher detection rate.", "paper_title": "A novel fuzzy anomaly detection method based on clonal selection clustering algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100067"}
