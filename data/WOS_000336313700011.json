In this paper, a novel scheme for the fast face recognition is presented via extreme learning machine (ELM) and sparse coding. The common feature hypothesis is first introduced to extract the basis function from the local universal images, and then the single hidden layer feedforward network (SLFN) is established to simulate the sparse coding process for the face images by ELM algorithm. Some developments have been done to maintain the efficient inherent information embedding in the ELM learning. The resulting local sparse coding coefficient will then be grouped into the global representation and further fed into the ELM ensemble which is composed of a number of SLFNs for face recognition. The simulation results have shown the good performance in the proposed approach that could be comparable to the state-of-the-art techniques at a much higher speed.", "paper_title": "Fast Face Recognition Via Sparse Coding and Extreme Learning Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000336313700011"}
