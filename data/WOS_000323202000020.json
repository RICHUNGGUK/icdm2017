Firstly, a novel differential-integral loop transformation framework is developed to achieve an augmented singular system model. Secondly, by constructing a new passive output derivative operator of hysteresis nonlinearity and establishing the bound condition of the solution of ferromagnetic hysteresis model, the equivalent absolute stability criterion of singular systems with hysteresis feedback is derived based on KYP method and LMIs technique. Furthermore, the strict LMIs conditions for absolute stabilization are obtained, which can easily be checked by the LMI toolbox in MATLAB. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Absolute stabilization of singular systems with ferromagnetic hysteresis nonlinearity", "paper_id": "WOS:000323202000020"}
