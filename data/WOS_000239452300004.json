In contrast with standard numerical procedures, this method requires only a few cost function evaluations to obtain gradient information, and can therefore be advantageously applied when identifying a large number of unknown model parameters, as for instance in neural network models or first-principles models. In this paper, a first-order SPSA algorithm is introduced, which makes use of adaptive gain sequences, gradient smoothing and a step rejection procedure to enhance convergence and stability. The algorithm performance is illustrated with the estimation of the most-likely kinetic parameters and initial conditions of a bioprocess model describing the evolution of batch animal cell cultures.", "paper_title": "A short note on SPSA techniques and their use in nonlinear bioprocess identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000239452300004"}
