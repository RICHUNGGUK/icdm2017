We use the Walsh decomposition of pseudo-Boolean functions and properties of Krawtchouk matrices to exactly compute the expected value for the fitness of a child generated by uniform crossover followed by bit-flip mutation from two parent solutions. We prove that this expectation is a polynomial in rho, the probability of selecting the best-parent bit in the crossover, and mu, the probability of flipping a bit in the mutation. We provide efficient algorithms to compute this polynomial for Onemax and MAX-SAT problems, but the results also hold for other problems such as NK-Landscapes. We also analyze the features of the expectation surfaces. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
