A spin valve model with special gridding corresponding to the exchange interaction length is proposed to study the influence of easy axes, exchange coefficients, pinning fields and feature widths on magnetization reversals and hysteresis characteristics of nano-sized GMRs with different pinned layer and free layer materials of Co, NiFe and Ni. The switching field is found to be almost linear with the pinning field and decrease with the absolute exchange coefficients and the feature widths for the nano-sized GMRs. The increase rate of each depends on the spin valve stacks. Further investigations into variations of the magnetization distribution reveal that the initial magnetization distribution and the magnetization reversal mode depend greatly on easy axes and materials The dependence on easy axes based mainly on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy is illustrated in detail.", "paper_title": "Modeling and analysis of nano-sized GMRs based on Co, NiFe and Ni materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000330681500020"}
