Topological analysis of a scalar function defined on the surface and its associated gradient field reveals the relationship between the features of interest and critical points of the scalar function. The segmentation is obtained by associating segments with local minima/maxima. Controlled simplification of the function merges segments resulting in a hierarchical segmentation of the molecular surface. This segmentation is used to identify rigid components of protein molecules and to study the role of cavities and protrusions in protein-protein interactions. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
