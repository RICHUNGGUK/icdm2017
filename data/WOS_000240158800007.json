This step may be performed using CAD systems and geometrical specifications defined by ISO standards. The present paper will describe the complete process involved in functional tolerancing. The CLIC tolerancing method has been implemented within an Excel software environment. CAD models for parts have been imported via a STEP interface. According to this approach, the designer describes the assembly process; the CLIC system then determines the functional requirements corresponding to the joints between parts and generates all datum reference frames and tolerancing of set-up surfaces in compliance with ISO standards. CLIC also determines both the geometrical conditions of minimum distances in order to avoid interference between parts and the conditions for assembling small standard components. The designer next adds other functional requirements. For each such requirement, a tolerancing process creates location and orientation specifications for influential parts using datum reference frames derived during the previous stage. Excel formulae focusing on the sum of tolerances are generated using a three-dimensional statistical approach. Moreover, the tolerance database allows optimizing the tolerances and nominal dimensions of parts. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
