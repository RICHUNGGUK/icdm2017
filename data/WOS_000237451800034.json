We suggest a method for recognizing antigens (generating such antibodies) via Singular Value Decomposition of a real-valued matrix obtained by preprocessing a database of connection logs [9]. New incoming connection requests are recognized by the antibodies as either self (normal request), or non-self (potential attack), by (a) mapping them into a k-dimensional shape space, and (b) evaluating the minimum Hamming distance between their image and that of a known attack logs. It is easy to see that using a shape space of dimension greater than 2 significantly reduces false positives.", "paper_title": "Profiling network attacks via AIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000237451800034"}
