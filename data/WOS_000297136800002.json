The main use case envisioned for GridCertLib, is to provide seamless and secure access to Grid X.509 certificates and proxies in web applications and portals: when a user logs in to the portal using SAML-based Shibboleth authentication, GridCertLib uses the SAML assertion to obtain a Grid X.509 certificate from the SLCS service and generate a VOMS proxy from it. We give an overview of the architecture of GridCertLib and briefly describe its programming model. Its application to some deployment scenarios is outlined, as well as a report on practical experience integrating GridCertLib into portals for Bioinformatics and Computational Chemistry applications, based on the popular P-GRADE and Django softwares.", "paper_title": "GridCertLib: A Single Sign-on Solution for Grid Web Applications and Portals", "paper_id": "WOS:000297136800002"}
