We propose a technique to eliminate transient ultrasonic wave reflections from the boundary of a small simulation model in order to simulate a larger structure in a computationally efficient manner. We also propose a coupled solid-fluid (concrete-air) model to simulate contactless air coupled sensing configuration. The proposed techniques are implemented within a commercially available FE analysis software package, although the presented results and findings are intended to be universal to all FE simulations. The simulation results compare favorably to experimental data, an analytical solution, and another computational solution. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
