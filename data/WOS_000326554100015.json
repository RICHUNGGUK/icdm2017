However, the experiences of practical software development have empirically confirmed the existences of other causes for code-similarity. Existing practices usually overemphasis the casual relationship between code-similarity and plagiarism, but ignore the importance to make students understand other causes that also contribute to code-similarity. This paper presents an active learning method to involve students and instructors collaboratively in finding causes of code-similarity occurred in programming assignments. The result shows that most causes occurred in programming assignments are positive. Students can learn the different causes of code-similarity with pros and cons during conducting the active learning method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
