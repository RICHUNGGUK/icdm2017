This has resulted in reliance of help desks to support users in dealing with a wide range of information technology-related problems such as hardware, software and telecommunication. The help desk generally has to cover a wide range of information technology products and services. However, due to resource constraint, in particular the lack of help desk staff, users often have to wait for a long time before their enquiries and problems are answered and solved. Literature has shown that the majority of incoming enquiries are considered to be \"simple and routine\", and do not require specialized knowledge. The aim of this paper is to present the results of a survey that identifies the classification of simple and routine technical enquiries in a help desk environment. This paper also discusses the development of help desks, ranging from support models to support structure.", "paper_title": "Information technology help desk survey: To identify the classification of simple and routine enquiries", "paper_id": "WOS:000248292900008"}
