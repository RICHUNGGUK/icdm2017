There is often significant financial incentive to use a robot (or a botnet) to artificially create fake views. How can we detect fake views? Can we detect them (and stop them) efficiently? What is the extent of fake views with current VoD service providers? These are the questions we study in this article. We develop some algorithms and show that they are quite effective for this problem.", "paper_title": "Analysis and Detection of Fake Views in Online Video Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000350567000004"}
