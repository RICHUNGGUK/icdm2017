TIN, a recursive acronym for 'TIN Is Not commercial', is a virtual combinatorial database enumeration of diversity-orientated multicomponent syntheses (MCR). Using a 'one-pot' synthetic technique, 12 unique small molecule scaffolds were developed, predominantly styrylisoxazoles and bis-acetylenic ketones, with extensive derivatization potential. Importantly, the scaffolds were accessible in a single operation from commercially available sources containing R-groups which were then linked combinatorially. This resulted in a combinatorial database of over 28 million product structures, each of which is synthetically feasible, These structures can be accessed through a free Web-based 2D structure search engine or downloaded in SMILES, MOL2, and SDF formats. Subsets include a 10% diversity subset, a drug-like subset, and a lead-like subset that are also freely available for download and virtual screening (http://mmg.rcstie:8080/tin).", "paper_title": "TIN - A Combinatorial Compound Collection of Synthetically Feasible Multicomponent Synthesis Products", "paper_id": "WOS:000290747300002"}
