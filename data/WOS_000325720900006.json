Fuzzy c-partitions are generally an extension of hard c-partitions. It was claimed that this was more robust. However, the fuzzy CML still lacks some robustness as a clustering algorithm, such as its in-ability to detect different volumes of clusters, its heavy dependence on parameter initializations and the necessity to provide an a priori cluster number. In this paper, we construct a robust fuzzy CML clustering framework that has a robust clustering method. The eigenvalue decomposition of a covariance matrix is firstly considered using the fuzzy CML model. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is then used for model selection, in order to choose the best model with the optimal number of clusters. Therefore, the proposed robust fuzzy CML clustering framework exhibits clustering characteristics that are robust in terms of the parameter initialization, robust in terms of the cluster number and also in terms of its capability to detect different volumes of clusters. Numerical examples and real data applications with comparisons are provided, which demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A ROBUST FUZZY CLASSIFICATION MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD CLUSTERING FRAMEWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000325720900006"}
