The stack model is defined syntactically and without any complexity limitations and hence our approximation bounds are independent of the P versus NP question. Using the stack model, we bound the performance of a broad class of primal-dual and local-ratio algorithms and supply a (log n + 1)/2 inapproximability result for set cover, a 4/3 inapproximability for min Steiner tree, and a 0.913 inapproximability for interval scheduling on two machines.", "paper_title": "How Well Can Primal-Dual and Local-Ratio Algorithms Perform?", "paper_id": "WOS:000293799400002"}
