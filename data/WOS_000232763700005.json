When decisions involve ordinal classes, the rough set reduction process should try to preserve the order relation generated by the decision classes. Previous works on rough sets when applied to ordinal decision systems still focus on preserving the information relating to the decision classes and not the underlying order relation. In this paper, we propose a new way of evaluating and finding reducts involving ordinal decision classes which focus on the order generated by the ordinal decision classes.", "paper_title": "Rough sets and ordinal reducts", "paper_id": "WOS:000232763700005"}
