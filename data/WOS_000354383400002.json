The SPH scheme is based on the continuity equation approach where the densities of SPH particles are evolved during the simulation, in combination with a momentum equation previously proposed in the literature. A series of simulations were carried out to investigate the influence of viscosity, smoothing, the thickness of density and velocity transition layers. It was found that the effective viscosity of the presented results are strongly dependent on the artificial viscosity parameter (AV), with a linear dependence of 0.15. The utilisation of a viscosity switch is found to significantly reduce the spurious viscosity dependence to 1.68 x 10(-4) and generated qualitatively improved behaviour for inviscid fluids. The linear growth rate in the numerical solutions is found to be in satisfactory agreement with analytical expectations, with an average relative error (smooth)=13%. In addition, the role played by velocity and density transition layers is also in general agreement with the analytical theory, except for the sharp-velocity, finite-density gradient cases where the larger growth rate than the classical growth rate is expected. We argue the inherited smoothing properties of the velocity field during the simulations are responsible for causing this discrepancy. Finally, the SPH results are in good agreement for finite velocity and density gradient scenarios, where an average relative error of (smooth)=11.5% is found in our work.
