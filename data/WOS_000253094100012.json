A new continualization procedure that refers to the non-local interaction between variables of the discrete media is proposed. The proposed procedure covers mainly the application of two-point Pade approximations and allows us to obtain continuous models suitable for analysis of 2D lattice vibrations with arbitrary frequencies.
