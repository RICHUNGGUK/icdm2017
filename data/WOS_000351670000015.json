One of the challenging issues in this domain is routing protocols. VANETs' unique characteristics such as high mobility with the constraint of road topology, fast network topology changes, frequently disconnected networks, and time-sensitive data exchange makes it difficult to design an efficient routing protocol for routing data in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Designing routing protocols for V2V commutations are more challenging due to the absence of infrastructure nodes in the communication procedure. They become even more challenging, when they get benefit from dynamic anchor computation method in which the anchor nodes (junctions or basic nodes for routing) are dynamic in their routing procedure. Position-based routing protocols have been proven to be superior and outperform the other protocols since there is no requirement to establish and save a route between source and destination during the routing process which is suitable for dynamic nature of vehicular networks. In this paper, the performance of V2V dynamic anchor position-based routing protocols, which are proposed for the most challenging condition of packet routing in VANET, are investigated and evaluated under two different scenarios (i.e. various vehicle densities and velocities) through NS-2. The obtained results are then illustrated based on average delay, packet delivery ratio and routing overhead as routing performance indicators. Our objective is to provide a quantitative assessment of the applicability of these protocols in different vehicular scenarios. The comparison provided in this paper makes the research contribution of this survey paper quite higher than a regular survey paper only with explanations.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of V2V dynamic anchor position-based routing protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000351670000015"}
