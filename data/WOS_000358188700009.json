Rev. A 88, 012307 (2013)]. This formula allows us to numerically find the time-energy cost of any quantum channel using positive semidefinite programming. We also derive a lower bound to the time-energy cost for any channels and the exact the time-energy cost for a class of channels which includes the qudit depolarizing channels and projector channels as special cases.", "paper_title": "SOLUTION TO TIME-ENERGY COSTS OF QUANTUM CHANNELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000358188700009"}
