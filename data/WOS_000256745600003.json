We contend that ERP implementation success is positively related with organizational culture along the dimensions of learning and development, participative decision making, power sharing, support and collaboration, and tolerance for risk and conflicts. In addition, we identify the strategic and tactical actions that the top management can take to influence organizational culture and foster a culture conducive to ERP implementation. The theoretical contributions and managerial implications of this study are discussed.
