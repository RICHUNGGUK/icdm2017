By forbidding certain sets of configurations from arising in these orthogonal arrays, this construction yields previously unknown perfect, separating, and distributing hash families. When the strength s of the orthogonal array, the strength t of the hash family, and the number of its rows are all specified, the forbidden sets of configurations can be determined explicitly. Each forbidden set leads to a set of equations that must simultaneously hold. Hence computational techniques can be used to determine sufficient conditions for a perfect, separating, and distributing hash family to exist. In this paper the forbidden configurations, resulting equations, and existence results are determined when (s, t). {(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (4, 3)}. Applications to the existence of covering arrays of strength at most six are presented.", "paper_title": "Linear hash families and forbidden configurations", "paper_id": "WOS:000264478700003"}
