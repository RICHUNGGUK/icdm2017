Based on this upper bound of the L-2-gain, the L-2-stability of the above T-S fuzzy control system is next investigated by using the small gain theorem and circle criterion. Two sufficient conditions are derived, which can be employed to graphically investigate the L-2-stability of certain kind of T-S fuzzy control system in the frequency domain. One numerical example is presented to illustrate how the L-2-stability of the simplified continuous-time T-S fuzzy system can be graphically examined. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
