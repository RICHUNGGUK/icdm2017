We discuss circumstantial evidence suggesting that Danish is intrinsically poorly intelligible. We then report on a formal experiment in which we tested the intelligibility of Danish and Swedish materials spoken by three representative male speakers per language (isolated cognate and non-cognate words, words in semantically unpredictable sentences, words in spontaneous interaction in map tasks) presented in descending levels of noise to native listeners of Danish (N = 18) and Swedish (N = 24), respectively. The results show that Danish is as intelligible to Danish listeners as Swedish is to Swedish listeners. In a separate task, the same listeners recognized the same materials (presented without noise) in the neighboring language. The asymmetry that has traditionally been claimed was indeed found, even when differences in familiarity with the non-native language were controlled for. Possible reasons for the asymmetry are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Is spoken Danish less intelligible than Swedish?", "paper_id": "WOS:000285126700014"}
