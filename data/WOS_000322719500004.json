In order to study the performance of the BV optical networks, we propose a BV extension to RSVP-TE signaling protocol and implement it with different routing schemes on our large-scale ASON test-bed. Results show that the adaptive routing (AR) combined with forward reservation RSVP-TE signaling (AR+RSVP-fBV) scheme has lower routing blocking probability; however, since its signaling blocking probability is higher than the fixed routing (FR) combined with backward reservation RSVP-TE signaling (FR+RSVP-bBV) scheme, it has no significant advantage in the overall blocking performance, especially in a highly dynamic network scenario. The introduction of spectrum conversion cannot improve the overall blocking performance significantly due to its higher signaling blocking probability, and worse yet, it increases setup delay.", "paper_title": "Experimenting with bandwidth-variable routing and signaling on a large-scale ASON test-bed", "paper_id": "WOS:000322719500004"}
