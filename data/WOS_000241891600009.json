To improve the resolving power, double or triple cascade spectrophotometer, and narrow slits have been employed, but the total flux of the radiation available decreases accordingly, resulting in a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a longer measure time. However, the spectral resolution can be improved by mathematically removing the effect of the instrument response function. An independent component analysis based algorithm is proposed to blindly deconvolve the measured spectroscopic data. The true spectrum and the instrument response function are estimated simultaneously. In the preprocessing stage, the noise can be reduced in some degree. Experiments on some real measured spectroscopic data demonstrate the feasibility of this method.", "paper_title": "Independent component analysis based blind deconvolution of spectroscopic data", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600009"}
