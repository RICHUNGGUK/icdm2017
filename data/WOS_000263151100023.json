In this paper we study thermomechanical behavior of a truss component; namely, a triangular frame consisting of two thin-walled circular beams connected through a joint. Transverse and axial mechanical motions of the beams are coupled though a mechanical joint. The nature of the external solar load suggests a decomposition of the temperature fields in the beams leading to two heat equations for each beam. One of these fields models the circumferential average temperature and is coupled to axial motions of the beam, while the second field accounts for a temperature gradient across the beam and is coupled to beam bending. The resulting system of partial and ordinary differential equations formally describes the coupled thermomechanical behavior of the joint-beam system. The main work is in developing an appropriate state-space form and then using semigroup theory to establish well-posedness and exponential stability. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
