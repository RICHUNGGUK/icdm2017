Developing green deployment schemes for IoT is a challenging issue since IoT achieves a larger scale and becomes more complex so that most of the current schemes for deploying wireless sensor networks (WSNs) cannot be transplanted directly in IoT. This paper addresses this challenging issue by proposing a deployment scheme to achieve green networked IoT. The contributions made in this paper include: 1) a hierarchical system framework for a general IoT deployment, 2) an optimization model on the basis of proposed system framework to realize green IoT, and 3) a minimal energy consumption algorithm for solving the presented optimization model. The numerical results on minimal energy consumption and network lifetime of the system indicate that the deployment scheme proposed in this paper is more flexible and energy efficient compared to typical WSN deployment scheme; thus is applicable to the green IoT deployment.", "paper_title": "A Novel Deployment Scheme for Green Internet of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000209672100009"}
