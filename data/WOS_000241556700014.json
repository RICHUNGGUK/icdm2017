The GGM consists of a fixed number of vertices that can be registered non-linearly to an individual anatomy so that for each individual we have a clearly defined set of landmarks that is spread across the cortex. This allows us to obtain a regionalized estimation of inter-subject variability. Since the GGM is stratified into different levels of depth, it also allows us to estimate variability as a function of depth. As another application of a polygonal line representation underlying the generic gyral model, we present a cortical parcellation scheme that can be used to regionalize cortical measurements.", "paper_title": "Investigating cortical variability using a generic gyral model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700014"}
