There is only one transmittal delay in the delayed coupling. The fact is that in the signal transmission process, the time delay affects only the variable that is being transmitted from one system to another, so assume that there is only one single time-varying delay coupling is more consistent with the reality. At the same time, the internal delay and coupling delay are time-varying and different. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, a feedback controller is designed for achieving synchronization between two coupled networks with time-varying delays in finite time. Finally, simulation examples are given to illustrate the theoretical analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
