While this information is widely available on the Web, it is most commonly published using proprietary Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The Linked Data community is aiming at resolving the incompatibilities between these diverse data sources by building a Web of data using Semantic Web technologies. The OMRAS2 project has made several important contributions to this by developing an ontological framework and numerous software tools, as well as publishing music related data on the Semantic Web. These data and tools have found their use even beyond their originally intended scope. In this paper, we first provide a broad overview of the Semantic Web technologies underlying this work. We describe the Music Ontology, an open-ended framework for communicating musical information on the Web, and show how this framework can be extended to describe specific sub-domains such as music similarity, content-based audio features, musicological data and studio production. We describe several data-sets that have been published and data sources that have been adapted using this framework. Finally, we provide application examples ranging from software libraries to end user Web applications.", "paper_title": "An Overview of Semantic Web Activities in the OMRAS2 Project", "paper_id": "WOS:000288434100002"}
