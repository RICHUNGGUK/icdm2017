We introduced ail entropy metric into an ant-based Clustering algorithm and compared it with other closely related algorithms using local density. The results strongly support the value of entropy metrics, obtaining faster and more accurate results. Entropy governs the pickup and drop behaviors, while movement is guided by the density gradient. Entropy measures also require fewer training parameters than density-based Clustering. The remaining parameters are Subjected to robustness Studies, and a detailed analysis is performed. In the second phase of the study, we further investigated Ramos and Abraham's (In: Proc 2003 IEEE Congr Evol Comput, Hoboken, NJ: IEEE Press 2003. pp 1370-1375) contention that ant-based methods are particularly suited to incremental clustering. Contrary to expectations, we did not find substantial differences between the efficiencies of incremental and nonincremental approaches to data clustering.
