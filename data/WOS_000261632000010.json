This article presents alternative expressions for the GV and GGT, which are independent of the derivatives, and are also non-singular. By using such expressions, it suffices to compute the ALF to two additional degrees and orders, instead of computing the first and the second derivatives of all the ALF. Therefore, the formulas are suitable for computer programming. Matlab software as well as an output of a numerical computation around the North Pole is also presented based on the derived formulas.
