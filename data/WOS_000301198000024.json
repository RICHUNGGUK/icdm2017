However, MRI-based motion modeling remains challenging due to the difficulty of acquiring multiple motion-free 3-D respiratory phases with adequate contrast and spatial resolution. Here, we propose a novel retrospective respiratory gating scheme from a 3-D undersampled high-resolution MRI acquisition combined with fast and robust image registrations to model the nonrigid deformation of the liver. The acquisition takes advantage of the recently introduced golden-radial phase encoding (G-RPE) trajectory. G-RPE is self-gated, i.e., the respiratory signal can be derived from the acquired data itself, and allows retrospective reconstructions of multiple respiratory phases at any arbitrary respiratory position. Nonrigid motion modeling is applied to predict the liver deformation of an average breathing cycle. The proposed approach was validated on 10 healthy volunteers. Motion model accuracy was assessed using similarity-, surface-, and landmark-based validation methods, demonstrating precise model predictions with an overall target registration error of TRE = 1.70 +/- 0.94 mm which is within the range of the acquired resolution.", "paper_title": "Nonrigid Motion Modeling of the Liver From 3-D Undersampled Self-Gated Golden-Radial Phase Encoded MRI", "paper_id": "WOS:000301198000024"}
