We derive the simplified spherical harmonics equations up to order N=7 for anisotropic scattering and partially reflective boundary conditions. We compare numerical results with diffusion and discrete ordinates transport solutions. We find that the simplified spherical harmonics methods significantly improve the diffusion solution in transport-like domains with high absorption and small geometries, and are computationally less expensive than the discrete ordinates transport method. For example, the simplified P-3 method is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than the discrete ordinates transport method, but only 2.5 times computationally more! demanding than the diffusion method. We conclude that the simplified spherical harmonics methods can accurately model light propagation in small tissue geometries at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, yielding transport-like solutions with only a fraction of the computational cost of the transport calculation.
