The computational simplicity of SSQM, which uses first-order information, makes it suitable for large scale problems. Theoretical results under standard assumptions are given proving that the whole sequence built by the algorithm converges to a solution and becomes feasible after a finite number of iterations. When in addition the objective function is strongly convex then asymptotic linear rate of convergence is established.", "paper_title": "A very simple SQCQP method for a class of smooth convex constrained minimization problems with nice convergence results", "paper_id": "WOS:000330038100012"}
