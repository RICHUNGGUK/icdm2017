However, conventional cross-layer designs all require channel state information at the base station (CSIT) which is difficult to obtain in practice. In this paper, we focus on cross-layer resource optimization based on ACK/NAK feedback flows in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems without explicit CSIT. While the problem can be modeled as Markov decision process (MDP), brute-force approach by policy iteration or value iteration cannot lead to any viable solution. Thus, we derive a simple closed-form solution for the MDP cross-layer problem, which is asymptotically optimal for sufficiently small target packet error rate (PER). The proposed solution also has low complexity and is suitable for real-time implementation. It is also shown to achieve significant performance gain compared with systems that do not utilize the ACK/NAK feedbacks for cross-layer designs or cross-layer systems that utilize very unreliable CSIT for adaptation with mismatch in CSIT error statistics. Asymptotic analysis is also provided to obtain useful design insights.", "paper_title": "Cross-Layer Design of FDD-OFDM Systems Based on ACK/NAK Feedbacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000269839000014"}
