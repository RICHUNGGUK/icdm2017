The paper also gives the small mock-up design of the matrix FCL and its finite element model (REM,). It also discusses the limitations of the FEM and explains how the results from the FEM compare with the experimental data derived for the configuration. A 3-dimensional FEM has been used because of the structure of the real geometry, which does not show any plane or axisymmetric features.", "paper_title": "Finite element modeling of a superconducting fault current limiter", "paper_id": "WOS:000309698800002"}
