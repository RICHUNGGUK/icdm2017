The advantages of this approach are the ease of representing each membrane with a processing element and the perspective of exploiting the expected nano-technological implementation of such an architecture. By combining these two non-conventional computing architectures, we touch interesting subproblems, such as the trade-off between being synchronous (P systems) and asynchronous (BME), or between structural adjacency and position-independent communications.", "paper_title": "A membrane computing system mapped on an asynchronous, distributed computational environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000235807300011"}
