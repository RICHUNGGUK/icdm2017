In this problem, we are given a strip of fixed width and unbounded height, and n items of C different classes. As in the well-known two-dimensional Strip Packing problem, we have to pack all items minimizing the used height, but now we have the additional constraint that items of higher classes cannot block the way out of lower classes items. This problem appears as a sub-problem in the Two-Dimensional Loading Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (2L-CVRP), where one has to optimize the delivery of goods, demanded by a set of clients, that are transported by a fleet of vehicles of limited capacity based at a central depot. We propose two approximation algorithms and a GRASP heuristic for the SPU problem and provide an extensive computational experiment with these algorithms using well know instances for the 2L-CVRP problem as well as new instances adapted from the Strip Packing problem.
