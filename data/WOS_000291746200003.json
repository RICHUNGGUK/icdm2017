Two kinds of maximum distance separable codes are studied. We determine all possible parameters of these codes and characterize the codes in certain cases. The main results are also valid when alpha = 0, namely for quaternary linear codes.", "paper_title": "Maximum distance separable codes over Z(4) and Z(2) x Z(4)", "paper_id": "WOS:000291746200003"}
