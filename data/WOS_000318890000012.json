We then build the first self-index based on LZ77 (or LZ-End) compression, which in addition to text extraction offers fast indexed searches on the compressed text. This self-index is particularly effective for representing highly repetitive sequence collections, which arise for example when storing versioned documents, software repositories, periodic publications, and biological sequence databases.
