In the present study, the molecular basis governing PKB-selective inhibition has been investigated using molecular dynamics simulation. The binding free energies calculated by MM/PBSA gave a good correlation with the experimental biological activity and a good explanation of the activity difference of the studied inhibitors. The decomposition of free energies by MM/GBSA indicates that the ethyl group on pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine ring of inhibitor Lig1 (N-{[(3S)-3-amino-1-(5-ethyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)pyrrolidin-3-yl]-methyl}-2,4-difluoro-benzamide) is an important contributor to its PKB alpha selectivity due to its hydrophobic interaction with the side chain of Thr291 in PKB alpha. The substituted groups on the pyrrolidine ring of Lig1 also show a strong tendency to mediate protein-ligand interactions through the hydrogen bonds formed between the amino or amide groups of Lig1 and the carboxyl O atoms of Glu234, Glu278, and Asp292 of PKB alpha. It was reported that there are only three key amino acid differences between PKB alpha (Thr211, Ala230, Met281) and PKA (Val104, Val123, Leu173) within the clefts of ATP-binding sites. These differences propel a drastic conformational change in PKA, weakening its binding interactions with inhibitor. The impact was also confirmed by MD simulated interaction modes of inhibitor binding to PKB alpha mutants with the in silico mutations of the three key amino acids, respectively. We expect that the results obtained here could be useful for future rational design of specific ATP-competitive inhibitors of PKB alpha.", "paper_title": "Binding selectivity studies of PKB alpha using molecular dynamics simulation and free energy calculations", "paper_id": "WOS:000326193200048"}
