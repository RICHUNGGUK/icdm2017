A mathematical formula representing the expected average cost per unit time is derived, and some properties are obtained to establish an efficient solution procedure. Since there is no closed-form expression for the optimal production run length, an approximate solving approach is presented. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the procedure of searching the optimal solutions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
