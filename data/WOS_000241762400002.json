Mathematical model based on discrete-time Markov chain is presented and analyzed to measure the performance of the proposed mechanisms. Numerical results show that the delicate, tuning of throughput could be performed by differentiation by backoff exponent while differentiation by the size of contention window gives more effect for differentiation of throughput.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of service differentiation for IEEE 802.15.4 slotted CSMA/CA", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762400002"}
