The proposed architecture addresses the current reliability, computational and quality drawbacks of a conventional centralized based video combiner architecture. This is achieved by redesigning the MCU video to move away the video combiner from the bridge and into the client endpoints. Moreover, the proposed architecture represents a serverless system and is able to scale a large number of clients at high resolutions in a multipoint video conferencing session. In order to realize this design, this paper also proposes a custom robust sustainable session management protocol which allows a dynamic multi-port management between the MCU video and client endpoints. In addition, the proposed custom session management protocol includes recommendation for a session protection structure. Experimental results suggest that the proposed architecture exhibits significant computational frame rate performance gains of up to 762.95% in comparison with the conventional centralized video combiner architecture based on a series of four and eight high definition combined video assessments. Moreover, reliability analysis suggests that the proposed architecture is also able to consistently sustain a high frame rate performance within a long duration high definition multipoint video conferencing session.
