This has resulted in a situation Where many WLAN networks use default or suboptimal channel assignments, leading to poor performance, and uneven spectrum usage. In this article, we introduce a number of frequency assignment techniques based oil graph colouring algorithms, and demonstrate their effectiveness using simulations. In particular, we show that the graph colouring based approach produces very good frequency assignments, significantly reducing the number of collisions in the network, leading to substantial capacity improvement. We also suggest a preliminary message format the access points Could employ to exchange information regarding the wireless channel. and elaborate oil the possible protocol architectures that could be used in the actual channel allocation process.", "paper_title": "Frequency Allocation for WLANs Using Graph Colouring Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000205769800002"}
