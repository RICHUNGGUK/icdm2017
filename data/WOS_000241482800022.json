The key idea of the method is to partition the vertex set of a graph randomly into two disjoint sets to separate a solution from the rest of the graph into connected components, and then select appropriate components to form a solution. We can use universal sets to derandomize algorithms obtained from this method. This new method is versatile and powerful as it can be used to solve a wide range of fixed-cardinality optimization problems for degree-bounded graphs, graphs of bounded degeneracy (a large family of graphs that contains degree-bounded graphs, planar graphs, graphs of bounded treewidth, and nontrivial minor-closed families of graphs), and even general graphs.", "paper_title": "Random separation: A new method for solving fixed-cardinality optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241482800022"}
