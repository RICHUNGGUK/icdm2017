Our study starts by defining a PSAT normal form, on which all algorithms are based. The proposed algorithms consist of several forms of reductions of PSAT to classical propositional satisfiability (SAT). The first algorithm is a canonical reduction of PSAT instances to SAT instances; three other algorithms are reductions to linear optimization with distinct column generation procedures, namely on auxiliary calls to SAT, weighted MAXSAT or SMT solvers. Theoretical and practical limitations of each algorithm are discussed. Several implementations were developed and compared by means of experiments using randomly generated input problems. Some of the implementations are shown to present a phase transition behavior. We show that variations of these algorithms may lead to the partial occlusion of the phase transition phenomenon and discuss the reasons for this change ofc practical behavior.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic satisfiability: algorithms with the presence and absence of a phase transition", "paper_id": "WOS:000366805000003"}
