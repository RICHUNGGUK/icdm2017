Because of the almost infinite number of drug-like organic molecules, bench-based experimental chemogenomics methods are not generally feasible. Several in silico chemogenomics models have therefore been developed for high-throughput screening of large numbers of drug candidate compounds and target proteins. In previous studies, we described two novel bi-modal PLS approaches. These methods provide a significant advantage in that they enable direct connections to be made between biological activities and ligand and protein descriptors. In this special issue, we review these two PLS-based approaches using two different chemogenomics datasets for illustration. We then compare the predictive and interpretive performance of the two methods using the same congeneric data set.", "paper_title": "Data Mining of Chemogenomics Data Using Bi-Modal PLS Methods and Chemical Interpretation for Molecular Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000345974300005"}
