Michler, Straight velocity boundaries in the lattice Boltzmann method, Physical Review E 77 (5) (2008) 056703] from straight to curved geometries for the lattice Boltzmann Bhatnager-Gross-Krook method (LBGK). The boundary condition is based on a reconstruction of the populations from the density, velocity and rate of strain. For curved boundaries, the reconstruction reduces the question of accuracy to a technical issue of interpolation. We present a method of interpolation allowing a very accurate representation of the curved boundary. The resulting boundary condition is verified for three different test cases: Taylor-Couette flow in-between rotating cylinders, laminar flow around a cylinder and flow past an impulsively started cylinder, demonstrating its second order accuracy and low error constant. The present boundary is stable for relaxation frequencies close to two. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
