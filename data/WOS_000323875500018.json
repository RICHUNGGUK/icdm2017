In this paper, a general framework for stable semantic ontology measurement is proposed. We first clarify the concepts of syntactic, semantic and stable semantic ontology measurement. Then we present the semantic derived model (SDM) to represent the semantic model of an ontology. By rule based transformation, an ontology can be automatically transformed into its final semantic derived model (FSDM) which is unique. Furthermore, we can measure ontologies based on FSDM by analyzing the types of entities of the existing ontology metrics. The related experiments are made to illustrate that our framework can effectively excavate and stably measure the semantics of ontologies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
