First, a systematic, structural link is established between a basic class of membrane systems and Petri nets. To capture the compartmentisation of membrane systems, localities are proposed as an extension of Petri nets. This leads to a locally maximal concurrency semantics for Petri nets. We indicate how processes for these nets could be defined which should be of use in order to describe what is actually going on during a computation of a membrane system.", "paper_title": "Towards a Petri net semantics for membrane systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235807300020"}
