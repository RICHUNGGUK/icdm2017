The wavelet coefficients are grouped into different block size and blocks are randomly selected from different subbands. We add different energies to the maximum wavelet coefficient under the constraint that the maximum wavelet coefficient is always maximum in a block. The watermark is embedded the local maximum coefficient which can effectively resist attacks. Also, using the block-based watermarking, we can extract the watermark without using the original image or watermark. Experimental results show that the proposed method is quite robust under either non-geometry or geometry attacks. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
