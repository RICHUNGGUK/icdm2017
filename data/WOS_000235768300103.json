This paper addresses a new biometric technology the identification and recognition based on point of blood vessel skeleton for ocular fundus. The image for green gray scale of ocular fundus is utilized. The cross point of skeleton shape of blood vessel for ocular fundus using contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization is extracted at first. After filtering treatment and extracting shape, shape curve of blood vessels is obtained. The cross point of shape for curve matching is later carried out by means of cross point matching. The recognition based on shape for blood vessel of ocular fundus has been demonstrated in this paper to possess high Identification and recognition rate, low rejection recognition rate as well as good universality, exclusiveness and stability. With more and more progress made in extracting technology, the recognition for blood vessel of optic fundus is to become an effective biometric technology.", "paper_title": "The identification and recognition based on point for blood vessel of ocular fundus", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300103"}
