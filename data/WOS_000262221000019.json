In this situation, the system may not properly perform fuzzy reasoning to get reasonable consequences. In order to overcome the drawback of sparse fuzzy rule-based systems, there is an increasing demand to develop fuzzy interpolative reasoning techniques in sparse fuzzy rule-based systems. In this paper, we present a new fuzzy interpolative reasoning method via cutting and transformation techniques for sparse fuzzy rule-based systems. It can produce more reasonable results than the existing methods. The proposed method provides a useful way to deal with fuzzy interpolative reasoning in sparse fuzzy rule-based systems.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Interpolative Reasoning for Sparse Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems Based on alpha-Cuts and Transformations Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000262221000019"}
