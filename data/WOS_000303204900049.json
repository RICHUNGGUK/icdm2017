Our compression and decompression functions can be computed at a negligible cost. In particular, our techniques lead to very efficient exponentiation algorithms that work with the compressed representations of elements and can be easily incorporated into pairing-based protocols that require exponentiations or products of pairings.", "paper_title": "Torus-Based Compression by Factor 4 and 6", "paper_id": "WOS:000303204900049"}
