Such a situation holds if e.g., the measurements are supplied by range sensors rigidly mounted to the vehicle body at nearly right angles, or by a single sensor scanning a nearly perpendicular narrow sector. A sliding mode control law is proposed that drives the robot at a pre-specified distance from the boundary and maintains this distance afterwards. This is achieved without estimation of the boundary curvature and holds for boundaries with both convexities and concavities. Mathematically rigorous analysis of the proposed control law is provided, including an explicit account for the global geometry of the boundary. Computer simulations and experiments with real wheeled robots confirm the applicability and performance of the proposed guidance approach. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
