However, most available environments do not provide risk management process support, to the project manager's activities. This support could be provided through the analysis of the interactions between projects. One of the main weaknesses of the approaches up to now is that risk management process improvement based on the risks between ongoing projects and completed ones is being neglected. In this light, we propose the creation of a Risk Management Model for Multiple Project Environments to treat the risk interactions between projects.", "paper_title": "Multiple risk management process supported by ontology", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485900043"}
