Our protocol coordinates the channel access among a set of relays capable of using network coding in order to minimize the number of the total transmissions, thus enhancing the performance of the network in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) metrics. The proposed solution is compared to other cooperative schemes, while analytical and simulation results are provided to evaluate our protocol. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
