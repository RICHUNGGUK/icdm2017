Since a user may have rights to access only a subset of a KB, the non-monotonic nature of ASP may cause the occurrence of consequences, which are erroneous in the sense that the consequences are not reasonable in the full KB. This paper proposes an approach dealing with the problem. The main idea is to let the usage of Closed World Assumptions (CWAs) for literals in a KB satisfy certain constraints. Two kinds of access right propositions are created, rule retrieval right propositions to control the access to rules, and CWA right propositions to control the usage of CWAs for literals. Based on these right propositions, this paper first defines an algorithm for translating an original KB into a KB tagged by right propositions, and then discusses the right dependency in a KB and proposes methods for checking and obtaining a set of rights that is closed under a set of dependency rules. Finally, several results on the correctness of a set of rights in a KB are presented, which serve as guidelines for the correct use of a KB. As an example, a KB of illness-related financial support for teachers of a university is presented to illustrate the application of our approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
