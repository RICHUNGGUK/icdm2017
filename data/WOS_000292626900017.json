Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such Hoe controllers are parameterized in terms of Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (BMIs). Moreover, some Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) sufficient conditions are also obtained for the problem.", "paper_title": "GENERAL H-infinity CONTROL FOR HADAMARD SYNERGIC CONTROL: A COMPOSITE CONTROL STRATEGY VIA CONNECTION-REGULATION AND FEEDBACK CONTROL", "paper_id": "WOS:000292626900017"}
