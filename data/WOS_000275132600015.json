The paper reviews a number of methods that employ nearby illuminants, and describes a new technique that assumes a rectangular planar nearby distributed uniform isotropic illuminant. It is shown that such a light Source illuminating a small Lambertian Surface patch is equivalent to a single isotropic point light source at infinity, in the absence of shadowing. A closed-form solution is given for the equivalent point light source direction in terms of the illuminant corner locations. Equivalent point light sources can be obtained for distinct illuminant patterns allowing standard photometric stereo algorithms to be used. An extension is given to the case of a rectangular planar illuminant with arbitrary radiance distribution. Experimental results are shown demonstrating the application of the theory to photometric stereo using illumination from a LCD Computer monitor. Details on the photometric calibration of the illumination source and image acquisition device are provided. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
