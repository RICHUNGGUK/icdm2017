The advantages of this approach can be also be applied to distributed real-time systems, increasing their flexibility and allowing the creation of new brand applications from existing services in the system. If this is an online process, then time-bounded composition algorithms are needed to not jeopardize the performance of the whole system. Different composition algorithms are studied and proposed, two of them optimal and another two based on heuristics. This paper presents an analytical solution that selects, depending on the structure of the application and on the load of the whole system, the most suitable composition algorithm to be executed in order to obtain a composed application in bounded time.
