And based on the grey incidence degree theory, the degree of interval number incidence is defined. These extend grey incidence analysis theory from real number sequence to interval number sequence. Design/methodology/approach - Studies the multi-attribute incidence decision-making problems for interval number and models the incidence decision-making model of multi-attribute interval number. Findings - An application example is given based on grey incidence decision model with multi-attribute interval number. Research limitations/implications - This new model can avoid the difficulty of seeking the dummy optimal scheme and the negative optimal scheme, and it regards evaluated scheme as a whole to seek the optimal scheme. Practical implications - It is easy to realizing on computer and the evaluated result is more objective than the results obtained by other methods. Originality/value - Studies multi-attribute decision-making problems.", "paper_title": "Multi-attribute grey incidence decision model for interval number", "paper_id": "WOS:000241260500031"}
