Security and privacy systems have become critical for wireless providers and enterprise networks. This paper considers the problem of secret communication over the Gaussian broadcast channel, where a multiple-antenna transmitter wishes to send independent confidential messages to two users with information-theoretic secrecy. That is, each user would like to obtain its own confidential message in a reliable and safe manner. This communication model is referred to as the multiple-antenna Gaussian broadcast channel with confidential messages (MGBC-CM). Under this communication scenario, a secret dirty-paper coding scheme and the corresponding achievable secrecy rate region are first developed based on Gaussian codebooks. Next, a computable Sato-type outer bound on the secrecy capacity region is provided for the MGBC-CM. Furthermore, the Sato-type outer bound proves to be consistent with the boundary of the secret dirty-paper coding achievable rate region, and hence, the secrecy capacity region of the MGBC-CM is established. Finally, two numerical examples demonstrate that both users can achieve positive rates simultaneously under the information-theoretic secrecy requirement.", "paper_title": "Secrecy Capacity Region of a Multiple-Antenna Gaussian Broadcast Channel With Confidential Messages", "paper_id": "WOS:000263928600023"}
