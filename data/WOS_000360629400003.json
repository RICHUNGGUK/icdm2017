The k-isoperimetric edge connectivity of a connected graph G is defined as gamma(k)(G) = min{vertical bar[X,(X) over bar]vertical bar : X subset of V(G), vertical bar X vertical bar >= k, vertical bar(X) over bar vertical bar >= k}. Let beta(k) (G) = min{vertical bar[X,(X) over bar]vertical bar : X subset of V(G), vertical bar X vertical bar >= k. A graph G is called a gamma(k)-optimal graph if gamma(k)(G) = beta(k)(G). An edge cut S = [X,(X) over bar] is called a gamma(k)-cut if vertical bar S vertical bar = gamma(k)(G), X subset of V(G), vertical bar X vertical bar >= k and vertical bar(X) over bar vertical bar >= k. Moreover, G is called a super-gamma(k) graph if every gamma(k)-cut [X,(X) over bar] of G has the property that either vertical bar X vertical bar = k or vertical bar(X) over bar vertical bar = k. Let G be a graph of order at least 2k with k >= 2. In this paper, we prove that for anc pair u, v of nonadjacent vertices in G, if vertical bar N(u) boolean AND N(v)vertical bar >= k + 1 when neither u nor v lies on a triangle, or vertical bar N(u) boolean AND N(v)vertical bar >= 2k - 1 when u or v lies on a triangle, then G is gamma(k)-optimal. Moreover, if G is a triangle-free graph, and vertical bar N(u) boolean AND N(v)vertical bar >= k + 1 for all pairs u, v of nonadjacent vertices in G, then G is either super-gamma(k) or isomorphic to K-k+1,K-k+1.", "paper_title": "Sufficient Conditions for Maximally k-Isoperimetric Edge Connectivity of Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000360629400003"}
