The key aspects of routing algorithm design include adaptivity, path selection strategy, VC allocation, isolation, and hardware implementation cost; these design aspects are not independent. The key contribution of this work lies in the design of a novel selection strategy, Destination-Based Selection Strategy (DBSS), which targets interference that can arise in many-core systems running consolidation workloads. In the process of this design, we holistically consider all aspects to ensure an efficient design. Existing routing algorithms largely overlook issues associated with workload consolidation. Locally adaptive algorithms do not consider enough status information to avoid network congestion. Globally adaptive routing algorithms attack this issue by utilizing network status beyond neighboring nodes. However, they may suffer from interference, coupling the behavior of otherwise independent applications. To address these issues, DBSS leverages both local and nonlocal network status to provide more effective adaptivity. More importantly, by integrating the destination into the selection procedure, DBSS mitigates interference and offers dynamic isolation among applications. Results show that DBSS offers better performance than the best baseline selection strategy and improves the energy-delay product for medium and high injection rates; it is well suited for workload consolidation.", "paper_title": "Holistic Routing Algorithm Design to Support Workload Consolidation in NoCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000333471800002"}
