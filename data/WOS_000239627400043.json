We extend the results of [4] to a class of transfer functions t(z) with multiple poles. One of the appearing positive systems is always 1-dimensional, while the other has dimension corresponding to the location and order of the poles of t(z). Recently, in [11], a universal approach was found, providing a decomposition for any asymptotically stable t(z). Our approach here gives lower dimensions than [11] in certain cases but, unfortunately, at present it can only be applied to a relatively small class of transfer functions, and it does not yield a general algorithm.", "paper_title": "Positive decomposition of transfer functions with multiple poles", "paper_id": "WOS:000239627400043"}
