The proposed method is based on statistical pattern recognition that employs a ratio of power spectrum amplitudes occurring for a microphone pair as a feature vector. It does not require any phase information explicitly, which is frequently used in conventional techniques, because the phase information is unreliable for the case in which strong reflections and diffractions occur around the microphones. The feature vectors we adopted can treat these influences naturally. The effectiveness of the proposed method was shown from direction-of-arrival estimation tests for 19 kinds of directions: 92.4% of errors were reduced compared with the conventional phase-based method.", "paper_title": "Ears of the robot: Direction of arrival estimation based on pattern recognition using robot-mounted microphones", "paper_id": "WOS:000256860900035"}
