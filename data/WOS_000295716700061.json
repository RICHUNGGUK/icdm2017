In this text, by reviewing some standard scalarization techniques we are interested in finding the relationships between epsilon-(weakly, properly) efficient points of an MOP and epsilon-optimal solutions of the related scalarized problem. For this purpose, the relationships between epsilon is an element of R >= and epsilon is an element of R(>=)(m), for a single objective and multi-objective problems, respectively, are analyzed. In fact, necessary and/or sufficient conditions for approximating (weakly, properly) efficient points of a general MOP via approximate solutions of the scalarized problems are obtained.
