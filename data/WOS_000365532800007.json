When any organization is going for IS development they will be looking for the IS development methods that are most complete and/or significant and also to fulfill their requirements and give them a complete solution. Agile software development methods have made their way into the software mainstream and have got the attention of software engineers and researchers due to their rapid growth. The purpose of this paper is to compare and investigate the three most practiced methods, that is Extreme Programming, Rational Unified Process and Dynamic System Development Method by using the Multi Criterion Decision Making tool. In addition, we analyze them on the basis of different aspects in order to find out which one is the most complete and significant technique for the development of Information System.", "paper_title": "A Comparative Analysis and Evaluation of Different Agile Software Development Methodologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000365532800007"}
