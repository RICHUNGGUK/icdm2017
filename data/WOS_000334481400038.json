Distributed dynamic output feedback controllers on the basis of the relative outputs of neighboring agents are proposed. Necessary and sufficient containment control conditions are presented which are less conservative than those in the literature. These conditions depend on the spectral properties of the topology matrix. Effective algorithms are proposed to obtain control gain matrices based on H-infinity type Riccati design. Then, distributed static output feedback control method is also discussed. Simulation examples are provided finally to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design methods.
