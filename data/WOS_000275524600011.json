In the solution procedure, the flows are represented by a series of fundamental solutions where the intensities of these sources are determined by the collocation on the boundary data. The fundamental solutions are derived by transforming the governing equation into the product of harmonic and Helmholtz-type operators, which can be classified into three types depending on the oscillatory frequencies of temperature field. All the velocities, the pressure, and the stresses corresponding to the fundamental solutions are expressed explicitly in tensor forms for all the three cases. Three numerical examples were carried out to validate the proposed fundamental solutions and numerical schemes. Then, the method was also applied to study exterior flows around a sphere. In these studies, we derived the MFS formulas of drag forces. Numerical results were compared accurately with the analytical solutions, indicating the ability of the MFS for obtaining accurate solutions for problems with smooth boundary data. This study can also be treated as a preliminary research for nonlinear convective thermal flows if the particular solutions of the operators can be supplied, which are currently under investigations.
