The design concepts of these models are presented, and a class of models is considered that approximate real sequential programs. Algorithms are constructed that recognize the equivalence of program schemas in models of a given class with practically acceptable complexity. The validity of these algorithms for constructing equivalent transformations (ETs) of program schemas is established.", "paper_title": "On a class of algebraic models of programs of practical interest", "paper_id": "WOS:000319070200002"}
