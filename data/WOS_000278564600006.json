This linear ordering allows pairs of disjoint edges to be either preceding (<), nesting ((sic)) or crossing ((sic)). Given a family of linear graphs, and a non-empty subset R subset of {<, (sic), (sic)} we are interested in the MAXIMUM COMMON STRUCTURED PATTERN (MCSP) problem: find a maximum size edge-disjoint graph, with edge pairs all comparable by one of the relations in R, that occurs as a subgraph in each of the linear graphs of the family. The MCSP problem generalizes many structure-comparison and structure-prediction problems that arise in computational molecular biology. We give tight hardness results for the MCSP problem for {<, (sic)}-structured patterns and {(sic), (sic)}-structured patterns. Furthermore, we prove that the problem is approximable within ratios: (i) 2H(k) for {<, (sic)}-structured patterns, (ii) k(1/2) for {(sic), (sic)}-structured patterns, and (iii) O(root k log k) for {<, (sic), (sic)}-structured patterns, where k is the size of the optimal solution and H(k) = Sigma(k)(i=1) 1/i is the kth harmonic number. Also, we provide combinatorial results concerning different types of structured patterns that are of independent interest in their own right. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
