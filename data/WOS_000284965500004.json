For this kernel, the synchronization frequency giving the minimum parallel time predicted by our theoretical model was very close to the synchronization frequency giving the least parallel time in practice We validate our model by extensive comparisons of the theoretically predicted parallel time and synchronization frequency against those obtained from practical experiments The comparisons show that the proposed model is highly accurate its predictions for the optimal synchronization frequency being within 0 0250% of the experimentally optimal synchronization frequency in the best case and within 0 1750% of the experimentally optimal synchronization frequency in the worst case Finally the comparisons show that the proposed model improves on a previously existing model in heterogeneous systems, whereas it gives similar results in homogeneous systems (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Studying the impact of synchronization frequency on scheduling tasks with dependencies in heterogeneous systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000284965500004"}
