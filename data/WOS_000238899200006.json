The C-UPFC consists of three voltage source inverters (VSI) with common DC link. One of the converters. is connected in parallel at the midpoint of line and the other two converters are connected in series. The simulation results indicate that the C-UPFC is capable of independently controlling the active and reactive power flows at the both ends of line and the magnitude of AC voltage at line mid point. It is shown that by adding a supplementary control system to the shunt inverter control system, it is possible to balance line current too. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
