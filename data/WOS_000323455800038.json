We employ an asymptotic analysis using an extended random network setting under an additive white Gaussian channel model with path loss, and show that the broadcast performance strongly depends on the path loss exponent of the medium. In particular, the probability of broadcasting in a 1-D infinite network is zero for path loss exponents larger than one, and is equal to a nonzero value for path loss exponents less than one. In 2-D infinite networks, the same behavior is observed for path loss exponents above and below two, respectively.", "paper_title": "Broadcast Analysis for Extended Cooperative Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000323455800038"}
