However, the problem of spoofing attacks can challenge face biometric systems in practical applications. In this paper, an effective countermeasure against face spoofing attacks based on a kernel discriminant analysis approach is presented. Its success derives from different innovations. First, it is shown that the recently proposed multiscale dynamic texture descriptor based on binarized statistical image features on three orthogonal planes (MBSIF-TOP) is effective in detecting spoofing attacks, showing promising performance compared with existing alternatives. Next, by combining MBSIF-TOP with a blur-tolerant descriptor, namely, the dynamic multiscale local phase quantization (MLPQ-TOP) representation, the robustness of the spoofing attack detector can be further improved. The fusion of the information provided by MBSIF-TOP and MLPQ-TOP is realized via a kernel fusion approach based on a fast kernel discriminant analysis (KDA) technique. It avoids the costly eigen-analysis computations by solving the KDA problem via spectral regression. The experimental evaluation of the proposed system on different databases demonstrates its advantages in detecting spoofing attacks in various imaging conditions, compared with the existing methods.", "paper_title": "Face Spoofing Detection Based on Multiple Descriptor Fusion Using Multiscale Dynamic Binarized Statistical Image Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000361685900004"}
