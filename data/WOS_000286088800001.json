This module, called advanced resource planning (ARP), provides a parameter-setting process, with the ultimate goal of yielding realistic information about production lead times for scheduling purposes, sales and marketing, strategic and operational decision making, and suppliers and customers. This article illustrates the ARP approach with reports from several real-life implementations by large industrial companies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
