Such functions are found by heuristic search in the space of rotation symmetric Boolean functions (RSBFs). This shows that there exist Boolean functions on n (odd) variables having non, linearity > 2(n-1) - 2 (n-1/2) if and only if n > 7. Using similar search technique, balanced Boolean functions on 9, 10, and 11 variables are attained having autocorrelation spectra with maximum absolute value < 2 [n/2]. On odd number of variables, earlier such functions were known for 15, 21 variables; there was no evidence of such functions at all on even number of variables. In certain cases, our functions can be affinely transformed to obtain first-order resiliency or first-order propagation characteristics. Moreover, 10 variable functions having first-order resiliency and nonlinearity 492 are presented that had been posed as an open question at Crypto 2000. The functions reported in this paper are discovered using a suitably modified steepest descent based iterative heuristic search in the RSBF class along with proper affine transformations. It seems elusive to get a construction technique to match such functions.", "paper_title": "Search for Boolean functions with excellent profiles in the rotation symmetric class", "paper_id": "WOS:000246034600009"}
