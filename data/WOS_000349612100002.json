Especially, emergency departments (EDs), as the gateway and the major source of outpatients in hospitals, have experienced yearly increase in patient visits and crowding, which jeopardizes quality of care. Based on a case study of emergency service delivery in a hospital, we propose and numerically test a solution making a better use of inpatient bed information. Finally, we propose directions for future research and some open questions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
