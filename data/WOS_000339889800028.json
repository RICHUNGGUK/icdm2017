The BCH code technique, which can correct the error bits caused by network transmission, packet loss, video-processing operations, various attacks, etc., encodes the embedded data by using BCH code before data hiding. The without distortion drift technique in this paper is that we exploit several paired-coefficients of a 4 x 4 discrete cosine transform (DCT) block to accumulate the embedding induced distortion, and the directions of intra-frame prediction are utilized to avert the distortion drift. It is proved analytically and shown experimentally that the new data hiding algorithm can get more robustness, effectively avert intra-frame distortion drift and get high visual quality.", "paper_title": "A robust without intra-frame distortion drift data hiding algorithm based on H.264/AVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000339889800028"}
