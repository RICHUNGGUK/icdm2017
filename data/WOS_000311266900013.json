Design/methodology/approach - This paper applies a genetic algorithm to optimally search in the target space, and repeatedly exerts genetic operation (select, cross, variation) on the population to explore the optimal configuration strategy between value creation activity and resource utilization. It also analyzes the relation between object function of value creation and relative parameters. Findings - The total value created by value activity network was impacted by the degree of effective configuration between all kinds of resources and value activities; the total value created by value activity network is positively related to activity units' elasticity coefficient of value creation of human resource, material resources and relations resource, and is negatively correlated to cost coefficient of human resource, material resources and relations resource; when the cooperative relations between activity units create positive relationship profit, the total value created by value activity network increases with the increase of cooperative relations between activity units. Practical implications - Enterprises in clusters should reasonably configure and incorporate the resource among value activities through adding, deleting or reconfiguring activities, which makes the value activities network create maximum value; enterprises can transform the type of activity units to increase elasticity coefficient of value creation of human resources, such as transforming production activities into the high value-added activities; enterprises can optimally incorporate the technical, material resources and human resources among activities to increase value creation elastic coefficient of material resources; enterprises can decrease cost coefficient by maintaining the stability of long-term cooperation with the suppliers and strengthening the cultivation of talents; enterprises can increase profits from relation resource or reduce cost coefficient of relationship by updating activities, building trust mechanism and communication mechanisms and establishing long-term cooperation relationship to improve value creation activities. Originality/value - This paper proposes the model of value creation from the perspective of cluster's value activity network, and applies a genetic algorithm to explore the optimal configuration strategies between value creation activity and resource utilization.", "paper_title": "Study on optimizing resources configuration of value activity network of manufacturing clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000311266900013"}
