It particularly focuses on complex tasks whose support relies more on experience than on knowledge. The presented approach is based on the \"use traces\" concept to investigate the \"activity reflexivity\" as a first step in experience management, and experience sharing and reusing as possible applications. The paper also outlines the framework supporting Trace-Based Systems creation. Traces, trace models and trace life cycle are formally defined. The main parts of the framework architecture: collecting, transformation, visualization, and query systems are also detailed.", "paper_title": "Trace-based framework for experience management and engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000141"}
