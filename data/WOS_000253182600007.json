In this paper, we first extend this necessary condition to the situation with max-Archimedean triangular-norm (t-norm) composition. Based on this necessary condition, we then propose rules to reduce the problem size so that the complete set of minimal solutions can be computed efficiently. Furthermore, rather than work with the actual equations, we employ a simple matrix whose elements capture all of the properties of the equations in finding the minimal solutions. Numerical examples with specific cases of the max-Archimedean t-norm composition are provided to illustrate the procedure.", "paper_title": "An efficient procedure for solving a fuzzy relational equation with max-Archimedean t-norm composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000253182600007"}
