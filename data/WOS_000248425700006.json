In the zero-error regime, the eavesdropper Eve can only take advantage of the losses in the transmission. We consider new attacks, based on unambiguous state discrimination, which perform better than the basic beam-splitting attack, but which can be detected by a careful analysis of the detection statistics. These results stress the importance of testing several statistical parameters in order to achieve higher rates of secret bits.", "paper_title": "Zero-error attacks and detection statistics in the coherent one-way protocol for quantum cryptography", "paper_id": "WOS:000248425700006"}
