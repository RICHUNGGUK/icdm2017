Chondrocytes and explants were exposed to LIPUS (30 mW/cm2; 20 min/day, 6 days). Stimulation of [35S]-sulphate incorporation into proteoglycans by LIPUS was 1.3-fold higher in degenerative than in collateral monolayers as assessed biochemically and 1.9-fold higher in explants as assessed by autoradiography. LIPUS decreased the number of cell nests containing 1-3 chondrocytes by 1.5 fold in collateral and by 1.6 fold in degenerative explants. LIPUS increased the number of nests containing 4-6 chondrocytes by 4.8 fold in collateral and by 3.9 fold in degenerative explants. This suggests that LIPUS stimulates chondrocyte proliferation and matrix production in chondrocytes of human articular cartilage in vitro. LIPUS might provide a feasible tool for cartilage tissue repair in osteoarthritic patients, since it stimulates chondrocyte proliferation and matrix production.", "paper_title": "Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound affects human articular chondrocytes in vitro", "paper_id": "WOS:000261181100010"}
