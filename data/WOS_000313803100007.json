In the present paper, the finite element method using NURBS as basis functions in the Galerkin method is applied to solve the boundary value problems and to solve a reshaping problem generated by the H1 gradient method for shape optimization, which has been developed as a general solution to shape optimization problems. Numerical examples of linear elastic continua illustrate that this solution works as well as using the conventional finite element method.", "paper_title": "Shape optimization of continua using NURBS as basis functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000313803100007"}
