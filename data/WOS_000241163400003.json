In order to gain an insight into what customers expect from a product/service, an analysis of quality management from customer's point of view is essential. Such an understanding would help the managers to adopt strategies that can enhance the satisfaction level of their customers. The present study highlights the critical factors of quality management in the software industry from the customer's perspective. Six critical factors are identified: and an instrument, comprising these factors, is developed and validated so as to measure the customer's perception of quality management in the software industry.", "paper_title": "An instrument for the measurement of customer perceptions of quality management in the software industry: An empirical study in India", "paper_id": "WOS:000241163400003"}
