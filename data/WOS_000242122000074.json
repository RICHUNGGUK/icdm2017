However, to access the original data (elevation values), it is necessary to decompress whole model. In this paper, we propose an algorithm oriented to compress a digital elevation model, which is based on a sequence of binary images encoded using RLE compression technique, according to a specific height (contour lines). The main goal of our algorithm is to obtain specific parameters of the DEM (altitudes and contours lines) without using a decompression stage, because the information is directly read from the compressed DEM.", "paper_title": "Applying A-priori knowledge for compressing digital elevation models", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000074"}
