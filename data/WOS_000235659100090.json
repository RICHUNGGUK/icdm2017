It is difficult for flood control and reservoir scheduling. It is ineffective to perform sequential computations for optimal scheduling of multi-reservoir due to the system complexity. In this paper, we implemented the multi-reservoir optimal scheduling algorithm in a Grid environment. Key components as multiple Protocols were developed within the layers of Grid architecture. The proposed Grid computing architecture provides an innovative design of multi-reservoir optimal scheduling system for increasing the accuracy of flood control and speedup of computing.", "paper_title": "A grid-based system for the multi-reservoir optimal scheduling in Huaihe River Basin", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100090"}
