The average biological impedance of body parts is evaluated by constructing a frequency response of the equivalent human body system. Only two stainless-steel electrodes are employed in the measurement and evaluation.", "paper_title": "Measurement and Evaluation of the Bioelectrical Impedance of the Human Body by Deconvolution of a Square Wave", "paper_id": "WOS:000279250600037"}
