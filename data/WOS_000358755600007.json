The high penetration of EVs especially in the form of plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEV) can result in new challenges in the optimal operation and management of the systems. The charging behavior of PHEVs in a typical system is affected by a number of uncertain parameters which makes the overall charging behavior of PHEVs uncertain. Therefore, this paper makes use of a newly introduced smart model for charging demand of PHEVs to assess their effect on the reconfiguration issue as a precious and significant strategy in the smart automated distribution systems (ADS). In this regard, two different charging modes including charging at the public station and in a local residential community are investigated. Also, a sufficient scenario-based stochastic framework is proposed to model the uncertainties associated with the PHEVs on the reconfiguration problem. The proposed stochastic framework employs the roulette wheel mechanism in conjunction with a modified evolutionary-based optimization technique to deal with the targets. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated on the 69 bus IEEE distribution system.", "paper_title": "Smart automated distribution system considering plug-in hybrid electric vehicle", "paper_id": "WOS:000358755600007"}
