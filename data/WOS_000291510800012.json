The security of the protocol can be reduced to the standard Computational Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption in the random oracle model. Our scheme is secure as long as each party has at least one uncompromised secret. Also, we give a strongly secure variant of the protocol. The variant has a much lower computational overhead than the original scheme, while its security relies on the Gap Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption. Currently, there are few ID-based AKA protocols that are provably secure in the strong eCK model. Compared with previous ID-based AKA schemes, our protocols have advantages over them in security or efficiency. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
