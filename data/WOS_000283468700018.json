The scheme solves the problem such as how to preserve and manipulate the users' private key securely. Meanwhile, it realizes the mutual authentication between user and server, in which the private key splitting method is proven to be secure in the RO model. The analysis shows that the scheme is able to resist the normal attacks such as the denial of service or the off-line password guess effectively. It has strong robustness in applications.", "paper_title": "ONLINE PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHIC SCHEME FOR DATA SECURITY IN BRIDGE HEALTH MONITORING", "paper_id": "WOS:000283468700018"}
