High-speed gas flow is always accompanied by low-speed gas flow, which produces rich visual details in the fluid motion. Realistic visualization involves a complex dynamic flow field with both low and high speed fluid behavior. In computer graphics, algorithms to simulate gaseous,fluids address either the low speed case or the high speed case, but no algorithm handles both efficiently. With the aim of providing visually pleasing results, we present a hybrid algorithm that efficiently! captures the essential physics of both low- and high-speed gaseous fluids. We model the low speed gaseous fluids by a grid approach and use a particle approach for the high speed gaseous fluids. In addition, we propose a physically sound method to connect the particle model to the grid model. By, exploiting complementary strengths and avoiding weaknesses of the grid and particle approaches, we produce some animation examples and analyze their computational performance to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new hybrid method.", "paper_title": "Simulating Gaseous Fluids with Low and High Speeds", "paper_id": "WOS:000270778100013"}
