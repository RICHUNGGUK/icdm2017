We briefly describe the Triana distribution mechanisms and the underlying architectures that we can support. Our middleware independent abstraction layer, called the Grid Application Prototype (GAP), enables us to advertise, discover and communicate with Web and peer-to-peer (P2P) services. We show how gravitational wave search algorithms have been implemented to distribute both the search computation and data across the European GridLab testbed, using a combination of Web services, Globus interaction and P2P infrastructures.
