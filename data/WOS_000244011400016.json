To the present, many optimization algorithms based on computational intelligence have been proposed, such as the Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In this paper, a new optimization algorithm, namely, Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) is proposed. CSO is generated by observing the behavior of cats, and composed of two sub-models by simulating the behavior of cats. According to the experiments, the results reveal that CSO is superior to PSO.", "paper_title": "Computational intelligence based on the behavior of cats", "paper_id": "WOS:000244011400016"}
