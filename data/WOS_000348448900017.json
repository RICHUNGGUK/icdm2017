The unique characteristics include multi-hop communication over lossy and non-deterministic wireless mediums, data transmission in the absence of a base station, similar traffic patterns over neighboring mesh nodes, etc. One of the reasons for the poor performance of conventional TCP variants over WMNs is that the congestion control mechanisms in conventional TCP variants do not explicitly account for these unique characteristics. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel artificial intelligence based congestion control technique for reliable data transfer over WMNs. The synergy with artificial intelligence is established by exploiting a carefully designed neural network (NN) in the congestion control mechanism. We analyze the proposed NN based congestion control technique in detail and incorporate it into TCP to create a new variant that we name as intelligent TCP or iTCP. We evaluate the performance of iTCP using both ns-2 simulations and real testbed experiments. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed congestion control technique exhibits a significant improvement in total network throughput and average energy consumption per transmitted bit compared to the congestion control techniques used in other TCP variants.", "paper_title": "iTCP: an intelligent TCP with neural network based end-to-end congestion control for ad-hoc multi-hop wireless mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000348448900017"}
