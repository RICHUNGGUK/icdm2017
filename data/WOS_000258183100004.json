Different versions of NN structures in the literature, which embed mathematical mappings related to solutions of the ADP-formulated problems called \"adaptive critics\" or \"action-critic\". networks, are discussed. Distinction between the two classes of ADP applications is pointed out. Furthermore, papers in \"model-free\" development and Model-based neurocontrollers are reviewed in terms of their contributions to stability issues. Recent literature suggests that work in ADP-based feedback controllers with assured stability,is growing in diverse forms.", "paper_title": "Issues on stability of ADP feedback controllers for dynamical systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000258183100004"}
