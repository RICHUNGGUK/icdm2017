In this paper, we investigate the influence of NBTI degradation induced variation and random process variations on the stability of the FinFET-based 6T-SRAM cell. The contributions of transistor threshold voltage variation Delta Vth on the stability of the SRAM cell and the corresponding compensating bias schemes are thoroughly examined by means of SPICE simulations. A mitigation method for memory stability management under spatial and temporal variations is demonstrated by taking advantage of the independent-gate FinFET device structure in order to perform threshold voltage adjustment. The proposed technique allows for a practical compensation strategy able to preserve the SRAM cell stability while balancing performance and leakage power consumption. We demonstrate that the standby leakage current I-DDQ value can be utilized to assess the consequences of parameter variations and NBTI on the circuit performance and propose a model that captures this. We evaluate the impact of our proposal on the SRAM cell stability by means of SPICE simulations for 20 nm FinFET devices. Simulation results indicate that the proposed technique can effectively maintain stability of an SRAM array within the desired range during its operational life under both spatial and temporal variations, hence improve the system performance and reliability. Our method allows for maintaining the Static Noise Margin (SNM) degradation of SRAM cells under a certain range, e.g., 2% of fresh device after 1 year operation, which is about 55.56% improvement when compared with the 4.5% degradation corresponding to the uncompensated case.
