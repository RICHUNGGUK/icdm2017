Though this lower bound is tight for Courcelle's theorem, it has been evaded by a series of recent meta-theorems for other graph classes. Here we provide some additional non-elementary lower bound results, which are in some sense stronger. Our goal is to explain common traits in these recent meta-theorems and identify barriers to further progress. More specifically, first, we show that on the class of threshold graphs, and therefore also on any union and complement-closed class, there is no model-checking algorithm with elementary parameter dependence even for FO logic. Second, we show that there is no model-checking algorithm with elementary parameter dependence for MSO logic even restricted to paths (or equivalently to unary strings), unless E=NE. As a corollary, we resolve an open problem on the complexity of MSO model-checking on graphs of bounded max-leaf number. Finally, we look at MSO on the class of colored trees of depth d. We show that, assuming the ETH, for every fixed d >= 1 at least d + 1 levels of exponentiation are necessary for this problem, thus showing that the (d + 1)-fold exponential algorithm recently given by Gajarsky and Hlineny is essentially optimal.", "paper_title": "MODEL CHECKING LOWER BOUNDS FOR SIMPLE GRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000333744700003"}
