This paper illustrates how interference can be used to counter eavesdropping and assist secrecy. In particular, a wiretap channel with a helping interferer (WT-HI) is considered. Here, a transmitter sends a confidential message to its intended receiver in the presence of a passive eavesdropper and with the help of an independent interferer. The interferer, which does not know the confidential message, helps in ensuring the secrecy of the message by sending an independent signal. An achievable secrecy rate and several computable outer bounds on the secrecy capacity of the WT-HI are given for both discrete memoryless and Gaussian channels.", "paper_title": "Interference Assisted Secret Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000289836300037"}
