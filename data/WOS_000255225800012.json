In the present 3D axisymmetric model, the equations of motion are expressed by expanding the displacement field using Fourier series ill the circumferential direction. Thus, the 3D elasticity equations of motion are reduced to 2D equations involving circumferential harmonics. In the finite element formulation the dependent variables, electric potential and loading are expanded in truncated Fourier series. Special emphasis is given to the coupling between symmetric and anti-symmetric terms for laminated materials with piezoelectric rings. Numerical results obtained with the present model are found to be in good agreement with other finite element solutions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
