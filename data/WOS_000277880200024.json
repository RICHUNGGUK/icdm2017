Each transmitter uses a Gaussian codebook and each receiver only decodes the data of the corresponding transmitter. For the case that the transmit powers are subject to arbitrary linear constraints, a mathematical expression for the boundary points of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) region is obtained. Moreover, when the channels are time-varying and the average powers are constrained, the zero-outage SINR region of the system is derived. In addition, a scenario where the demanded SINR of the users is out of the SINR region is considered. A common approach is to remove a subset of the users such that the demanded SINR can be provided for the remaining users; the removed users are serviced in a later time slot. With the aim of maximizing the number of serviced users in each time slot, a suboptimal algorithm is developed, which outperforms the other known alternatives.", "paper_title": "Characterization of SINR Region for Interfering Links With Constrained Power", "paper_id": "WOS:000277880200024"}
