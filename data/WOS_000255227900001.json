The calculus comes equipped with a labelled transition system in which types play a major role: this system allows us to show interesting algebraic laws. As usual, types express the communication, access and mobility properties of the modelled system, and inferred types express the minimal constraints required for the system to be well behaved.", "paper_title": "Types for ambient and process mobility", "paper_id": "WOS:000255227900001"}
