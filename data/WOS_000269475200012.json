The protocol is characteri zed by state traces and formally verified by a theorem proving system PVS. Relevant prope rties are specified and verified in terms of inductive principles. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evidenced by the elaborate analysis which unveils a subtle bug in the initial protoco limplementation. The approach is scalable for an arbitrary number of agents. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
