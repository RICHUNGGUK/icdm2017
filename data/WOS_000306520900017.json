However, it is undeniable that the distortion reflects the intrinsic property of the lens, especially, the extreme wide-angle lens, which has a significant distortion. In this paper, we discuss how explicitly employing the distortion cues can detect the forgery object in distortion image and make the following contributions: 1) a radial distortion projection model is adopted to simplify the traditional captured ray-based models, where the straight world line is projected into a great circle on the viewing sphere; 2) two bottom-up cues based on distortion constraint are provided to discriminate the authentication of the line in the image; 3) a fake saliency map is used to maximum fake detection density, and based on the fake saliency map, an energy function is provided to achieve the pixel-level forgery object via graph cut. Experimental results on simulated data and real images demonstrate the performances of our method.", "paper_title": "Forgery Authentication in Extreme Wide-Angle Lens Using Distortion Cue and Fake Saliency Map", "paper_id": "WOS:000306520900017"}
