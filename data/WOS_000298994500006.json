In the case of dynamic scenes, standard techniques may introduce artifacts called ghosts if the scene changes are not accounted for. In this paper, we consider the blind HDR problem for dynamic scenes. We develop a novel bottom-up segmentation algorithm through superpixel grouping which enables us to detect scene changes. We then employ a piecewise patch-based compositing methodology in the gradient domain to directly generate the ghost-free LDR image of the dynamic scene. Being a blind method, the primary advantage of our approach is that we do not assume any knowledge of camera response function and exposure settings while preserving the contrast even in the non-stationary regions of the scene. We compare the results of our approach for both static and dynamic scenes with that of the state-of-the-art techniques.", "paper_title": "Reconstruction of high contrast images for dynamic scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000298994500006"}
