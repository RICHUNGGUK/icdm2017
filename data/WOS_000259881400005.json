To ensure an acceptable level of statistical accuracy relatively large numbers of particles are needed. State-of-the-art Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), with their high memory bandwidth. hundreds of SPMD processors, and half-a-teraflop performance potential, offer a viable alternative to distributed memory parallel computers for running medium-scale PICplasma simulations on inexpensive commodity hardware. In this paper, we present an overview of a typical plasma PIC code and discuss its GPU implementation. In particular we focus on fast algorithms for the performance bottleneck operation of Particle-To-Grid interpolation. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
