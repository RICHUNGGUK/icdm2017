It is a CRYPTREC recommended e-government cipher in Japan. In this paper we address how to recover the user key from a few subkey bits of SC2000, and describe two 4.75-round differential characteristics with probability 2(-126) of SC2000 and seventy-six 4.75-round differential characteristics with probability 2(-127). Finally, we present a differential cryptanalysis attack on a 5-round reduced version of SC2000 when used with a 128-bit key; the attack requires 2(125:68) chosen plaintexts and has a time complexity of 2(125:75) 5-round SC2000 encryptions. The attack does not threat the security of the full SC2000 cipher, but it suggests for the first time that the safety margin of SC2000 with a 128-bit key decreases below one and a half rounds.", "paper_title": "Differential Attack on Five Rounds of the SC2000 Block Cipher(*)", "paper_id": "WOS:000292681200016"}
