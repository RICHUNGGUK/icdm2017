Firstly, alpha-generalized lock resolution is proposed for lattice-valued propositional logic and first order logic, respectively, along with their concepts, soundness and completeness. Then, alpha-generalized lock resolution for first order linguistic truth-valued lattice-valued logic LV(nx2)F(X) is equivalently transformed into that for propositional logic LnP(X), which can greatly reduce the complexity of the resolution procedure. Finally, alpha-generalized linear semi-lock resolution is discussed, and its general algorithm is also contrived. This work provides more efficient and natural resolution automated reasoning scheme in linguistic truth-valued logic based on lattice implication algebra with the aim at establishing formal tools for symbolic natural language processing.", "paper_title": "alpha-Generalized lock resolution method in linguistic truth-valued lattice-valued logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000311119400010"}
