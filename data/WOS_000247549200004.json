Linearized tracking-error dynamics is used to predict future system behavior and a control law is derived from a quadratic cost function penalizing the system tracking error and the control effort. Experimental results on a real mobile robot are presented and a comparison of the control obtained with that of a time-varying state-feedback controller is given. The proposed controller includes velocity and acceleration constraints to prevent the mobile robot from slipping and a Smith predictor is used to compensate for the vision-system dead-time. Some ideas for future work are also discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
