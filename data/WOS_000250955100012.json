Thus, in this field, automatic content recommenders should receive special attention in the following years to improve assistance to users. Current approaches of content recommenders have significant well-known de.ciencies that hamper their wide acceptance. In this paper, a new approach for automatic content recommendation is presented that considerably reduces those deficiencies. This approach, based on the so-called Semantic Web technologies, has been implemented in the AVATAR tool, a hybrid content recommender that makes extensive use of well-known standards, such as TV-Anytime and OWL. Our proposal has been evaluated experimentally with real users, showing signi. cant increases in the recommendation accuracy with respect to other existing approaches.", "paper_title": "Avatar: Enhancing the personalized television by semantic inference", "paper_id": "WOS:000250955100012"}
