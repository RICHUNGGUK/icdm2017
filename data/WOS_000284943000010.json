A color theme is typically defined as a template of colors and an associated verbal description. This paper presents a data-driven method for enhancing a desired color theme in an image. We formulate our goal as a unified optimization that simultaneously considers a desired color theme, texture-color relationships as well as automatic or user-specified color constraints. Quantifying the difference between an image and a color theme is made possible by color mood spaces and a generalization of an additivity relationship for two-color combinations. We incorporate prior knowledge, such as texture-color relationships, extracted from a database of photographs to maintain a natural look of the edited images. Experiments and a user study have confirmed the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Data-Driven Image Color Theme Enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000284943000010"}
