In general, biochemical reaction of the biological system is extremely slow. However, a square wave generator used as a genetic clock the transient response should be fast enough to catch the reaction change between two logic levels. Therefore, the requirement for instantaneous changes in logic status is not likely to exist in biological systems. This paper presents a method of synthesizing a genetic clock generator based on the combination of a toggle switch with two biological logic gates. A dual repressor is used to connect the two fundamental biologic circuits. Analysis of the characteristic responses of this genetic clock with its relation to the key parameters is provided.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of Genetic Clock with Combinational Biologic Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000362909500023"}
