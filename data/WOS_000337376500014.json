This characterization utilizes asymmetric intermodulation distortion (IMD)components, which are the result of a 2-tone excitation of a nonlinear amplifier. These asymmetric IMD components are represented basically by a power series, where each term in the series has its own time delay term. These time delay terms successfully justify the presence of asymmetry in the intermodulation components, which leads to the prediction of amplitude-to-amplitude and amplitude-to-phase distortions. The parameters of the model are extracted using 2-tone measurements. A 100-W peak power amplifier is examined. Model predictions are verified by the measurement results of a 4-tone stimulus. The proposed model can also be used in time domain analysis with arbitrary excitation.", "paper_title": "A low-order nonlinear amplifier model with distributed delay terms", "paper_id": "WOS:000337376500014"}
