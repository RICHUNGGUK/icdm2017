Due the high accuracy on detecting leakage, it is necessary to set procedures that will achieve the leading performance. This paper describes a methodology to set instrumentations systems to accomplish with the legal requirement keeping high reliability during normal and fail operations conditions. To achieving the described state this paper proposes a set of models acting as Expert systems: each one observing and diagnosing pipeline leakage in real-time. The proposed system also validates the operations according the business rules applied to it. A set of techniques is applied in order to be possible the system executes its function: fuzzy logic, neural network, genetic algorithm and statistic analysis. The application of the methodology proposed is in operation supervising pipeline in a Brazilian petroleum installation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
