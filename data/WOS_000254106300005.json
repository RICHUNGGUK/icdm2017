The main difficulty of the problem is that the load of vehicles is fluctuating rather than decreasing as in the VRP. We design a reactive tabu search metaheuristic that can check feasibility of proposed moves quickly and reacts to repetitions to guide the search. Several new best solutions are found for benchmark problems.", "paper_title": "A reactive tabu search algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickups and deliveries", "paper_id": "WOS:000254106300005"}
