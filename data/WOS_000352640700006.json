A dual-loop Boost PFC model with the feed-forward slope compensation is built to analyze the nonlinear phenomena in system, and the corresponding circuit structure is presented. The chaos control ability of the feed-forward slope compensation is studied theoretically, and the relation of compensated slope and feed-forward signal is deduced, as well as slope stability conditions. The simulation and measured results show that this method could effectively suppress system bifurcation and chaos phenomena, and improve the system working range and dynamic response speed, and eliminate the influence on system stability for without compensated, under compensated, and over compensated.", "paper_title": "Feed-Forward Slope Compensated PFC for Chaos Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000352640700006"}
