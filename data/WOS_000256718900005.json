An available crash test is modeled and the impact response was simulated through a finite element (FE) model. On the basis of insight gained through this detailed FE analysis, a simpler rigid body model is then used to perform a comprehensive study of the barrier response under vehicular impact. The results from FE simulation and the rigid body model are found to be consistent with each other and in good agreement with the full-scale crash test. On the basis of results from a series of simpler analyses, a set of charts for assessing the barrier displacement and related variables are developed for the purpose of design.", "paper_title": "Traffic barriers under vehicular impact: From computer simulation to design guidelines", "paper_id": "WOS:000256718900005"}
