It has been applied to several linear and nonlinear problems and, very recently, to a simulation of fully-developed, two-dimensional drift wave turbulence. The mere fact that parareal works in such a turbulent regime is in itself somewhat unexpected, due to the characteristic sensitivity of turbulence to any change in initial conditions. This fundamental property of any turbulent system should render the iterative correction procedure characteristic of the parareal method inoperative, but this seems not to be the case. In addition, the choices that must be made to implement parareal (division of the temporal domain, election of the coarse solver and so on) are currently made using trial-and-error approaches. Here, we identify the mechanisms responsible for the convergence of parareal of these simulations of drift wave turbulence. We also investigate which conditions these mechanisms impose on any successful parareal implementation. The results reported here should be useful to guide future implementations of parareal within the much wider context of fully-developed fluid and plasma turbulent simulations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
