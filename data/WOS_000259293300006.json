To do this, we have conducted various Monte Carlo experiments in which the effect of these outliers on the principal model identification tools (descriptive statistics, graphs and heteroscedasticity tests) is analysed.", "paper_title": "Specification error caused by level shifts and temporary changes in ARMA-GARCH models", "paper_id": "WOS:000259293300006"}
