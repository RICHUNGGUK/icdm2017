The use of phase components in 2D (two-dimensional) discrete Fourier transforms of palmprint images makes it possible to achieve highly robust image registration and matching. In the proposed algorithm, POC is used to align scaling, rotation and translation between two palmprint images, and evaluate similarity between them. Experimental evaluation using a palmprint image database clearly demonstrates efficient matching performance of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A palmprint recognition algorithm using Phase-Only Correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000255647700014"}
