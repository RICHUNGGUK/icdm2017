Different approaches have been adopted to analyse the extent to which certain aspects of a computer-generated environment may enhance these factors, but mainly in 2D graphical user interfaces. This study explores the influence of different sensory modalities on performance and the sense of presence experienced within a 3D environment. In particular, we have evaluated visual, auditory and active haptic feedback for indicating selection of virtual objects. The effect of spatial alignment between proprioceptive and visual workspaces (co-location) has also been analysed. An experiment has been made to evaluate the influence of these factors in a controlled 3D environment based on a virtual version of the Simon game. The main conclusions obtained indicate that co-location must be considered in order to determine the sensory needs during interaction within a virtual environment. This study also provides further evidence that the haptic sensory modality influences presence to a higher extent, and that auditory cues can reduce selection times. Conclusions obtained provide initial guidelines that will help designers to set out better selection techniques for more complex environments, such as training simulators based on VR technology, by highlighting different optimal configurations of sensory feedback.", "paper_title": "The influence of different sensory cues as selection feedback and co-location in presence and task performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000331084000006"}
