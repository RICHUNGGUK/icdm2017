The optical implementation features two key components. Firstly, a multiport encoder and a decoder are newly introduced, which allows one to generate and process the optical-code labels simultaneously, thus ensuring a good scalability. Secondly, an optical multicast-capable matrix switch which is composed of 1 x 2 TO-SWs enables the dynamical updating of the multicast forwarding table. Finally, this multicast-capable optical packet switched network is experimentally demonstrated. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
