And nested Mobile Network is prevalent in NEMO environment. But the current framework lacks of efficient mechanism for communication between different mobile networks in the same foreign link. Aiming at this problem, we propose a new basic routing protocol for Nested NEMO in this paper. Also, this protocol can give efficient support to some route optimization algorithms for nested NEMO. Furthermore, we give an extended routing protocol, which can realize local route optimization in the foreign link. We discuss the fixed scenario including mobile network and mobile node in our protocol, too. Evaluation results show that our approach is simple and effective to support communication and route optimization mechanisms in Nested NEMO environment.", "paper_title": "A new routing protocol in Nested NEMO", "paper_id": "WOS:000257602500002"}
