Through experiments on six well-known benchmarks, we find that the HPSO and the HPSO-TVAC algorithms have better performance than the PSO algorithm in most cases, and all the clustering algorithms using PSO have good performance for large-scale data and high-dimensional data, especially the two algorithms proposed in this article. Furthermore, we have also observed that the convergence of the HPSO and the HPSO-TVAC algorithms are better when using a suitable fitness function.", "paper_title": "A comparative analysis of PSO, HPSO, and HPSO-TVAC for data clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000287493400005"}
