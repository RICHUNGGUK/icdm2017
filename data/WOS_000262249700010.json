To consider gravity effect appropriately, there is a minimum value requirement for the contact stiffness of a particle so that unexpected particle overlap can be avoided. This minimum value is called the critical contact stiffness of a particle due to gravity effect. Using the vertical force equilibrium condition of a particle at the bottom of a two-dimensional particle model, a theoretical formula has been successfully derived for determining the critical contact stiffness of the particle in this paper. For the two-dimensional particle model consisting of circular particles of unit thickness, there is a relationship between the critical contact stiffness of a particle and the critical elastic modulus of the particle material when a linear-elastic-con tact model between any two particles is used. Since the elastic moduli of most crustal rocks are greater than the corresponding critical elastic modulus of the particle material, it has been theoretically demonstrated that the particle simulation method, which is based on the linear-elastic-contact model between any two particles, is suitable for simulating gravity effect within the particle model of a large length-scale. The related simulation results have demonstrated the usefulness of the particle simulation method for simulating spontaneous crack generation patterns within brittle crustal rocks.
