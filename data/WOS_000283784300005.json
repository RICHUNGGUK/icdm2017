However, the large amounts of data produced during acquisition prohibits direct transmission of Integral Image data. A number of highly efficient compression architectures are proposed today that outperform standard two-dimensional encoding schemes. However, critical issues regarding real-time compression for quality demanding applications are a primary concern to currently existing Integral Image encoders. In this work we propose a real-time FPGA-based encoder for Integral Image and integral video content transmission. The proposed encoder is based on a highly efficient compression algorithm used in Integral Imaging applications. Real-time performance is achieved by realizing a pipelined architecture, taking into account the specific structure of an Integral Image. The required memory access operations are minimized by adopting a systolic concept of data flow through the core processing elements, further increasing the performance boost. The encoder targets, real-time, broadcast-type high-resolution Integral Image and video sequences and performs three orders of magnitude faster than the analogous software approach.", "paper_title": "Real-time compression architecture for efficient coding in autostereoscopic displays", "paper_id": "WOS:000283784300005"}
