In this paper, we provide a general structure of the weight matrices of multigroup decodable codes using Clifford algebras. Without assuming that the number of variables in each group is the same, a method of explicitly constructing the weight matrices of full-diversity, delay-optimal multigroup decodable codes is presented for arbitrary number of antennas. For the special case of 2(a) number of transmit antennas, we construct two subclass of codes: 1) a class of 2a-group decodable codes with rate a/2((a-1)), which is, equivalently, a class of single-symbol decodable codes, and 2) a class of (2a - 2)-group decodable codes with rate (a-1)/2((a-2)), i.e., a class of double-symbol decodable codes.", "paper_title": "Multigroup Decodable STBCs From Clifford Algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000262328600021"}
