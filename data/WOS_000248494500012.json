With Boolean operations, the method is extended to multi-object clipping and can meet the needs of more complicated clipping applications. Due to hardware acceleration, proposed algorithms achieve interactive display rate and can be used in volume cutting applications such as surgery simulation and so on. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
