Features extracted from the original pixels information using wavelet transform (WT) are fed as input to a feed forward multi-layer neural network (MLP). The WT basically provides the spatial and spectral features of a pixel along with its neighbors and these features are used for improved classification. For testing the performance of the proposed method, we have used two IRS-1A satellite images and one SPOT satellite image. Results are compared with those of the original spectral feature based classifiers and found to be consistently better. Simulation study revealed that Biorthogonal 3.3 (Bior3.3) wavelet in combination with MLP performed better compared to all other wavelets. Results are evaluated visually and quantitatively with two measurements, beta index of homogeneity and Davies-Bouldin (DB) index for compactness and separability of classes. We suggested a modified beta index in accessing the percentage of accuracy (PA beta) of the classified images also.", "paper_title": "Neuro-wavelet classifier for multispectral remote sensing images", "paper_id": "WOS:000251284800004"}
