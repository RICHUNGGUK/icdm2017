Inf. Theory, Vol. 50, pp. 2402-2407,2004). In this correspondence, we investigate the upper bound for this class of sequences. By using the relationship between IRSs and Cps, a new upper bound for (m, k, 1) -IRS is given, which improves the Johnson bound.", "paper_title": "New upper bounds for impulse radio sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000237147400037"}
