The goal is to assign a sensing range, r(i), to each of the sensors y(i) is an element of Y. such that each point p is an element of P is covered by at least k sensors, and the cost, Sigma(i) r(i)(alpha), of the assignment is minimized, where alpha is a constant. In this paper, we assume that alpha = 2, that is, find a set of disks centered at points of Y, such that (1) each point in P is covered by at least k disks, and (11) the sum of the areas of the disks is minimized. We present, for any constant k >= 1, a polynomial-time c(1)-approximation algorithm for this problem, where c(1) = c(1) (k) is a constant. The discrete version, where one has to over a given set of it points, X, by disks centered at points of Y, arises as a subproblem. We present a polynomial-time c(2)-approximation algorithm for this problem, where c(2) = c(2)(k) is a constant.", "paper_title": "MULTI COVER OF A POLYGON MINIMIZING THE SUM OF AREAS", "paper_id": "WOS:000300235000005"}
