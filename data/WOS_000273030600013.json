Equations for the oscillation frequency of the multivibrator are derived taking into account the positive feedback factor around the multivibrator. We show that the use of the fractional capacitance allows the multivibrator to have very high frequencies of oscillation for reasonable time constants used. PSPICE simulation and experimental results demonstrate the analysis with an approximation to a fractional capacitor that yields a result, which is at least 1000 times in frequency compared to if a normal capacitor of the same value was employed.", "paper_title": "On a multivibrator that employs a fractional capacitor", "paper_id": "WOS:000273030600013"}
