The design objective is to prolong the lifetime of wireless ad hoc networks wherein nodes can adaptively adjust their transmission power based on communication ranges. LPAR achieves this goal via two phases. In the first phase, energy draining balancing is achieved by identifying end-to-end paths with high residual energy. The second phase is designed to effectively reduce the power consumed for packet forwarding. This is achieved by iteratively performing adaptive localized power-aware alternate rerouting to bypass each (potentially) high-power link alone, the end-to-end path identified in the first phase. Further, the design of LPAR enables nodes to collect their neighborhood information 'on-demand', which can effectively reduce the overhead for gathering such information. LPAR is suitable for both homogeneous and non-homogeneous networks. Simulation results demonstrate that LPAR achieves improved performance in reducing protocol overhead and also in prolonging network lifetime as compared with existing work.
