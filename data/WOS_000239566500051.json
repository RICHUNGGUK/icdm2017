ARIA is a middleware for describing and executing media processing workflows to process, filter, and fuse sensory inputs and actuate responses in realtime. ARIA is designed with the goal of maximum modularity and ease of integration of a diverse collection of media processing components and data sources. Moreover, ARIA is cognizant of the fact that various media operators and data structures are adaptable in nature; i.e, the delay, size, and quality/precision characteristics of these operators can be controlled via various parameters. In this demo, we present the ARIA design interface in different image processing and retrieval scenarios.", "paper_title": "Modular design of media retrieval workflows using ARIA", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566500051"}
