In this paper, the macroscale mechanical behaviour of soft collagenous tissues is modelled by a three-level multiscale approach, based on a multi-step homogenisation technique from nanoscale up to the macroscale. Nanoscale effects, related to both intermolecular cross-links and collagen mechanics, are accounted for, together with geometric nonlinearities at the microscale. Moreover, an effective submodelling procedure is conceived in order to evaluate the local stress and strain fields at the microscale, which is around and within cells. Numerical results, obtained by using an incremental finite element formulation and addressing stretched tendinous tissues, prove consistency and accuracy of the model at both macroscale and microscale, confirming also the effectiveness of the multiscale modelling concept for successfully analysing physiopathological processes in biological tissues.", "paper_title": "Stress and strain localization in stretched collagenous tissues via a multiscale modelling approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000328539900003"}
