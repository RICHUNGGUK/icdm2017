A graph G is called locally connected if, for every vertex v is an element of V(G), the subgraph induced by the neighbourhood of v is connected. In this paper, we prove that every connected and locally connected graph with more than 3 vertices contains a HIST. Consequently, we confirm the following conjecture due to Archdeacon: every graph that triangulates some surface has a HIST, which was proposed as a question by Albertson, Berman, Hutchinson and Thomassen.", "paper_title": "Homeomorphically Irreducible Spanning Trees in Locally Connected Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000302058500006"}
