The algorithm is based on bidirectional motion compensation. The algorithm has no smoothing in the time domain implying the absence of the image sharpness oscillations in the transformed video sequence. A special post-processing step with adaptively controlled degree of smoothing makes it possible to considerably decrease the \"blocking\" artifact while retaining the maximum number of image details. The absence of complicated mathematical computations allows realtime hardware implementation of the algorithm and real-time video processing.", "paper_title": "Double up-conversion of video frame rate based on bidirectional motion compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000272466500005"}
