Nowadays NNMF is an essential tool in many fields spanning machine learning, data analysis, image analysis or audio source separation, among others. NnmfPack is an efficient numerical library conceived for shared memory heterogeneous parallel systems, and it supports, from its conception, both conventional multi-core processors and many-core coprocessors. In this article, NnmfPack is extended to handle different metrics options (-divergence), and some other parallel algorithms have been added and tested. The performance of the new functionalities of NnmfPack is tested, and some precision results of the implementations are showed using an example borrowed from the image processing field.", "paper_title": "Improving NNMFPACK with heterogeneous and efficient kernels for beta-divergence metrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000353786700016"}
