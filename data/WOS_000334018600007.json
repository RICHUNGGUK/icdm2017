Here, a novel formulation is reported for finite element (FE) analysis of wear acceleration due to scratch damage. A diffused-light photography technique was used to globally locate areas of damage, providing guidance for usage of high-magnification optical profilometry to determine individual scratch morphology. This multiscale image combination allowed comprehensive input of scratch-based damage patterns to an FE Archard wear model, to determine the wear acceleration associated with specific retrieval femoral heads. The wear algorithm imposed correspondingly elevated wear factors on areas of PE incrementally overpassed by individual scratches. Physical validation was provided by agreement with experimental data for custom-ruled scratch patterns. Illustrative wear acceleration results are presented for four retrieval femoral heads.", "paper_title": "A novel formulation for scratch-based wear modelling in total hip arthroplasty", "paper_id": "WOS:000334018600007"}
