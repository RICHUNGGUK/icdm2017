This paper explores the possibility of using this model for multidimensional data visualization. To achieve this, a new learning algorithm called naive Bayes self-organizing map (NBSOM) is proposed to enable the naive Bayes model to perform topographic mappings. The training is carried out by means of an online expectation maximization algorithm with a self-organizing principle. The proposed method is compared with principal component analysis, self-organizing maps, and generative topographic mapping on two benchmark data sets and a real-world image processing application. Overall, the results show the effectiveness of NBSOM for multidimensional data visualization.", "paper_title": "NBSOM: The naive Bayes self-organizing map", "paper_id": "WOS:000307552600024"}
