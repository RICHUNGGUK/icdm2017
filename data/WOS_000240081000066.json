The environment consists of a high-level ubiquitous programming framework, a run-time system enhanced with better context adaptation and security, and programming support tools. In this paper, we focus on a ubiquitous programming framework, which includes a high-level policy description language, a translator to Java and a runtime system. We first present a high-level policy description language for formally specifying context entity relation, as well as context-based access control and adaptation policies. We then describe how a specification in the policy description language can be translated into Java code which makes use of JCAF.", "paper_title": "A policy description language for context-based access control and adaptation in ubiquitous environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000066"}
