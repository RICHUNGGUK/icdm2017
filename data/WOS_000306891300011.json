Based on survey data collected from employees of Indonesian manufacturing companies, a two-stage approach is applied (i) to discover the connectivity relations among business-IT alignment and four aspects of employee alignment orientations, and then (ii) to measure the relative influence of each aspect onto one another. Employee communication is deemed to have the most direct contribution to business-IT alignment. Meanwhile, the connectivity relations show exactly how employee alignment orientations influence business-IT alignment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
