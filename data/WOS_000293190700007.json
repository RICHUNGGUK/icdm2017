Two distinct phases, aimed, respectively, at detecting volumes of interests (VOIs) within the CT scan, and at classifying VOIs into nodules and non-nodules, were considered. Three algorithms, namely thresholding, region growing and robust fuzzy clustering, were used as VOI detectors. For the classification phase, we built multi-classifier systems, which aggregate the decisions of three statistical classifiers, a neural network and a decision tree. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic convex hull method was used to build the final classifier, which results to be the aggregation of the best local behaviors of both classifiers and combiners. All the CAD modules were tested on CT scans analyzed by two expert radiologists. In the experiments, we achieved a sensitivity of 92.5% against a specificity of 83.5%.", "paper_title": "Computer-aided detection of lung nodules based on decision fusion techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000293190700007"}
