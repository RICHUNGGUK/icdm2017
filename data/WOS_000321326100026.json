In order to deal with uncertainty happened, the triangular fuzzy number (TFN) is used to express the fuzzy phenomenon of the sampling plan's parameters. In this plan the acceptable quality level (AQL) and the lot tolerance percent defective (LTPD) are TFN. For such a plan, we design a decision criterion of acceptance and rejection for every arbitrary lambda-cut and a particular table of rejection and acceptance is calculated. This plan is well defined, since, if the parameters are crisp, it changes to a classical plan.", "paper_title": "Sequential sampling plan using fuzzy SPRT", "paper_id": "WOS:000321326100026"}
