However, the iris recognition algorithms are currently implemented on general purpose sequential processing systems, such as generic central processing units (CPUs). In this work, we present a more direct and parallel processing alternative using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), offering an opportunity to increase speed and potentially alter the form factor of the resulting system. Within the means of this project, the most time-consuming operations of a modern iris recognition algorithm are deconstructed and directly parallelized. In particular, portions of iris segmentation, template creation, and template matching are parallelized on an FPGA-based system, with a demonstrated speedup of 9.6, 324, and 19 times, respectively, when compared to a state-of-the-art CPU-based version. Furthermore, the parallel algorithm on our FPGA also greatly outperforms our calculated theoretical best Intel CPU design. Finally, on a state-of-the-art FPGA, we conclude that a full implementation of a very fast iris recognition algorithm is more than feasible, providing a potential small form-factor solution.", "paper_title": "Parallelizing Iris Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000271968200006"}
