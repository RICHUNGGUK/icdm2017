We consider this problem from the perspective of expected query time. We are given the probabilities p(z) that the query point lies within each cell z is an element of S. The entropy H of the resulting discrete probability distribution is the dominant term in the lower bound on the expected-case query time. We show that it is possible to achieve query time H + O(root H + 1) with space O(n), which is optimal up to lower order terms in the query time. We extend this result to subdivisions with convex cells, assuming a uniform query distribution within each cell. In order to achieve space efficiency, we introduce the concept of entropy-preserving cuttings.", "paper_title": "Optimal expected-case planar point location", "paper_id": "WOS:000247647200011"}
