Color-coding is a technique that gives fixed parameter tractable algorithms for several well-known NP-hard optimization problems. In this work, by efficiently parallelizing steps in color-coding, we create two new biological protein interaction network analysis tools: FASCIA for subgraph counting and motif finding and FASTPATH for signaling pathway detection. We demonstrate considerable speedup over prior work, and the optimizations introduced in this paper can also be used for other problems where color-coding is applicable. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
