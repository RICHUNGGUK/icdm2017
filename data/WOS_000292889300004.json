Each mission can have different characteristics that depend on operational and environmental conditions. These proposed preventive maintenance policies are defined and modeled mathematically. The study of these two policies is based on a dynamic system failure law that takes into account the different missions performed. The first step is to determine the optimal business plan to achieve, i.e. the set of missions to perform in order to maximize the profit of missions minus maintenance costs. Thus, for each plan, we determine the maintenance planning considering two policies. The first preventive maintenance policy is periodic and the objective is to determine the optimal number of preventive maintenance to achieve. For the second policy, namely sequential, we calculate the optimal number of preventive maintenance intervals and the duration of these different intervals.", "paper_title": "Periodic and sequential preventive maintenance policies over a finite planning horizon with a dynamic failure law", "paper_id": "WOS:000292889300004"}
