Contemporary strands of IS and organisational change literature were reviewed, grouping common themes into planning, leadership, learning and culture approaches. This theoretical basis was extended through a case analysis of an IS organisation in the banking industry which had undergone wide ranging and successful strategic change. Twenty in-depth interviews were conducted with senior experienced change practitioners from across the organisation. Three propositions on IS and organisational change theory were developed from the finding for this research. Firstly, IS change is a subset of organisational change which is frequently noted and argued through existing academic or 'espoused' change theories. Secondly, whether successful or unsuccessful, strategic change is in itself a rich learning experience which may be leveraged through experience, intuition and self-reflexion. Thirdly, managers develop their own 'theories in use' of change based on experiential learning and apply them in a highly context specific 'informed' way. The main contribution of the research is a 'meta-learning' framework for informing IS strategic change which suggests valuable theoretical insights, a practitioner implementation process and proposals for further research directions and limitations.
