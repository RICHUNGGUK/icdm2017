The purpose of this paper is to develop a QUALIFLEX-based method for multiple criteria group decision making within a decision environment of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. We conduct a statistical inference approach with finite population correction to construct interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. In addition, we incorporate the relative importance of decision makers and fuse individual opinions to form collective ratings using a modified method with weighted interval estimations. In view of diversiform preference types (weak order, strict order, difference order, interval bound, and ratio bound), we represent multiple decision makers' various forms of preference structures and assess criterion weights under incomplete information. By means of score functions, accuracy functions, membershipuncertainty indices, and hesitation-uncertainty indices, a ranking procedure is employed to identify a criterion-wise preference of alternatives. A QUALIFLEX-based model is then established to measure the level of concordance of the complete preference order for handling multiple criteria group decisions. The feasibility of the proposed method is illustrated by a practical problem relating to the selection of a landfill site. As indicated in the application, the proposed method is useful for handling complicated group decision-making problems that involve comprehensive criteria and limited alternatives.", "paper_title": "DATA CONSTRUCTION PROCESS AND QUALIFLEX-BASED METHOD FOR MULTIPLE-CRITERIA GROUP DECISION MAKING WITH INTERVAL-VALUED INTUITIONISTIC FUZZY SETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000326678200004"}
