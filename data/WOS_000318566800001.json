For each polygonal control volume, the pressure is defined in the cell center, whereas the discrete velocity field is given by the normal velocity component at the cell faces. A piecewise high-order polynomial vector velocity field is then reconstructed from the scalar normal velocities at the cell faces by using a new high-order constrained least-squares reconstruction operator. The reconstructed high-order piecewise polynomial velocity field is used for trajectory integration in a semi-Lagrangian approach to discretize the nonlinear convective terms in the governing PDE. For that purpose, a high-order Taylor method is used as ODE integrator. The resulting semi-implicit algorithm is extensively validated on a large set of different academic test problems with exact analytical solution and is finally applied to a real-world engineering problem consisting of a curved channel upstream of two micro-turbines of a hydroelectric power plant. For this realistic case, some experimental reference data are available from field measurements.
