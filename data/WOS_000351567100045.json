However, the H.264/AVC standard does not respond to scene changes, and this causes the transmission quality to deteriorate as a scene change occurs. In this work, a scene change is detected by comparing the ratio of the sum of absolute difference (SAD) between two consecutive frames. As the scene change is detected, the proposed method, which is modified from the reference software of H.264/AVC, re-assigns a quantization parameter (QP) value to regulate the bitrate. Because the inter-prediction works poorly for the scene-changed frame, the proposed method estimates its frame complexity based on the content, and further creates another QR model to assign QP. The adaptive rate control mechanism presented in this study can quickly respond to the heavy bitrate increment caused by a change of scene. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the average peak signal noise ratio (PSNR) to approximately 1.1 dB, with a smaller buffer size compared with the performance of the reference software JM version 17.2.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Rate Control Mechanism in H.264/AVC for Scene Changes", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567100045"}
