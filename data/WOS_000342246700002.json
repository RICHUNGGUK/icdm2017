Because of limited and dynamic energy supply, EPWSNs are duty-cycled to achieve energy-neutrality, a condition where the energy demand does not exceed the energy supply. Duty cycling entails nodes to sleep and wakeup according to a wakeup scheduling scheme. In this paper, we survey the various wakeup scheduling schemes, with focus on their suitability for EPWSNs. A classification scheme is proposed to characterize existing wakeup scheduling schemes, with three main categories, namely, asynchronous, synchronous, and hybrid. Each wakeup scheduling scheme is presented and discussed under the appropriate category. The paper concludes with open research issues. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
