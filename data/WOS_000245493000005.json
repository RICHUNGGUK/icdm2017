In this paper, the bit error rate (BER) performance of OFDM/TDM in a frequency-selective Rayleigh fading, channel is evaluated by computer simulation. It is shown that the use of frequency-domain equalization based on minimum mean square error criterion (MMSE-FDE) can significantly improve the BER performance, compared to the conventional OFDM, by exploiting the channel frequency-selectivity while reducing the PAPR or improving the robustness against long time delays. It is also shown that the performance of OFDM/TDM designed to reduce the PAPR can bridge the conventional OFDM and single-carrier (SC) transmission by changing the design parameter.", "paper_title": "BER performance of OFDM combined with TDM using frequency-domain equalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000245493000005"}
