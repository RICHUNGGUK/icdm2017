Three available algorithms incorporate seismic impacts into DDA simulations for earthquake-induced slope failure. The following methods are used: directly applying time-dependent accelerations to falling/sliding blocks (Method 1); adding time-dependent accelerations to base block (Method 2); and time-dependently constraining seismic displacements of the base block (Method 3). However, incorrect absolute movements of falling/sliding and base blocks were obtained using Method 1. Additionally, relative movements between falling/sliding blocks and the base block are opposite to those simulated by the other two algorithms Methods 2 and 3. Since locating an earthquake-induced landslide before an earthquake is extremely difficult, the seismic movements of base rock are recorded. Method 1 applies recorded seismic data to sliding blocks in conflict with d'Alembert's principle of mechanics. Additionally, in Method 2, when the computation time step must be longer than the time in seismic data, computational results reveal abnormal base block displacements due to the non-zero velocity recorded at the end time of seismic data in seismic DDA. In this study, a novel algorithm to diminish the velocity of the base rock in the seismic analysis is utilized to modify Method 2. Furthermore, this work confirms that DDA with the modified Methods 2 and 3 is a practical approach for earthquake-induced landslide simulations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
