Herein, recent results on sum of correlated chi-squared random variables are employed to derive the probability density function of the ED statistic under both the noise only and the signal plus noise hypotheses. This allows us to derive accurate closed-form expressions of the detection and false alarm probabilities for finite sample-based ED using correlated receiving antennas. Simulation results are presented to validate the accuracy of the derived expressions.", "paper_title": "Closed-Form Approximation for the Performance of Finite Sample-Based Energy Detection Using Correlated Receiving Antennas", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681700008"}
