We submitted results for the following languages: French, Portuguese, Bulgarian and Hungarian, using a passage retrieval system. We focused on a version of this system that combines passages of different size to improve retrieval performance. After an analysis of our experiments and of the official results at CLEF, we find that our passage retrieval combination model achieves considerably improved scores.", "paper_title": "Combining passages in the monolingual task with the IR-n system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000023"}
