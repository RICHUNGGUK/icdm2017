This study uses LRFM customer relationship model, which consists of four dimensions: relation length (L), recent transaction time (R), buying frequency (F), and monetary (M), to carry out customer clusters. We proceed with this clustering analysis to classify customers in order to set discriminative marketing strategies. In addition, this study further employed a cross analysis over three predetermined dimensions: area, sales, and new/old characteristics to enhance the clustering analysis. The results obtained from the real textile business show that the customer groups formed using the four-factor (LRFM) clustering all has statistical significant differences, and with meaningful explanations in terms of marketing strategy. Thus, this study considers useful for discriminative customer relationship management. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
