In order to develop reasonable modular product architecture with physically detachable modules, a new systematic and structured approach for product modularization based on axiomatic design and design structure matrix is proposed. The product is decomposed hierarchically into its functional, physical, and process domains using axiomatic design method. After transformation from design matrix to design structure matrix, the pertinence design structure matrices of design parameters describing function, structure, and manufacturing process are constructed. Besides, a manufacturing process similarity matrix of design parameters is established. Finally, a genetic algorithm combined with the minimal description length is employed to realize the modularization optimization after integration of the above matrices. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, an indoor air conditioner unit is presented as a demonstrative example.", "paper_title": "A product module identification approach based on axiomatic design and design structure matrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000309353500002"}
