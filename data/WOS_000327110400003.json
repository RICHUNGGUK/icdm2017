Its generalized form is the model with a single fractional pole replacing the integer order pole, which is believed to better characterize the reaction curve. In this paper, using time delayed system model with a fractional pole as the starting point, fractional order controllers design for this class of fractional order systems is investigated. Integer order PID and fractional order PI and [PI] controllers are designed and compared for these class of systems. The simulation comparison between PID controller and fractional order PI and [PI] controllers show the advantages of the properly designed fractional order controllers. Experimental results on a heat flow platform are presented to validate the proposed design method in this paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
