These forecasts ingest regional atmospheric data in real time and can consume large computational resources in real time as well. Two highly complementary projects are developing a hardware and software framework to enable real- time multiscale forecasting. Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere and Linked Environments for Atmospheric Discovery are stand- alone systems that offer distinct benefits to their respective user communities, but when used together, promise a paradigm shift in atmospheric science research.", "paper_title": "CASA and LEAD: Adaptive cyberinfrastructure for real-time multiscale weather forecasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000241907100009"}
