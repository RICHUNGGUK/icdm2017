Lower and upper bounds on the domination number of exchanged hypercubes are proved which in particular imply that gamma(EH(2, t)) = 2(t+1) holds for any t >= 2. Using Hamming codes we also prove that gamma (EH(s, 2(k) -1)) <= (2(s) - 2(k))gamma(Q(2k-1)) + (gamma(Q(s)(-)) + 1) holds for s >= k >= 3. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
