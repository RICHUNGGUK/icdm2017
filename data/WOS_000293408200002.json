Flow structures have been investigated inside and outside the RAC to improve efficiencies. Accuracies of the measured velocities by the PIV have been confirmed by a Pitot tube at important locations around the RAC. Then, a numerical analysis has been performed by developed computer programs to design parts for the RAC with improved efficiencies. The design guideline has been proposed based on the analyzed results to reduce the condensation problem and increase the flow rate. Finally, shapes of a fan with high flow rates and an outlet with reduced condensation problems have been obtained based on the developed experimental and numerical methods in this study.", "paper_title": "Study on flow distribution for room air conditioner using visualization technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000293408200002"}
