It is found that the carbon peaks-commonly used as the reference for spectroscopic analysis-shift under mechanical and thermal stretching. Results also indicate that, at different temperatures and among the various functional groups present in PVA, the carbon in the C-O group is the most stable. Computational calculations showed that Hartree-Fock/10-31G (d) reproduces the binding energy of core carbon electrons with an accuracy of 95 %, which is enough to characterize bonds, allowing the results of the spectroscopic analysis to be corroborated.", "paper_title": "Degradation of polyvinyl alcohol under mechanothermal stretching", "paper_id": "WOS:000321922600032"}
