Using the variational framework, we consider the L-1 fidelity term and several possible regularizers. In particular, we use generalizations of the Mumford-Shah (MS) functional to color images and Gamma-convergence approximations to unify deblurring and denoising. Experimental comparisons show that the MS stabilizer yields better results with respect to Beltrami and total variation regularizers. Color edge detection is a beneficial by-product of our methods.", "paper_title": "Deblurring of color images corrupted by impulsive noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000245156500017"}
