On one hand, the limited machine room space and insufficient power supply make it impossible to accommodate exponentially growing amount of network equipment of operators. On the other hand, net heterogeneity caused by different specifications of wireless access equipment causes costly trouble related to management and optimization. This article, correspondingly, proposes a holistic solution involving different technologies, i.e. network function virtualization (NFV), software defined radio (SDR), and software defined network (SDN). In particular, we investigate both existing standards and possible extensions for 4G/5G mobile networks, followed by a few open issues for future research.", "paper_title": "Integrating Network Function Virtualization with SDR and SDN for 4G/5G Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000355756800009"}
