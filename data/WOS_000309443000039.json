We recently developed a new computer-based behavioral assessment of OCD in a previous study. As a follow-up experiment for this method, the goal of this study was to examine whether the new computer-based behavioral assessment would be capable of differentiating behaviors in adults with OCD characterized by checking behavior from those without checking behavior. We compared 22 OCD patients with compulsive checking behaviors (OCD checkers), 17 OCD controls without checking behavior (OCD controls), and 31 healthy controls (HCs) on a novel computer-based behavioral measure of checking behavior. Despite similar levels of successfully completed tasks, OCD checkers demonstrated longer duration of checking behaviors than OCD controls or HCs. Interestingly, no differences were found between OCD controls and HCs in any of the dependent variables. Our new behavioral measure offers a novel, objective, and ecologically valid measure of checking behaviors in a sample of adults with OCD. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
