Our insight is that the use of quasi-uniform mesh sampling, an interesting option now that very large meshes can be edited and displayed in real-time, provides the right framework for expressing and efficiently processing arbitrary changes of topological genus. The user controls deformation by gesture: he sweeps tools that apply a variety of deformation fields, from smoothing and trimming ones to local inflation and constant volume deformation tools. Meanwhile, the quasi-regular mesh seamlessly splits or locally blends when and where needed, while still following the user-specified deformation. Our method guarantees a closed, self-intersection-free mesh, whatever the user action. We demonstrate the practical usability of the resulting, interactive sculpting system through the sculpture of models that would have been extremely difficult to achieve with both current research methods and state of the art professional software.
