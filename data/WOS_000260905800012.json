Certainty-based classification approach had been employed for the classification task in which the assignment criterion used for MUPs is based on a combination of MUP shapes and motor unit firing pattern information. The environment software package consists of several graphical user interfaces used to detect individual MUP waveforms from a raw EMG signal, extract relevant features, and classify the MUPs into motor unit potential trains (MUPTs) using certainty-based classifiers. The development of the proposed software package is useful at enhancing the analysis quality and providing a systematic approach to the EMG signal decomposition process. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
