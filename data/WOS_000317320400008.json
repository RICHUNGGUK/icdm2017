We compute a lower bound on the positive real roots of univariate polynomials using an exponential search. This allows us to derive a worst-case bound of (O) over tilde (B)(d(4)tau(2)) for isolating the real roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients using the classic variant of CF, where d is the degree of the polynomial and tau the maximum bitsize of its coefficients. This improves the previous bound of Sharma by a factor of d(3) and matches the bound derived by Mehlhorn and Ray for another variant of CF which is combined with subdivision; it also matches the worst-case bound of the classical subdivision-based solvers STURM, DESCARTES, and BERNSTEIN.
