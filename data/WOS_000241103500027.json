The goal of this work is to decompose the overall process of tagging of Polish into subproblems of partial disambiguation. Moreover, an architecture of a tagger facilitating this decomposition is proposed. The proposed architecture enables easy integration of hand-written tagging rules with the rest of the tagger. The architecture is open for different types of classifiers. A complete tagger for Polish called TaKIPI is also presented. Its configuration, the achieved results (92.55% of accuracy for all tokens, 84.75% for ambiguous tokens in ten-fold test), and considered variants of the architecture are discussed, too.", "paper_title": "Effective architecture of the Polish tagger", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500027"}
