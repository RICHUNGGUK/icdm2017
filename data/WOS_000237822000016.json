We analyze and evaluate the negative impact of random window adjustments on smoothness, short-term fairness, and long-term fairness. We further propose an experimental congestion avoidance mechanism, namely TCP(alpha, beta, gamma, delta), based on coordinated window adjustments. The flow-level smoothness is enhanced significantly for media-streaming applications, without a cost on fairness and responsiveness. Responsiveness is even boosted when bandwidth is underutilized.", "paper_title": "TCP smoothness and window adjustment strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000237822000016"}
