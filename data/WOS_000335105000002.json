An unstructured triangular or tetrahedral mesh is used near curved boundaries and a structured Cartesian mesh is used to fill the remainder of the domain. A quadrature-free implementation is employed for the regular quadrilateral and hexahedral elements which, together with the reduction in the number of internal faces, leads to a reduction in the cpu time requirements. Numerical examples in two and three dimensions are used to illustrate the benefits of using hybrid meshes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
