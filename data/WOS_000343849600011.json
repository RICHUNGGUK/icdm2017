The method is able to characterize all asymmetrical and symmetrical shapes of a pyran ring, is readily automated, easy to interpret, and maps trivially to IUPAC definitions. It also provides a qualitative measurement of the distortion of the ring. Example applications include the analysis of data from crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations.", "paper_title": "BFMP: A Method for Discretizing and Visualizing Pyranose Conformations", "paper_id": "WOS:000343849600011"}
