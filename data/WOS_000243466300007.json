With DS-EDCA, both strict priority and weighted fair service can be provided. The strict priority service is provided for high priority traffic through carefully setting the EDCA parameter sets of lower priority traffic; the proportional fairness service is enabled by determining the backoff intervals according to the distributed scheduling discipline (DFS). We also propose a hierarchical link sharing model for IEEE 802.11e WLANs, in which AP and mobile stations are allocated different amounts of link resource. The performance of DS-EDCA and EDCA is compared via ns-2 simulations. The results show that DS-EDCA outperforms the original EDCA in terms of its support for both strict priority and weighted fair service. More importantly, DS-EDCA can be easily implemented, and is compatible to the IEEE 802.11 Standard.", "paper_title": "A differentiated service model for enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) of IEEE 802.11e WLANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000243466300007"}
