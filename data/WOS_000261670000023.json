While the optimization design effectively improves the overall performance of the (X) over bar &CUSUM chart over the entire process shift range, it does not increase difficulties in understanding and implementing this combined chart. A new feature pertaining to an additional charting parameter omega (the exponential of the sample mean shift) is also investigated. with the hope of further enhancing the detection effectiveness of the (X) over bar &CUSUM chart. Moreover, this article provides the SPC practitioners with a design table to facilitate the designs of the (X) over bar &CUSUM charts. From this design table, the users can directly find the optimal values of the charting parameters, according to the design specifications. The design table makes the design of an (X) over bar &CUSUM chart as simple as the design of the simplest (X) over bar chart. In general, this article will help to enhance the detection effectiveness of the (X) over bar &CUSUM chart, and facilitate and promote its applications in SPC. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
