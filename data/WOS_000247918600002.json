Although the linear integer programming (LIP) solution we formulate provides the performance upper bound of the margin adaptive (MA) optimization problem, it is hard to be implemented in practice due to its high computational complexity. By regarding each user's equivalent channel gain as approximate independent values and using iterative descent method, we present a heuristic MA resource allocation algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm efficiently converges to the local optimum, which is very close to the performance of the optimal LIP solution. Compared with existing space division multiple access (SDMA) OFDM systems with or without adaptive resource allocation, the proposed algorithm achieves significant performance improvement by exploiting the frequency diversity and multi-user diversity in downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) OFDM systems.", "paper_title": "Margin adaptive optimization in multi-user MISO-OFDM systems under rate constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000247918600002"}
