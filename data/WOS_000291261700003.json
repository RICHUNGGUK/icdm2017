Interactions between specific anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins determine the fate of a cell. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins have been shown to be over-expressed in certain cancers and they are attractive targets for developing anti-cancer drugs. Peptides from the BH3 region of pro-apoptotic proteins have been shown to interact with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and induce biological activity similar to that observed in parent proteins. However, the specificity of BH3 peptides derived from different pro-apoptotic proteins differ for different anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. In this study, we have investigated the relationship between the stable helical nature of BH3 peptides and their affinities to Bcl-X-L, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein. We have carried out molecular dynamics simulations of six BH3 peptides derived from Bak, Bad and Bim pro-apoptotic proteins for a period of 50 ns each in aqueous medium. Due to the amphipathic nature of BH3 peptides, the hydrophobic residues on the hydrophobic face tend to cluster together in all BH3 peptides. While this process resulted in a complete loss of helical structure in 16-mer Bak and 16-mer Bad wild type peptides, stabilizing interactions in the hydrophilic face of the BH3 peptides and capping interactions helped to maintain partial helical character in 16-mer Bad mutant and 16-mer Bim peptides. The latter two 16-mer peptides exhibit higher affinity for Bcl-X-L. Similarly the longer BH3 peptides, 25-mer Bad and 33-mer Bim, also resulted in smaller and stable helical fragments and their helical conformation is stabilized by interactions between residues in the solvent-exposed hydrophilic half of the peptide. The stable nature of helical segment in a BH3 peptide can be directly correlated to its binding affinity and the helical region encompassed the highly conserved Leu residue. We propose that upon approaching the hydrophobic groove of anti-apoptotic proteins, a longer helix will be induced in high affinity BH3 peptides by extending the smaller stable helical segments around the conserved Leu residue in both N- and C-terminal regions. The results reported in this study will have implications in developing peptide-based inhibitors for anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.", "paper_title": "Molecular dynamics simulations of pro-apoptotic BH3 peptide helices in aqueous medium: relationship between helix stability and their binding affinities to the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-X-L", "paper_id": "WOS:000291261700003"}
