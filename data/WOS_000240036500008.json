We determine the pattern of switch control bits and calculate the cost of transporting them. A test case indicates that the cost is much lower than the gain obtained from the segmentation, and that the prospects of segmented buses remain promising.", "paper_title": "Energy consumption for transport of control information on a segmented software-controlled communication architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036500008"}
