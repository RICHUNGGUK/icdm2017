The objective of this clustering is to adhere to some principles of grouping exercised by humans when determining a structure in data. Compared with other clustering approaches, the proposed approach offers more detailed insight into the cluster's structure and the underlying decision making process. This contributes to the enhanced interpretability of the results via the representation capabilities of AFS theory. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by using real-world data, and the obtained results show that the performance of the clustering is comparable with other fuzzy rule-based clustering methods, and benchmark fuzzy clustering methods FCM and K-means. Experimental studies have shown that the proposed fuzzy clustering method can discover the clusters in the data and help specify them in terms of some comprehensive fuzzy rules.
