The photodiode has a maximum responsivity for lambda = 400 nm. Th photosensor functions as a current to frequency converter. Measurements of the microsystem illuminated by blue and UV LEDs demonstrate the good linear behavior, sensitivity and efficiency of the system.", "paper_title": "Fully integrated blue/UV SOI CMOS photosensor for biomedical and environmental applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000284640800007"}
