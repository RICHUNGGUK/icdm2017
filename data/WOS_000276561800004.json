In this paper, we survey the existing work on security and privacy in VANETs from several distinct viewpoints, and classify them into distinct categories based on their cryptographic techniques, implementation methodologies, functionality, and other important characteristics. We identify the pertinent characteristics of different approaches and highlight their comparative advantages and disadvantages.", "paper_title": "Privacy and Anonymity in VANETs: A Contemporary Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000276561800004"}
