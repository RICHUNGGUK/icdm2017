A visco-hyperelastic model is formulated with regard to fat pad tissue, while a fibre-reinforced hyperelastic model is considered for the heel skin tissue. Bone components are defined by means of an orthotropic linear elastic model. Particular attention is paid to the evaluation of constitutive parameters within different models adopted in consideration of experimental tests data. Preliminarily, indentation tests on a skinless cadaveric foot are considered with regard to fat pad tissue. Indentation tests on an intact heel pad of a cadaveric foot are subsequently adopted for the final identification of constitutive parameters of fat pad and skin tissues. A numerical model of the rear foot is defined and different loading conditions are assumed according to experimental data. A comparison between experimental and numerical data leads to the evaluation of the real capability of the procedure to interpret the actual response of the rear foot.", "paper_title": "Constitutive formulation and numerical analysis of the heel pad region", "paper_id": "WOS:000303560700008"}
