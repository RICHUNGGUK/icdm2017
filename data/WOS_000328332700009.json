The classical design of this vehicle contains a four-way frame, at which nodes electric motors with propellers rigidly mounted on their axles. An approach to solving the problem is proposed, based on application of the method of two-level control, according to which the required control is constructed in the form of the sum of a desired control and an additional feedback stabilizing the zero solution of the system of equations in deviations from the desired motion. The complete controllability of the nonstationary linear system in deviations is strictly proved. For constructing a stabilizing feedback, a known solution of the problem on linear controller with quadratic cost function is used. The proposed approach makes it possible to develop a general numerical method for constructing a control that provides a stable motion of the quadrotor helicopter along arbitrary smooth three-dimensional trajectories.", "paper_title": "Stabilization of desired motion of a quadrotor helicopter", "paper_id": "WOS:000328332700009"}
