To this end, algorithm parameters are commonly calibrated by means of either theoretic analysis or intensive experimentation. When undertaking a detailed statistical analysis of the influence of each parameter, the designer should pay attention mostly to the parameters that are statistically significant. In this paper the ANOVA (ANalysis Of the VAriance) method is used to carry out an exhaustive analysis of a simulated annealing based method and the different parameters it requires. Following this idea, the significance and relative importance of the parameters regarding the obtained results, as well as suitable values for each of these, were obtained using ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey HSD test, on four well known function optimization problems and the likelihood function that is used to estimate the parameters involved in the lognormal diffusion process. Through this statistical study we have verified the adequacy of parameter values available in the bibliography using parametric hypothesis tests.", "paper_title": "Determining the significance and relative importance of parameters of a simulated quenching algorithm using statistical tools", "paper_id": "WOS:000307252400006"}
