But the allocation problem of intermediate measures does not arouse attention in this movement. This negligence will lead to biased efficiency measurement of overall system as well as individual stages. The paper proposes a two-stage DEA model considering simultaneously the structure of inputs and intermediate measures in efficiency evaluation and decomposition. The methodology extends previous work in which the intermediate measures play only a linking role in DMU efficiency forming. The study follows an empirical analysis which shows that the proposed model is able to revise the efficiency scores over-evaluated by traditional model and sub-evaluated by conventional two-stage model. The application results support the arguments that assignment of intermediate measure has strategic implications for decision makers and should therefore be fully examined from the expert and intelligent systems perspective.
