The approach employs an improved group search optimizer (iGSO) proposed in this paper by incorporating particle swarm optimization (PSO) into group search optimizer (GSO) for optimal setting of DGs. The proposed approach is executed on a networked distribution system the IEEE 14-bus test system for different objectives. The results are also compared to those that executed by basic GSO algorithm and PSO algorithm on the same test system. The results show the effectiveness and promising applications of the proposed approach in optimal location and capacity of DGs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
