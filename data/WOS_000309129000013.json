Both leader free and virtual leader available are considered. For leader free, a set of control laws is proposed, and it is proved that the agent velocities become the same asymptotically, and avoidance of collisions between the agents is ensured. For virtual leader available, a set of control laws that relies on the state information and the external signal is proposed. With the control laws all agents can follow the virtual leader.", "paper_title": "Flocking of multi-agents with time delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000309129000013"}
