We examined the effects of horizontal and vertical coordination on project performance. A total of 169 responses from IS project managers listed in the Project Management Institute of the USA were solicited, obtained, and analyzed. The results indicated that horizontal coordination can enhance the level of leadership empowerment and knowledge transfer, and help to clarify the mission and objectives among team members, while vertical coordination can enhance knowledge transfer. The results further suggested that project performance was improved by empowering team members, promoting knowledge transfer among team members and specifying clear mission and project objectives.
