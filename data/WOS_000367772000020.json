The flexure-based stage comprises symmetric flexure guiding mechanism and two piezoelectric stack actuators. The layout of the stage is evaluated by finite element analysis, and the results indicate that the proposed design exhibits ultralow parasitic rotation. A prototype of the stage is then fabricated, and its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the stage has a stroke of 500 mu m x 500 mu m and the crosstalk is less than 1%. The maximum parasitic rotation is +/- 1.2 arcsec at a stroke of 500 mu m. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
