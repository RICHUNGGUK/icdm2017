The motivation behind this paper was to analyze the existing remote attestation techniques in order to figure out their strengths and weaknesses. We have analyzed Integrity Measurement Architecture, Policy-reduced Integrity Measurement Architecture, Property-based Attestation, Remote Attestation on Program Execution, Semantic Remote Attestation, Trustable Remote Verification of Web Services, and Model-based Behavior Attestation. Each of the existing remote attestation techniques was found to be effective in some situations but was found to be infeasible in others. Therefore, a new remote attestation technique is needed, which is platform independent and flexible enough to meet the challenges of today's scalable computing environments.
