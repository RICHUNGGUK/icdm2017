Recent studies have mostly focused on identifying motivational factors in digital games (e.g., curiosity, rules, control) that support intrinsic motivation. These findings, however, are limited in two fronts. First, they did not depict the interactive nature of the motivational processing in DGBL Second, they excluded the outcome processing (learners' final effort versus performance evaluation) as a possible motivation component to sustain the iterative game playing cycle. To address these problems, situated in the integrative theory of Motivation, Volition, and Performance (MVP), this study examined the relationship between motivational processing and outcome processing in an online instructional game. The study surveyed 264 undergraduate students after playing the Trade Ruler online game. Based on the data collected by ARCS-based Instructional Materials Motivational Survey (IMMS), a regression analysis revealed a significant model between motivational processing (attention, relevance, and confidence) and the outcome processing (satisfaction). The finding preliminarily suggests that both motivational processing and outcome processing need to be considered when designing DGBL. Furthermore, the finding implies a potential relationship between intrinsic motives and extrinsic rewards in DGBL.
