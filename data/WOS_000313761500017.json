Traditional genetic algorithm employs genetic operations, such as selection, mutation and crossover to generate the optimal solution. In practice, the child solutions generated by crossover and mutation are largely random and therefore cannot ensure the fast convergence of the algorithm. To tackle the weakness of traditional GA, the ELM is introduced to estimate the nonlinear functional relationships between the parent population and child population generated by genetic operations. The trained downward-climbing and upward-climbing ELMs are then employed to generate candidate solutions, which forms the new population together with the solutions given by genetic operations. The proposed algorithm is applied to the power system economic dispatch problem. As demonstrated in case studies, the modified genetic algorithm is able to locate local minima faster and escape from local minima with a greater probability. The proposed algorithm can therefore ensure the faster convergence and provide more economical dispatch plans. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
