They do not require any iterations and standard computer routines can be employed for model fitting. Emphasis has been given to the consistency and asymptotic normality for both estimators, but the finite sample performance of the WLS estimator has not been thoroughly investigated. The finite sample performance of these two estimators is compared using an extensive simulation study as well as an analysis of the Stanford heart transplant data. The results demonstrate that the WLS approach performs much better than the KSV method and is reliable for use with censored data. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
