The strategies focus on the affected areas in the images, the separability, and smoothness of the transformations by exploiting a representation of images on quantum computers extensively. The complexity in terms of the number of basic gates and the depth of the corresponding circuits are analyzed to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy. Examples to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed strategies are presented. The strategies provide high level tools to explore and analyze transformations which are necessary to build practical image processing applications on quantum computers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
