In the context of the proof planner MULTI and the agent-based reasoning system Omega-ANTS, we present techniques to automatically synthesize proof planning methods and Omega-ANTS-agents from assertions such that they can be actively used by these systems. This in turn enables a user to effectively use these systems without having to know the peculiarities of coding methods and agents.", "paper_title": "Synthesizing proof planning methods and Omega-ants agents from mathematical knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000239954600008"}
