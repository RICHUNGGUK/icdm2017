To do so, we try to approximate the solution of Hamiltonian conditions based on the Pontryagin minimum principle (PMP). For this purpose, we introduce an error function that contains all PMP conditions. In the proposed error function, we used trial solutions for the trajectory function, control function and the Lagrange multipliers. These trial solutions are constructed by using neurons. Then, we minimize the error function that contains just the weights of the trial solutions. Substituting the optimal values of the weights in the trial solutions, we obtain the optimal trajectory function, optimal control function and the optimal Lagrange multipliers.", "paper_title": "Optimal control problem via neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000326889800028"}
