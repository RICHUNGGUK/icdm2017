In our previous research, which was summarized in Zaslavski (2006b), we showed that approximate solutions are determined mainly by the integrand, and are essentially independent of the choice of time interval and data, except in regions close to the endpoints of the time interval. In the present paper we establish convergence of approximate solutions in regions close to the endpoints of the time intervals.", "paper_title": "Convergence of approximate solutions of variational problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000278080400017"}
