It serves as a major alternative for training and teaching professionals, technicians, skilled workers, amateurs and students who cannot manage regular college education due to time, cost and distance factors. Prior research focuses on learning enhancement from several perspectives like computer mediated methods, learning games, personalized learning environments and web based instructional design. The proposed work contributes to this debate by investigating the role of collaboration i.e. student-student and student-instructor interaction, support material, instructor's feedback and evaluating their effects on learning outcome and students' learning experience. The investigation is performed through a case study presenting four vocational courses offered in three consecutive sessions. The findings revealed that collaborative practices i.e. group work, team effort, in time instructor's feedback and consolidated support material enhances learning experience of student and contributes positively to the learning outcome.
