Our approach involves a covariant functor psi from the category of fuzzy uniform spaces and fuzzy uniformly continuous mappings (in our sense) to the category of uniform spaces and uniformly continuous mappings. We show that psi is well-behaved with respect to some significant fuzzy uniform concepts. and its behavior provides a method to introduce notions of tine fuzzy uniform structure and Stone-tech fuzzy compactification in this context. Our method also applies to obtain fuzzy versions of some classical results on topological algebra and hyperspaces. The case of quasi-uniform structures is also analyzed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
