Starting from two alternative definitions of combinatorial maps: the classical definition by gluing half-edges, and a definition by non-ambiguous depth-first traversal, we derive non-trivial asymptotic expansions and efficient random generation of logic formulae (syntactic trees) in the BCI or BCK systems.
