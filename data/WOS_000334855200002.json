However, measurement of tumour volume over time potentially masks a range of biological changes that the xenograft is undergoing. In this paper a mechanistic model of tumour growth in xenografts is presented that can be used to investigate the mode of drug action with respect to phenotypic changes. The model encapsulates key histological biomarkers and spatial constraints. The unknown model parameters are first shown to be uniquely identifiable from the proposed experimental studies, and then estimated from the resulting data using the anti-cancer agent docetaxel.
