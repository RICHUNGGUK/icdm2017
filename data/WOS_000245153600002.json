Our approach, particularly suited for mechanical or Computer Aided Design (CAD) parts, produces a mixed quadrangle-triangle control mesh, optimized in terms of face and vertex numbers while remaining independent of the connectivity of the input mesh. Our algorithm begins with a decomposition of the object into surface patches. The main idea is to approximate the region boundaries first and then the interior data. Thus, for each patch, a first step approximates the boundaries with subdivision curves (associated with control polygons) and creates an initial subdivision surface by linking the boundary control points with respect to the lines of curvature of the target surface. Then, a second step optimizes the initial subdivision surface by iteratively moving control points and enriching regions according to the error distribution. The final control mesh defining the whole model is then created assembling every local subdivision control meshes. This control polyhedron is much more compact than the original mesh and visually represents the same shape after several subdivision steps, hence it is particularly suitable for compression and visualization tasks. Experiments conducted on several mechanical models have proven the coherency and the efficiency of our algorithm, compared with existing methods.", "paper_title": "A framework for quad/triangle subdivision surface fitting: Application to mechanical objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000245153600002"}
