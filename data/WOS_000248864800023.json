A complete multipartite graph is balanced if each of its partite sets has the same size. In this paper it is proved that the complete multipartite graph G can be decomposed into 4-cycles cyclically if and only if G is balanced and 4-sufficient. Moreover, the problem of finding a maximum cyclic packing of the complete multipartite graph with 4-cycles are also presented.", "paper_title": "Maximum cyclic 4-cycle packings of the complete multipartite graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000248864800023"}
