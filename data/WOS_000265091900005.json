Fuzzy-UCS is inspired by UCS, an on-line accuracy-based Learning Classifier System. Fuzzy-UCS introduces a linguistic representation of the rules with the aim of evolving more readable rule sets, while maintaining similar performance and generalization capabilities to those presented by UCS. The behavior of Fuzzy-UCS is analyzed in detail from several perspectives. The granularity of the linguistic fuzzy representation to define complex decision boundaries is illustrated graphically, and the test performance obtained with different inference schemes is studied. Fuzzy-UCS is also compared with a large set of other fuzzy and nonfuzzy learners, demonstrating the competitiveness of its on-line architecture in terms of performance and interpretability. Finally, the paper shows the advantages obtained when Fuzzy-UCS is applied to learn fuzzy models from large volumes of data.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy-UCS: A Michigan-Style Learning Fuzzy-Classifier System for Supervised Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000265091900005"}
