Some further regularity in W(1,2+delta), delta > 0, is obtained for the weak solutions. The shape sensitivity analysis by the boundary variations technique is performed for the weak solutions. As a result, the existence of the strong material derivatives for the weak solutions of the problem is shown. The result can be used to establish the shape differentiability for a broad class of shape functionals for the models of Fourier-Navier-Stokes flows under the electromagnetic field.", "paper_title": "Incompressible Maxwell-Boussinesq approximation: Existence, uniqueness and shape sensitivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000278066900014"}
