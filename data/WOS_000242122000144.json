Temperatures of the pistons in the testbench of a Diesel Engine 4112 are measured using hardness recovery methods. Then the experimental results are employed as boundary conditions for the pistons FEA, which estimates their temperature field and their thermal loading capability. The FEA result provides effective theoretical evidence for further improving the pistons' performance.", "paper_title": "Temperature field estimation for the pistons of Diesel Engine 4112", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000144"}
