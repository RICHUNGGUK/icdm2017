It simulates the process of the attraction and merging of objects due to their gravity force. The procedure is simplified by not considering velocity and multi-force attraction. The proposed hierarchical method does not depend on random initialization and the results can be used as better initial centers for K-means to achieve higher performance under the SSE (sum-squared-error) criterion. The experimental results on the recognition of handwritten Chinese characters show that the proposed approach can generate better prototypes than K-means and the results obtained by MCE training can be further improved when the proposed method is employed.", "paper_title": "A new simplified gravitational clustering method for multi-prototype learning based on minimum classification error training", "paper_id": "WOS:000240262900018"}
