A virtual screening protocol using fFLASH for the human estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) was advanced and benchmarked against screens completed using established commercial screening softwares Catalyst and ROCS. The optimised protocol was applied to a similar to 6000 member physical screening collection and virtual hits sourced and biologically assayed. The approach identified a novel, potent and highly selective partial antagonist of the ERa. This study firstly validates the clique detection algorithm utilised by fFLASH and secondly, emphasises the benefits of the consensus approach of employing more than one program in a VS protocol.", "paper_title": "Consensus Computational Ligand-Based Design for the Identification of Novel Modulators of Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha", "paper_id": "WOS:000302862700004"}
