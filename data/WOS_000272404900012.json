Quiescent initial conditions with the chamber initially filled with an inert, hot gas are used to provide physically realistic starting conditions and robust, reliable combustion initiation. Transient processes are visualized by using a distinct initial fluid in the combustor whose concentration is tracked as it is expelled. The duration of the transient is shown to be dependent on the characteristic turn-over time for recirculation zones and the time for the chamber pressure to reach steady conditions. Substantial changes in the initial condition did not materially affect the length of the transient. Different combustor geometries changed the ratio of pressure equilibration time and species replenishment time, but did not have a major effect on the overall duration of the transient. Representative comparisons of the time-averaged, stationary results with experiment are presented to document the computations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
