Unlike Shamir's secret sharing, the proposed scheme does not use a polynomial. In the secret image sharing procedure, a histogram is generated by the difference value between the original and copy images. And, the secret image is embedded into original and copy images by using histogram shifting. Lastly, generated shadow images are distributed to each participant. In the experimental results, we measure embedding capacity of secret image and a distortion ratio between original and shadow images. The experimental results show that the embedding capacity and image distortion ratio of the proposed scheme are superior to the previous schemes.", "paper_title": "A New (n, n)-threshold Reversible Secret Image Sharing Using Histogram Shifting", "paper_id": "WOS:000361372000025"}
