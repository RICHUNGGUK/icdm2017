Design/methodology/approach - A conventional level set method using the smeared Heaviside function has been employed for shape and topology optimizations. The smeared Heaviside function yields an indistinct interface boundary, and so can increase computational time and cause numerical errors. The adaptive level set method does not use the smeared Heaviside function. To coincide with the material interface, it processes the zero level as the boundary data of element meshing. Findings - Usefulness and accuracy of shape optimization using the adaptive level set method are shown by comparison to the conventional level set method. A shape optimization procedure using the adaptive level set method is introduced. Numerical examples are employed to explain how the adaptive level set method is applied. Originality/value - The adaptive level set method is proposed to relieve the interface problem of the conventional level set method. Shape variation in the optimization is calculated from the continuum sensitivity analysis.", "paper_title": "Adaptive level set method for accurate boundary shape in optimization of electromagnetic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000339620000008"}
