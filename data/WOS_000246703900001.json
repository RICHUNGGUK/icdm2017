We consider this problem and its variant MAX AW CSP where the weights are allowed to be both positive and negative, and study how the complexity of the problems depends on the allowed constraint types. We prove that MAX AW CSP over an arbitrary finite domain exhibits a dichotomy: it is either polynomial-time solvable or NP-hard. Our proof builds on two results that may be of independent interest: one is that the problem of finding a maximum H-colourable subdigraph in a given digraph is either NP-hard or trivial depending on H, and the other a dichotomy result for MAX CSP with a single allowed constraint type.
