Villaveces in Bogota (Colombia) in July 2010, Joachim Schummer, editor-in-chief of HYLE-International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry(i) (HYLE), discussed with Restrepo the possibility of editing a special issue of HYLE devoted to philosophical and historical aspects of mathematical chemistry and, more general, the relationship between chemistry and mathematics. In the first HYLE issues of each 2012 and 2013, nine papers were published(2) collecting the thoughts, reflexions and investigations by leading scholars in mathematical chemistry and philosophy of chemistry. As a response, Ivan Gutman, editor-in-chief of MATCH Communications in Mathematical and in Computer Chemistry(ii) (MATCH), invited Restrepo to write a document for MATCH commenting about the HYLE issues. In the following lines, we summarise our experience editing the two issues and use the opportunity to ponder on some unsolved questions in the philosophy of mathematical chemistry.", "paper_title": "Philosophical Aspects of Mathematical Chemistry", "paper_id": "WOS:000343077300017"}
