The achievement of this scheme, referred to as consumer grids, requires not only an efficient network paradigm for job transmission, but also a scalable and robust architecture, since there is a large number of dynamic resources and users (perhaps millions) and a high frequency of job requests in the consumer market. It has already been verified that the optical burst switching (OBS) network is a promising candidate for consumer grids. However, all the current architectures proposed for grids over OBS networks are client-server (COS) based, carrying the disadvantages of poor scalability, poor fault tolerance, and low efficiency with increasing numbers of grid users and jobs. In order to address this issue, a novel peer-to-peer (P2P)-based architecture for optical grids is investigated, and this architecture is experimentally demonstrated on a labeled OBS (LOBS) network testbed. Results from theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration show that the proposed P2P-based architecture is feasible, scalable, and efficient for grid applications. Moreover, it outperforms COS-based architectures for emerging large-scale consumer-oriented grid applications.", "paper_title": "Experimental Investigation of a Peer-to-Peer-Based Architecture for Emerging Consumer Grid Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000270332700006"}
