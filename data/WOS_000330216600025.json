First, the power (including crosstalk-induced power) prediction for ultradeep submicron ICs and nano systems is proposed. The novelty of the method for crosstalk prediction is deduced by employing a polynomial progressive calibration. Second, as a part of this methodology, we present a new solution for power prediction of through-silicon-vias.", "paper_title": "Predictive Application of PIDF and PPC for Interconnects' Crosstalk, TSV, and LER Issues in UDSM ICs and Nano-Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000330216600025"}
