Using Gaussian mixture models as groundwork, the proposed method expresses the features of skins in a probability form and incorporates them into the mixture-based framework. Moreover, to alleviate the influence of shadows, the properties of shadows are also formulated as probabilities and used for shadow detection and elimination. In addition to moving skin region detection, this paper also develops two practical fingertip input applications to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed detection method. The two applications are Mandarin Phonetic Symbol combination recognition system and single fingertip virtual keyboard implementation. Experimental results have shown the advantages of the proposed detection method and the effectiveness of the two application implementations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
