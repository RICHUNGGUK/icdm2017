Our procedure is straightforward and easy to follow. We apply it to 1587 instances taken from benchmark problem sets and compare our results to those found in the literature. We find that our procedure produces very high-quality solutions very quickly and generates several new optimal solutions. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
