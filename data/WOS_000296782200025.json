It is natural to ask what information is hidden behind these \"0\" s and \"1\" s. Unfortunately, recent matrix completion methods, though very effective in many cases, are less likely to infer something interesting from these (0,1)-matrices. To answer this challenge, we propose INDEVI, a very succinct and effective algorithm to perform independent-evidence-based transactional database transformation. Each entry of a (0,1)-matrix is evaluated by \"independent evidence\" (maximal supporting patterns) extracted from the whole matrix for this entry. The value of an entry, regardless of its value as 0 or 1, has completely no effect for its independent evidence. The experiment on a genephenotype database shows that our method is highly promising in ranking candidate genes and predicting unknown disease genes.", "paper_title": "Transactional Database Transformation and Its Application in Prioritizing Human Disease Genes", "paper_id": "WOS:000296782200025"}
