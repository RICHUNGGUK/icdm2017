Assuming trajectory information is already available, we represent trajectories as temporal ordering of subtrajectories. This approach solves the problem of trajectory representation when only partial trajectory information is available due to occlusion. It is achieved by a hypothesis testing-based method applied to curvature data computed from trajectories. The subtrajectories are then represented by their principal component analysis (PCA) coefficients for optimally compact representation. Different techniques are integrated to index and retrieve subtrajectories, including PCA, spectral clustering, and string matching. We assume a query by example mechanism where an example trajectory is presented to the system and the search system returns a ranked list of most similar items in the dataset. Experiments based on datasets obtained from University of California at Irvine's KDD archives and Columbia University's DVMM group demonstrate the superiority of our proposed PCA-based approaches in terms of indexing and retrieval times and precision recall ratios, when compared to other techniques in the literature.", "paper_title": "Real-time motion trajectory-based indexing and retrieval of video sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000243041500007"}
