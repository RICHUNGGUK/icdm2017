The proposed metric is formulated via a simple linear combination of values and weights. Values are calculated for each pair of users between which the similarity is obtained, whilst weights are only calculated once, making use of a prior stage in which a genetic algorithm extracts weightings from the recommender system which depend on the specific nature of the data from each recommender system. The results obtained present significant improvements in prediction quality, recommendation quality and performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
