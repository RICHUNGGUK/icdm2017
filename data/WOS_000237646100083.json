This requires new types of concurrency control mechanism to support mobile transactions executed in the mobile clients, which have low-bandwidths toward the server. In this paper, we propose an OCC/DTA (Optimistic Concurrency Control with Dynamic Timestamp Adjustment) protocol that can be efficiently adapted to mobile computing environments. The protocol reduces communication overhead by using client-side validation procedure and enhances transaction throughput by adjusting serialization order without violating transaction semantics. We show that the proposed protocol satisfies data consistency requirements, and simulate that this protocol can improve the performance of mobile transactions in data broadcasting environments.", "paper_title": "A timestamp-based optimistic concurrency control for handling mobile transactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100083"}
