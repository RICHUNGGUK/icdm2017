Quality inspection of solar cells ensures high energy conversion efficiency of the product. The surface of a multi-crystal solar wafer shows multiple crystal grains of random shapes and sizes. It creates an inhomogeneous texture in the surface, and makes the defect inspection task extremely difficult. This paper proposes an automatic defect detection scheme based on Haar-like feature extraction and a new clustering technique. Only defect-free images are used as training samples. In the training process, a binary-tree clustering method is proposed to partition defect-free samples that involve tens of groups. A uniformity measure based on principal component analysis is evaluated for each cluster. In each partition level, the current cluster with the worst uniformity of inter-sample distances is separated into two new clusters using the Fuzzy C-means. In the inspection process, the distance from a test data point to each individual cluster centroid is computed to measure the evidence of a defect. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method is effective and efficient to detect various defects in solar cells. It has shown a very good detection rate, and the computation time is only 0.1 s for a 550 x 550 image. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
