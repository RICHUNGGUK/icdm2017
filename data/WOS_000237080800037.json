This kind of project is formed by multidisciplinary teams, which must consist of people with specific knowledge to execute different tasks. As the expertise of an employee often differs in small but significant details, simple classification or a keyword approach is not sufficient for competence identification. A way of reasoning the competences of a person is to analyze the documents this person created. We have chosen a number of criteria, described in this paper, to measure the degree of expertise and, consequently, propose team formation to projects, people's participation in a community and identify the strengths and weaknesses of an organization.", "paper_title": "Recommendation for team and virtual community formations based on competence mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800037"}
