The characters of personalized data-mining is reviewed and discussed in the beginning, and then an innovative algorithm (FP-Tree time-validity algorithm) of Web pageviews, based on personalization, is raised. More authentic information can be efficiently got by adding time-validity coefficient to M-Tree storage structure to implement increment raining.", "paper_title": "FTT algorithm of web pageviews for personalized recommendation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800014"}
