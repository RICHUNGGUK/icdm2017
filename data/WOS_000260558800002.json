The construction of I-codes enables a sender to encode any message such that if its integrity is violated in transmission over a radio channel, the receiver is able to detect it. In order to achieve this, we rely on the physical properties of the radio channel and on unidirectional error-detecting codes. We analyze in detail the use of I-codes, and we present their implementation on a wireless platform as a \" proof of concept.\" We further introduce a novel concept called \"authentication through presence,\" whose broad applications include broadcast authentication, key establishment, and navigation signal protection. We perform a detailed analysis of the security of our coding scheme, and we show that it is secure within a realistic attacker model.", "paper_title": "Integrity Codes: Message Integrity Protection and Authentication over Insecure Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000260558800002"}
