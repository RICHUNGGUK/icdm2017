Unfortunately, they also exhibit pathologies resulting from their game-theoretic nature, and these pathologies interfere with finding solutions that correspond to optimal collaborations of interacting agents. We address this problem by biasing a cooperative CEA in such a way that the fitness of an individual is based partly on the result of interactions with other individuals (as is usual), and partly on an estimate of the best possible reward for that individual if partnered with its optimal collaborator. We justify this idea using existing theoretical models of a relevant subclass of CEAs, demonstrate how to apply biasing in a way that is robust with respect to parameterization, and provide some experimental evidence to validate the biasing approach. We show that it is possible to bias coevolutionary methods to better search for optimal multiagent behaviors.", "paper_title": "Biasing coevolutionary search for optimal multiagent behaviors", "paper_id": "WOS:000242751400001"}
