We prove that for r(3) < 3.42 this heuristic succeeds with probability asymptotically bounded away from zero. Previously, heuristics of increasing sophistication were shown to succeed for r(3) < 3.26. We improve up to r(3) < 3.52 by further exploiting the degree of the negation of the evaluated to TRUE literal.
