A new design method of NPC is proposed. Correspondingly, the necessary and sufficient conditions on the stability of the closed-loop networked control system are derived. The merit of the proposed design method lies in its decreased conservativeness, which is achieved by packing the current predictive control signal with history predictive signals. By this means, the future plant input is known. Therefore, the state predictor can be designed such that its performance and stability will not be affected by the future input of the plant, while the existing design methods of NPC cannot do so. The proposed design method is shown to be much less conservative than the existing result through several examples.", "paper_title": "A new networked predictive control approach for systems with random network delay in the forward channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000277149800004"}
