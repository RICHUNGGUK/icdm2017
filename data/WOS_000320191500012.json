The rank preservation problem is converted to the nonsingularity analysis problem of the minors of the matrix in discussion. Based on some essential properties of matrix measures, a new sufficient algebraically elegant criterion for the robust controllability of linear interval systems with multiple control delays is established. A numerical example is given to illustrate the application of the proposed sufficient algebraic criterion.", "paper_title": "Robust controllability of linear interval systems with multiple control delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000320191500012"}
