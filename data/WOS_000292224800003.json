Motivated by the idea of power aggregation [R.R. Yager, The power average operator, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics-Part A 31 (2001) 724-731], in this paper, we develop a series of operators for aggregating IFNs, establish various properties of these power aggregation operators, and then apply them to develop some approaches to multiple attribute group decision making with Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy information. Moreover, we extend these aggregation operators and decision making approaches to interval-valued Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy environments.
