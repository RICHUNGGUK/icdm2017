This problem is very difficult to resolve using a conventional reset. image sticking was investigated by observing the light emission from the reset, indicating that the wall charges accumulated Oil the Sustain electrodes were the major cause. A few face (plate-gap) discharges equated the wall voltages on the sustain electrodes and set all cells of the PDP at the same external voltage for firing a Surface discharge. The image sticking phenomenon disappeared after the face discharges. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
