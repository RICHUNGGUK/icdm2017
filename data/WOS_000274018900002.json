A variety of qualitative explanations are presented in the literature to analyze and address resiliency and vulnerability. Unfortunately, most of the explanation do not provide an objective resilience index computation. This paper attempts to develop a resilience index for urban infrastructure using a belief function framework. The belief function framework can handle subjective, independent information and hierarchical data, all of which are characteristics of the inputs required for proper resilience index analyses. The steps of the analyses are presented using a prototype urban highway infrastructure network.", "paper_title": "Formulation of Resilience Index of Urban Infrastructure Using Belief Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000274018900002"}
