In particular, class of binary patterns including characters/primitives and symbols has been considered in the scope of this work. We demonstrate novel binary multiple kernel learning-based classification architecture for applications including such problems for fast and efficient performance. The character/primitive classification problem primarily concentrates on Gujarati and Bangla character recognition from the analytical and experimental context. A novel feature representation scheme for symbols images is introduced containing the necessary elastic and non-elastic deformation invariance properties. The experimental efficacy of proposed framework for symbol classification has been demonstrated on two public data sets.", "paper_title": "Feature combination for binary pattern classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000345094500005"}
