In the present study, a 3D finite element L4-L5 model was developed and subjected to a 1200N compression preload. Five groups of muscle forces were applied on L4 under flexion-extension, lateral bending and axial rotation. Topology optimisation was employed for reducing the stress shielding effect by removing the ineffective material from the design domain. The optimised design was designed with polyaryletheretherketone (PEEK) titanium and cortical materials to encounter the shielding response. The stress responses show that the new design increased the stress magnitude by at least 17.10, 18.11 and 18.43% in 4Nm of flexion-extension, lateral bending and axial rotation, respectively. In conclusion, the material factor did not significantly alter the stress magnitude, but volume was the key factor in reducing the stress shielding effect.", "paper_title": "Topology optimisation of spinal interbody cage for reducing stress shielding effect", "paper_id": "WOS:000278314600003"}
