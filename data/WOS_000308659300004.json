The circuits consist of a hierarchy of interconnected modules, reflecting the structure of circuits designed using a system-on-chip design flow. Within each level of hierarchy, modules can be connected in a bus, star, or dataflow configuration. Our circuit generator is calibrated based on a careful study of existing system-on-chip circuits. We show that our benchmark circuits lead to more realistic architectural conclusions than circuits generated using previous generators.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical Benchmark Circuit Generation for FPGA Architecture Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000308659300004"}
