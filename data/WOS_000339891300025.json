Meanwhile, weather forecasting information is important for many people in the daily life. Most of current weather information systems only illustrate the basic weather information, such as the temperature and the precipitation probability, by a simple text-based or graphic-based presentation without involving too much environmental information. To integrate weather information with ambient intelligence, this paper aims at showing our implementation experience about how to realize our ambient mesoscale weather forecasting system (AMWFS). With an augmented reality presentation in the system, a more intuitive navigation interface provides users a new way of accessing weather information.", "paper_title": "Ambient mesoscale weather forecasting system featuring mobile augmented reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000339891300025"}
