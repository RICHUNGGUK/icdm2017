These intelligent objects should provide personalized, ad hoc application services by automatically recognizing relationships with users. To do so, there should be a method of establishing awareness of the relationship between a user and an object. However, while several recent approaches have suggested simple tools to improve the relationships themselves, very few methods are proposed for recognizing those relationships. Hence, this paper proposes a methodology for reasoning the relationship context between a user and an object. To do so, the Case-Based Reasoning method is adopted and amended. We also implement a prototype system and analyse significance via a laboratory experiment to demonstrate the feasibility of the ideas proposed in this paper.", "paper_title": "A relationship-aware methodology for context-aware service selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000294923200008"}
