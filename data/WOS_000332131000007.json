This study examines whether partnering efforts made between users and IS developers are successful in reducing the realization of user-related risks during system development. We employ risk factors identified in the literature to drive a confirmation of risk reduction via partnering efforts between users and developers. A survey of system development project managers provides the data for confirmation. Indications from the survey include risk reducing benefits from establishing problem resolution, continuous improvement, and common goals at the commencement of any new development project. This study highlights that a partnership between users and developers during the development process mitigates certain risks and improves eventual outcomes of IS development projects.", "paper_title": "REDUCING USER-RELATED RISKS WITH USER-DEVELOPER PARTNERING", "paper_id": "WOS:000332131000007"}
