Recently, a new fast MRI technique based on CS was proposed. However, the reconstruction quality and computation time of CS-MRI did not meet the standard of clinical use. Therefore, we proposed a novel algorithm based on three successful components: the sparsity of EWT, the rapidness of FISTA, and the excellent tuning in SISTA. The proposed method was dubbed Exponential Wavelet Iterative Shrinkage/Threshold Algorithm (EWISTA). Experiments over four kinds of MR images (brain, ankle, knee, and ADHD) indicated that the proposed EWISTA showed better reconstruction performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms such as FCSA, ISTA, FISTA, SISTA, and EWT-ISTA. Moreover, EWISTA was faster than ISTA and EVVT-ISTA, but slightly slower than FCSA, FISTA and SISTA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
