Design/methodology/approach - The first method is a gradient-based optimization algorithm, based on the adjoint fields. The second method employs an optimization algorithm based on the phase angle gradients of a functional. Findings - The first method, the adjoint field method, is functioning well for a 2D test case. The second method, the phase angle gradient method, gives very good results for 3D test cases. Research limitations/implications - The next step is to test the methods with results from real measurement data. Practical implications - The developed methods are intended for use in dosimetry studies and other applications, where the field distribution from electromagnetic sources are needed. Originality/value - The methods extend previously made constant phase approximations. The present methods are useful in situations where the electromagnetic source is hard to model.", "paper_title": "Computational methods for modeling of complex sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000252916300014"}
