In response to this market environment, many manufacturing companies have established a global simultaneous launch strategy for new products to occupy markets before competitors. In this process, careful scheduling of the global simultaneous launch strategy is critical. In particular, to meet the launch schedule for each country in which a new product will be released, a collaboration process among relevant departments must be prepared, and correct product information should be maintained among major cooperative work support systems according to new product development business processes. This paper suggests a collaboration model integrating product lifecycle management and supply chain management as an approach to supporting complicated new product development procedures. We use a practical case study to evaluate this model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
