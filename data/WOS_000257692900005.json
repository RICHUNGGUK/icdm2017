Numerical research results show that let an optical pulse with center wavelength in Zero dispersion wavelength of optical fiber transit in SMF for generating an oscillation pulse. Subsequently, the followed SOA is provided for amplification. As a consequence, the high-repetition-rate optical pulses can be obtained.", "paper_title": "Generation of high-repetition-rate pulses utilizing cascaded single mode fiber and semiconductor optical amplifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000257692900005"}
