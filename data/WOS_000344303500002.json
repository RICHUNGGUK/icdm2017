Recently, a variant of SN P systems was considered: at each step the neuron with the minimum number of spikes among the neurons that can spike will fire. It has been shown, in previous papers, that such systems are Turing complete when the computing result is obtained by accumulating the spikes in the output neuron. In this work, we use a natural way to define the computing result of the systems, by considering the time interval between the first two spikes emitted by the output neuron. As devices for computing functions, we construct a universal sequential SN P system based on minimum spike number (without delay) which uses 137 neurons; as a generator of sets of numbers, a universal sequential SN P system based on minimum spike number (without delay) with 126 neurons is also obtained.", "paper_title": "Small universal sequential spiking neural P systems based on minimum spike number", "paper_id": "WOS:000344303500002"}
