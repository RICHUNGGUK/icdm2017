In this work, we explore building construction of ID-based proxy re-signature with aggregate property, which has many applications. Our construction utilizes the full domain hash structure from multi-linear map proposed by Hohenburger et al. In particular, Hohenburger et al. proposed an ID-based signature with unrestricted aggregation. We build on this result to offer the first bidirectional ID-based proxy re-signature that admits unrestricted aggregation. In our construction, an arbitrary-sized set of signatures or re-signatures can be aggregated into a single group element, which authenticates the whole set. Our scheme can be proved selectively secure under the l + n-MCDH assumption.", "paper_title": "ID-based Proxy Re-signature with Aggregate Property", "paper_id": "WOS:000358814100004"}
