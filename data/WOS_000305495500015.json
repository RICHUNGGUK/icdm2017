In a number of trials these systems have demonstrated their user-friendliness, convenience and effectiveness for both patients and healthcare professionals. In this paper we propose a generic architecture, associated terminology and a classificatory framework for comparing mobile patient monitoring systems. We then apply this comparison framework to classify six mobile patient monitoring systems selected according to the following criteria: use of diverse mobile communication techniques, evidence of practical trials and availability of sufficient published scientific information. We also show how to use this framework to determine feature sets of prospective real-time mobile patient monitoring systems using the example of epilepsy monitoring. This paper is aimed at both healthcare professionals and computer professionals. For healthcare professionals, this paper provides a general understanding of technical aspects of the mobile patient monitoring systems and highlights a number of issues implied by the use of these systems. The proposed framework for comparing mobile patient monitoring systems can be used by healthcare professionals to determine feature sets of prospective mobile patient monitoring systems to address particular healthcare related needs. Computer professionals are expected to benefit by gaining an understanding of the latest developments in the important emerging application area of mobile patient monitoring systems.
