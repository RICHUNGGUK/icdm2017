It is designed to support both road safety and commercial applications. Road safety applications will require reliable and timely wireless communications. However, as the medium access control (MAC) layer of DSRC is based on the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF), it is well known that the random channel access based MAC cannot provide guaranteed quality of services (QoS). It is very important to understand the quantitative performance of DSRC, in order to make better decisions on its adoption, control, adaptation, and improvement. In this paper, we propose an analytic model to evaluate the DSRC-based inter-vehicle communication. We investigate the impacts of the channel access parameters associated with the different services including arbitration inter-frame space (AIFS) and contention window (CW). Based on the proposed model, we analyze the successful message delivery ratio and channel service delay for broadcast messages. The proposed analytical model can provide a convenient tool to evaluate the inter-vehicle safety applications and analyze the suitability of DSRC for road safety applications.
