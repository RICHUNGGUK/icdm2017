This work utilizes frequency-domain channel estimator (FD-CE) and decision-feedback aliasing canceller (DF-AC) to produce single-FFT SC-FDE. In this way, non-CP single-carrier block transmission (SCBT) can be decoded using sphere decoder of MIMO-OFDM modems to support multimode and backward compatibility under an acceptable complexity in IEEE 802.11 very high throughput (VHT). An N-point FFT is sufficient to measure channel frequency responses (CFR) from L-sample preambles (L <= N/2). And then, M-bit block codes (M <= L) are decodable over frequency domains with DF-AC's help. Simulations and measurements imply that this work can ensure adequate performance, even if there is no CP existed against the distortions of multipath propagation.", "paper_title": "Channel Estimator and Aliasing Canceller for Equalizing and Decoding Non-Cyclic Prefixed Single-Carrier Block Transmission via MIMO-OFDM Modem", "paper_id": "WOS:000285844200017"}
