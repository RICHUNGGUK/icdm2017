In this paper, we present a new characterization of AQC, which generalizes a result of the symmetric case known previously. As an application of the characterization, we establish a relationship of AQC with classical error-correcting codes and show a few examples of good AQC with specific parameters. By using this relationship, we obtain an asymptotic bound on AQCs from algebraic geometry codes.", "paper_title": "Asymmetric Quantum Codes: Characterization and Constructions", "paper_id": "WOS:000277880200034"}
