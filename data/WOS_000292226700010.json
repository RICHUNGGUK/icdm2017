We show that warping techniques can be adapted to efficiently generate convolution-like implicit primitives of varying radius along helices, a useful 3D skeleton found in a number of natural shapes. Depending on a single parameter of the helix, we warp it onto an arc of circle or onto a line segment. For those latter skeletons closed-form convolutions are known for entire families of kernels. The new warps introduced preserve the circular shape of the normal cross section to the primitive. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
