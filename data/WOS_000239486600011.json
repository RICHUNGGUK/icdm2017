In this paper we introduce an approximate image-space approach for real-time rendering of deformable translucent models by taking account of diffuse multiple subsurface scattering. We decompose the process into two stages, called the Gathering and Scattering corresponding to the computations for incident and exiting irradiance respectively. We derive a simplified all-frequency illumination model for the gathering of the incident irradiance, which is amenable for deformable models using two auxiliary textures. We introduce two modes for efficient accomplishment of the view-dependent scattering. We implement our approach by fully exploiting the capabilities of graphics processing units (GPUs). Our implementation achieves visually plausible results and real-time frame rates for deformable models on commodity desktop PCs.", "paper_title": "An approximate image-space approach for real-time rendering of deformable translucent objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600011"}
