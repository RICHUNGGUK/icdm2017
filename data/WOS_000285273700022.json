In many real world classification problems, however, costs of different types of misclassification are asymmetric, and one type of misclassification is more serious than the other. In this paper, we propose an asymmetric support vector machine (ASVM) for the binary classification problem with asymmetric cost of misclassification. Through introducing some adjustable parameters into the model of the conventional SVM, we establish an explicit connection between the expected cost of misclassification (ECM) and the adjustable parameters. The proposed ASVM effectively decreases ECM through minimizing an upper bound of ECM. Computational results verify the efficacy of ASVM compared with the conventional SVM and the method proposed in the previous literature.", "paper_title": "ASYMMETRIC SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE FOR THE CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM WITH ASYMMETRIC COST OF MISCLASSIFICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000285273700022"}
