But the efficiency of blue organic/polymeric light emitting diodes is considerably low due to their large band gap that requires higher energy for effective emission. In this paper we report the enhancement in polyfluorene blue organic light emitting diodes with a polymer nano-composite hole transport layer. Blue light emitting diode based on polyfluorene as an emissive layer and poly(3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)-titanium dioxide nanocomposite as the hole transport layer were fabricated and studied. Different concentrations of titanium dioxide nanoparticles were doped in poly(3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) in the hole transport layer and the performance of the devices were studied. Significant enhancement in the blue peak at 430 nm of polyfluorene has been observed with increase in concentration of TiO2 nanoparticles in the hole transport layer. The turn on voltage of the device has also been found to improve significantly with the incorporation of titanium dioxide nanoparticles in the hole transport layer. The optimized concentration of titanium dioxide in the hole transport layer for most efficient device has been found to 15 wt.%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
