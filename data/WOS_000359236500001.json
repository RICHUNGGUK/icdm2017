Such chains are called kappa-chains and we show that they have applications in finding efficient parallelizations in problems that are known to be difficult to parallelize. In particular, 3-chains improve computations of inversions in finite fields using hybrid-double multipliers. Recently, it was shown that this operation can be efficiently computed using a ternary algorithm but we show that 3-chains provide a significantly more efficient solution.", "paper_title": "A Generalization of Addition Chains and Fast Inversions in Binary Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000359236500001"}
