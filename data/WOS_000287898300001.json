The research is concerned with integrating adaptive control and a standard computer numerical controller (CNC) for optimizing a metal-cutting process. It is designed to adaptively maximize the feed rate subject to allowable cutting force on the tool, which is very beneficial for a time consuming complex shape machining. The purpose is to present a reliable, robust neural controller aimed at adaptively adjusting feed rate to prevent excessive tool wear, tool breakage and maintain a high chip removal rate. Numerous simulations and experiments are conducted to confirm the efficiency of this architecture. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
