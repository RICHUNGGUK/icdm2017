We show how the classical staircase boundary conditions for hard reflections or, in the electromagnetic case, conducting surfaces in certain cases give 0(l) errors. The proposed conditions keep the structure of the Yee scheme and are thus well suited for high performance computing. The higher accuracy is achieved by modifying the coefficients in the difference stencils near the boundary. This generalizes our earlier results with Gustafsson and Wahlund in one space dimension. We study stability and convergence and we present numerical examples. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
