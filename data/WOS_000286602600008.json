This research presents results from a study of continuous use of mobile services in different use contexts as defined by task and consumption place. Using mobile games as an example, the authors proposed a research model that augments current technology adoption theories to fit the hedonic nature of mobile games. The results from conducting an online survey indicate that contextual factors have significant moderating effect on the intention to play mobile games. The diverse lifestyles of users also have different attitudes and concerns regarding using mobile services. The findings suggest that service providers need to take into account the impact of use contexts and the needs of specific users when they design mobile services.", "paper_title": "Effect of use contexts on the continuous use of mobile services: the case of mobile games", "paper_id": "WOS:000286602600008"}
