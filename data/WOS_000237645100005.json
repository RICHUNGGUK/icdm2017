Current tools for facilitating job searches lack in providing intelligent matching between employer advertisements and the curriculum vitae of the candidates. The objective of this research work was to develop an intelligent web portal to serve as service provider in recruitment tasks. This portal aims at helping people living in the region of the South-east of Spain to find a job. For this purpose, the knowledge of the recruitment domain has been represented by means of ontology, which has been used to guide the design of the application and to supply the system with semantic capabilities. Furthermore, the ontological component allows for defining an ontology-guided search engine which provides more intelligent matches between job offers and candidates' curricula. Finally, this work covers the design of the ontology and the development of the web portal. Both issues are discussed and some validation results are presented. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
