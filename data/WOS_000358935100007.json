A major drawback of their analysis is that the protocol is secure only if (almost) all nodes participate at all times. That is, even if only n << N nodes wish to sendmessages, all N nodes have to participate in the protocol at all times. This suggests necessity of sending dummy messages and a high message overhead. Our first contribution is showing that this is unnecessary. We relax the adversary model and assume that the adversary only controls a certain fraction of the communication links in the communication network. We think this is a realistic adversary model. For this adversary model we show that a low message overhead variant of Chaum's protocol is provably secure. Furthermore, all previous security proofs assumed the a priori distribution on the messages is uniform. We feel this assumption is unrealistic. The analysis we give holds for any a priori information on the communication distribution. We achieve that by combining Markov chain techniques together with information theory tools in a simple and elegant way.", "paper_title": "Provable Unlinkability Against Traffic Analysis with Low Message Overhead", "paper_id": "WOS:000358935100007"}
