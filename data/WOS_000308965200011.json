However, it can potentially introduce dataset shift, a harmful factor that is often not taken into account and can result in inaccurate performance estimation. This paper analyzes the prevalence and impact of partition-induced covariate shift on different k-fold cross-validation schemes. From the experimental results obtained, we conclude that the degree of partition-induced covariate shift depends on the cross-validation scheme considered. In this way, worse schemes may harm the correctness of a single-classifier performance estimation and also increase the needed number of repetitions of cross-validation to reach a stable performance estimation.", "paper_title": "Study on the Impact of Partition-Induced Dataset Shift on k-fold Cross-Validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000308965200011"}
