Density functional theory (DFT) was used to predict the optimized geometries, electronic structures, heats of formation and densities, and the detonation properties were evaluated by using the VLW equation of state (EOS). Calculation results show that there are good linear relationships between heats of formation, densities, detonation properties and the number of N atom in all designed high-nitrogen compounds. Furthermore, several designed high-nitrogen compounds show good detonation velocities and pressures compared with octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX), making them potential candidates for high-energy-density materials (HEDM).", "paper_title": "Theoretical studies on the heats of formation, densities, and detonation properties of substituted s-tetrazine compounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000276061300019"}
