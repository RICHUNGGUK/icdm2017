Similarly it would be good to be able to exponentiate an operator with expm(L) or determine eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with eigs(L). A system is described in which such calculations are indeed possible, at least in one space dimension, based on the previously developed chebfun system in object-oriented Matlab. The algorithms involved amount to spectral collocation methods on Chebyshev grids of automatically determined resolution.", "paper_title": "THE CHEBOP SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATIC SOLUTION OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261618700005"}
