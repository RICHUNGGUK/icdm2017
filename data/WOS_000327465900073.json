We enhance ICN's ability to support data confidentiality by introducing attribute-based encryption into ICN and making it specific to the data attributes. Our approach is unusual in that it preserves ICN's goal to decouple publishers and subscribers for greater data accessibility, scalable multiparty communication and efficient data distribution. Inspired by application-layer publish-subscribe, we enable fine-grained access control with more expressive policies. Moreover, we propose an attribute-based routing scheme that offers interest confidentiality. A prototype system is implemented based on CCNx, a popular open source version of ICN, to showcase privacy preservation in Smart Neighborhood and Smart City applications.", "paper_title": "Toward Content-Centric Privacy in ICN: Attribute-based Encryption and Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000327465900073"}
