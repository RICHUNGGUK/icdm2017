The singularity in this ill posed problem was removed by the Tikhonov approach with the regularization parameter calculated as the L curve maximum curvature. A sensitivity analysis was also coupled to the numerical inversion. For temperatures ranging from 15 K to 300 K the heat capacity results, calculated from the inverted phonon density of states, yields an average error of about 0.3 %, within the experimental errors that ranged from 2 % to 3 %. The predicted entropy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy are also within experimental errors.", "paper_title": "Phonon density of states from the experimental heat capacity: an improved distribution function for solid aluminium using an inverse framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000340869400032"}
