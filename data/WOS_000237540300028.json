According to the analysis of the classical positioned-based routing protocols, this paper introduces a novel concept of Effective Transmission (ET) which ensures each forwarding node is not only farther from the source node, but also nearer to the destination node with respect to its sender. An energy-aware routing protocol based on ET is proposed. It decreases the energy consumption for each hop in the transmission. The simulation results show the routing protocol is effective on the performance of energy consumption while comparing with some other routing protocols.", "paper_title": "An energy-aware position-based routing strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300028"}
