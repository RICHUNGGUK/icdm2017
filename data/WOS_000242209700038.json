An integrated approach combining an Ant algorithm (LFCP-Ant) and a Geographic Information System (GIS) has been devised to solve the LFCP problem in large scale. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a case study of locating new fire stations in Singapore. A GIS has been used to transform the continuous problem into a discrete one, which is then solved using the LFCP-Ant. This algorithm employs a two-phase local search to improve both search efficiency and precision. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
