Amino and nitro are two important high energy density functional groups. Here, we present calculations on 1-nitro-1-triazene (NH2-N=N-NO2). Thermal stability and detonation parameters were predicted theoretically at CCSD(T)/6-311G* level, based on the geometries optimized at MP2/6-311G* level. It was found that the p ->pi conjugation interaction and the intramolecular hydrogen bonding that exist in the system together increase the thermal stability of the molecule. Moreover, the detonation parameters were evaluated to be better than those of the famous HMX and RDX. Finally, the compound was demonstrated to be a high energy density material.", "paper_title": "Is 1-nitro-1-triazene a high energy density material?", "paper_id": "WOS:000340869400034"}
