For high-quality maintenance of the technical systems in mining, it is necessary to conduct a thorough analysis of machinery and accompanying elements in order to determine the critical elements in the system which are prone to failures. The risk assessment of the failures of system parts leads to obtaining precise indicators of failures which are also excellent guidelines for maintenance services. This paper presents a model of the risk assessment of technical systems failure based on the fuzzy sets theory, fuzzy logic and min-max composition. The risk indicators, severity, occurrence and detectability are analyzed. The risk indicators are given as linguistic variables. The model presented was applied for assessing the risk level of belt conveyor elements failure which works in severe conditions in a coal mine. Moreover, this paper shows the advantages of this model when compared to a standard procedure of RPN calculating - in the FMEA method of risk assessment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
