It models the probability distribution of clean signal using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and minimizes the misfit between the true probability distributions of hidden variables and model parameters and their approximate distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than that of some other methods. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
