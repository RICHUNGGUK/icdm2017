The main results show that processes are in one-to-one correspondence with switch-equivalent classes of derivations, and that the unfolding construction can be characterised as a coreflection, that is, the unfolding functor arises as the right adjoint to the embedding of the category of occurrence grammars into the category of grammars. As the unfolding represents potentially infinite computations, we need to work in adhesive categories with 'well-behaved' colimits of omega-chains of monos. Compared with previous work on the unfolding of Petri nets and graph grammars, our results apply to a wider class of systems, which is due to the use of a refined notion of grammar morphism.", "paper_title": "Processes and unfoldings: concurrent computations in adhesive categories", "paper_id": "WOS:000343644000002"}
