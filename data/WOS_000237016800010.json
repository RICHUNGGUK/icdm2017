The web document could contain the sensitive information and it should be sent to users who have an authority accessing the sensitive information. In a well-known method, called XML Pool Encryption, the sensitive information is separated from the document, and then, it is encrypted. Therefore, reconstruction of a document is required when the document is shown to a user. For the reconstruction, it is very important that we identify the location of decrypted information effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a labeling scheme to support the fast reconstruction of document, based on the use of encryption techniques. The proposed labeling scheme supports the inference of structure information in any portion of the document. In the experimental results, our labeling scheme shows an efficiency in searching for the location of decrypted information.", "paper_title": "A novel labeling scheme for secure broadcasting of XML data", "paper_id": "WOS:000237016800010"}
