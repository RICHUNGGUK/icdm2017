However, the noisy and incomplete correspondence between web services and tags impedes the tag related web service applications. To address this challenge, a Matrix Completion based Web Service Tag Refinement (MCWSTR) framework is proposed. Firstly, the MCWSTR framework naturally formulates the web service tag refinement problem as a Correlation Consistency Constrained Matrix Completion (C3MC) problem, which jointly model content correlation consistency and tag correlation consistency among web services and tags. Secondly, the MCWSTR framework employs an efficient Fixed Point Iterative algorithm based on Operator Splitting technique to solve the C3MC problem, Experimental results on the real-world web services collection show the encouraging performance of our proposed MCWSTR framework.", "paper_title": "Correlation consistency constrained matrix completion for web service tag refinement", "paper_id": "WOS:000347408400008"}
