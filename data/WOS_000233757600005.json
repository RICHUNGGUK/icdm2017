The main idea is to start from an equivalence relation R, which is a congruence with respect to boolean AND and boolean OR(1) and, for each p is an element of X, construct an equivalence relation R-p which is a congruence with respect to boolean AND and boolean OR(p). Furthermore, For each x is an element of R-p we construct a quotient hyperoperation boolean OR(p) and we show that the hyperalgebra (X/R-p,boolean OR(p)) is a join space and the hyperalgebra (X/R-p,boolean OR(p), boolean AND(p)) is a hyperlattice.
