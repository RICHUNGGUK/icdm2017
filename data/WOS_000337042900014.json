In this paper, we consider one important coloring, linear arboricity, which is an improper edge coloring. Moreover, we study linear arboricity on planar graphs with maximum degree . We have proved that the linear arboricity of is , if for each vertex , there are two integers such that any two cycles of length and , which contain , are not adjacent. Clearly, if for each vertex , then we can easily get one corollary: for two fixed integers , if there is no adjacent cycles with length and in , then the linear arboricity of is [Delta/2].", "paper_title": "Minimum number of disjoint linear forests covering a planar graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000337042900014"}
