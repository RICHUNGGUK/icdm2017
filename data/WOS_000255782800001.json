These divergences are generalizations of the \"entropy distance\" and \"information distance.\" Their main characteristic is that they combine a complexity term and the mutual information. We then introduce the notion of (normalized) information-based divergence, propose several examples, and discuss their mathematical properties, in particular, in some prediction framework.", "paper_title": "Normalized information-based divergences", "paper_id": "WOS:000255782800001"}
