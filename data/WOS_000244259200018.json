Irrespective of this grouping, most motif detection tools only take into account similarities across ungapped sequence regions, possibly causing short motifs located peripherally and in varying distance to a 'core' motif to be missed. We present a new method, adding to the set of expectation-maximization approaches, that permits the use of gapped alignments for motif elucidation.", "paper_title": "Mclip: motif detection based on cliques of gapped local profile-to-profile alignments", "paper_id": "WOS:000244259200018"}
