We derive a formula for the weight of a codeword of C(3, m), in terms of certain varieties associated with alternating trilinear forms on F-q(m). The classification of such forms under the action of the general linear group GL(m, F-q) is the other component that is required to calculate the spectrum of C(3, m). For, m = 7, we explicitly determine the varieties mentioned above. The classification problem for alternating three-forms on F-q(7) was solved in a study by Cohen and Helminck in 1988, which we then use to determine the spectrum of C(3, 7).", "paper_title": "Weight Spectrum of Codes Associated With the Grassmannian G(3,7)", "paper_id": "WOS:000313728800019"}
