This trend leads to massive computational tasks during simulation, optimization and statistical analyses, requiring robust modeling tools so that the whole process can be achieved reliably. In this paper, the authors proposed frequency-and time-domain computer-aided design tools that can characterize RF/microwave field effect and heterojunction bipolar transistors and efficiently predict a circuit performance. The proposed tools are demonstrated through examples.", "paper_title": "CAD tools for efficient RF/microwave transistor modeling and circuit design", "paper_id": "WOS:000275398000007"}
