Three learning-operators, i.e. the random learning operator, the individual learning operator, and the social learning operator, are developed to generate new solutions and search for the optima by mimicking the learning behaviors of humans. The numerical functions, deceptive functions and 0-1 knapsack problems', are adopted as benchmark problems to validate the performance of ASHLO, and the results are compared with those of binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), modified binary differential. evolution (MBDE), the binary fruit fly optimization algorithm (bFOA) and adaptive binary harmony search (ABHS). The experimental results demonstrate that the developed ASHLO significantly outperforms BPSO, MBDE, bFOA and ABHS and has a robust search ability for various problems. With the adaptive strategy, the search ability of ASHLO is improved further especially on the high-dimensional and complicated problems. Considering the ease of implementation, the excellence of global search ability and the robustness for various problems, ASHLO is a promising optimization tool for scientific research and engineering applications.
