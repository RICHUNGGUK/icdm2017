We show that P-*,P- the class of sufficient matrices, is a subclass of L. In the course of demonstrating this inclusion, we introduce other new matrix classes that forge interesting new connections between known matrix classes.", "paper_title": "Sufficient matrices belong to L", "paper_id": "WOS:000235062200009"}
