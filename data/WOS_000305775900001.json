In order to allocate sensor resources in the system to maximize the sensor grid utility, different controllers are deployed at three levels: a job-level controller, an application group controller, and a sensor grid system controller. At the lowest levels, job-level controllers perform fast, frequent, local adaptation for optimizing a single sensor grid application at a time, while, at the highest levels, sensor grid system controllers perform less frequent control actions to optimize all applications. Sensor grid system control considers all sensor grid applications in response to large system changes at coarse time granularity. Sensor grid system control exploits the interlayer coupling of the resource layer and the application layer to achieve a system-wide optimization based on the sensor grid users' preferences. Job-level control adapts a single application to small changes at fine granularity. The layered control system uses a set of utility functions to evaluate the performance of sensor grid applications and groups. The control system chooses control actions that would result in a higher level of utility. In the simulation, a performance evaluation of the algorithm is carried out. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
