By introducing a non-singular terminal sliding mode manifold, a novel terminal sliding mode controller is designed for the speed loop. This controller can make the states not only reach the manifold in finite time, but also converge to the equilibrium point in finite time. Thus, the controller could make the motor speed reach the reference value in finite time, obtaining a faster convergence and a better tracking precision. Meanwhile, considering the large chattering phenomenon caused by high switching gains, a composite terminal sliding mode control method based on disturbance observer is proposed to reduce chattering. Through disturbance estimation for feed-forward compensation, the composite terminal sliding mode controller may take a smaller value for the switching gain without sacrificing disturbance rejection performance. Matlab simulation and TMS320F2808 DSP experimental results are provided to show the superiority of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation of Terminal Sliding Mode Control Method for PMSM Speed Regulation System", "paper_id": "WOS:000326113700009"}
