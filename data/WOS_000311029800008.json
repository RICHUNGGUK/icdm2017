Most methods for automatically constructing ontologies focus on taxonomic relations, such as is-kind-of and is-part-of relations. However, much of the domain-specific semantics is ignored. This work proposes a semi-unsupervised approach for extracting semantic relations from domain-specific text documents. The approach effectively utilizes text mining and existing taxonomic relations in domain ontologies to discover candidate keywords that can represent semantic relations. A preliminary experiment on the natural science domain (Taiwan K9 education) indicates that the proposed method yields valuable recommendations. This work enriches domain ontologies by adding distilled semantics.", "paper_title": "Extracting semantic relations to enrich domain ontologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000311029800008"}
