Disturbed flows (flow separation/reattachment, vortical and secondary flows) as well as regions of high oscillatory shear index (OSI) with low wall shear stress (WSS), i.e., high-OSI-and-low-WSS and low-OSI-and-high-WSS were found in the proximal and distal anastomoses, especially at the toe and heel regions of distal anastomosis, which indicate highly suspected sites for the onset of the atherosclerotic lesions. The flow patterns found in the graft and distal anastomoses of our model at deceleration phases are different from those of the isolated distal anastomosis model. In addition, a huge significant difference in segmental averages of HPs was found between the distal and proximal anastomoses. These findings further suggest that intimal hyperplasia would be more prone to form in the distal anastomosis than in the proximal anastomosis, particularly along the suture line at the toe and heel of distal anastomosis.", "paper_title": "Numerical investigation and identification of susceptible sites of atherosclerotic lesion formation in a complete coronary artery bypass model", "paper_id": "WOS:000256929000007"}
