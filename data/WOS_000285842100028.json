However, their weight distributions are known only for a few cases. In this paper, the weight distributions of the duals of the cyclic codes with two zeros are settled for a few cases. The weight distributions of punctured versions of these codes are also determined for several special cases.", "paper_title": "The Weight Enumerator of a Class of Cyclic Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000285842100028"}
