When (B-spline) neural networks are used to model a nonlinear dynamical functional such as the output stochastic distributions in the repetitive processes or the batch processes, the parameters in the basis functions will be tuned using the generalized iterative learning control (GILC) scheme. The GILC scheme differs from the classical model-based ILC laws, with no dynamical input-output differential or difference equations given a prior. For the \"model free\" GILC problem, we propose an optimal design algorithm for the learning operators by introducing an augmented difference model in state space. A sufficient and necessary solvable condition can be given where a robust optimization solution with an LMI-based design algorithm can be provided.", "paper_title": "An optimal iterative learning scheme for dynamic neural network modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000074"}
