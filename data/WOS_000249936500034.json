A curvilinear coordinate system that fits the target quantum dot shape is first determined. Three finite difference discretizations of the Schrodinger equation are then developed on the original and the skewed curvilinear coordinate system. The resulting large-scale generalized eigenvalue systems are solved by a modified Jacobi-Davidson method. Intensive numerical experiments show that the scheme using both grid points on the original and skewed curvilinear coordinate system can converge to the eigenpairs quickly and stably with second-order accuracy.
