Two indices have been suggested to detect the axial displacement. The measurement results show the effectiveness of these indices. A new method of the detection of the axial displacement extent based on decision tree (DT) has been proposed, too. It has been shown that this method has a good accuracy to determine the displacement of the winding and its extent. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
