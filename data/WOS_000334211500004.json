We first introduce some concepts of hesitant fuzzy set and interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set. Then, the hesitant fuzzy superiority and inferiority ranking (HF-SIR) method and the interval-valued hesitant fuzzy superiority and inferiority ranking (IVHF-SIR) method are proposed in detail. Furthermore, the approach to MAGDM problem based on the HF-SIR and IVHF-SIR method is given under hesitant fuzzy environment. Finally, a comparative analysis is illustrated with a numerical example.", "paper_title": "A novel SIR method for multiple attributes group decision making problem under hesitant fuzzy environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000334211500004"}
