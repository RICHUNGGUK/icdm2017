Three-dimensional (3D) NoCs offer several advantages over two-dimensional (2D) NoCs. Through-silicon via (TSV) technology is one of the candidates for implementation of 3D NoCs. TSV reliability analysis is still challenging for 3D NoC designers because of their unique electrical, thermal, and physical characteristics. After providing an overview of common TSV issues, this article aims to define a reliability criterion for NoC and provide a framework for quantifying this reliability as it relates to TSV issues. TSV issues are modeled as a time-invariant failure probability. Also, a reliability criterion for TSV-based NoC is defined. The relationship between NoC reliability and TSV failure is quantified. For the first time, the reliability criterion is reduced to a tractable closed-form expression that requires a single Monte Carlo simulation. Importantly, the Monte Carlo simulation depends only on network geometry. To demonstrate our proposed method, the reliability criterion of a simple 8x8x8 NoC supported by an 8x8x7 network of TSVs is calculated.", "paper_title": "Analytical Reliability Analysis of 3D NoC under TSV Failure", "paper_id": "WOS:000353642700012"}
