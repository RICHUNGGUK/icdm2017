In this paper it is shown that Kneser graph K(n:r) is hyperenergetic for any naturals n and r >= 2 with n >= 2r + 1. Also we prove that for r >= 2, the complement of Kneser graph, E((K(n:r)) over bar), is hyperenergetic.", "paper_title": "Kneser Graphs and their Complements are Hyperenergetic", "paper_id": "WOS:000264128200007"}
