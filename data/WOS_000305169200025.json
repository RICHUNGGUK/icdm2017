When faced with multiple attacking targets, it is important for the laser antimissile system, to determine the attacking sequence in order to destroy more targets. Conceptually, this laser antimissile problem can be seen as a dynamical traveling salesman problem, which is much harder than a pure traveling salesman problem. It is extremely difficult to find the global optimal solution, especially when the number of the targets is greater than six. This paper introduces a fast algorithm for this problem based on two exchange strategies the adjacent exchange and the symmetric exchange. With a given initial sequence, the adjacent exchange strategy searches for a local optimal sequence among neighbors fast. The symmetric exchange will search in a larger region so as to jump out from the local optimal solution. The combination of the two exchange strategies increases the probability of finding the global optimal solution. For illustration, a case with eight attacking targets is simulated. The results show the convergence of the proposed algorithm is very fast and it is a highly practical method. Interestingly, the local optimal solution obtained is, indeed, quite close to the global one.", "paper_title": "A PERMUTATION ALGORITHM FOR LASER ANTIMISSILE STRATEGY OPTIMIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000305169200025"}
