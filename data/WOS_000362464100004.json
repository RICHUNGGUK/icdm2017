Compared to the format that uses one view plus one depth, the advanced 2D-compatible format reduces the bitrates of both color and depth frames. In order to achieve 3D image generation in real time, a hardware architecture of 2D-compatible format is firstly designed in this paper. In this paper, an edge-based DIBR algorithm is also proposed and implemented in to hardware architecture. The proposed edge-based DIBR algorithm achieves better image quality than the original DIBR algorithm. This paper combines these two architecture in to the advanced video and depth depacking architecture which can reduce the bitrates and increase the image quality of 3D video. Simulation results also show that image quality of the proposed system is better than that of the original DIBR algorithm. For the hardware cost, the proposed system requires 6.34k gates. The operation frequency can reach 100 MHz, which can supports the maximum frame size up to FHD (1920 x 1088) in real time.", "paper_title": "An Advanced Video and Depth Depacking Architecture for 3D Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000362464100004"}
