We first introduce a new affinity function for distance measure between a test point and a training point which is an approach based on local learning. A new similarity function using this affinity function is proposed next for the classification of the test patterns. The widely used convention of k, i.e., k = [root N] is employed, where N is the number of data used for training purpose. The proposed modified kNN algorithm is applied on fifteen numerical datasets from the UCI machine learning data repository. Both 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validations are used. The average classification accuracy, obtained from our method is found to exceed some well-known clustering algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
