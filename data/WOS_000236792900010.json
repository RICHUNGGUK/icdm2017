Given a set of sensor nodes in Euclidean plane, our objective is to place minimum number of relay nodes to forward data packets from sensor nodes to the sink, such that: 1) the network is connected, 2) the network is 2-connected. For case one, we propose a (6+epsilon)-approxirnation algorithm for any epsilon>0 with polynomial running time when epsilon is fixed. For case two, we propose two approximation algorithms with (24+epsilon) and (6/T+12+epsilon), respectively, where T is the ratio of the number of relay nodes placed in case one to the number of sensors. We further extend the results to the cases where communication radiuses of sensor nodes and relay nodes are different from each other.", "paper_title": "On optimal placement of relay nodes for reliable connectivity in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000236792900010"}
