On one hand, to accurately and efficiently simulate flow field, our recently developed solution-adaptive LBM (Wu and Shu, 2011) is employed. On the other hand, a smoothed discrete delta function (Yang et al., 2009) is utilized to suppress the non-physical force oscillations produced by IBM when dealing with the moving boundary problems. After simulating some validation cases including flows over a transversely oscillating circular cylinder and insect hovering flight in ground effect, the current method is employed to numerically investigate the ground effect on the performance of a flapping foil. In this study, the ground is represented by a flat or wavy plate. Due to the existence of the ground, the performance of the flapping foil is greatly changed. Higher lift force or power extraction efficiency can be achieved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
