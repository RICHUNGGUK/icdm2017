In the proposed RICA clustering algorithm, the Euclidean distance measure is considered. Due to the competitive agglomeration is used, the RICA clustering algorithm can be fast converges in a few iterations and to the same optimal partition regardless of its initialization of prototype. Experimentally results show the merits and usefulness of the RICA clustering algorithm for the symbolic interval-values data with outliers.", "paper_title": "Robust Interval Competitive Agglomeration Clustering Algorithm with Outliers", "paper_id": "WOS:000283915700006"}
