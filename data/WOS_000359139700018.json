It is desired that these updates are non-blocking, that is without disrupting the ongoing lookups. Furthermore, considering the increasing line rates and table sizes, the scalability of the design is very important. Ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) architectures are widely deployed for hardware IP lookup. In this paper, we propose a novel TCAM architecture, S-DIRECT-Scalable and Dynamically REConfigurable TCAM, that is custom designed for hardware IP lookup. S-DIRECT consists of hierarchically combined TCAM cells with inherent priority encoders (PEs) to support LPM. Hence, its design is scalable without any need for a separate PE or a redesign for different table size. Furthermore, S-DIRECT can perform constant time, non-blocking updates in hardware provided that certain write capabilities are present in the TCAM entries. S-DIRECT architecture is both independent of the hardware platform and the implementation of the TCAM cells. We demonstrate the generality and viability of S-DIRECT by implementing it both with prefix/mask register and LUT-based TCAM cells on FPGA.", "paper_title": "S-DIRECT: Scalable and Dynamically Reconfigurable TCAM Architecture for High-Speed IP Lookup", "paper_id": "WOS:000359139700018"}
