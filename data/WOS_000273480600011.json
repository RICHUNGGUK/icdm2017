Can one decide for a given rational set which of the two options holds? We give a positive answer to all the previous questions in the case that M is a direct product of free monoids. Some of the proved results also extend to trace monoid.", "paper_title": "On Bounded Rational Trace Languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000273480600011"}
