To exhibit the security of our proposal, we develop the theory of simulatability and relationship between the certificateless threshold signatures and the underlying (non-threshold) ID-based signatures. We show that the proposed scheme is robust and existentially unforgeable against adaptively chosen message attacks under CDH assumption in the random oracle model. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
