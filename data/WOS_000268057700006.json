For this purpose, two approaches are implemented and compared with respect to three criteria, i.e., investment cost, equipment number and a flexibility indicator based on work in process (the so-called WIP) computed by use of a discrete-event simulation model. The first approach involves a genetic algorithm in order to generate acceptable solutions, from which the best ones are chosen by using a Pareto Sort algorithm. The second approach combines the previous Genetic Algorithm with a multicriteria analysis methodology, i.e., the Electre method in order to find the best solutions. The performances of the two procedures are studied for a large-size problem and a comparison between the procedures is then made. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
