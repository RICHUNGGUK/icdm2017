For example, if every F-i is the path P-3 on 3 vertices, then we are looking for a proper k-edge-coloring of G, i.e., a coloring of the edges of G with no pair of edges of the same color incident to the same vertex. Rodl and Rucinski studied this problem for the random graph G(n,p) in the symmetric case when k is fixed and F-1 = (...) = F-k = F. They proved that such a coloring exists asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.) provided that p <= bn(-beta) for some constants b = b(F, k) and beta = beta(F). Their proof was, however, non-constructive. This result is essentially best possible because for p >= Bn-beta, where B = B(F, k) is a large constant, such an edge-coloring does not exist. For this reason we refer to n(-beta) as a threshold function. In this paper we address the case when F-1,..., F-k are cliques of different sizes and propose an algorithm that a.a.s. finds a valid k-edge-coloring of G(n,p) with p <= bn(-beta) for some constants b = b (F-1,..., F-k, k) and beta = beta(F-1,...,F-k). Kohayakawa and Kreuter conjectured that n(-beta(F1,...,Fk)) is a threshold function in this case. This algorithm can be also adjusted to produce a valid k-coloring in the symmetric case.", "paper_title": "Threshold functions for asymmetric Ramsey properties involving cliques", "paper_id": "WOS:000240348600040"}
