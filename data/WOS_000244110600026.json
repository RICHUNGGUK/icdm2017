Conventional clustering techniques often based on Euclidean metric. However, the metric is ad hoc not intrinsic to the semantic of the documents. In this paper, we are proposing a novel approach, in which the semantic space of high-dimensional data is structured as a simplicial complex of Euclidean space (a hypergraph but with different focus). Such a simplicial structure intrinsically captures the semantic of the data; for example, the coherent topics of documents will appear in the same connected component. Finally, we cluster the data by the structure of concepts, which is organized by such a geometry. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
