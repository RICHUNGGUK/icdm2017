We propose a set of 11 simple time domain and power bands features, computed from one intracranial EEG contact located in the seizure onset zone. The classification of the features is performed using a random forest classifier. Depending on the training datasets and the optimization preferences, the performance of the algorithm were: 93.84% mean sensitivity (100% median sensitivity), 3.03 s mean (1.75 s median) detection delays and 0.33/h mean (0.07/h median) false detections per hour.", "paper_title": "Early Seizure Detection Algorithm Based on Intracranial EEG and Random Forest Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000356443600007"}
