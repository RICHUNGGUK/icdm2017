In this paper we propose a heterogeneous network model based on the IMS that integrates the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) technologies and provides guaranteed QoS. We present the complete signalling flow concerning the authorization, registration, session set up and vertical handoff processes, as well as, an analytic model for cost analysis of the proposed architecture.
