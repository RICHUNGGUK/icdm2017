Many problems with computer networks today, such as faults, misconfiguration, performance degradation, etc., are due to insufficient support for network management, and the problem takes on additional dimensions with the emerging programmable router paradigm. The Internet Network Management Workshop is working to build a community of researchers interested in solving the challenges of network management via a combination of bottoms-up analysis of data from existing networks and a top-down design of new architectures and approaches driven by that data. This editorial sets out some of the research challenges we see facing network management, and calls for participation in working to solve them.", "paper_title": "New Frontiers in Internet Network Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000271210600007"}
