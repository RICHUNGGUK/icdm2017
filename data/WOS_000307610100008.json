On the basis of a literature review a conceptual model is proposed, showing the effects of the color of e-commerce websites and specifically of its components, hue and brightness on the behavioral responses of the consumer, memorization and buying intention. These responses are conveyed by mood. Data collection was carried out during a laboratory experiment in order to control for the measurement of the colored appearance of e-commerce websites. Participants visited one of the eight versions of a website designed for the research, selling music CDs. Data analysis using ANOVA, regressions and general linear models show a significant effect of color on memorization, conveyed by mood. The interaction of hue and brightness, using chromatic colors for the background and foreground supports memorization and buying intention, when contrast is based on low brightness. A negative mood infers better memorization but a decreasing buying intention. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.
