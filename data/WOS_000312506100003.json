Through constructing a new augmented LKF and proving its positive definiteness, introducing some slack matrices and using integral inequality, the improved delay-dependent stability criteria are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities, and it is theoretically established that obtained results are less conservative than some existing stability conditions. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the significant improvement on the conservatism of the delay bound over some existing results.
