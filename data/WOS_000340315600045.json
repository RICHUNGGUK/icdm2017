To tackle this problem, we propose a semi-supervised manifold kernel density estimation (SSMKDE) approach based on a recently proposed manifold KDE method. Our contributions are twofold. First, SSMKDE leverages both labeled and unlabeled samples and formulates all data in a manifold structure, which enables a more accurate label prediction. Second, the relationship between KDE-based methods and graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods is analyzed, which helps to better understand graph-based SSL methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SSMKDE over existing KDE-based and graph-based SSL methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
