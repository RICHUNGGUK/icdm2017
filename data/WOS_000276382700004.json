In this article, we propose a novel method for detecting various video copies in a video sequence. To achieve fast and robust detection, the method fully integrates several components, namely the min-hashing signature to compactly represent a video sequence, a spatio-temporal matching scheme to accurately evaluate video similarity compiled from the spatial and temporal aspects, and some speedup techniques to expedite both min-hashing indexing and spatio-temporal matching. The results of experiments demonstrate that, compared to several baseline methods with different feature descriptors and matching schemes, the proposed method which combines both global and local feature descriptors yields the best performance when encountering a variety of video transformations. The method is very fast, requiring approximately 0.06 seconds to search for copies of a thirty-second video clip in a six-hour video sequence.", "paper_title": "Fast Min-Hashing Indexing and Robust Spatio-Temporal Matching for Detecting Video Copies", "paper_id": "WOS:000276382700004"}
