In this paper, an analytical model for infrastructure based cognitive radio systems is proposed, and its performance is evaluated under bursty traffic scenarios in a multiple cell environment. Performance metrics like probabilities of dropping and blocking for primary and secondary users as well as forced termination and forced frequency handoff for secondary users are investigated, and the analytical model is verified with simulations. In addition to the analytical model, a new resource planning method is proposed to compensate for uneven traffic load distribution. The proposed method considers offered traffic, hop count to the heavily loaded cell, and velocity of mobile users during resource planning and performs better in terms of probability of blocking, dropping, and forced termination. The proposed method is promising in balancing the system performance measures, yet there is room for further improvement for finding a closed formula for the proposed analytical model.
