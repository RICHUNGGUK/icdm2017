At first, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions of monotone curvature for the uniform rational quadratic B-spline segment and we compare it to the curvature condition of rational quadratic Bezier curve. Then, we give the sufficient condition of monotone curvature for the nonuniform rational quadratic B-spline segment. At last, we obtain the condition of monotone curvature for general rational quadratic B-spline curves with any number of control points.", "paper_title": "Curvature monotony condition for rational quadratic B-spline curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900122"}
