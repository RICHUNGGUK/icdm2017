The numerical results are solves by Keller-Box method incorporated with linear stability theory. The velocity and temperature profiles, local Nusselt number, as well as instability parameters for magnetic parameter M ranging from 0 to 2 and radiation parameter M ranging from 0 to 0.03 are presented. Numerical results showed that, as magnetic parameter M increases or radiation parameter R decreases, the heat transfer rate decrease. In addition, the magnetic effect destabilizes the flow to vortex mode of disturbance, while the radiation effect stabilizes it. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
