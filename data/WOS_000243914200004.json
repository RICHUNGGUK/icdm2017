The generalized linear least square (GLLS) method is a well-established method for solving linear compartment models with fast computational speed. However, the high level of noise intrinsic in the SPECT data leads to reliability and instability problems of GLLS for generating parametric images. An integrated method is proposed to restrict the noise in both the temporal and spatial domains to estimate multiple parametric images for dynamic SPECT. This method comprises three steps which are optimum image sampling schedule in the projection space, cluster analysis applied postreconstruction and parametric image generation with GLLS. The simulation and experimental studies for the neuronal nicotine acetylcholine receptor tracer of 5-[(123)I]-iodo-A-85380 were employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results of influx rate of K(1) and volume of distribution of V(d) demonstrated that the integrated method was successful in generating low noise parametric images for high noise SPECT data without enhancing the partial volume effect. Furthermore, the integrated method is computationally efficient for potential clinical applications.", "paper_title": "Fast and reliable estimation of multiple parametric images using an integrated method for dynamic SPECT", "paper_id": "WOS:000243914200004"}
