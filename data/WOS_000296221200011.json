Most of the camless valvetrains suffer the problem of high impacts at valve seating, which restricts its mass production. This paper focuses on the valve seating performance of an electromagnetic valvetrain (EMVT) with moving coil linear actuator. The EMVT has inherent advantages to achieve low valve seating velocity. The seating performance of EMVT is evaluated by two indicators: seating velocity and holding force. To limit the seating velocity, the valve is controlled to track a desired trajectory based on inverse system method at seating process. The holding force is also properly controlled base on PID current control to ensure the cylinder sealed. The valve seating performance is validated on an experimental setup. The results show that excellent valve seating performance has been achieved. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
