The spatial patterns depicted by the training image are first Summarized into a few filter scores; then classified into pattern groups in the filter score space. The sequential simulation approach proceeds by associating each conditioning data event to a closest pattern group using some distance function. A training pattern is then sampled from that group and pasted back onto the simulation grid. Local Multiple-point statistics carried by patterns are captured from the training image, and reproduced in the simulation realizations. Hence complex multiple-scale geological structures call be re-constructed in the simulation grid, conditional to a variety of sub-surface data such as well data and seismic survey.
