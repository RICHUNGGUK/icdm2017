We describe design issues as well as some of the optimization techniques we employed. We conducted a performance evaluation over shared memory using microbenchmarks. The evaluation shows that MPICH2 Nemesis has very low communication overhead, making it suitable for smaller-grained applications. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
