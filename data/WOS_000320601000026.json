However, it becomes more difficult to realize users' needs due to the ever increasing complexity of the task and the limitation of the capability of a single service alone. Creation of a new service on demand to carry out more complex tasks is possible through the composition of existing services. We have developed a preliminary prototype that supports dynamic service composition in a smart workspace environment. The system is able to achieve the desired user-tailored goals by composing the combination of available services in the smart office domain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
