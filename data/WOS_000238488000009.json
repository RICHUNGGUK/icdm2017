Pooling design is a mathematical tool to reduce the number of tests for DNA library screening. The transversal design is a special type of pooling design, which is good in implementation. In this paper, we present a new construction for transversal designs. We will also extend our construction to the error-tolerant case.", "paper_title": "New construction for transversal design", "paper_id": "WOS:000238488000009"}
