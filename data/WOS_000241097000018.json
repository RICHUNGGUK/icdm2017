In this paper we propose a decision-support framework that permits decision-makers to gauge quality both in an objective (context-independent) and in a context-dependent manner. The framework is based on the information product approach and uses the Information Product Map (IPMAP). We illustrate its application in evaluating data quality using completeness-a data quality dimension that is acknowledged as important. A decision-support tool (IPView) for managing data quality that incorporates the proposed framework is also described. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
