First, we segment a color image into skin and non-skin regions by a Gaussian skin-color model. Then, we apply mathematical morphology and region filling techniques for noise removal and hole filling. We determine whether a skin region is a face candidate by its size and shape. Principle component analysis (PCA) is used to verify face candidates. We create an ellipse model to locate eyes and mouths areas roughly, and apply the support vector machine (SVM) to classify them. Finally, we develop knowledge rules to verify eyes. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves the accuracy rate of 96.7% in face detection and 90.0% in facial feature extraction.", "paper_title": "Extracting faces and facial features from color images", "paper_id": "WOS:000255842700009"}
