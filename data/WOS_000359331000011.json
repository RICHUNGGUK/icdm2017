The lambda-fuzzy measure is applied to simplify the fuzzy measure on attribute set (or expert set), and some formulae and programming models are proposed to determine the 2-fuzzy measure. Meanwhile some desirable properties of aggregation operator are studied. With respect to group decision making under interval linguistic environment, the GOGDM algorithm is introduced in detail. Furthermore, the facility location selection is applied to illustrate the practicality and validity of the GOGDM algorithm. Comparative analysis are proposed to show the advantage and validity of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
