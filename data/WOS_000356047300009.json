The output mesh is proved to consist of sliver-free simplices. Assuming that the hyper-surface is a closed smooth manifold, we also guarantee faithful geometric and topological approximation. We implement and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on publicly available segmented cardiac images. Finally, we devise a tightly coupled parallelization technique to boost the performance of our 4-dimensional mesher, thereby taking advantage of the multi-core and many-core platforms already available in the market.", "paper_title": "4D space-time Delaunay meshing for medical images", "paper_id": "WOS:000356047300009"}
