A text classifier generates a (locally optimal) initial output, which is refined by an HMM, providing a globally optimal classification. The proposed approach was evaluated in two case studies and the experiments revealed a consistent gain in performance through the use of the HMM. In the first case study, the implemented prototype was used to extract information from bibliographic references, reaching a precision rate of 87.48% in a test set with 3000 references. In the second case study, the prototype extracted information from author affiliations, reaching a precision rate of 90.27% in a test set with 300 affiliations.", "paper_title": "COMBINING TEXT CLASSIFIERS AND HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS FOR INFORMATION EXTRACTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000265542900005"}
