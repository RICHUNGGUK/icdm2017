In particular, the steady-state circuit voltages are the components of the LP (QP) optimal solution. The paper shows how to construct the circuit and provides a proof of equivalence between the circuit and the LP (QP) problem. The proposed method is used to implement an LP-based Model Predictive Controller by using an analog circuit. Simulative and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
