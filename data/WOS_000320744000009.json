This paper presents a scalable architecture, including a domain decomposition technique, of a GPU accelerator for the two-dimensional Discrete Element Method for triangular shaped particles. This approach achieved a speed up of about 140 times as a single core and about 80 after domain decomposition on a consumer level GPU compared to a similar algorithm run on a fast desktop PC.
