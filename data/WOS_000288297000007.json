In the proposed method, a statistical shape model of healthy tracheas is registered to a 3D CT image of a patient with tracheal stenosis. The registration yields an estimation of the shape of the patient's trachea as if stenosis was not present. From this point, the extent and the severity of the stenosis is assessed and stent parameters are obtained automatically. The method was extensively evaluated on simulation as well on real data and the results showed that it is accurate and fast enough to be used in the clinical setting. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
