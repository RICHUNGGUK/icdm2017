In recent years, many researchers design exact exponential-time algorithms for problems of that kind. The goal is getting the time complexity still of order O(c(n)), but with the constant c as small as possible. In this work we extend this line of research and we investigate whether the constant c can be made even smaller when one allows constant factor approximation. In fact, we describe a kind of approximation schemes-trade-offs between approximation factor and the time complexity. We use general transformations from exponential-time exact algorithms to approximations that are faster but still exponential-time. For example, we show that for any reduction rate r, one can transform any O*(c(n))-time(1) algorithm for SET COVER into a (1 + lnr)-approximation algorithm running in time O*(C(n/r)). We believe that results of that kind extend the applicability of exact algorithms for NP-hard problems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
