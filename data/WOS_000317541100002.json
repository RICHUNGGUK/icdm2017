The model has been considered as a computational model. In an orthogonal way, several distributed systems have been termed in literature as being realizations of games in the sense of game theory. In this paper, we investigate under which conditions population protocols, or more generally pairwise interaction rules, can be considered as the result of a symmetric game. We prove that not all symmetric rules can be considered as symmetric games. We prove that some basic protocols can be realized using symmetric games.", "paper_title": "Population Protocols that Correspond to Symmetric Games", "paper_id": "WOS:000317541100002"}
