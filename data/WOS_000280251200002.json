A key issue is extracting and making use of significant features hidden behind the chronological and structural dependencies found in these sequences. Almost all existing algorithms designed to perform this task are based on the matching of patterns in chronological order, but such sequences often have similar structural features in chronologically different order. In this paper we propose SCS, a novel, effective and domain-independent method for measuring the similarity between categorical sequences, based on an original pattern matching scheme that makes it possible to capture chronological and non-chronological dependencies. SCS captures significant patterns that represent the natural structure of sequences, and reduces the influence of those which are merely noise. It constitutes an effective approach to measuring the similarity between data in the form of categorical sequences, such as biological sequences, natural language texts, speech recognition data, certain types of network transactions, and retail transactions. To show its effectiveness, we have tested SCS extensively on a range of data sets from different application fields, and compared the results with those obtained by various mainstream algorithms. The results obtained show that SCS produces results that are often competitive with domain-specific similarity approaches.", "paper_title": "A general measure of similarity for categorical sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000280251200002"}
