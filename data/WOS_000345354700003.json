As a result, for soft sensor development, we may only have a small number of output data samples and have much more input data samples. In this case, it is important to incorporate more input data samples to improve the modeling performance of the soft sensor. On the basis of the semisupervised modeling method, this paper aims to extend the linear semisupervised soft sensor to the nonlinear one, with incorporation of the kernel learning algorithm. Under the probabilistic modeling framework, a mixture form of the nonlinear semisupervised soft sensor is developed in the present work. To evaluate the performance of the developed nonlinear semisupervised soft sensor, an industrial case study is provided.
