An equivalent circuit is proposed to derive the electrical behavior of the material and to relate it with its physical and chemical characteristics. A simple Randles cell achieves the best fitting results for the device operation up to 1.8 V. Diffusion effects become important from 1.1 V to 1.7 V. These fittings will allow future use in displays, in smart glasses for vision impaired people, and other applications, as they will optimize the electronic drivers and signals to be used.
