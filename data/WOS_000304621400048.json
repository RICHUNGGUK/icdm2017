The dependence of the peptide behavior on temperature was tested with the commonly employed thermostat scheme consisting of one thermostat for the protein and another for the solvent. The thermostat coupling time of the protein was increased to infinity, when the protein is not in direct contact with the thermal bath, a situation known as minimally invasive thermostat. In agreement with other works, it was observed that only in the last situation the instantaneous temperature of the model protein obeys a canonical distribution. As for the folding studies, it was shown that, in the applications of the commonly utilized thermostat schemes, the systems are trapped in local minima regions from which it has difficulty escaping. With the minimally invasive thermostat the time that the protein needs to fold was reduced by two to three times. These results show that the obstacles to the evolution of the extended peptide to the folded structure can be overcome when the temperature of the peptide is not directly controlled.", "paper_title": "Effect of the thermostat in the molecular dynamics simulation on the folding of the model protein chignolin", "paper_id": "WOS:000304621400048"}
