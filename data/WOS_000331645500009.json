The objective is to pack these items as they arrive, minimizing the resulting height. Just like in the classical game of Tetris, each square must be moved along a collision-free path to its final destination. In addition, we account for gravity in both motion (squares must never move up) and position (any final destination must be supported from below). A similar problem has been considered before; the best previous result is by Azar and Epstein, who gave a 4-competitive algorithm in a setting without gravity (i.e., with the possibility of letting squares \"hang in the air\") based on ideas of shelf packing: Squares are assigned to different horizontal levels, allowing an analysis that is reminiscent of some bin-packing arguments. We apply a geometric analysis to establish a competitive factor of 3.5 for the bottom-left heuristic and present a 34/13 approximate to 2.6154-competitive algorithm.", "paper_title": "Online Square Packing with Gravity", "paper_id": "WOS:000331645500009"}
