From the morphology point of view, the growth is decomposed as initial conditions, uniform growth and directional growth, which is represented by a static polynomial model based on the Fourier expansion. A recursive model is also introduced to help understand the dynamic characteristics of the observed systems. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated using data from a simulation and from a real crystal growth experiment.", "paper_title": "Identification of radius-vector functions of interface evolution for star-shaped crystal growth", "paper_id": "WOS:000304310700002"}
