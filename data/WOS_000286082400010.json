It belongs to the family of previously developed residual-based compact schemes and can be considered as optimal since it offers the maximum achievable order of accuracy on the 3 x 3-point stencil. The computation of 2D scalar problems demonstrates the excellent accuracy and efficiency properties offered by this new RBC scheme with respect to existing second- and third-order versions.
