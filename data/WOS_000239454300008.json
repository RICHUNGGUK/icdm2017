We present an optimization for distances based on neighbourhood sequences for the face-centered cubic (fcc) and body-centered cubic (bcc) grids. In the optimization, several error functions are used measuring different geometrical properties of the balls obtained when using these distances.", "paper_title": "Approximating Euclidean distance using distances based on neighbourhood sequences in non-standard three-dimensional grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454300008"}
