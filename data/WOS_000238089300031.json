Starting from playing games in one-dimensional world, and then followed by games in two-dimensional and three-dimensional ones, the players are progressively led to generalized rules that can be applied to the four-dimensional world, in which the generalized rule is tested. Different series of games were designed for players to learn the different features of four-dimensional world and were implemented into a web-based learning system which is now undergone field tests.", "paper_title": "Exploring the fourth dimension: The design of a multimedia learning system for generalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300031"}
