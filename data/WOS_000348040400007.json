In this paper, we propose a new region of interest (ROI) extraction method based on the probabilistic region growing algorithm, which is robust to the finger displacement and rotation. Firstly, contrast enhancement is performed for the finger-knuckle-print images. And then we detect and correct the skewed images. Finally, ROI is extracted using the new probabilistic region growing algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance compared with other existing methods.", "paper_title": "A new finger-knuckle-print ROI extraction method based on probabilistic region growing algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000348040400007"}
