The proposed method first takes the gist representation of an image as its global feature. The image is then over-segmented into many super-pixels and histogram representations of these super-pixels are used as local features. In addition, co-occurrence and spatial layout relations among object classes are exploited as contextual cues. Finally the features and cues are integrated into the inference framework based on conditional random field by defining specific potential terms and introducing weighting functions. The proposed method has been compared with state-of-the-art methods on the MSRC database, and the experimental results show its effectiveness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
