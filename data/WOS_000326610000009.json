However, it is relatively unexplored in the flow shop setting. In this paper, we consider the flow shop scheduling with truncated position-based learning effect, i.e., the actual processing time of a job is a function of its position and a control parameter in a processing permutation. The objective is to minimize one of the six regtilar performance criteria, namely, the total completion time, the makespan, the total weighted completion time, the discounted total weighted completion time, the sum of the quadratic job completion times, and the maximum lateness. We present heuristic algorithms and analyze the worst-case bound of these heuristic algorithms. We also provide the computational results to evaluate the performance of the heuristics.
