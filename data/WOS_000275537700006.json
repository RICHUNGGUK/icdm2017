The new BGNN takes account of the complex nonlinear characteristics of HTS. Two redefined training procedures of the BGNN include the off-line training of the threshold matrix parameters, optimized by swarm optimization algorithms, and the on-line BGNN predictive application driven by the sliding window data method. The characteristics models of an HTS are identified using the new BGNN method and simulation results are presented which show the effectiveness of the BGNN in addressing modeling problems of HTS.", "paper_title": "Modeling of hydraulic turbine systems based on a Bayesian-Gaussian neural network driven by sliding window data", "paper_id": "WOS:000275537700006"}
