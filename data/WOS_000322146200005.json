In this paper, we present our study of the SESS system performance under pulsed-noise jamming and show that iterative detection can significantly improve the bit error rate (BER) performance. The jamming performance of the SESS with correlation detection is verified to be similar to that of the conventional direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) system. On the other hand, the time diversity detection of the SESS can completely mitigate the effect of jamming by exploiting the inherent temporal diversity of the SESS system. Furthermore, iterative detection with multiple iterations can not only eliminate the jamming completely but also achieve a gain of approximately 1 dB at 10(-3) BER as compared with the binary phase shift keying (BPSK) system under additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) by effectively combining the correlation and time diversity detections.", "paper_title": "Self-Encoded Spread Spectrum with Iterative Detection under Pulsed-Noise Jamming", "paper_id": "WOS:000322146200005"}
