The classifier used in the system is based on smooth support vector machine (SSVM). SSVM is a variation of support vector machine (SVM) with higher detection rate and shorter training time. Since SSVM is a binary classifier, for the sake of recognizing different attacks, we constructed hierarchical SSVMs to do it. The NIDS captures HTTP request packet, and derives features from payload but header information. By experiments, the NIDS capture(] 55,308 HTTP request packets on-line, consisting of 31,034 normal and 24,274 abnormal packets, the true positive rate is 99.40% and the false alarm is 6.85%. The proposed NID has another merit; that is, it has the ability to detect unknown or even novel attacks, ranging from 65.13% to 97.33%, depending on different signatures missed in training phase. Moreover, our NIDS takes only 7.2 x 10(-4) second in average for processing an incoming packet in a PC with 2.4GHZ CPU and 256MB RAM. The high accuracy and speed make our NIDS more practicable in the real world.", "paper_title": "Anomaly detection for web server based on smooth support vector machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000258348100007"}
