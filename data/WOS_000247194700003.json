Moreover, video transmission over ad hoc networks causes frequent transmission loss of video packets owing to end-to-end transmission with a number of wireless links, and requires essential bandwidth and restricted delay to provide quality-guaranteed display. This paper presents an architecture supporting transmission of multiple video streams in ad hoc networks by establishing multiple routing paths to provide extra video coding and transport schemes. This study also proposes an on-demand multicast routing protocol to transport layered video streams. The multicast routing protocol transmits layered video streaming based on a weight criterion, which is derived according to the number of receivers, delay and expiration time of a route. A simulation is performed herein to indicate the viability and performance of the proposed approach. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed transport scheme is more effective than other video transport schemes with single or multiple paths.", "paper_title": "Transmission of layered video streaming via multi-path on ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000247194700003"}
