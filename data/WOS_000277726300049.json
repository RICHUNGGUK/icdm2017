The fault detection is a challenging problem due to increasing complexity of processes and agility necessary to avoid malfunction or accidents. The fault detection central challenge is determining the difference between normal and potential harmful activities at dynamic systems. A promising solution is emerging in the form of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS). The Danger Model (DM) proposes that the immune system reacts not against self or non-self but by threats generated into the organism: the danger signals. DM-based fault detection system proposes a new formulation for a fault detection system. A DM-inspired methodology is applied to a fault detection benchmark provided by DAMADICS to compare its relative performance to others algorithms. The results show that the strategy developed is promising for incipient and abrupt fault detection in dynamic systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
