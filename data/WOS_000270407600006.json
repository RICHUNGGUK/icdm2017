An anycasting message finds an appropriate server that can meet the service requirements of the client effectively. We discuss the mathematical framework to provide quality of service (QoS) for anycasting over optical burst switched networks. These QoS parameters include resource availability, reliability, propagation delay, and quality of transmission. With the help of link-state information available at each network element (NE), the bursts are scheduled to their next link. This decentralized way of routing helps to provide optimal QoS and hence decreases the loss of grid jobs due to multiple constraints. We compare the performance of our proposed algorithm with the shortest-path algorithm. Using simulation results performed on different network topologies, we show that the service-aware anycasting paradigm introduced decreases the number of bursts lost.", "paper_title": "Constraint-Based Anycasting Over Optical Burst Switched Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270407600006"}
