This paper discusses the properties of a new distance between fuzzy variables defined by expected value operator. Furthermore, a metric space of fuzzy variables is defined and the completeness of this space is proved. Finally, the distances between fuzzy vectors, fuzzy random vectors, and random fuzzy vectors are given.", "paper_title": "On distance between fuzzy variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000258878600004"}
