So, it is hard to get a good performance by using the conventional PI controller for the speed control of BLDCM. In this paper, a fuzzy adaptive single neuron neural networks (NN) controller for BLDCM is developed. The fuzzy logic system (FLS) is adopted to adjust the parameter K of single neuron NN controller online. By this way, performance of the system can be improved. Performances of the proposed fuzzy adaptive single neuron NN controller are compared with the performances of conventional PI controller and normal single neuron NN controller. The experimental results demonstrate that a good control performance is achieved. The using of fuzzy adaptive single neuron NN makes the drive system robust, accurate, and insensitive to parameter variations.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy adaptive single neuron NN control of brushless DC motor", "paper_id": "WOS:000314844300020"}
