The framework couples global sensitivity analysis using Sobol' variance decomposition with multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to generate planning alternatives and test their robustness to new modeling assumptions and scenarios. We explore these issues within the context of a risk-based water supply management problem, where a city seeks the most efficient use of a water market. The case study examines a single city's water supply in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) in Texas, using a suite of 6-objective problem formulations that have increasing decision complexity for both a 10-year planning horizon and an extreme single-year drought scenario. The de Novo planning framework demonstrated illustrates how to adaptively improve the value and robustness of our problem formulations by evolving our definition of optimality while discovering key tradeoffs.
