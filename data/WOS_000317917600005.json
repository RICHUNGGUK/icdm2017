The development of SOULAGE-TAVIE included four main phases: (1) identification of a clinical problem, (2) outline design, (3) clinical operationalization, and (4) production. The validation of the intervention's feasibility and acceptability was made through pilot testing with 30 patients expecting cardiac surgery over 4 months in 2010. SOULAGE-TAVIE consists of a 30-minute computer-tailored preoperative educational session about postoperative pain management. Activities and information were tailored according to a predetermined profile. Two short reinforcements were provided in person postoperatively. Ninety-six percent of participants agreed that the strategies proposed responded to their needs. An iterative process among various sources of knowledge gave place to an innovative approach to preoperative education. Pilot testing provided preliminary support for the acceptability and feasibility of a tailored Web-based intervention. Patient empowerment is complementary yet crucial in the current context of care and may contribute to improved pain relief. The use of information technologies can increase personalization and accessibility to health education in a complex environment of care.", "paper_title": "SOULAGE-TAVIE Development and Validation of a Virtual Nursing Intervention to Promote Self-management of Postoperative Pain After Cardiac Surgery", "paper_id": "WOS:000317917600005"}
