To judge the quality of the overall composition, for example, we can start by calculating the semantic similarities between outputs and inputs of connected constituent services, and aggregate these values into a measure of semantic quality for the composition. This paper takes a specific interest in combining semantic and nonfunctional criteria such as quality of service (QoS) to evaluate quality in web services composition. It proposes a novel and extensible model balancing the new dimension of semantic quality (as a functional quality metric) with a QoS metric, and using them together as ranking and optimization criteria. It also demonstrates the utility of Genetic Algorithms to allow optimization within the context of a large number of services foreseen by the \"Web of Services\" vision. We test the performance of the overall approach using a set of simulation experiments, and discuss its advantages and weaknesses.", "paper_title": "Seeking Quality of Web Service Composition in a Semantic Dimension", "paper_id": "WOS:000289624600011"}
