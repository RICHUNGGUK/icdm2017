Since it is difficult for common computing users to explore the grid computing resource successfully without computer-experts' help; it is feasible that computing users should be presented an easy-study-and-use language to express their workflow and it is up to computer-expert to realize an interpreter to translate the scripting-language file into XML scripting language file. Furthermore, this destination file should conform to specification of BPEL4WS such that the prototype system realized will hold good expansibility.", "paper_title": "A workflow-oriented scripting language based on BPEL4WS", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100093"}
