To increase their use, and to reuse them when possible, it is vital to manage them adequately and to provide them in a standard interchange format. Simple knowledge organization systems (SKOS) seem to be the most promising representation for the type of knowledge models used in digital libraries, but there is a lack of tools that are able to properly manage it. This work presents a tool that fills this gap, facilitating their use in different environments and using SKOS as an interchange format.", "paper_title": "ThManager: An open source tool for creating and visualizing SKOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000250371400005"}
