In this article, we present observations that have implications to a set of common assumptions protocol designers make while designing sensornet protocols-specifically-the MAC and network layer protocols. We first distill these common assumptions in to a conceptual model and show how our observations support or dispute these assumptions. We also present case studies of protocols that do not make these assumptions. Understanding the implications of these observations to the conceptual model can improve future protocol designs.", "paper_title": "An Empirical Study of Low-Power Wireless", "paper_id": "WOS:000275163100007"}
