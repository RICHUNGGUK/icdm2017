However, the simple permit-based verification method is not sufficient for the critical departments such as banks and courts, which need to check not only the identity of the vehicles, but also the vehicle route before reaching the restricted area, as the vehicles can have the access permit if and only if they have traveled along the pre-defined routes. To meet the route-tracking requirement, we proposed a novel access control systems based on the radio frequency identification systems on roads. Particularly, we designed a key cloaking method and a route encryption algorithm so that the access control system can be protected against the attackers from both outside and inside. The analytical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can successfully reduce the threat of some malicious attack, such as side-channel attack.", "paper_title": "Secured access control for vehicles in RFID systems on roads", "paper_id": "WOS:000344812200010"}
