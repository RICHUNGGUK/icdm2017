Specifically, we show that given an arithmetic circuit (either explicitly or via black-box access) that computes a multivariate polynomial f, the task of computing arithmetic circuits for the factors of f can be solved deterministically, given a deterministic algorithm for the polynomial identity testing problem (we require either a white-box or a black-box algorithm, depending on the representation of f). Together with the easy observation that deterministic factoring implies a deterministic algorithm for polynomial identity testing, this establishes an equivalence between these two central derandomization problems of arithmetic complexity. Previously, such an equivalence was known only for multilinear circuits (Shpilka & Volkovich, 2010).", "paper_title": "Equivalence of Polynomial Identity Testing and Polynomial Factorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000354904400004"}
