In this paper, by using the generator matrices of bordered double circulant doubly-even self-dual codes, we give 3-(n, k; m)-SEEDs with (n, k, m) . With the aid of computer, we obtain 22 generator matrices of bordered double circulant doubly-even self-dual codes of length 48, which enable us to get 506 mutually disjoint 5-(48, k, ) designs for (k, )=(12, 8),(16, 1356),(20, 36176). Moreover, this implies 5-(48, k; 506)-SEEDs for k = 12, 16, 20, 24.", "paper_title": "Mutually disjoint t-designs and t-SEEDs from extremal doubly-even self-dual codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000340681700004"}
