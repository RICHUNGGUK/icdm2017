In this paper, we present the first derivatives of toric surface patches along the boundary and study the G(1) continuity between adjacent toric surface patches by the toric degenerations. Furthermore, some practical G(1) sufficient conditions of toric surface patches are developed and the representative examples are given. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
