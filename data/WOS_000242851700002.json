In spite of the diversity of sequential activities of sensory, motor, and cognitive neural systems, they have many similarities from the dynamical point of view. In this review we discus the ideas, models, and mathematical image of sequence generation and reshaping on different levels of the neural hierarchy, i.e., the role of a sensory network dynamics in the generation of a motor program (hunting swimming of marine mollusk Clione), olfactory dynamical coding, and sequential learning and decision making. Analysis of these phenomena is based on the winnerless competition principle. The considered models can be a basis for the design of biologically inspired autonomous intelligent systems.", "paper_title": "Generation and reshaping of sequences in neural systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242851700002"}
