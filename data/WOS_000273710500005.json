Data mining of these vasts amount of data is crucial in gaining this understanding. In this paper, we present a fuzzy rule-based classification system that allows for effective analysis of gene expression data. The applied classifier consists of a set of fuzzy if-then rules that enable accurate nonlinear classification of input patterns. We further present a hybrid fuzzy classification scheme in which a small number of fuzzy if-then rules are selected through means of a genetic algorithm, leading to a compact classifier for gene expression analysis. Extensive experimental results on various well-known gene expression datasets confirm the efficacy of our approaches.", "paper_title": "Data Mining of Gene Expression Data by Fuzzy and Hybrid Fuzzy Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000273710500005"}
