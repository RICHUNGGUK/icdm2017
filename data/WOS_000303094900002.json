With the characteristics of the structured P2P networks, we establish a biological immune model and a file propagation tracing mechanism, based on which the mechanisms for alarms collection, propagation-chain tracing, immune response and antibody memorizing are designed. The proposed immune strategy can not only eliminate the polluted clusters and indices effectively but also prevent the reviving of the old pollution. In addition, the node permission is employed to control the ability to request files. The experimental results show that our strategy can curb the propagations of the polluted files effectively and efficiently even in the severely polluted structured P2P networks.
