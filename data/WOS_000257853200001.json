In the first problem, a single server receives two classes of customers with general service time requirements and follows a preemptive-resume policy between them. Both classes are impatient and abandon the system if their wait time is longer than their exponentially distributed patience limits. In the second model, the low-priority class is assumed to be patient and the single server chooses the next customer to serve according to a non-preemptive priority policy in favor of the impatient customers. The third problem involves a multi-server system that can be used to analyze a call center offering a call-back option to its impatient customers. Here, customers requesting to be called back are considered to be the low-priority class. We obtain the steady-state performance measures of each class in the first two problems and those of the high-priority class in the third problem by exploiting the level crossing method. We furthermore adapt an algorithm from the literature to obtain the factorial moments of the low-priority queue length of the multi-server system exactly.", "paper_title": "On priority queues with impatient customers", "paper_id": "WOS:000257853200001"}
