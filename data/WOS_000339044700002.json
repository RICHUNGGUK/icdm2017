Prior standard face recognition methods like Eigenfaces or state-of-the-art approaches such as sparse representation-based classification did not consider possible contamination of data during training, and thus their recognition performance on corrupted test data would be degraded. In this paper, we propose a novel face recognition algorithm based on low-rank matrix decomposition to address the aforementioned problem. Besides the capability of decomposing raw training data into a set of representative bases for better modeling the face images, we introduce a constraint of structural incoherence into the proposed algorithm, which enforces the bases learned for different classes to be as independent as possible. As a result, additional discriminating ability is added to the derived base matrices for improved recognition performance. Experimental results on different face databases with a variety of variations verify the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "Robust Face Recognition With Structurally Incoherent Low-Rank Matrix Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000339044700002"}
