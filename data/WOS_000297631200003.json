In order to achieve consistent composite results, both the virtual and real characters must share the same geometrical constraints and their interactions must follow some common sense. One essential question is how to detect the motion of real objectssuch as real characters moving in the videoand how to steer virtual characters accordingly to avoid unrealistic collisions. We propose an online solution. First, by analysis of the input video, the motion states of the real pedestrians are recovered into a common world 3D coordinate system. Meanwhile, a simplified accuracy measurement is defined to represent the confidence of the motion estimate. Then, under the constraints imposed by the real dynamic objects, the motion of virtual characters are accommodated by a uniform steering model. The final step is to merge virtual objects back to the real video scene by taking into account visibility and occlusion constraints between real foreground objects and virtual ones. Several examples demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
