An asset-based DWTA optimization model was proposed with four kinds of constraints considered, including capability constraints, strategy constraints, resource constraints and engagement feasibility constraints. A general \"virtual\" representation of decisions was presented to facilitate the generation of feasible decisions. The representation is in essence the permutation of all assignment pairs. A construction procedure converts the permutations into real feasible decisions. In order to solve this problem, three evolutionary decision-making algorithms, including a genetic algorithm and two memetic algorithms, were developed. Experimental results show that the memetic algorithm based on greedy local search can generate obviously better DWTA decisions, especially for large-scale problems, than the genetic algorithm and the memetic algorithm based on steepest local search.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary decision-makings for the dynamic weapon-target assignment problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000272033000007"}
