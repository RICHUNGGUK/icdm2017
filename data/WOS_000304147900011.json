We assume that all the nodes are selfish and show formally that both protocols are strategy proof, that is, no individual has an interest to deviate. Extensive simulations with real traces show that our protocols introduce an extremely small overhead in terms of delay, while the techniques we introduce to force faithful behavior have the positive and quite surprising side effect to improve performance by reducing the number of replicas and the storage requirements. We test our protocols also in the presence of a natural variation of the notion of selfishness-nodes that are selfish with outsiders and faithful with people from the same community. Even in this case, our protocols are shown to be very efficient in detecting possible misbehavior.", "paper_title": "Give2Get: Forwarding in Social Mobile Wireless Networks of Selfish Individuals", "paper_id": "WOS:000304147900011"}
