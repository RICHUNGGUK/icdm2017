Although the upper bound of performance of a circuit increases as the number of clock domains increases in multi-domain clock skew scheduling, the improvement of the performance becomes smaller while the cost of clock distribution network increases much. In this paper, a linear time algorithm that finds an optimum two-domain clock skew schedule in general-synchronous framework is proposed. Experimental results on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits and artificial data show that optimum circuits are efficiently obtained by our method in short time.", "paper_title": "2-SAT Based Linear Time Optimum Two-Domain Clock Skew Scheduling in General-Synchronous Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567100024"}
