The theorems to apply this way are approved. Then, the parametric form of fuzzy numbers is applied to solve two types of fuzzy H-differential equations of second order with constant multipliers and fuzzy initial values. Their solutions are classified and discussed hereinafter.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy generalized H-differential and applications to fuzzy differential equations of second-order", "paper_id": "WOS:000332245500032"}
