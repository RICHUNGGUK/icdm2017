The N-version programming technique, where N-different modules run in parallel, can be used to improve the reliability and safety of such systems at the desired safety level. Decisions of N-different modules are then evaluated by another component, usually known as the voter, using different voting strategies. In the current study a bitwise voting strategy to evaluate module decisions that are based on safe-states of variables is proposed and possible synchronization problems between the modules are determined. Sequence diagrams and solutions for synchronization problems are also explained.", "paper_title": "A new bitwise voting strategy for safety-critical systems with binary decisions", "paper_id": "WOS:000359124800024"}
