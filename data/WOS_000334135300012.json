From the Lagrangian analysis, the dynamic model of a differential wheeled robot can be obtained. A fuzzy sliding-mode controller is derived for leader-follower formation control based on graph theory and consensus algorithm. Moreover, an adaptive law is provided to estimate the bounds of unknown uncertainties. Both simulation and experimental results are applied to validate the formation performance. It is indicated that the proposed adaptive control scheme can provide better leader-following formation responses of multiple mobile robots.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Fuzzy Sliding-Mode Formation Controller Design for Multi-Robot Dynamic Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000334135300012"}
