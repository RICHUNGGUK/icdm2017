Tackling the complexity challenge, integration with heterogeneous Model of Computation (MoC) and providing a consistent notion of time are key challenges, on which this research work is focused. The proposed Executable Time-Triggered Model (E-TTM) provides an executable modeling approach that supports the integration with SystemC-AMS based plant models for the design of time-triggered real-time control-systems. E-TTM metamodel has been implemented as a C++ library that extends SystemC with the time-triggered MoC. This approach is illustrated with a case study.", "paper_title": "Modeling time-triggered real-time control systems using executable time-triggered model (E-TTM) and systemC-AMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000303074700005"}
