While existing methods attempt to rerank all the individual result videos, they suffer from several drawbacks. In this article, we propose a new video reranking paradigm called cluster-based video reranking (CVR). The idea is to first construct a video near-duplicate graph representing the visual similarity relationship among videos, followed by identifying the near-duplicate clusters from the video near-duplicate graph, then ranking the obtained near-duplicate clusters based on cluster properties and intercluster links, and finally for each ranked cluster, a representative video is selected and returned. Compared to existing methods, the new CVR ranks clusters and exhibits several advantages, including superior reranking by utilizing more reliable cluster properties, fast reranking on a small number of clusters, diverse and representative results. Particularly, we formulate the near-duplicate cluster identification as a novel maximally cohesive subgraph mining problem. By leveraging the designed cluster scoring properties indicating the cluster's importance and quality, random walk is applied over the near-duplicate cluster graph to rank clusters. An extensive evaluation study proves the novelty and superiority of our proposals over existing methods.", "paper_title": "Mining Near-Duplicate Graph for Cluster-Based Reranking of Web Video Search Results", "paper_id": "WOS:000284939400006"}
