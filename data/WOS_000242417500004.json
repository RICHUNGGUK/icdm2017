But other transformation groups can be considered to improve the solving process. More precisely, using different transformation groups leads to a new approach of decomposition which generalizes in some sense the classical approaches. This paper presents a method able to perform such a multi-group decomposition.", "paper_title": "Geometrical constraint system decomposition: A multi-group approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000242417500004"}
