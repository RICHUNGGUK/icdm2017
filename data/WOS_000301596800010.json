This study investigates the possibility of introducing computational approximations in modelling stent deployment in aneurysmatic cerebral vessels to achieve simulations compatible with the constraints of real clinical workflows. The release of a self-expandable stent in a simplified aneurysmatic vessel was modelled in four different initial positions. Six progressively simplified modelling approaches (based on Finite Element method and Fast Virtual Stenting - FVS) have been used. Comparing accuracy of the results, the final configuration of the stent is more affected by neglecting mechanical properties of materials (FVS) than by adopting 1D instead of 3D stent models. Nevertheless, the differences showed are acceptable compared to those achieved by considering different stent initial positions. Regarding computational costs, simulations involving 1D stent features are the only ones feasible in clinical context.", "paper_title": "Deployment of self-expandable stents in aneurysmatic cerebral vessels: comparison of different computational approaches for interventional planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000301596800010"}
