This structure can be used to build a data structure that stores a simple polygon and allows ray-shooting queries along parabolic trajectories with vertical main axis. For a polygon of complexity n, we can answer such \"such-throwing\" queries in O(log(2) n) time, using O(n log n) storage and O(n log(2) n) preprocessing time. This matches the best known bound for circular ray shooting in simple polygons.", "paper_title": "Parabola separation queries and their applicationto stone throwing", "paper_id": "WOS:000251316600004"}
