Physical layer aspects and MAC protocols have been intensively investigated in the recent years leading, in some cases, to important and definitive results. However, many questions relating to the UWB network layer are still open. The aim of this paper is to investigate the network layer of the UWB system: for this purpose a new routing protocol called Interference Aware-based Ad-Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (IA-AODV) and based on the interference concept has been proposed. In particular, two distinct metrics are explained in detail: the first one is based on the concept of global interference perceived by each node; the second one is based on the concept of link interference perceived by a node on a wireless path to a generic neighbor. Finally, a comparative analysis between our protocol and Ad-Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol are carried out in order to show the soundness of our proposal. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
