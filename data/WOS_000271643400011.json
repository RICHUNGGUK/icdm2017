Kanban and CONWIP systems are focused on and analyzed in this paper. CONWIP is a well-known production control system, and some papers have shown it has better performance than the Kanban system. Our research shows that the Kanban is more flexible for the assembly system under concern with respect to a given objective than the CONWIP. In some cases, if the number of kanbans at each manufacturing/assembling station is optimally set, Kanban system outperforms CONWIP with a lower average WIP and the same level of throughput. That is, the distribution of kanbans can be an important design parameter of the system. We also propose two different policies to release cards in a CONWIP controlled assembly system, followed by their comparison results.", "paper_title": "A performance comparison between Kanban and CONWIP controlled assembly systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000271643400011"}
