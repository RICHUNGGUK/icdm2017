We can decide whether a language L is prefix-, suffix-, factor-, or subword-convex in polynomial time if L is represented by a DFA, but these problems become PSPACE-complete if L is represented by an NFA. If a regular language is not convex, we find tight upper bounds on the length of the shortest words demonstrating this fact, in terms of the number of states of an accepting DFA. Similar results are proved for some subclasses of convex languages: the prefix-, suffix-, factor-, and subword-closed languages, and the prefix-, suffix-, factor-, and subword-free languages. Finally, we briefly examine these questions where L is represented by a context-free grammar. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
