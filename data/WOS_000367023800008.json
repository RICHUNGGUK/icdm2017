It interacts with physical world and humans through ad hoc communications. In contemporary, with the fast development of CPS theory and applications, CPS generates a large volume of data, which may lead its control into a chaotic status. Hence, there is a pressing demand to solve the chaotic status CPS control. To this end, the chaotic time series prediction algorithm is employed to resolve the chaotic status featured by a fuzzy feedback linearization model. Modeling the CPS under big data without taking chaotic features into account may lead to unexpected results. This is because chaotic CPS is dramatically sensitive to small disturbances or minor changes of initiators. This paper developed a CPS model in light of fuzzy feedback linearization. Further, the chaotic time prediction algorithm is applied to solve the chaotic control problem in CPS. The developed algorithm takes both tracking control problem and synchronization control problem into account. The numerical results suggest that the developed method is feasible and efficient in tracking control and synchronization of two chaotic CPS. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
