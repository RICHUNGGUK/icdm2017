In the location case, this procedure allows for computing halfspace depth regions even beyond dimension two. The corresponding algorithm is described in detail, and illustrations are provided both for simulated and real data. The efficiency of a MATLAB implementation of the algorithm is also investigated through extensive simulations. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.
