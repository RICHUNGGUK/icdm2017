Extra connectivity determination and faulty networks' structure analysis are two important aspects for the reliability evaluation of interconnection networks. An n-dimensional bijective connection network (in brief, BC network), denoted by X-n, is an n-regular graph with 2(n) vertices and n2(n-1) edges. The hypercubes, Mobius cubes, crossed cubes, and twisted cubes are some examples of the BC networks. By exploring the boundary problem of the BC networks, we prove that when n >= 4 and 0 <= h <= n - 4 the h-extra connectivity of an n-dimensional BC network X-n is k(h)(X-n) = n(h + 1) - 1/2h(h + 3). Furthermore, there exists a large connected component and the remaining small components have at most h vertices in total if the total number of faulty vertices is strictly less its h-extra connectivity. As an application, the results on the h-extra connectivity and structure of faulty networks on hypercubes, Mobius cubes, crossed cubes, and twisted cubes are obtained.", "paper_title": "Reliability Evaluation of BC Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000325171200018"}
