More specifically, for numerical predicate sets 93 satisfying a certain closure property, we characterize the class of languages recognized by FO[<, (sic)]-uniform linear threshold circuits as exactly those which are recognized by a particular class of two-variable formulas that use majority quantifiers and (sic) predicates, and are exactly those which can be recognized by a particular class of weakly blocked products of typed monoids. This correspondence will hold for any numerical predicate set which is FO[<]-closed and whose predicates do not depend on the input length. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
