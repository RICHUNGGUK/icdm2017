The sensitivity can be leveraged to detect attacks that exude randomness in traffic characteristics, such as denial-of-service attacks and worms. In particular, we show that the method can be used to alert of the imminent onset of a worm epidemic in a statistically sound manner, irrespective of the worm's scanning strategies.", "paper_title": "Is Early Warning of an Imminent Worm Epidemic Possible?", "paper_id": "WOS:000270548500003"}
