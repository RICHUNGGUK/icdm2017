This theory qualitatively describes the shapes of the objects, considering: (i) shape boundary characteristics, such as angles, relative length, concavities, and curvature; and (ii) their color and size. The shapes to be recognized may be regular or irregular closed polygons, or closed curvilinear figures. Each figure is described as a symbolic character string that contains all its distinctive characteristics. This description is used to determine whether the shape of two figures matches. Then, given a design of a mosaic and given a set of physical ceramic tesserae, an application is developed in order to recognize the tesserae that form the mosaic, thus enabling the intelligent and automated assembly of ceramic mosaics.", "paper_title": "2D qualitative shape matching applied to ceramic mosaic assembly", "paper_id": "WOS:000308820200038"}
