The problem arises because some email-control mechanisms like bonds, graph-turing tests, etc., inherently leak information, and without discontinuing their use, leakage channels cannot be closed. We formalize the capabilities of an attacker and show how she can launch guessing attacks on recipient's mail acceptance policy that utilizes leaky mechanism in an effort to avoid unwanted mail. The attacker in our model guesses the contents of a recipient's private information. The recipients' use of leaky mechanisms allow the sender to verify her guess. We assume a constraint logic programming based policy language for specification and evaluation of mail acceptance criteria and present two different program transformations that can prevent guessing attacks while allowing recipients to utilize any email-control mechanism in their policies.", "paper_title": "Policy transformations for preventing leakage of sensitive information in email systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239572200012"}
