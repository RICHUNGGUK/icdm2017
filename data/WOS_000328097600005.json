We show that Gauss-Markov conditions are not met here and thus estimations of network parameters are biased. To eliminate this we propose to use cloning of neuron parameters in the GMDH network with genetic selection and cloning (GMC GMDH) that can outperform other powerful methods. It is demonstrated on tasks from the Machine Learning Repository.", "paper_title": "GMDH METHOD WITH GENETIC SELECTION ALGORITHM AND CLONING", "paper_id": "WOS:000328097600005"}
