To this purpose we introduce a suitable functional whose minimizers are given by the points we want to detect. In order to provide numerical experiments we replace this energy with a sequence of more treatable functionals by means of the notion of Gamma-convergence.", "paper_title": "A Formal Gamma-Convergence Approach for the Detection of Points in 2-D Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000285500900013"}
