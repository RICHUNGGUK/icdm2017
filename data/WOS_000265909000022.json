For electronic market (e-market) applications, the wide variety of choices to the consumers has introduced the problem of information searching. Meanwhile, there are also so many issues for the participants that require negotiations to find the best deal. In this paper, we present a bilateral multi-issue negotiation scheme, which deploys risk seeking/averse strategies and cost-oriented/benefit-oriented tactics to explore the negotiation space of possible trade-off for the one that is most likely to be acceptable. In particular, it focuses on the incorporation of the level of vagueness of preferences for those issues (either crisp or fuzzy) and multi-objective decision-making techniques. The goal of this research is to design an effective model and some constraints-based fuzzy rules and relax of these constraints to their prevailing transaction circumstances. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
