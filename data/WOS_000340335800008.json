In this optimization method, the optimization problems are formulated based on the original Boltzmann equation, and the design sensitivities are precisely obtained without the time-consuming numerical operations encountered when dealing with a large-scale asymmetric matrix, in contrast to previous research in which the LBM uses the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) for the formulations of optimization problems and the derivation of their adjoint equations. That is, we newly derive sensitivity formulations from the original Boltzmann equation, not the LBE that can be said to be an approximated equation, and these formulations yield strictly correct sensitivities that are error free. Based on the above formulations, we construct a level set-based topology optimization method incorporating a fictitious interface energy for the design of a fluid channel that minimizes flow friction. Furthermore, two- and three-dimensional numerical examples are provided to confirm the validity and utility of the presented method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
