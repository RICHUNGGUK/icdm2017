The proposed algorithm consists of a global path planner (GPP) and a local motion planner (LMP). The GPP, which uses a MAKLINK-based approach, plans a trajectory for a robot end-effector from the starting free-space to the goal free-space. A GA with a non-random initial population is adopted to plan the manipulator configurations along the path given by the GPP. Once the optimal configuration has been obtained, the optimal chromosomes are reserved as the initial population for the next intermediate goal. Since the initial population is non-random, the evolution is more efficient and the planned path is smoother than those of the conventional GA. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm works well, specifically in terms of path smoothing and computation efficiency. The proposed algorithm also significantly reduces the number of variations of joint angles of the manipulator.", "paper_title": "HIERARCHICAL PATH PLANNING FOR MANIPULATORS BASED ON GENETIC ALGORITHM WITH NON-RANDOM INITIAL POPULATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000301405300016"}
