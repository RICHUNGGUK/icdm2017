Many researchers have given a lot of efforts to reputation-based system area and some of them have made good theoretical models. Problems are to spread malicious contents whereas the remark that such models only concentrate on the relationship between the node and its direct neighbors is still controversial. To solve the problems, we introduced the RCM (Resource Chain Model) and the Enhanced RCM. In this letter, we analyze the models and then show usage of our models can help us to find the best and safest location efficiently and decrease the number of malicious transaction.", "paper_title": "The Chain Effect for the Reputation-Based Trust Model in Peer-to-Peer Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000299588600020"}
