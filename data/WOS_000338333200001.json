This note extends this idea to a two-bar truss under two load conditions for the purpose of illustrating differences between deterministic designs and reliability-based ones in terms of risk allocation. For this example, for the same probability of failure, a deterministic design based on the same safety factor for both loads can be substantially heavier than the reliability-based design. The difference in weight is due to very different risk allocation between the two failure modes.", "paper_title": "Analytical benchmark example for risk allocation in structural optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000338333200001"}
