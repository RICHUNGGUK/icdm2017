A hot research topic is how to configure Web services to meet their demand when the diversity of user requirements, distinction of service components' performance, and limitation of resources are considered. This paper builds a Web service configuration net based on Petri nets in order to exhibit Web service configurations in a formal way. Then, an optimal algorithm is presented to help choose the best configuration with the highest quality of service to meet users' nonfunctional requirements. Finally, the simulation results and related analysis prove the soundness and correctness of our model and algorithm.", "paper_title": "QoS-aware Web service configuration", "paper_id": "WOS:000257020200012"}
