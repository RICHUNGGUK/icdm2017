Parameterized approaches for modeling friction find it difficult to achieve satisfactory performance due to the presence of nonlinearity and uncertainties in dynamical systems. This paper aims to develop adaptive fuzzy friction models by the use of data-mining techniques and system theory. Our main technical contributions are twofold: extraction of fuzzy rules and formulation of a static fuzzy friction model and adaptation of the fuzzy friction model by the use of the Lyapunov stability theory, which is associated with a control compensation of a typical motion dynamics. The proposed framework in this paper shows a successful application of adaptive data-mining techniques in engineering. A single-degree-of-freedom mechanical system is employed as an experimental model in simulation studies. Results demonstrate that our proposed fuzzy friction model has promise in the design of uncertain mechanical control systems.", "paper_title": "Extraction and Adaptation of Fuzzy Rules for Friction Modeling and Control Compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000293750700006"}
