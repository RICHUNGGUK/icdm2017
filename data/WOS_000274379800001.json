More specifically, our approach leads to simple randomized algorithms for the k-means, k-median and discrete k-means problems that yield (1 + epsilon) approximations with probability >= 1/2 and running times of O(2((k/epsilon)O(1)) dn). These are the first algorithms for these problems whose running times are linear in the size of the input (nd for n points in d dimensions) assuming k and e are fixed. Our method is general enough to be applicable to clustering problems satisfying certain simple properties and is likely to have further applications.", "paper_title": "Linear-Time Approximation Schemes for Clustering Problems in Any Dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000274379800001"}
