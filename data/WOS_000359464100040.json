An attractor, which is a state of a Boolean network repeating itself periodically, can represent a stable stage of a gene regulatory network. It is known that the problem of finding an attractor of the shortest period is NP-hard. In this article, we give a fixed-parameter algorithm for detecting a singleton attractor (SA) for a Boolean network that has only AND and OR Boolean functions of literals and has bounded treewidth k. The algorithm is further extended to detect an SA for a constant-depth nested canalyzing Boolean network with bounded treewidth. We also prove the fixed-parameter intractability of the detection of an SA for a general Boolean network with bounded treewidth.", "paper_title": "A Fixed-Parameter Algorithm for Detecting a Singleton Attractor in an AND/OR Boolean Network with Bounded Treewidth", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464100040"}
