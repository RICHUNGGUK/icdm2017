We find that the tested force fields and water models have little effect on the measures of radii of gyration and solvent accessible surface area (SASA); however, secondary structure measures and intrapeptide hydrogen-bonding are significantly modified, with AMBER (99, 99SB, 995B-ILDN, and 03) and CHARMM22/27 force-fields readily increasing helical content and the variety of intrapeptide hydrogen bonds. On the basis of a comparison between the population of helical and beta structures found in experiments, our data suggest formation of helical structure might be a better choice to model the A beta(21-30) peptide.", "paper_title": "Force-Field Induced Bias in the Structure of A beta(21-30): A Comparison of OPLS, AMBER, CHARMM, and GROMOS Force Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000367560200011"}
