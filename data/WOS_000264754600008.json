The taxonomy defines the objectives, methods and principles for classifying models and facilitates their integration. In particular, we show the integration process of models in two notations such as CIAN, which considers collaboration and human-computer interaction issues, and UML, which allows specifying the functionality of groupware systems. The proposed integration process is based on a software tool, called CIAT, developed to put our proposal into practice.", "paper_title": "Taxonomy for Integrating Models in the Development of Interactive Groupware Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000264754600008"}
