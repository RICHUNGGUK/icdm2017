The proposed scheme is based on linear precoding at the base stations (BS) and requires feedback only within each cell. For the 3-cell case, mathematical analysis is provided to show that the proposed scheme approaches to interference-free degree-of-freedom (dof) of this channel as the number of users grows. A geometric interpretation is presented to generalize the proposed scheme for more than three cells. Simulation results illustrate the dof achieved using this scheme for the 3-cell case which is important in a real cellular environment because of the three adjacent interfering cells.", "paper_title": "Interference Alignment for Downlink Transmission of Multiple Interfering Cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696300014"}
