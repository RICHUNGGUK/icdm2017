The most straightforward optical implementation of this condition is that of the entanglement between a single-photon and a coherent state. In this work, we describe the first step towards the generation of this type of hybrid entanglement from the experimental perspective.", "paper_title": "Experimental hybrid entanglement between quantum and classical states of light", "paper_id": "WOS:000351136900016"}
