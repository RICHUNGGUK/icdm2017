Gene assembly transforms a micronucleus into a macronucleus, thereby transforming each gene from its micronuclear form to its macronuclear form. Within a formal intramolecular model of gene assembly based on strings, the not ion of reduction graph represents the macronuclear form of a gene, including byproducts, given only a description of the micronuclear form of that gene. For a more abstract model of gene assembly based on graphs, one cannot, in general, define the notion of reduction graphs. We show that if were strict ourselves to the so-called realistic overlap graphs (which correspond to genes occurring in nature), then the notion of reduction graph can be defined in a manner equivalent to the string model. This allows one to carry over from the string model to the graph model several results that rely on the notion of reduction graph.", "paper_title": "REDUCTION GRAPHS FROM OVERLAP GRAPHS FOR GENE ASSEMBLY IN CILIATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000265086600004"}
