Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted to collect data to empirically assess the research model. In total, 736 usable responses were collected using a questionnaire derived from previous research. Both the structural equation model and partial least squares were used to study the model concerning different user groups. Findings - The results indicate that there are significant differences in the users' perceptions of mobile interne usage during its different innovation diffusion stages. Of the determinants, perceived enjoyment is the most important predictor of MIU. Practical implications - In addition to motivating users by making services more enjoyable, the findings suggest that practitioners should take the differences of adopter groups into account. Making the mobile internet easy to use and compatible with users' lifestyles would promote the use of technology as well. Originality/value - Few studies have investigated the differences between user groups when studying mobile internet diffusion, especially in China, which is reaching a critical stage in this regard.", "paper_title": "Mobile internet diffusion in China: an empirical study", "paper_id": "WOS:000278279300001"}
