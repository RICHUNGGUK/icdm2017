DSigDB currently holds 22 527 gene sets, consists of 17 389 unique compounds covering 19 531 genes. We also developed an online DSigDB resource that allows users to search, view and download drugs/compounds and gene sets. DSigDB gene sets provide seamless integration to GSEA software for linking gene expressions with drugs/compounds for drug repurposing and translational research.", "paper_title": "DSigDB: drug signatures database for gene set analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000361757500024"}
