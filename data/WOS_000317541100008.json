Exploring these connections, first we show that any graph is a pivot-minor of a planar graph, and even a pivot minor of a triangular grid. Then, we prove that the application of measurements in the (X, Z) plane (i.e., one-qubit measurement according to the basis {cos (theta)vertical bar 0 > + sin(theta)vertical bar 1 >, sin(theta)vertical bar 0 > - cos(theta)vertical bar 1 >} for some theta) over graph states represented by triangular grids is a universal measurement-based model of quantum computation. These two results are in fact two sides of the same coin, the proof of which is a combination of graph theoretical and quantum information techniques.", "paper_title": "Graph States, Pivot Minor, and Universality of (X, Z)-Measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000317541100008"}
