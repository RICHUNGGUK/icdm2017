Several efficient routing protocols are proposed for specific scenarios to achieve particular objectives in WSN. However, such networks have many limitations such as low data rates and security threats. In this paper, we propose an adaptive secure routing protocol which is based on bioinspired mechanism. It uses distributed ant-based methodology to select two optimal paths keeping in viewroute security. Simulation results show that our routing protocol can perform better in many scenarios.", "paper_title": "Secure Ant-Based Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000321631900001"}
