The presence of process variations further exacerbates these problems. In this article, we propose techniques for the efficient evaluation and mitigation of the impact of leakage power variations on the temperature profile of 3D Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs). Experimental results demonstrate that, due to the impact of process variations, a 4-tier 3D implementation can be more than 40 degrees C hotter and 23% leakier than its 2D counterpart. To determine the maximum temperature of each fabricated 3D IC, we propose an accurate learning-based model for peak temperature prediction. Based on the learning model, we then propose two post-fabrication techniques to increase the thermal yield of 3D CMPs: (1) tier restacking and (2) thermally-aware die matching. Experimental results show that: (1) the proposed prediction model achieves more than 98% accuracy, and (2) the proposed thermally-aware, post-fabrication optimization techniques significantly improve the thermal yield from only 51% to 99% for 3D CMPs.", "paper_title": "Statistical Peak Temperature Prediction and Thermal Yield Improvement for 3D Chip Multiprocessors", "paper_id": "WOS:000341232600008"}
