In order to limit in vivo experiments and reduce trial and error research, a scaffold screening technique has been developed. In this protocol seven structural and three biomechanical properties of potential scaffold materials are quantified and compared to the desired values. The property assessment is done on computer models of the scaffolds, and these models are based on micro-CT images. As a proof of principle, three porous scaffolds were evaluated with this protocol: stainless steel, hydroxyapatite, and titanium. These examples demonstrate that the modelling technique is able to quantify important scaffold properties. Thus, a powerful technique for automated screening of bone tissue engineering scaffolds has been developed that in a later stage may be used to tailor the scaffold properties to specific requirements.", "paper_title": "Micro-CT-based screening of biomechanical and structural properties of bone tissue engineering scaffolds", "paper_id": "WOS:000241094900001"}
