Normally, better generalization performance is obtained when unneeded parameters coming from irrelevant or redundant variables are eliminated. Information theory provides a robust theoretical framework for performing input variable selection thanks to the concept of mutual information. Nevertheless, for continuous variables, it is usually a more difficult task to determine the mutual information between the input variables and the output variable than for classification problems. This paper presents a modified approach for variable selection for continuous variables adapted from a previous approach for classification problems, making use of a mutual information estimator based on the k-nearest neighbors.", "paper_title": "Effective input variable selection for function approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100005"}
