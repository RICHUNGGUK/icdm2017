This algorithm is the extension of general CBS method which was initially introduced in finite element framework. In this work, the general equations of flow have been represented in the meshfree context. A new finite element and MFree code is developed for solving flow problems. This computational code is capable of solving both time-dependent and steady-state flow problems. Numerical simulation of some known benchmark flow problems has been studied. Computational results of MFree method have been compared to those of finite element method. The results obtained have been verified by known numerical, analytical and experimental data in the literature. A number of shape functions are used for field variable interpolation. The performance of each interpolation method is discussed. It is concluded that the MFree method is more accurate than FEM if the same numbers of nodes are used for each solver. Meshfree CBS algorithm is completely stable even at high Reynolds numbers.
