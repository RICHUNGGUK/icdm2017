The latter's conjunction is semantically interpreted by a left-continuous (but not continuous) triangular norm; implication is obtained through residuation. Our duality allows one to transfer to nilpotent minimum logic several known results about inutitionistic logic with the prelinearity axiom (also called Godel-Dummett logic), mutatis mutandis. We give several such applications.", "paper_title": "Spectral duality for finitely generated nilpotent minimum algebras, with applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000250086700006"}
