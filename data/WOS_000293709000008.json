Achieving the desired area and throughput constraints requires careful tuning of the underlying architecture and high-level design tools are gaining increasing acceptance to achieve this goal while decreasing the design time. Most existing tools employ a bottom-to-top methodology, which piece together functional units, interconnect, and control logic based on the given application; this tends to scale poorly. We developed a tool, simulate and eliminate (S&E), that is fundamentally different from the existing high-level design tools as it employs a top-to-bottom methodology. S&E provides automatic generation of a variety of general purpose processing cores with different parameterization options. Then, the provided application(s) are simulated on this general-purpose architecture and the unneeded functionality is eliminated resulting in application specific architecture. S&E generates completely synthesizable hardware description language for an input C and/or MATLAB code. S&E provides different design methods and parameterization options to enable the user to study area and performance tradeoffs over a large number of different architectures and find the optimum architecture for the desired objective.", "paper_title": "Simulate and Eliminate: A Top-to-Bottom Design Methodology for Automatic Generation of Application Specific Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000293709000008"}
