It utilizes the concepts of Augmented Cloud and Agent Platform as a Service (AgPaaS), discussed in the context of Cloud Computing as defined by NIST. The key idea of the presented solution is to span the cloud (i.e. computing infrastructure) beyond the data center borders by utilizing volunteer nodes as computational workers. The feasibility of the approach was demonstrated by a prototype based on Java Applets and Adobe Flash technologies. Selected results from the experiment are discussed in the final part of the paper.", "paper_title": "Agent-based computing in an augmented cloud environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000308440100002"}
