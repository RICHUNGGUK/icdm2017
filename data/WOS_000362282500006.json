In this paper, we consider an important spatial crowdsourcing problem, namely reliable diversity-based spatial crowdsourcing (RDB-SC), in which spatial tasks (such as taking videos/photos of a landmark or firework shows, and checking whether or not parking spaces are available) are time-constrained, and workers are moving towards some directions. Our RDB-SC problem is to assign workers to spatial tasks such that the completion reliability and the spatial/temporal diversities of spatial tasks are maximized. We prove that the RDB-SC problem is NP-hard and intractable. Thus, we propose three effective approximation approaches, including greedy, sampling, and divide-and-conquer algorithms. In order to improve the efficiency, we also design an effective cost-model-based index, which can dynamically maintain moving workers and spatial tasks with low cost, and efficiently facilitate the retrieval of RDB-SC answers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approaches over both real and synthetic datasets.", "paper_title": "Reliable Diversity-Based Spatial Crowdsourcing by Moving Workers", "paper_id": "WOS:000362282500006"}
