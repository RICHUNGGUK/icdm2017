Moreover, a sharpened version of the support inequality is obtained by introducing a generalization of the coherence. In the finite-dimensional case and under certain conditions, minimizers of these inequalities are given. In addition, l(p) norms inequalities are introduced as byproducts of the entropic inequalities.", "paper_title": "Refined Support and Entropic Uncertainty Inequalities", "paper_id": "WOS:000321925900012"}
