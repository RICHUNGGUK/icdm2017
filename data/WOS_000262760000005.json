However, most of these Studies concentrated on how to improve accuracy and efficiency of their methods, and seldom discussed how to detect sequential pattern changes between two time-periods. To help business managers understand the changing behaviors of their customers, a three-phase sequential pattern change detection framework is proposed in this paper. In phase 1, two sequential pattern sets are generated respectively from two time-period databases. in phase II. the dissimilarities between all pairs of sequential patterns are evaluated using the proposed sequential pattern matching algorithm. Based on a set of judgment criteria, a sequential pattern is clarified as one of the following three change types: an emerging sequential pattern. an unexpected sequence change, or an added/perished sequential pattern. In phase III. significant change patterns are returned to managers if the degree of change for a pattern is large enough. A practical transaction database is demonstrated to show how the proposed framework helps managers to analyze their customers and make better marketing strategies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
