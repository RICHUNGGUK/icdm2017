Therefore, an algorithm for script classification and identification is proposed. It creates coded text from initial document. Then, the coded text is subjected to statistical analysis. As a result, the texture feature extraction is carried out. Obtained texture features are used as criteria for script classification and identification. The proposed method is tested on the samples of old Slavic printed documents written in Glagolitic, Cyrillic and Latin script.", "paper_title": "An approach to the script discrimination in the Slavic documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000361728200019"}
