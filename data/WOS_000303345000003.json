The shapes of the probability density histograms suggest a typical Ginzburg-Landau scenario for the phase transition of the model, and estimates of the \"magnetic\" exponent seem to confirm its mean-field critical behavior. We also found that the flipping times between the metastable phases of the model scale exponentially with the system size, signaling the breaking of ergodicity in the thermodynamic limit. Incidentally, we discovered that a closely related model not considered before also displays a phase transition with the same critical behavior as the original model. Our results support the usefulness of off-critical histogram techniques in the investigation of nonequilibrium phase transitions. We also briefly discuss in the appendix a good and simple pseudo-random number generator used in our simulations.", "paper_title": "MEAN-FIELD CRITICAL BEHAVIOR AND ERGODICITY BREAK IN A NONEQUILIBRIUM ONE-DIMENSIONAL RSOS GROWTH MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000303345000003"}
