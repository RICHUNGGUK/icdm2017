Online EM is of particular interest as it is a more practical method for long data sets since in batch EM, or a full Bayesian approach, a complete browse of the data is required between successive parameter updates. Online EM is also suited to MTT applications that demand real-time processing of the data. Performance is assessed in numerical examples using simulated data for various scenarios. For batch estimation our method significantly outperforms an existing gradient based maximum likelihood technique, which we show to be significantly biased.", "paper_title": "Calibrating the Gaussian multi-target tracking model", "paper_id": "WOS:000352705000007"}
