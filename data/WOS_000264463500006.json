In this paper, we formulate an integrated multistage logistics network model with considering the direct shipment and direct delivery of logistics and inventory. In addition, we propose an effective hybrid evolutionary algorithm (hEA) to solve this problem: (1) we employ an extended priority-based encoding method, (2) combine a local search (LS) technique and (3) proposed a new fuzzy logic control (FLC) to enhance the search ability of EA. Finally, numerical analysis of case study is carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
