They argued that their simple three-party PAKE (3-PAKE) protocol can resist against various known attacks. In this paper, we show that this protocol is vulnerable to a kind of man-in-the-middle attack that exploits an authentication flaw in their protocol and is subject to the undetectable on-line dictionary attack. We also conduct a detailed analysis on the flaws in the protocol and provide an improved protocol. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
