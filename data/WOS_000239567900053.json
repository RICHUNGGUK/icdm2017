This paper presents an efficient and robust algorithm to find and highlight the mold-piece regions on a part. The algorithm can be executed on current-generation computer graphics hardware. The complexity of the algorithm solely depends on the time to render the given part. By using a system that can quickly find various mold-piece regions on a part, designers can easily optimize the part and mold design and if needed make appropriate corrections upfront, streamlining the subsequent design steps.", "paper_title": "Finding mold-piece regions using computer graphics hardware", "paper_id": "WOS:000239567900053"}
