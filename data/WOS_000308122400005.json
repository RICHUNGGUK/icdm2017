In order to reduce cruise drag, a promising method is under consideration by adjusting, or rather morphing the rear part of the aircraft's wing during cruise flight. Given the premature state of knowledge of such a design implementation, a knowledge-based computational framework is developed. The purpose of this framework is to allow for an aerodynamic optimization of a section of the wing. The framework is set up in such a way that all relevant design knowledge generated in the process can be captured and used in a subsequent mechanical design process. In this fashion, the complex design process of a novel morphing wing device can be automated to a certain degree. This automation can be used to construct a large number of different feasible and optimized designs with varying boundary conditions of a complex experimental device. This article describes the initial 2-dimensional aerodynamic design step of the morphing device under consideration and how it is implemented in a knowledge-based optimization framework. It describes the initial stage of the development of this tool, as it will be expanded by a number of design steps that each adds more detail to the design in all relevant aspect fields (aerodynamic, structural, actuation, etc.). Ultimately, this tool will be used to obtain a thorough evaluation of a number of different proposed structural solutions and allow for a comparison between them. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
