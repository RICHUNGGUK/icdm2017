In view of the NP-hard nature of the problem, neighborhood properties of the problem are investigated. It is found that the traditional move-based neighborhood is inefficient to search. Then a new neighborhood, which is based on batch destruction and construction. is developed. A simulated annealing algorithm with the new neighborhood is proposed. Experiments are carried out on the randomly generated problems and the real-life instances from a factory in China. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain better near optimal solutions than the existing algorithm. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
