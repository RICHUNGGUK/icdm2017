We assume that, the outcomes of opinion dynamics on the behavior of asymptomatically infected individuals who have known their infected state, could not only reduce their transmission probabilities, but also could increase their transmission probabilities. This assumption has rarely been considered for modeling the interactions among epidemic dynamics, opinion dynamics and the exchange of human behaviors. We find that when the epidemic-related opinion dynamics exist, a higher randomness of individuals will simultaneously lead to a higher prevalence of infectious diseases and a lower social discrimination perceived by infected individuals. Furthermore, if the positive external global impact exceeds a certain critical value, there is an abrupt disappearance of infection owing to the contribution of opinion dynamics. Based on our results, some suggestions are given to reduce the spreading of epidemic diseases.", "paper_title": "The Impact of Discrimination on the Spread of Infectious Diseases in Complex Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000341370700002"}
