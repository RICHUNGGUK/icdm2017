Three chromosomes are used to codify an individual in the population. The first and second chromosomes locate and quantify damage, respectively. The third permits the self-adaptation of the genetic parameters. The natural frequencies and mode shapes are used to formulate the objective function. A numerical analysis was performed for several truss structures under different damage scenarios. The results have shown that the methodology can reliably identify damage scenarios using noisy measurements and that it results in only a few misidentified elements.
