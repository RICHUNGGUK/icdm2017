In this paper, we present a new neural network approach, which is called an algorithm learning based neural network (ALBNN), to improve classification accuracy by integrating feature selection and classification procedures. In general, a knowledge-based artificial neural network operates on prior knowledge from domain experience, which provides it with better starting points for the target function and leads to better classification accuracy. However, prior knowledge is usually difficult to identify. Instead of using unknown background resources, the proposed method utilizes prior knowledge that is mathematically calculated from the properties of other learning algorithms such as PCA, LARS, C4.5, and SVM. We employ the extreme learning machine in this study to help obtain better initial points faster and avoid irrelevant time-consuming work, such as determining architecture and manual tuning. ALBNN correctly approximates a target hypothesis by both considering the interaction between two procedures and minimizing individual procedure errors. The approach produces new relevant features and improves the classification accuracy. Experimental results exhibit improved performance in various classification problems. ALBNN can be applied to various fields requiring high classification accuracy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
