Mining models are developed by the use of comparable analytical methods. Performance of prediction models is estimated by cross validation consisting of holding a fraction of observations out as a test set. The derived results show the high accuracy and reliability of these techniques in predicting low-energy comfortable rooms. The results are extended to show the benefits of these techniques in optimizing a building's four basic elements (structure, systems, services and management) and the interrelationships between them. These techniques extend and enhance, current methodologies, to simplify modeling interior daylight and thermal comfort, to further assist building energy management decision-making.
