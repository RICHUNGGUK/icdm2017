The identification procedure is based on minimizing the model error over a given training data set subject to an incremental stability constraint, which is formulated as a semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical results are presented for several analog circuits, including a distributed power amplifier, as well as a MEM device. It is also shown that our dynamical models can accurately predict important circuit performance metrics, and may thus, be useful for design optimization of analog systems.", "paper_title": "Compact Modeling of Nonlinear Analog Circuits Using System Identification via Semidefinite Programming and Incremental Stability Certification", "paper_id": "WOS:000282543700001"}
