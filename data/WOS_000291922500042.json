We assume that the distribution of bursts is invariant under cyclic shifts and that the burst-length statistics are known. In analogy with rate-distortion theory, we wish to find frames of a given size, which minimize the mean-square reconstruction error for the encoding of vectors in a complex finite-dimensional Hilbert space. We obtain an upper bound for the mean-square reconstruction error for a given Parseval frame and in the case of cyclic Parseval frames, we find a family of frames which minimizes this upper bound. Under certain conditions, these minimizers are identical to complex Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes discussed in the literature. The accuracy of our upper bounds for the mean-square error is substantiated by complementary lower bounds. All estimates are based on convexity arguments and a discrete rearrangement inequality.", "paper_title": "Burst Erasures and the Mean-Square Error for Cyclic Parseval Frames", "paper_id": "WOS:000291922500042"}
