The design of the feedback control uses an optimal control approach that minimizes the peak deceleration of anthropogenic CO(2) emissions whilst avoiding overshooting the 2 degrees C target. The peak value for emissions deceleration that satisfies the closed-loop optimization was found to be linearly related to climate sensitivity and a climate sensitivity of 3.5 degrees C gave a deceleration of - 1.9 GtC/a/20 years(2). In addition to accounting for the predicted climate dynamics, the control system design includes a facility to emulate a robust corrective action in the face of uncertainty. The behavior of the overall control action is evaluated using an uncertainty scenario for climate model equilibrium sensitivity. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
