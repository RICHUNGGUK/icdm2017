Static timing analysis derives bounds on WCETs but requires statically known loop bounds. This work removes the constraint on known loop bounds through parametric analysis expressing WCETs as functions. Tighter WCETs are dynamically discovered to exploit slack by dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) saving 60% to 82% energy over DVS-oblivious techniques and showing savings close to more costly dynamic-priority DVS algorithms. Overall, parametric analysis expands the class of real-time applications to programs with loop-invariant dynamic loop bounds while retaining tight WCET bounds.", "paper_title": "Parametric Timing Analysis and Its Application to Dynamic Voltage Scaling", "paper_id": "WOS:000285875500011"}
