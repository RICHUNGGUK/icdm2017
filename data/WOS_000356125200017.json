Firstly, two novel concepts, variation and local variance variation based on an adaptive analysis are introduced. They are calculated based on the error projection matrix in the back projection process. Secondly, a restraint item is adopted to constrain the back projection matrix. Thirdly, a modified iterative scheme is used to reconstruct the high resolution image. The effectiveness of the proposed approach on ringing artifacts suppression is demonstrated by experiments. The results indicate that the proposed method can achieve satisfactory performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
