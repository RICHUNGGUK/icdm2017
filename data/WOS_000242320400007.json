It is proved that some known families of snarks have no (orientable) polyhedral embeddings. This result supports a conjecture of Grunbaum that no snark admits an orientable polyhedral embedding. This conjecture is verified by computer for all snarks having fewer than 30 vertices. On the other hand, for every non-orientable surface S, there exists a non-3-edge-colourable graph which polyhedrally embeds in S.", "paper_title": "On polyhedral embeddings of cubic graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000242320400007"}
