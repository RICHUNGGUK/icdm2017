The brand promoting the event and its sponsors can obtain various benefits in the form of brand image, personality and notoriety. The main aim of this research is to evaluate the effects that experiencing an event has on experience with the promoting brand. Design/methodology/approach - The study analysed the musical event MTV Winter Festival 2010, considering the opinion of 127 attendees to discover the impact of experiencing the MTV entertainment television channel event in three areas: improved brand experience, improved brand personality and increased brand reputation. EQS was used to test the proposed model. Findings - Regarding event experience antecedents, \"immersion\" has been identified as the most important one and brand experience as an important effect. Also, brand experience has been found to have a positive impact on exciting brand personality and exciting brand personality in turn on brand reputation. Originality/value - Although two of the hypotheses on the antecedents of emotional event experience (\"surprise\" and \"participation\") were not confirmed, it can be said that progress has been made on the benefits of marketing experiences since this is the first empirical investigation to deal with the connection of event-brand experiences in the area of the arts.", "paper_title": "Event-brand transfer in an entertainment service: experiential marketing", "paper_id": "WOS:000319640600006"}
