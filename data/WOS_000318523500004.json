Herein, we employ: adaptive filtering for removing nonstationary PN; random variables (RV) coefficient for FC analysis. Comparisons with standard techniques were performed by quantifying PN filtering and FC in neural vs. non-neural regions. As a result, adaptive filtering plus RV coefficient showed a greater suppression of PN and higher connectivity in neural regions, representing a novel effective approach to analyze fMRI data.", "paper_title": "ADAPTIVE FILTERING AND RANDOM VARIABLES COEFFICIENT FOR ANALYZING FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING DATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000318523500004"}
