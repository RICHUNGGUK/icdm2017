However, some barriers such as price of chipset and RFID user information privacy protection exist in widely using it in public. So, recently time-memory trade-off was disclosed to reduce the amount of calculation with user's information privacy protecting scheme utilizing hash-chain, meeting indistinguishable forward security. However, it requires a long pre-calculation time, causing the problem of scalability. In this paper, we propose scheme (RHDP: Real-time Hash-chain Decreasing Pre-calculation) to reduce pre-calculation time that is the biggest problem in time-memory trade-off. The proposed scheme can shorten the authentication time and improve its scalability and efficiency of RFID.", "paper_title": "RHDP-scheme for RFID's efficiency improvement on the ubiquitous computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400137"}
