Current approaches using decomposition and analysis of isolated subproblems could lead to suboptimization. We develop a framework for integrated design that combines analytical modeling with embedded simulations for large-scale infrastructure planning. The framework uses problem decomposition and a guided simulation methodology, which uses concepts of extrinsic and intrinsic guidance. These are integrated in a comprehensive framework and used to interlink the subproblems and guide the design process towards achieving overall objectives concurrently. A case study demonstrates viability of the framework. The methodology is efficient and flexible, and can be adapted for other problems where resource sharing and integrated system design is critical.", "paper_title": "A decomposition and guided simulation methodology for large-scale system design: A study in QoS-Capable intranets with fixed and mobile components", "paper_id": "WOS:000248990800011"}
