One example of an 12 binding site characterized by binding studies, kinetics, and crystal structure has been described in monoamine oxidase B (MAO B). MAO A also binds imidazolines but has a different active site structure. Docking and molecular dynamics were used to explore how 2-(2-benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline hydrochloride (2-BFI) binds to MAO A and to explain why tranylcypromine increases tight binding to MAO B. The energy for 2-BFI binding to MAO A was comparable to that for tranylcypromine-modified MAO B, but the location of 2-BFI in the MAO A could be anywhere in the monopartite substrate cavity. Binding to the tranylc-ypromine-modified MAO B was with high affinity and in the entrance cavity as in the crystal structure, but the energies of interaction with the native MAO B were less favorable. Molecular dynamics revealed that the entrance cavity of MAO B after tranylcypromine modification is both smaller and less flexible. This change in the presence of tranylcypromine may be responsible for the greater affinity of tranylcypromine-modified MAO B for imidazoline ligands.", "paper_title": "Computational Comparison of Imidazoline Association with the 12 Binding Site in Human Monoamine Oxidases", "paper_id": "WOS:000335201200017"}
