Based on these three Parts, we Construct a multiple description encoder with three channels The successful application of the reshaped redundancy gets high compression efficiency and keeps the structure Character of the original image. To evaluate the performance: we apply our method to image communication we compare our algorithm with several traditional methods under the assumptions that there is at least one channel that can always be trusted Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "SPIHT AND ODD-EVEN ESTIMATION BASED MDC ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000275767800021"}
