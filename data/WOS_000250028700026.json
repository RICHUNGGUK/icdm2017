A minutiae matching algorithm has to solve two problems: correspondence and similarity computation. For the correspondence problem, we assign each minutia two descriptors: texture-based and minutiae-based descriptors, and use an alignment-based greedy matching algorithm to establish the correspondences between minutiae. For the similarity computation, we extract a 17-D feature vector from the matching result, and convert the feature vector into a matching score using support vector classifier. The proposed algorithm is tested on FVC2002 databases and compared to all participators in FVC2002. According to equal error rate, the proposed algorithm ranks 1st on DB3, the most difficult database in FVC2002, and on the average ranks 2nd on all 4 databases. (C) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society.
