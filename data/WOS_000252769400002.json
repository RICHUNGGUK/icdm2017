They optimize over the first Chvatal closure by modeling the Chvatal-Gomory (CG) separation problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) which is then solved by a general- purpose MILP solver. Unfortunately, this approach does not extend immediately to the Gomory mixed integer (GMI) closure of an MILP, since the GMI separation problem involves the solution of a nonlinear mixed integer program or a parametric MILP. In this paper we introduce a projected version of the CG cuts, and study their practical effectiveness for MILP problems. The idea is to project first the linear programming relaxation of the MILP at hand onto the space of the integer variables, and then to derive Chvatal-Gomory cuts for the projected polyhedron. Though theoretically dominated by GMI cuts, projected CG cuts have the advantage of producing a separation model very similar to the one introduced by Fischetti and Lodi, which can typically be solved in a reasonable amount of computing time.", "paper_title": "Projected Chvatal-Gomory cuts for mixed integer linear programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000252769400002"}
