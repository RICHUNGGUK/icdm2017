To optimally manage numerous production and transportation decisions, a novel monolithic continuous-time MILP-based framework is developed to determine the best short-term operational planning to meet all customer requests at minimum total cost. The formulation lies on the unit-specific general precedence concept for the production scheduling problem whereas the immediate precedence notion is used for transportation decisions. To illustrate the applicability and potential benefits of the model, a challenging example corresponding to a supply chain comprising several locations geographically spread in six European countries has been solved to optimality with modest CPU times. Several scenarios with different logistics features were addressed in order to remark the significant advantages of using the integrated approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
