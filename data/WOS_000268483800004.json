Various solutions to this problem have been proposed which, apart from their offered advantages, suffer the following disadvantages: (i) most of them are syntactic-based, leading to poor precision and recall, (ii) they are not scalable to large numbers of services, and (iii) they are incompatible, thus yielding in cumbersome service publication and discovery. This article presents the principles, the functionality, and the design of PYRAMID-S which addresses these disadvantages by providing a scalable framework for unified publication and discovery of semantically enhanced services over heterogeneous registries. PYRAMID-S uses a hybrid peer-to-peer topology to organize Web service registries based on domains. In such a topology, each Registry retains its autonomy, meaning that it can use the publication and discovery mechanisms as well as the ontology of its choice. The viability of this approach is demonstrated through the implementation and experimental analysis of a prototype.", "paper_title": "Unified Publication and Discovery of Semantic Web Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000268483800004"}
