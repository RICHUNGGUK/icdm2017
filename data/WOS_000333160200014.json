Regular inductive-iris filters in SIW technology are supplemented with H-plane frequency-dependent inverters which not only create transmission zeros but also serve as the proper impedance inverter. A synthesis technique is introduced to prescribe transmission zeros at finite frequencies on either side of the pass band, symmetrically or asymmetrically. Two different topologies of frequency-dependent inverters for X-band SIW band pass filters demonstrate that attenuation poles can be created on both side of the passband and significantly improve the filters' stop-band performences. Measurements confirm the validity of the presented design approach. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
