The authors reported that their method was Suitable to run the Navier-Stokes equations efficiently oil non-matching and overlapping block-structured meshes. However, there was a problem of mass conservation and a discontinuity of pressure through the interfaces in some cases. In the present paper, an improvement of the method based on a pressure correction scheme is proposed. With this improvement, the pressure is continuous through the interfaces and the incompressibility constraint is ensured over the whole domain. Several numerical tests were carried out to assess the proposed method.
