We prove that for a fixed H, every graph excluding H as a topological subgraph has a tree decomposition where each part is either \"almost embeddable\" to a fixed surface or has bounded degree with the exception of a bounded number of vertices. Furthermore, we prove that such a decomposition is computable by an algorithm that is fixed-parameter tractable with parameter vertical bar H vertical bar. We present two algorithmic applications of our structure theorem. To illustrate the mechanics of a \"typical\" application of the structure theorem, we show that on graphs excluding H as a topological subgraph, Partial Dominating Set (find k vertices whose closed neighborhood has maximum size) can be solved in time f(H, k) . n(O)(1). More significantly, we show that on graphs excluding H as a topological subgraph, Graph Isomorphism can be solved in time n(f(H)). This result unifies and generalizes two previously known important polynomial time solvable cases of Graph Isomorphism: bounded-degree graphs [E. M. Luks, J. Comput. System Sci., 25 (1982), pp. 42-65] and H-minor free graphs [I. N. Ponomarenko, Zap. Nauchn. Sem. Leningrad. Otdel. Mat. Inst. Steklov. (LOMI), 174 (1988), pp. 147-177, 182]. The proof of this result needs a generalization of our structure theorem to the context of invariant treelike decomposition.", "paper_title": "STRUCTURE THEOREM AND ISOMORPHISM TEST FOR GRAPHS WITH EXCLUDED TOPOLOGICAL SUBGRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000353967100005"}
