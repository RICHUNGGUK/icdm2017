These codes were first studied by Levenshtein in 1964, motivated by applications in synchronization. More recently these codes were independently invented (under the name cross-bifix-free codes) by Bajic and Stojanovic. We provide a simple construction for a class of non-overlapping codes which has optimal cardinality whenever n divides q. Moreover, for all parameters n and q, we show that a code from this class is close to optimal, in the sense that it has cardinality within a constant factor of an upper bound due to Levenshtein from 1970. Previous constructions have cardinality within a constant factor of the upper bound only when q is fixed. Chee, Kiah, Purkayastha, and Wang showed that a q-ary length n non-overlapping code contains at most q(n)/(2n-1) codewords; this bound is weaker than the Levenshtein bound. Their proof appealed to the application in synchronization: we provide a direct combinatorial argument to establish the bound of Chee et al. We also consider codes of short length, finding the leading term of the maximal cardinality of a non-overlapping code when n is fixed and q ->infinity. The largest cardinality of non-overlapping codes of lengths 3 or less is determined exactly.", "paper_title": "Non-Overlapping Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000360015900022"}
