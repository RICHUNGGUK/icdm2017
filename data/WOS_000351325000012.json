Secret message M can be held by n participants to avoid the secret from incidentally or intentionally being lost. In a secret sharing scheme, secret information leaks from shadows, attack on shadow image, and large shadow image issues which has arisen when developing an algorithm. Although existing algorithms provide remedies for such problems, the computational complexity of existing algorithms is still questionable. Therefore, we propose a low computational complexity Quadri-Directional Searching Algorithm (QDSA) for secret image sharing. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm ensures that generated shares are of high quality and no secret information is leaked from these shares, thus it guarantees high security of our scheme.
