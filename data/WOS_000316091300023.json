If PEVs were allowed to charge simultaneously at the maximum power rate, the distribution grid would face serious problems of stability. Therefore, mechanisms are needed to coordinate various PEVs that charge simultaneously. In this paper we propose an allocation mechanism that aims at balancing allocative efficiency and fairness, providing preferential treatment to the PEVs that have a high valuation of the available power, while guaranteeing a fair share of this power to all the PEVs.
