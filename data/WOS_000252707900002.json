The model is given by the stochastic differential equation (M2) or equivalently by the ordinary differential equation (M3) whose coefficients depend on the size Nt. Theorems on a unique strong and weak existence of the solution to (M2) are proved and computer simulations performed.", "paper_title": "Kermack-McKendrick epidemic model revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000252707900002"}
