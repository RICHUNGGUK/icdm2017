In our model, the data schema is an acyclic graph with a single root, and data analysis queries are formulated using paths starting at the root. The root models the objects of an application and the remaining nodes model attributes of the objects. Our objective is to use this model as a simple interface for the analyst to formulate queries, and then map the queries to a commercially available system for the actual evaluation.", "paper_title": "A functional model for data analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575000005"}
