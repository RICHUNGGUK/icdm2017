This led us to fabricate stubs and interdigital capacitors with ferroelectric materials so as to use them as basic circuits in loaded structures for further investigations about their behavior at microwave frequencies. This study was aimed at assessing topologies to find the one the most able to take benefit of the agility provided by the ferroelectric material.
