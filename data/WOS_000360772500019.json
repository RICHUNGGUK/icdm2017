They enable the evaluation of system behavior according to the design requirements and ensure their correctness before any implementation. Due to the difficulty of analyzing, modeling and verifying these large scale systems, we introduce a novel verification framework based on PRISM probabilistic model checker that takes the SysML activity diagram as input and produce their equivalent timed probabilistic automata that is/are expressed in PRISM language. To check the functional correctness of the system under test, the properties are expressed in PCTL temporal logic. To prove the soundness of our mapping approach, we capture the underlying semantics of both the SysML activity diagrams and their generated PRISM code. We found that the timed probabilistic equivalence relation between both semantics preserve the satisfaction of the system requirements. We present digital camera as case study to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach and to demonstrate its efficiency by analyzing a performability properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
