Two solutions for the interface layer between the existing deck plate and the second steel plate are presented: thin epoxy (bonded system) and thick polyurethane (sandwich system). A parametric study based on analytical solutions is carried out on flexural behavior of beams representing the renovation solutions. The influence of geometrical, mechanical and structural parameters on the stiffness and stress reduction factor of the system is studied. Maximum values of stiffness and stress reduction are achieved when maximizing the interface layer thickness and minimizing the second steel plate thickness with in certain practical limits. Based on the weight restrictions one can choose the most efficient interface layer regarding thickness and mechanical properties.", "paper_title": "Parametric Study on the Interface Layer of Renovation Solutions for Orthotropic Steel Bridge Decks", "paper_id": "WOS:000298875500005"}
