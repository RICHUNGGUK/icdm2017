A Virtex-II-style two-dimensional (2-D) FPGA fabric is used as a baseline architecture to quantify the relative improvements in logic density, delay, and power consumption achieved by such a 3-D FPGA. It is assumed that only the switch transistor and configuration memory cells can be moved to the top layers and that the 3-D FPGA employs the same LB and programmable interconnect architecture as the baseline 2-D FPGA. Assuming they are <= 0.7, the area of a static random-access memory cell and switch transistors having the same characteristics as n-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor devices in the CMOS layer are used. It is shown that a monolithically stacked 3-D FPGA can achieve 3.2 times higher logic density, 1.7 times lower critical path delay, and 1.7 times lower total dynamic power consumption than the baseline 2-D FPGA fabricated in the same 65-mn technology node.", "paper_title": "Performance benefits of monolithically stacked 3-D FPGA", "paper_id": "WOS:000243953000003"}
