Fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering has also been successfully applied in several image segmentation applications. In this paper, we combine the benefits of these two approaches, by proposing a novel treatment of HMRF models, formulated on the basis of a fuzzy clustering principle. We approach the HMRF model treatment problem as an FCM-type clustering problem, effected by introducing the explicit assumptions of the HMRF model into the fuzzy clustering procedure. Our approach utilizes a fuzzy objective function regularized by Kullback-Leibler divergence information, and is facilitated by application of a mean-field-like approximation of the MRF prior. We experimentally demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over competing methodologies, considering a series of synthetic and real-world image segmentation applications.", "paper_title": "A Fuzzy Clustering Approach Toward Hidden Markov Random Field Models for Enhanced Spatially Constrained Image Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000260046700019"}
