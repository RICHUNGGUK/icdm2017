In this model, the project owner is considered to be the leader and the contractor, the follower. The project owner has two objectives: 1) to maximize profit and 2) minimize makespan, while the contractor's objective is to minimize cost only. A fuzzy random simulation-based bilevel global-local-neighbor particle swarm optimization technique is proposed to solve the multiple decision-maker PSP (MDPSP). A case study based on the Wanjiakouzi Hydropower Station is used to demonstrate an application of the developed model and illustrate the scope of the MDPSP.", "paper_title": "A Bilevel Model for Project Scheduling in a Fuzzy Random Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000361751100003"}
