The prior is defined as a stationary intrinsic Gaussian Markov random field on a toroidal graph, which enables efficient computation of the relevant posterior marginals. Hence the method is applicable to large images produced by modern digital cameras. The technique is demonstrated in two examples from medical imaging. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
