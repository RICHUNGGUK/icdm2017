However, the high amount of paste will limit the volume fractions of coarse aggregate, and reduce the tendency of coarse aggregate to suppress drying shrinkage deformations. For this reason, SCC tends to produce higher values of drying shrinkage than NC for the most part. In order to assess the drying shrinkage of SCC quantitatively for application to offshore caisson foundations, the formulas presented in the literatures (ACI 209 and CEB-FIP) are used to predict the values of drying shrinkage in SCC according to the corresponding mix proportions. Additionally, a finite element (FE) model, which assumes concrete to be a homogeneous and isotropic material and follows the actual size and environmental conditions of the caisson, is utilized to simulate stress distribution situations and deformations in the SCC caisson resulting from the drying shrinkage. The probability of cracking and the behavior of drying shrinkage of the SCC caisson are drawn from the analytic results calculated by the FE model proposed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Numerical modeling of drying shrinkage behavior of self-compacting concrete", "paper_id": "WOS:000263851400001"}
