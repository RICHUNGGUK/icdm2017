Owing to the fact that Strong online banking services are important drivers for bank performance and customer service delivery; several studies have been carried out on online banking service adoption or acceptance where services are already deployed and on the factors that influence customers' adoption and use or intention to use those services. However, despite the increasing discussion in the literatures, no attempt has been made to look at consumers' preference in terms of future online banking service adoption. This study used conjoint analysis and stated preference methods with discrete choice model to analyze the technology adoption pattern regarding consumers' preference for potential future online banking services in the Nigerian banking industry. The result revealed that to increase efficiency and strengthen competitiveness, banks need to promote smart and practical branded services especially self-services at the same time promote a universal adoption of e-banking system services that add entertainment or extra convenience to customers such as ease of usage including digital wallet, real-time interaction (video banking), ATMs integrated with smart phones, website customization, biometric services, and digital currency. These services can contribute to an increasing adoption of online services. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
