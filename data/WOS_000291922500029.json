For line networks, the capacity region of the general multiple multicast problem is established. The coding theorem is based on a binary linear coding scheme, while the converse requires new upper bounds that improve on standard cut-based bounds. For star networks, the multiple unicast problem is examined. Capacity upper bounds are derived and a simple linear coding scheme is proposed which is based on the combinatorial optimization problem of cycle packing in directed graphs. The optimality of this scheme is established for a broad class of demands. The connection of node-constrained network coding in star networks, and index coding with side information is discussed and used to partially characterize the optimal linear code for general rates.", "paper_title": "Network Coding in Node-Constrained Line and Star Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000291922500029"}
