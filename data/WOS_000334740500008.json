Recently, the protocol has been selected as the standard in several network scenarios such as the Internet of Things and machine-to-machine communications, among others. However, the lack of open source implementations of the standard does not facilitate the testing and deployment of the protocol in different network scenarios, which may hinder its broader expansion and adoption. In this article, we present OpenPANA, our open source contribution, which implements the standard PANA. We describe the design and implementation decisions around OpenPANA so that they can help other developers to create their own implementations. We also show different usage scenarios where the implementation has been considered and used. Finally, we provide performance results and an interoperability test that we have performed with CPANA, the other active open source implementation.", "paper_title": "An Open Source Implementation of the Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access: OpenPANA", "paper_id": "WOS:000334740500008"}
