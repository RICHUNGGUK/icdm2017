Methods: The narrative nursing notes of 427 intensive-care patients who were discharged in 2007 that were documented at the point-of-care using standardized nursing statements were extracted from a clinical data repository at a teaching hospital in Korea and analyzed. The frequencies of five nursing interventions for pressure-ulcer prevention were compared between pressure-ulcer and pressure-ulcer risk groups, as were the characteristics of the nurses who were treating the patients in these two groups. Nursing interventions for pressure-ulcer prevention were also assessed relative to the patients' medical problems. Results: The overall incidence of pressure ulcers was 15.0%. Position change was the most popular nursing intervention provided for pressure-ulcer prevention in both the pressure-ulcer and at-risk groups, followed by skin care. There was a statistically significant tendency toward a greater frequency of providing skin care and nutritional care in the at-risk group than in the pressure-ulcer group. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean frequencies of nursing interventions relative to the patients' medical problems in the pressure-ulcer group. However, frequencies of nursing interventions did differ significantly between patients with neurological problems and those with other medical problems in the at-risk group. Analysis of the nurses' characteristics revealed that more nursing interventions were documented by those who were younger, less experienced, and more educated. Conclusion: A standardized nursing-terminology-based electronic nursing record system allowed us to monitor the variations in nursing practice with regard to preventive pressure-ulcer care in intensive-care patients with and at risk of pressure ulcers. We found that pressure-ulcer prevention care was provided at frequencies much lower than the recommended guidelines. Further studies on identifying the factors affecting pressure-ulcer prevention care and ways to improve the quality of that care are needed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
