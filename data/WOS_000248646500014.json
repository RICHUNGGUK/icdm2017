The main receptors involved in the RAS are the Angiotensin type-I (AT,) and type-2 (AT(2)) receptors, which are both activated by the endogepnous octapeptide angiotensin II (AngII). This study describes the development of 3D-QSAR models for AT, and AT, receptor affinity and AT(1)/AT(2) receptor selectivity using CoMFA. A data set of 244 compounds, based on the triazolinone and quinazolinone structural classes was compiled from the literature. Before CoMFA could be performed, an alignment rule for the two structural classes was defined using the phari-nacophore-searching program DISCOtech. Models were validated using a test set obtained by dividing the data set into a training set and test set using hierarchical clustering, based on the CoMFA fields, AT(1)-, AT(2)-receptor affinities, and AT(1)/AT(2) selectivity values. Predictive models with good statistics could be developed both for AT(1) and AT(2) receptor affinity as well as selectivity towards these receptors. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
