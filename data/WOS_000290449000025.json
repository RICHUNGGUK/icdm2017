Using a feature selection method with the computational architecture of the cross-entropy method [16], including an additional preliminary step ensuring a lower bound on the number of times any feature is considered, we show when testing on a human lymph node data set that there are a significant number of genes that perform well when their complementary power is assessed, but \"pass under the radar\" of popular feature selection methods that only assess genes individually on a given classification tool. We also show that this phenomenon becomes more apparent as diagnostic specificity of the tissue samples analysed increases.", "paper_title": "Two-Step Cross-Entropy Feature Selection for Microarrays-Power Through Complementarity", "paper_id": "WOS:000290449000025"}
