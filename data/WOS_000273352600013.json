They are highly nonlinear, quite complex and complicated. While applying neural network in such complicated problems, epoch determination is based on hit-and-trail basis mainly. In this paper, the effect of different number of epochs is shown on the network and a method is proposed to determine the optimum number of epoch with the help of self-organized map (SOM) to avoid overtraining of the network. Data distribution is also done with the help of SOM and a statistical analysis is made to show consistency between training and testing dataset for ensuring the optimal model performance.", "paper_title": "Epoch determination for neural network by self-organized map (SOM)", "paper_id": "WOS:000273352600013"}
