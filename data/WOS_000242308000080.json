Smoothing splines are used to map the locally-coordinatized data points into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality. In this work setting, we can achieve two goals. First, a global embedding is obtained by minimizing the low-dimensional coordinate reconstruction error. Second, the NLDR algorithm can be naturally extended to deal with out-of-sample data points. Experimental results illustrate the validity of our method.", "paper_title": "Spline embedding for nonlinear dimensionality reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000242308000080"}
