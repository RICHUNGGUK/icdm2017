In this paper, a Multi-Devices Synergy problem is proposed with ubiquitous service model and network model. And then dimensionless processing method with multi-attribute decision making is proposed to deal with different users' requirements. In addition, a service-oriented synergy approach among multi-devices is proposed to support three processes, including service requesting, multi-devices synergy set selecting and quality maintenance. At last, the simulation is implemented with OPNET and MATLAB and the result shows this mechanism is better applied to support complex ubiquitous services.", "paper_title": "Service-Oriented Synergy Mechanism Among Multi-Devices in Ubiquitous Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000344445900007"}
