In this paper, we address three relevant security issues: template re-issuances, also called cancellable biometrics,(1) replay attacks, and database attacks. We propose to use a random orientation filter bank (ROFB) as a feature extractor to generate noise-like feature codes, called Competitive Codes for templates re-issuances. Secret messages are hidden in templates to prevent replay and database attacks. This technique can be regarded as template watermarking. A series of analyses is provided to evaluate the security levels of the measures. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
