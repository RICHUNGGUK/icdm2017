Design/methodology/approach - A new flux-controllable stator-PMBL motor with skewed rotor is presented. The key of the proposed motor is to incorporate both direct current field windings and permanent magnets in the stator. By using a 2D multi-slice finite element model, the electromagnetic performances such as flux linkage, self-inductance and back-EMF are obtained. To minimize the torque ripple, a vector control strategy is applied to the stator-PMBL motor drive for the first time. Findings - Some encouraging experimental results such as lower torque ripple and faster speed transients are achieved. It is shown that the three-phase flux-controllable stator-PMBL motor, when properly designed and controlled, is an interesting candidate for traction drive systems especially for electrical vehicle operation. Originality/value - The control method can also contribute the other type of stator-PMBL machines to realize the low torque ripple.", "paper_title": "Electromagnetic performance analysis and vector control of a flux-controllable stator-permanent-magnet brushless motor with skewed rotor", "paper_id": "WOS:000288567800005"}
