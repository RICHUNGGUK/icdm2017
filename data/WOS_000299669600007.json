A combination of sophisticated inertial sensing, wireless communication and signal processing technologies has made such a pervasive and remote monitoring possible. Due to the nature of the sensing and communication mechanisms, these monitoring sensors are susceptible to errors and failures. In this paper, we address the issue of identifying and isolating faulty sensors in a Body Sensor Network that is used for remote monitoring of daily living activities. We identify three different types of faults in a Body Sensor Network and propose fault isolation strategies using history-based and non-history based approaches. The contributions of this paper are: (i) faulty sensor node identification in a small number of deployed body sensors (accelerometers); and (ii) identification of a faulty sensor node using a statically or dynamically bound group of sensor nodes that is sharing similar sensor signal patterns.
