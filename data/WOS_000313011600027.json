A set of locations is provided and a score is collected from the visit to each location. The objective is to maximize the total score given a fixed time limit for each available tour. Given the computational complexity of this problem, a multi-start simulated annealing (MSA) algorithm which combines a simulated annealing (SA) based meta-heuristic with a multi-start hill climbing strategy is proposed to solve TOP. To verify the developed MSA algorithm, computational experiments are performed on well-known benchmark problems involving numbers of locations ranging between 42 and 102. The experimental results demonstrate that the multi-start hill climbing strategy can significantly improve the performance of the traditional single-start SA. Meanwhile, the proposed MSA algorithm is highly effective compared to the state-of-the-art meta-heuristics on the same benchmark instances. The proposed MSA algorithm obtained 135 best solutions to the 157 benchmark problems, including five new best solutions. In terms of both solution quality and computational expense, this study successfully constructs a high-performance method for solving this challenging problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
