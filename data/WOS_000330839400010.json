For this purpose, we have defined a simple non-stationary MRF model with long-range pairwise interactions whose potentials are estimated from the likelihood of the presence of an edge at each considered pair of pixels. Another contribution of this paper is also to demonstrate that an efficient and interesting alternative strategy to complex and elaborate region-based segmentation models consists in averaging several (quickly estimated) soft contour maps (obtained, for example, with simpler edge-based segmentation models) and to use this MRF reconstruction model to achieve a reliable and accurate segmentation map into regions. This model has been successfully applied on the Berkeley image database. The experiments reported in this paper demonstrate that the proposed segmentation model from an edge map is reliable and that this segmentation strategy is efficient (in terms of visual evaluation and quantitative performance measures) and performs well compared with the best existing state-of-the-art segmentation methods recently proposed in the literature.", "paper_title": "A non-stationary MRF model for image segmentation from a soft boundary map", "paper_id": "WOS:000330839400010"}
