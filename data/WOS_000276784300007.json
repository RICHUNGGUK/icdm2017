Quadratic treatment of the boundary conditions is shown to be necessary to obtain uniform error of O(Delta(2)) This contrasts with the Dirichlet case where both quadratic and linear treatments give O(Delta(2)) error, although the coefficient of error may be much larger for the linear case Explicit error estimates demonstrating this behaviour are found for the ID case with similar behaviour found in 2D and 3D numerical examples. Finally, the extension of this approach to the N-dimensional case is given, where N>3.
