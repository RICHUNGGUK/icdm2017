Contraction of a non-edge merges two non-adjacent vertices into a single vertex such that the edges incident on the non-adjacent vertices are now incident on the merged vertex. In this paper, we consider simple connected graphs, hence parallel edges are removed after contraction. The minimum number of nodes whose removal disconnects the graph is the connectivity of the graph. We say a graph is k-connected, if its connectivity is k. A non-edge in a k-connected graph is contractible if its contraction does not result in a graph of lower connectivity. Otherwise the non-edge is non-contractible. We focus our study on non-contractible non-edges in 2-connected graphs. We show that cycles are the only 2-connected graphs in which every non-edge is non-contractible. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
