We continue this research by classifying all the minimal blocking sets of the hyperbolic quadrics Q(+)( 2n + 1, 3), n >= 3, of size at most 3(n) + 3(n-2). This means that the three smallest minimal blocking sets of Q(+)( 2n + 1, 3), n >= 3, are now classified. We present similar results for q = 2 by classifying the minimal blocking sets of Q(+)( 2n + 1, 2), n >= 3, of size at most 2(n) + 2(n-2). This means that the two smallest minimal blocking sets of Q(+)(2(n) + 1, 2), n >= 3, are classified.", "paper_title": "Characterization results on small blocking sets of the polar spaces Q(+) (2n+1,2) and Q(+) (2n+1,3)", "paper_id": "WOS:000249298700019"}
