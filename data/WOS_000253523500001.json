Furthermore, it becomes more difficult to deal with on the emerging heterogeneous PC cluster environments. In the past, some loop self-scheduling schemes have been proposed to be applicable to heterogeneous cluster environments. In this paper, we propose a performance-based approach, which partitions loop iterations according to the performance ratio of cluster nodes. To verify the proposed approach, a heterogeneous cluster is built, and three types of application programs are implemented to be executed in this testbed. Experimental results show that the proposed approach performs better than traditional schemes.", "paper_title": "Dynamic partitioning of loop iterations on heterogeneous PC clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000253523500001"}
