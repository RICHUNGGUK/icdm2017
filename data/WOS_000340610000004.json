Existing methods for document segmentation and classification do not handle well the complexity and variety of contents, geometric layout, and elemental shapes. This paper proposes a novel document image classification approach that distributes individual pixels into four fundamental classes (text, image, graphics, and background) through support vector machines. This approach uses a novel low-dimensional feature descriptor based on textural properties. The proposed feature vector is constructed by considering the sparseness of the document image responses to a filter bank on a multi-resolution and contextual basis. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on business document images show the benefits of adopting a contextual and multi-resolution approach. The proposed approach achieves excellent results; it is able to handle varied contents and complex document layouts, without imposing any constraint or making assumptions about the shape and spatial arrangement of document elements.", "paper_title": "Texture sparseness for pixel classification of business document images", "paper_id": "WOS:000340610000004"}
