Our new unsplitting conservative scheme exactly satisfies the continuity equation for charge. The implicit Finite Difference Time Domain method is also adopted for computation of electromagnetic fields, which is not restricted by the CFL condition for light. The Geospace Environment Modeling magnetic reconnection challenge problem is adopted as a benchmark test. The characteristics of the present Vlasov code are studied by varying the resolution in configuration space. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
