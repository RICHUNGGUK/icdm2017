The service and vacation times are generally distributed random variables and their durations are integral multiples of a slot duration. We obtain the queue-length distributions at departure, service completion, vacation termination, arbitrary and prearrival epochs. Several performance measures such as probability of blocking, average queue-length and the fraction of time the server is busy have been discussed. Finally, the analysis of actual waiting time under the first-come-first-served discipline is also carried out. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
