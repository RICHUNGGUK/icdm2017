The analytical models have a high value in the early stages to uncover major performance problems which affect the design of the architecture before the cost of rectification is too high. The development of new modeling methods for rapid analysis is also very important for the further fast deployment of new applications and services. In this paper, we develop a modeling method, based on queuing theory, for the solution of network performance problems faced when trying to support real-time services over Internet Protocol (IP) network. Namely, we are modeling signaling network architecture for the real-time services using M/GX/1 queuing system. We evaluate and compute expected waiting time and time in system. Furthermore, we present numerical results of our calculations and provide corresponding curves for them. (C) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
