This method improves the sub-band decomposition method (SDM) introduced in [N. Ben Abdallah, E. Polizzi, Subband decomposition approach for the simulation of quantum electron transport in nanostructures, J. Comput. Phys. 202 (1) (2005) 150-180]. The principal feature of the here presented model consists in an inexpensive and fast resolution of the Schrodinger equation in the transport direction, due to the application of WKB techniques. Oscillating WKB basis elements are constructed and replace the piecewise polynomial interpolation functions used in SDM. This procedure is shown to reduce considerably the computational time, while keeping a good accuracy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
