As a control scheme the concept of virtual force is presented and discussed. In such concept, full rank of input matrix, describing relationship between controlled variables and number of actuators, has been assumed. The signal of the assumed additional actuator is equal to zero equivalently (because this force is \"virtual\" and it does not exist in practice) but in this way the invertibility of input matrix can be achieved. The equation of the implicit function generates the reference signals needed in control algorithm. Mathematical proof of proper action of such control law has been presented using Lyapunov-like function. Efficiency and robustness of control scheme on parametric uncertainty of terrain, which the mobile manipulator is moving on, have been tested in numerous simulations.", "paper_title": "Virtual Force Concept in Steering Mobile Manipulators with Skid-Steering Platform Moving in Unknown Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000350657800004"}
