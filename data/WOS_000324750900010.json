Such accounts must respond to the objection of \"cognitive bloat\". When does a processes count as my cognitive process? This objection is not best rebutted, as Clark often attempts, by limiting extension to processes that play a similar role to internal brain processes. Nor is it best addressed, as Gallagher (2013) does, by appealing to enactive engagement as grounding \"ownership\" of a process. Rather, the solution is in our shared, evolving, normative and social practices of holding people responsible for their actions. I support this by drawing parallels between socially distributed cognition and feminist relational theory, which has already addressed the issue of individual autonomy within social practices that shape individuals' selves, values, and capacities. I end by high-lighting political and ethical concerns raised by this conception of HEC regarding differential distribution of cognitive resources. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
