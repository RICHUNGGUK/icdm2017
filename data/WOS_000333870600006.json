MDTWNPP is a generalization of a Two-way Number Partitioning Problem (TWNPP), where a set of vectors is partitioned rather than a set of numbers. The simple k-swap neighborhoods allow an effective shaking procedure in the VNS search. The attraction-repulsion mechanism of EM is extended with a scaling procedure, which additionally moves EM points closer to local optima. Both VNS and EM use the same local search procedure based on 1-swap improvements. Computational results were obtained on 210 standard instances. Direct comparison with results from the literature confirm the significance of applying these methods to MDTWNPR (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
