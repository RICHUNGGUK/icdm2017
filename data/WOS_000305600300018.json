Comparisons with experimental data over a range of conditions, including particle size, mass loading and flow Reynolds number, demonstrate good agreement with predictions of all the erosion models considered. In particular, the models are able to yield reliable predictions of erosion depth and wear location on the concave and convex walls of the bends. The slight disparities observed are most likely due to uncertainties in the particle-wall collision model employed, and variability in the data. The complexity of the particle-wall collision process precluded the development in this work of a model which accounted for the occurrence of erosion pockets and their subsequent influence on the fluid flow, particle trajectories and the magnitude of wear at secondary wear locations, as well as the dynamic movement of the maximum wear location. Despite this, however, and within experimental uncertainty, the models perform well, although their further extension as noted could potentially lead to improved agreement with data.
