Special cases include sorting by comparisons, selection, multiple selection, and heap construction. We give an algorithm performing ITLB + o(ITLB) + O(n) comparisons in the worst case. Here, n denotes the size of the ground sets, and ITLB denotes a natural information-theoretic lower bound on the number of comparisons needed to produce the target partial order. Our approach is to replace the target partial order by a weak order (that is, a partial order with a layered structure) extending it, without increasing the information-theoretic lower bound too much. We then solve the problem by applying an efficient multiple selection algorithm. The overall complexity of our algorithm is polynomial. This answers a question of Yao [SIAM J. Comput., 18 (1989), pp. 679-689]. We base our analysis on the entropy of the target partial order, a quantity that can be efficiently computed and provides a good estimate of the information-theoretic lower bound.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT ALGORITHM FOR PARTIAL ORDER PRODUCTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000280847900008"}
