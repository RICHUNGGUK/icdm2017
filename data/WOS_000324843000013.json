Due to the limitation of DSRC channels, Wi-Fi channels can be alternative to realize the multicast in the vehicular networks. However, the deployment using the Wi-Fi in ISM bands is challenging due to the interference from increasing residential Wi-Fi users as well as inter-vehicle interference. In this study, we propose a cognitive multi-channel, multi-radio multicast protocol, CoCast, borrowing concept of recently developed cognitive radio techniques, which can help overcome such interference, with spectrum sensing and multi-channel assignment. Unfortunately, number of orthogonal channels is very limited in the ISM band to avoid interference in urban Wi-Fi cloud. Therefore, we apply two additional features to use partially overlapped channels: parallel frame transmission over OFDM subchannels to exploit spectral diversity, and network coding for the subchannel frames. Our evaluation results show that the reliability of multicast communication among vehicles in a dense urban environment can be significantly improved with these protocol extensions.
