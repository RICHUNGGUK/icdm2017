This study is aimed at detecting the location of the nonpropagating transverse crack. A series of beams with cracks that are simulated by rotational springs with equivalent stiffness are analyzed. The mode shape and the slope of this lumped crack model are calculated. Through complex continuous wavelet transform of the slope of the mode shape using Complex Gaus1 wavelet (CGau1), the locations of cracks are detected from the modulus line and the angle line of wavelet coefficients. By comparison, the singularity is much more apparent from the angle line of complex continuous wavelet transform. This demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms the existing method of wavelet transform of the mode shape with real wavelets. Also, this method can detect cracks in beams with different boundary conditions. The influence of crack locations and crack depth on crack detection is discussed. Finally, the noise effect is studied. Through the multiscale analysis, the locations of cracks may be detected from the angle of wavelet coefficients.", "paper_title": "Crack Detection from the Slope of the Mode Shape Using Complex Continuous Wavelet Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000299929700003"}
