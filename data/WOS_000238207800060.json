In worm simulation, worm traffic generation is the base to analyze influences of worm traffic on network. The popular Random Constant Spread (RCS) model ignores the burstiness of \"latency-limited\" worm traffic, which will cause underestimation of the influences. According to worm scan behaviors, the Periodic Burst Scanning (PBS) model is proposed to model \"latency-limited\" worm traffic. Simulation results show that network performance decreases much more with PBS model than that with RCS model.", "paper_title": "Worm traffic Modeling for network performance analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800060"}
