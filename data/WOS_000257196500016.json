A test prototype has been designed and fabricated using 0.18-mu m single-poly six-metal CMOS process with core area of 0.16 mm(2). The measurement results show that packet error rate (PER) is less than 1% given SNR = 5 dB. The total power consumption is merely 251 mu W at a 2.4-MHz system clock.", "paper_title": "ZigBee 868/915-MHz modulator/demodulator, for wireless personal area network", "paper_id": "WOS:000257196500016"}
