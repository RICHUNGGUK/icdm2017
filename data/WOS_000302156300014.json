The 2D distribution of these institutions is then utilized (1) to categorize the institutions into a number of qualitative groups revealing the nature of their performance, and (2) to determine the position of a specific institution among the set of institutions. The method is compared with some major h-type indices and tested with empirical data using clinical medicine as an illustrative case. The method is extensible to the research performance evaluation at other aggregation levels such as researchers, journals, departments, and nations.", "paper_title": "A Two-Dimensional Approach to Performance Evaluation for a Large Number of Research Institutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000302156300014"}
