Through the dyadic parabolic decomposition of phase space, we obtain the solution of the wave equation with a boundary source and homogeneous initial conditions using wave packets. On this basis, we develop a numerical procedure for the reverse-time continuation from the boundary of scattering data and for RTM. The algorithms are derived from those we recently developed for the discrete approximate evaluation of the action of Fourier integral operators and inherit their conceptual and numerical properties.", "paper_title": "Multiscale Reverse-Time-Migration-Type Imaging Using the Dyadic Parabolic Decomposition of Phase Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000367019300008"}
