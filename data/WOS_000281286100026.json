Our first contribution is a new lightweight grammar representation that compactly encodes facade structures and allows fast per-pixel access. We call this grammar F-shade. Our second contribution is a prototype rendering system that renders an urban model from the compact representation directly on the GPU. Our suggested approach explores an interesting connection from procedural modeling to real-time rendering. Evaluating procedural descriptions at render time uses less memory than the generation of intermediate geometry. This enables us to render large urban models directly from GPU memory.", "paper_title": "Grammar-based Encoding of Facades", "paper_id": "WOS:000281286100026"}
