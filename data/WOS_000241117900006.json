Exponential lower bounds for read-once branching programs are known for a long time. On the other hand, the problem of proving superpolynomial lower bounds for parity read-once branching programs is still open. In this paper restricted parity read-once branching programs are considered and an exponential lower bound on the size of the so-called well-structured parity graph-driven read-once branching programs for integer multiplication is proven. This is the first strongly exponential lower bound on the size of a parity nonoblivious read-once branching program model for an explicitly defined Boolean function. In addition, more insight into the structure of integer multiplication is yielded. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
