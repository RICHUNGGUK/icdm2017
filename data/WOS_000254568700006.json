Design/methodology/approach - The survey results of 351 responses were analyzed to test the proposed hypotheses and research model using structural equation modeling. Data were collected in Southern Science Park in Taiwan. Findings - It was found that personality factors such as locus of control and self-esteem significantly influence employees' internet addictions; and internet addiction significantly impacts employees' internet abuse at the workplace. Practical implications - Employers should pay special attention to employees' personalities because they play important roles in internet addiction and internet abuse. Also a good internet policy will be useful especially to a panoptic working environment, which is becoming popular. Originality/value - This study provides a comprehensive theoretical foundation to better understand the two controversial issues in industry. The empirical study validates the important theories of locus of control, self-esteem, use and gratification, control, and containment in workplace surveillance and deviant behavior research.", "paper_title": "An empirical evaluation of key factors contributing to internet abuse in the workplace", "paper_id": "WOS:000254568700006"}
