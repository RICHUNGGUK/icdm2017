The main characteristics of WMNs permit network connectivity anywhere anytime with simplicity and low cost. Their capability for self-organization significantly reduces the complexity of network deployment. The draft standard of IEEE P802.11s/D4.0 is not considered secure for the routing protocol. In this paper, we propose a secure Hybrid-Wireless-Mesh Protocol using an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA-HWMP). We then compare the ECDSA-based HWMP against identity-based encryption (IBE)-based HWMP. This study has been carried out to show the great benefits of the IBE technique in securing HWMP. Through extensive Network Simulator-3 simulations, results have shown that the IBE-HWMP outperforms the ECDSA-HWMP in terms of overhead, throughput, loss ratio and delay. Simulation results show that the use of the IBE-based HWMP provides a greater level of security with light overhead.
