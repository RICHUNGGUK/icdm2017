The algorithm employs a viscous fluid model which naturally incorporates two components: a similarity measure for registration and an intensity correction term for image enhancement. Incorporating an intensity correction term improves the registration results. Furthermore, applying the image enhancement term to CBCT imagery leads to an intensity corrected CBCT with better image quality. To achieve minimal processing time, the algorithm is implemented on a graphic processing unit (CPU) platform. The advantage of the simultaneous optimization strategy is quantitatively validated and discussed using a synthetic example. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is then illustrated using six patient datasets, three head-and-neck datasets and three prostate datasets.
