However, the difference between the fitness values of individuals, which may be helpful to improve the performance of the algorithm, has not been used to tune parameters and choose mutation strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel variant of DE with an individual-dependent mechanism that includes an individual-dependent parameter (IDP) setting and an individual-dependent mutation (IDM) strategy. In the IDP setting, control parameters are set for individuals according to the differences in their fitness values. In the IDM strategy, four mutation operators with different searching characteristics are assigned to the superior and inferior individuals, respectively, at different stages of the evolution process. The performance of the proposed algorithm is then extensively evaluated on a suite of the 28 latest benchmark functions developed for the 2013 Congress on Evolutionary Computation special session. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's outstanding performance.", "paper_title": "Differential Evolution With an Individual-Dependent Mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000358883500007"}
