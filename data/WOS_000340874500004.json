In this paper, we study the Kaplan-Meier estimator of survival probability based on RSS under random censoring time setup, and propose nonparametric estimators of the population mean. We present a simulation study to compare the performance of the suggested estimators. It turns out that RSS design can yield a substantial improvement in efficiency over the SRS design. Additionally, we apply the proposed methods to a real data set from an environmental study.", "paper_title": "On the Kaplan-Meier estimator based on ranked set samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000340874500004"}
