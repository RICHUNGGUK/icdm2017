Our approach begins with PathFinder-style routing, which we run on a coarsened representation of the routing architecture. This leads to fast generation of a partial routing solution where the signals are assigned to groups of wire segments rather than individual wire segments. A Boolean satisfiability (SAT)-based stage follows, generating a legal routing solution from the partial solution. We explore approximately 165 000 FPGA switch block architectures, showing that the choice of the architecture has a significant impact on the complexity of the SAT formulation, and by extension, on routing runtime. Our approach points to a new research direction, namely, reducing FPGA computer-aided design runtime by exploring FPGA architectures and algorithms together.", "paper_title": "Combined Architecture/Algorithm Approach to Fast FPGA Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000319473000007"}
