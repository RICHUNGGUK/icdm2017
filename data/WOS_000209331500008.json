Healthy issue includes physical and mental cares that had been researched topics and attracted industrial in many countries. In this paper, we propose a multidisciplinary scheme to identify elders' mental states and provide proper network services to enhance the quality of elderly lifestyle. Firstly, we present the five dimensions (5D) for the aged which includes the entertainment services for aged, health improvement, social interactive services, home care services and family communication services of elderly demands in the clinical manifestation. Based on 5D aspect, we develop the elderly suited TV-based network services for elders (ETVNetSers). ETVNetSers are developed to promote the well-being of elders in home living space. Residential elder users are connected by Internet to overcome the space and time constraints to enjoy the TV-based entertainment, health-care services or social communication. Besides, an elderly LOHAS index (ELI) is designed to evaluate the performance of the developed services. ELI could be applied to identify mental and psychological states of aged people. Clinical measurement and verification results show that the reliability analysis from 182 subjects retrieved ELI resulted in Cronbach's Alpha of 0.865. The statistics on 59 subjects manipulating the ETVNetSers with 850 records show that the services carry them with premium services and lead them toward well-being living.", "paper_title": "Clinical measurement and verification of elderly LOHAS index in an elder suited TV-based home living space", "paper_id": "WOS:000209331500008"}
