In this paper. a novel peer-to-peer indexing system with related P2P registries is proposed to support the completely decentralized discovery capabilities. In the presented system. with the ontology encoding scheme, the semantic service description is distributed into a distributed trie index on the structured P2P network to allow requesters to lookup services with semantic requirements. Finally, experimental result shows that the presented system is efficient and scalable.", "paper_title": "A peer-to-peer approach to Semantic Web services discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500010"}
