The authors first analyse the request-to-send (RTS) collision range and the data collision range that induced by the hidden terminal problem and obtain the RTS collision probability and the data collision probability, respectively. The authors confirm that the fundamental problem of modelling the saturation throughput in multi-hop environments is to distinguish the different backoff procedures induced by RTS collisions and data collisions. To this end, the authors introduce the concept of pseudo state and put forward a novel bidimensional Markov model which fully takes the discrepancy of these two kinds of backoff procedures into account. Moreover, the authors derive the accurate expression of the saturation throughput of WLAN mesh networks Finally, the authors evaluate the accuracy of the proposed model through extensive simulations, and the results demonstrate the efficiency of the model.", "paper_title": "Modelling MAC-layer saturation throughput in WLAN mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000329216400003"}
