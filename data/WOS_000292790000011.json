If there is any problem found in the simulation process, we will have to change the model by amending input parameters and re-start the simulation. Therefore, the accident reconstruction result has very big difference with real accident process. This article discusses the coupled calculation method between the traffic accident simulation and simulation optimization. Then it confirms the method's validity through the reliability analysis to simulation result. Finally through the actual traffic accident cases' simulation and optimization analysis, the reconstruction result shows that the deviation of the accident reconstruction result does not exceed 10%. And the reconstruction result is a nice match with the accident scene investigation data. The simulation and optimization integration calculation method provides an effective solution to the problem that lies in traditional traffic accident simulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
