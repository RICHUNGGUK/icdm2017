We investigate the performance and hardware scale of the proposed architectures in two add/drop configurations. Numerical evaluations prove that the proposed architectures attain almost the same routing performance as the equivalent conventional single large-scale OXC with an ideal colorless, directionless, and contentionless add/drop part, while enabling substantial hardware scale reduction.", "paper_title": "Hardware Scale and Performance Evaluation of a Compact Subsystem Modular Optical Cross Connect That Adopts Tailored Add/Drop Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000355935400009"}
