We show that if no restrictions are placed on the hybrid nodes in the solution, the problem is trivially solved in polynomial time by a simple sorting network-based construction. For the more interesting (and biologically more motivated) case where the solution is required to be a level-1 phylogenetic network, we present an algorithm solving the problem in O(vertical bar T vertical bar(2)) time when T is dense, i.e., when T contains at least one rooted triplet for each cardinality three subset of L. We also give an O(vertical bar T vertical bar(5/3))-time algorithm for finding the set of all phylogenetic networks having a single hybrid node attached to exactly one leaf (and having no other hybrid nodes) that are consistent with a given dense set of rooted triplets.
