Although the screen size of mobile phones is very small, the full information of the image should nevertheless be represented. Moreover, the high frequency components of the mobile phone images may contain important information. In order to enhance the performance of mobile JPEG images, these high frequency components should be compensated using an appropriate quantization table. Considering these characteristics, we propose a modeling method of the quantization table for compensating the high frequency components of the mobile images while sacrificing their low frequency components. We select the optimized pre-emphasis factor and bias factor using various sets of 240x 320 images and show that the proposed method improves the performance in terms of size and PSNR.", "paper_title": "A Modeling Method of JPEG Quantization Table for QVGA Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000282600700012"}
