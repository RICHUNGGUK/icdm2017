Nonnegative matrix tri-factorization (NMTF) emerges as a promising tool for co-clustering, seeking a 3-factor decomposition X approximate to USV(T) with all factor matrices restricted to be nonnegative, i.e.. U >= 0.S >= 0, V >= 0. In this paper we develop multiplicative updates for orthogonal NMTF where X approximate to USV(T) is pursued with orthogonality constraints, U(T)U = I. and V(T)V = I, exploiting true gradients on Stiefel manifolds. Experiments on various document data sets demonstrate that our method works well for document clustering and is useful in revealing polysemous words via co-clustering words and documents.
