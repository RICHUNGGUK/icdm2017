In order to avoid fragmentation, we construct a potential function and a connectivity-preserving flocking algorithm to enable the multiple agents to move with the same velocity while preserving the connectivity of underlying networks with a mild assumption that the initial network is connected and the coupling strength of the initial network of the nonlinear velocity consensus term is larger than a threshold value. Furthermore the proposed flocking algorithm is extended to solve the problem of multi-agent systems with a nonlinear dynamical virtual leader. The result is that all agents' velocities asymptotically approach to the velocity of the virtual leader, and the distance between any two agents is asymptotically stabilized to avoid collisions among agents. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
