Our approach supports the master-worker scheme, but could be applied to other cases of parallel computation over stored data. We tested our new approach under various circumstances and measured it performance by means of several metrics. We made comparisons of our approach with respect to other scheduling policies; it performed significantly better than the majority of cases, and in worst cases, it was as good as the best of the others.", "paper_title": "Multiple job scheduling in a connection-limited data parallel system", "paper_id": "WOS:000234122000004"}
