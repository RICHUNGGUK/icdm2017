The corresponding binary codes of Z(2)Z(4)-additive codes under an extended Gray map are called Z(2)Z(4)-linear codes. In this paper, the invariants for Z(2)Z(4)-linear codes, the rank and dimension of the kernel, are studied. Specifically, given the algebraic parameters of Z(2)Z(4)-linear codes, the possible values of these two invariants, giving lower and upper bounds, are established. For each possible rank r between these bounds, the construction of a Z(2)Z(4)-linear code with rank r is given. Equivalently, for each possible dimension of the kernel k, the construction of a Z(2)Z(4)-linear code with dimension of the kernel k is given. Finally, the bounds on the rank, once the kernel dimension is fixed, are established and the construction of a Z(2)Z(4)-linear code for each possible pair (r, k) is given.", "paper_title": "Z(2)Z(4)-linear codes: rank and kernel", "paper_id": "WOS:000277338400004"}
