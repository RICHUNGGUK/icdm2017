A consequence of this PBD-closure result is that the size of optimal constant-composition codes can be determined for infinite families of parameter sets from just a single example of an optimal code. As an application, the size of several infinite families of optimal constant-composition codes are derived. In particular, the problem of determining the size of optimal constant-composition codes having distance four and weight three is solved for all lengths sufficiently large. This problem was previously unresolved for odd lengths, except for lengths seven and eleven.", "paper_title": "The PBD-closure of constant-composition codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000248235400002"}
