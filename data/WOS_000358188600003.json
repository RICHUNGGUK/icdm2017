One is a limit measure which is obtained from the probability distribution of the walk at a long-time limit, and the other is a convergence in distribution for the walker's position in a rescaled space by time. In addition, as an application of the walk, we obtain discrete uniform limit measures from the 3-state walk with a delocalized initial state.", "paper_title": "LIMIT THEOREMS OF A 3-STATE QUANTUM WALK AND ITS APPLICATION FOR DISCRETE UNIFORM MEASURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000358188600003"}
