Grounded on the resource-based view (RBV) theory of the firm, we assess a research model linking three determinants; ERP use, collaboration, and analytics to explain the ERP value in three effects (individual productivity, management control, and customer satisfaction). Using a survey data set of 883 firms across European SMEs we test the theoretical model through structural equation modelling. This study provides empirical evidence on how European SMEs find value from the top four commercial-packaged ERPs. Whereas for Dynamics and ORACLE the most important factor is analytics system capability, for SAP and SAGE it is greater collaboration system capability. Furthermore, for SAP and ORACLE greater ERP use is perceived as an important factor, but not for Dynamics and SAGE. In addition, the study finds that both collaboration and analytics capabilities are the greatest differentiators to ERP value, which is consistent with the RBV. The finding provide guidance to business implementation strategies and to software development. The limitations and future work of the study are noted.
