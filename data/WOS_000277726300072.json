The aim of our study is to facilitate knowledge sharing and information exchange in this area by means of a knowledge-based system. We propose a knowledge-based system, CASESIAN, to automatically model each physician's prescription experience. This is done by collecting as many as possible instances of when the physician has issued a prescription. These occasions will be analyzed from a statistical perspective to form a reciprocal interactive knowledge sharing process for the issuing of medical prescriptions which we will call the prescription process. With the help of the prescription data in medical organizations, the knowledge-based system employs the Bayesian Theorem to correlate the experience of peers in order to evaluate individual prescription knowledge as retrieved through the case-based reasoning technique. In addition, a system prototype was implemented in a Hong Kong medical organization to evaluate the feasibility of such an approach. Our evaluation indicates that there is a significant improvement in knowledge sharing after the adoption of the system. CASESIAN obtains a higher rating in both recall and precision measurement when compared to traditional knowledge-based system. In particular, its information retrieval is much stronger than the baseline in around 40%. Furthermore, regarding the result of the interviews, physicians agree that the system can improve the storing and sharing of medical prescription knowledge. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
