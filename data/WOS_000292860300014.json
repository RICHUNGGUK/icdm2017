We assume sliding rocks are elastic blocks. Detailed joint shear strength parameters are set in DDA in a manner compatible with what is known about the Tsaoling landslide mechanisms. Landslide run-out distance, information from survivors, and the post-failure topography are used to constrain the computational results. Calculations demonstrate that sliding rocks from the ground surface decoupled from those near the basal shear surface during the landslide. Local residents survived because surficial rocks were never deeply buried during the landslide. Additionally, shear strength parameters of material in the deposition area strongly govern final deposit topography. Computational results correlate well with actual post-failure topography.
