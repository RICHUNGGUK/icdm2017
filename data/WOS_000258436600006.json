I ne implementation of a network into different levels or sub-layers improves the performance and reduces the investment against plain topologies. This paper tries to characterize important parameters on multilevel networks such as diameter, average distance and gateway location to be able to optimize the global network topology with no need for additional path calculations. The study focuses on the lower level of the network formed by subnetworks with regular structures such as Single Ring, Double Ring and Torus Grid. The achieved results will ease and improve the network planning of large-scale networks. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
