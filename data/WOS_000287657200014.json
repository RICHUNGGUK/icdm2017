In this paper, the \"converse\" result is proven. In particular, it is proven that for every 0 < rho < 1 - 1/q, a random code of rate 1 - H(q)(rho) - epsilon, with high probability, is not a (rho, L)-list decodable code for any L <= c/epsilon where c is some constant that depends only on rho and q. A similar lower bound is also shown for random linear codes. Previously, such a tight lower bound on the list size was only known for the case when rho >= 1 - 1/q - O(root epsilon) for small enough epsilon > 0 [Blinovsky, 1986, 2005, 2008; Guruswami and Vadhan, 2005]. A lower bound is known for all constant 0 < rho < 1 - 1/q independent of epsilon, though the lower bound is asymptotically weaker than our bound [Blinovsky, 1986, 2005, 2008]. These results, however, are not subsumed by ours as these other results hold for arbitrary codes of rate 1 - H(q)(rho) - epsilon.", "paper_title": "Limits to List Decoding of Random Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000287657200014"}
