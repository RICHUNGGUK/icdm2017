While the closely related Dual Coordinate Ascent (DCA) method has been implemented in various software packages, it has so far lacked good convergence analysis. This paper presents a new analysis of Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent (SDCA) showing that this class of methods enjoy strong theoretical guarantees that are comparable or better than SGD. This analysis justifies the effectiveness of SDCA for practical applications.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent Methods for Regularized Loss Minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000315981900008"}
