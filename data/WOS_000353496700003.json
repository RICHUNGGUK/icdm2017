Sufficient conditions for the systems to be controllable are presented. In particular, the control inputs are computed to achieve the state transition for the controllable systems by using the root locus technique. Examples are also provided to illustrate the results of the paper.", "paper_title": "On controllability of two-dimensional discrete-time bilinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000353496700003"}
