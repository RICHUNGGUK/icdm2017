A simple neurocontroller can be linearized by using describing function method firstly. According to the classical method of parameter plane, the stability of linearized system with adjustable parameters is then considered. In addition, gain margin and phase margin for limit cycle generation are also analyzed by adding a gain-phase margin tester into open loop system. Computer simulations show the efficiency of this approach.", "paper_title": "Limit cycle prediction of a neurocontrol vehicle system based on gain-phase margin analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000277940600008"}
