We develop a unified reliability model that accounts for failures in all three categories. Hardware, and software failures are accounted for with well-known modeling approaches. In this paper, we propose a modeling methodology using Markov processes to capture hardware-software interaction failures. We illustrate the combined hardware & software modeling approach by applying it to a real telecommunication system.", "paper_title": "Reliability Modeling of hardware and software interactions, and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000242547400002"}
