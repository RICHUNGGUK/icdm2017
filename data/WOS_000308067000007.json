The method of fundamental solutions (MFS) approximates the exact solution to the Laplace equation by a linear combination of independent fundamental solutions with different source points. The accuracy of the numerical solution depends on the distribution of source points. In this paper, a weighted greedy QR decomposition (GQRD) is proposed to choose significant source points by introducing a weighting parameter. An index called an average degree of approximation is defined to show the efficiency of the proposed method. From numerical experiments, it is concluded that the numerical solution tends to be more accurate when the average degree of approximation is larger, and that the proposed method can yield more accurate solutions with a less number of source points than the conventional GQRD.
