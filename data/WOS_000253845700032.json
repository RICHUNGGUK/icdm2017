In this work, fusion of different information sources with the fuzzy integral (FI), and the associated fuzzy measure (FM), are applied to the problem of classifying a small set of highly confusable human non-speech sounds. As FI is a meaningful formalism for combining classifier outputs that can capture interactions among the various sources of information, it shows in our experiments a significantly better performance than that of any single classifier entering the FI fusion module. Actually, that FI decision-level fusion approach shows comparable results to the high-performing SVM feature-level fusion and thus it seems to be a good choice when feature-level fusion is not an option. We have also observed that the importance and the degree of interaction among the various feature types given by the FM can be used for feature selection, and gives a valuable insight into the problem.
