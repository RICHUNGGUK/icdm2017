We propose strategies of univariate descent (UVD), methods. The main advantage of this approach is that the optimization problem is broken down into one-dimensional optimization problems, so that each optimization step involves little computation effort. In order to assess its numerical performance, we apply the devised method to eigen-problems as well as to independent component analysis in signal processing. (C) 2008 IMACS.
