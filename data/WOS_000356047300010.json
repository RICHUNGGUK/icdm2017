Here, an idealization approach is proposed that is based on generative shape processes used to decompose an initial B-Rep solid, i.e., extrusion processes with material addition are used to segment a solid. The corresponding extrusion primitives form the basis of candidate sub-domains for idealization and their connections conveyed through the generative processes they belong to, bringing robustness to set up the appropriate connections between idealized sub-domains. This is made possible because the connections between extrusion primitives have an explicit geometric representation and can be used to bound the connections between idealized sub-domains. Taking advantage of an existing construction tree as available in a CAD software does not help much because it may be complicated to use it for idealization processes because this tree structure is not unique. Using generative processes attached to an object that is no longer reduced to a single construction tree but to a graph containing all non-trivial construction trees, is more useful for the engineer to evaluate variants of idealization. From this automated decomposition, each primitive is subjected to a morphological analysis to define whether it can idealized or not. Subsequently, geometric interfaces between primitives form also a graph that can be used to process the connections between the idealized sub-domains generated from the primitives. These interfaces are taken into account to determine more precisely the idealizable sub-domains and their contours when primitives are incrementally merged to come back to produce the global morphological analysis of the initial object. A user-defined threshold is used to tune the morphological analysis with respect to further user parameters. Finally, the idealizable sub-domains and their connections are processed to locate the mid-surfaces and connect them using generic criteria that the user can tune locally using complementary criteria.", "paper_title": "Idealized models for FEA derived from generative modeling processes based on extrusion primitives", "paper_id": "WOS:000356047300010"}
