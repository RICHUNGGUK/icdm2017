Broadcast is a fundamental operation for all kinds of networks and it has not been addressed seriously in the WSN. Therefore, we propose two types of power and time efficient broadcasting protocols, namely one-to-all and all-to-all broadcasting protocols, for five different WSN topologies. Our one-to-all broadcasting protocols conserve power and time by choosing as few relay nodes as possible to scatter packets to the whole network. Besides, collisions are carefully handled such that our one-to-all broadcasting protocols can achieve 100% reachability. By assigning each node a proper channel, our all-to-all broadcasting protocols are collision free and efficient. Numerical evaluation results compare the performance of the five topologies and show that our broadcasting protocols are power and time efficient.
