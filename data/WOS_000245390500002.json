In this paper, we derive new cost functions for spectral clustering based on measures of error between a given partition and a solution of the spectral relaxation of a minimum normalized cut problem. Minimizing these cost functions with respect to the partition leads to new spectral clustering algorithms. Minimizing with respect to the similarity matrix leads to algorithms for learning the similarity matrix from fully labelled data sets. We apply our learning algorithm to the blind one-microphone speech separation problem, casting the problem as one of segmentation of the spectrogram.", "paper_title": "Learning spectral clustering, with application to speech separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000245390500002"}
