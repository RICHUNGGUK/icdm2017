Knowing the extent of blocking artifacts is thus necessary for such applications as automatic quality monitoring and restoration. The current blocking artifacts measures are based on a strong prior that the block boundaries are known in advance, which often does not hold in real-world applications. Therefore, their performances degrade significantly when block boundaries are misaligned. To address the problem, this paper presents a robust no-reference blocking artifacts evaluation metric for JPEG images based on grid strength and regularity (GridSAR). The underlying idea is to extract block grids from a JPEG image and quantify the grid image to evaluate the strength of blocking artifacts. To this end, a grid map of blocking artifacts is first extracted from the image in the spatial domain. Then the blocking artifacts of the image are evaluated by quantifying the strength and regularity of the grid image. Furthermore, in order to account for the varying sensitivities of human eyes to the blocking artifacts in smooth and textured areas, a masking function is also proposed. Experimental results on seven popular image quality databases demonstrate that GridSAR achieves the state-of-the-art performance, and is robust to block misalignments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
