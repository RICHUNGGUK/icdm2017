Hence, a core asset is a key element of PLE, and therefore the reusability of the core asset largely determines the success of PLE projects. However, current quality models to evaluate reusability do not adequately address the unique characteristics of core assets in PLE. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for evaluating the reusability of core assets. We first identify the key characteristics of core assets, and derive a set of quality attributes that characterizes the reusability of core assets. Then, we define metrics for each quality attribute and finally present practical guidelines for applying the evaluation framework in PLE projects. Using the proposed framework, the reusability of core assets can be more effectively and precisely evaluated. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
