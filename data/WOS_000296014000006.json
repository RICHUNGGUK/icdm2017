Most commercial P2P streaming systems have resorted to the practice of overprovisioning a fixed amount of upload capacity on streaming servers. In this paper, we have performed a detailed analysis on 10 months of run-time traces from UUSee, a commercial P2P streaming system, and observed that available server capacities are not able to keep up with the increasing demand by hundreds of channels. We propose a novel online server capacity provisioning algorithm that proactively adjusts server capacities available to each of the concurrent channels, such that the supply of server bandwidth in each channel dynamically adapts to the forecasted demand, taking into account the number of peers, the streaming quality, and the channel priority. The algorithm is able to learn over time, has full Internet service provider (ISP) awareness to maximally constrain P2P traffic within ISP boundaries, and can provide differentiated streaming qualities to different channels by manipulating their priorities. To evaluate its effectiveness, our experiments are based on an implementation of the algorithm, which replays real-world traces.", "paper_title": "On Dynamic Server Provisioning in Multichannel P2P Live Streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000296014000006"}
