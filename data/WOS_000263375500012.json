The setup is similar to the class of deterministic interference channels without common information studied by El Gamal and Costa, which was later extended to the class of deterministic interference channels with common information. In this paper, certain conditions that were originally imposed by El Gamal and Costa are relaxed and it is shown, by a specific example, that this new class of interference channels is strictly larger than the class of deterministic interference channels previously studied. In fact, the result of this paper is obtained by combining the class of deterministic interference channels with the class of discrete memoryless interference channels with strong interference. Hence, it also includes the capacity region of the class of discrete memoryless interference channels with strong interference as a special case.", "paper_title": "The Capacity Region of a Class of Semideterministic Interference Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000263375500012"}
