The parameter uncertainties are assumed to be norm bounded. Based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory and the nonnegative semimartingale convergence theorem, delay-dependent and delay- independent sufficient stability conditions are established. It is also shown that the result in this paper cover some recently published works. Two examples are provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed criteria.", "paper_title": "Exponential Stability of Uncertain Stochastic Neural Networks with Markovian Switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000284852300006"}
