The input to these systems are natural numbers expressed in binary form, encoded as appropriate sequences of spikes. A single system accepts as inputs numbers of any size. The present work may be considered as a first step towards the design of a CPU based on the working of spiking neural P systems.", "paper_title": "First Steps Towards a CPU Made of Spiking Neural P Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000267551700006"}
