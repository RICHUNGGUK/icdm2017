The first one is for the case when the machines are identical and the precedence graph partitions the jobs into groups of fixed size. As an interesting particular case, this yields a polynomial time approximation scheme for scheduling jobs with chain or tree precedence constraints on identical machines, when each chain or tree is of constant size. The second approximation scheme is for scheduling jobs with arbitrarily long chain precedence constraints on uniformly related machines when the number of machines is fixed.", "paper_title": "APPROXIMATION SCHEMES FOR SCHEDULING JOBS WITH CHAIN PRECEDENCE CONSTRAINTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000274425600002"}
