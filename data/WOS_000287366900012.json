The proposed setup involves simple linear optical elements, N-photon polarization entangled state, and conventional photon detectors that only distinguish the vacuum and nonvacuum Fock number states. We show that with local operations, single-photon measurement, and one way classical communication, the protocol can be successfully realized with a certain probability.", "paper_title": "LINEAR OPTICAL PROTOCOL FOR GENERATION OF W STATE WITHIN A NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000287366900012"}
