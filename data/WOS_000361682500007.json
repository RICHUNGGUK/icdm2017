Egoki follows amodel-based approach and selects suitable interaction resources and modalities depending on users' capabilities. A proof-of-concept prototype evaluation was conducted with accessibility experts and participants in two different scenarios: one devoted to blind people and the other to people with cognitive impairments. Two services were developed for each scenario: a service for selecting the menu for lunch and a bus schedule service. The tailored user interfaces automatically generated for both scenarios were evaluated by accessibility experts following a barrier walkthrough method. In addition, a user evaluation was performed with eleven participants (two blind participants and nine participants with cognitive impairments). Observational methods were employed during the evaluation sessions where participants were asked to perform several tasks. The results revealed that the tailored user interfaces automatically generated by Egoki were operable and accessible and that all of the participants were able to complete the proposed tasks.", "paper_title": "Automatic Generation of Tailored Accessible User Interfaces for Ubiquitous Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000361682500007"}
