Jones, D. Brown, The division of labor between human and computer in the Presence of Decision Support System Advice, Decision Support Systems 33 (2002) 375-388]. This paper extends Jones and Brown [D.R. Jones, D. Brown, The division of labor between human and computer in the Presence of Decision Support System Advice, Decision Support Systems 33 (2002) 375-388] in two studies. In Study 1, we find that, in lieu of the divide-and-conquer strategy, human-judges give weight to all three types of inputs and that giving weight to the modeled information degrades performance. In Study 2, we find that (1) as strategies approach the divide-and-conquer strategy judgment performance improves, and (2) the divide-and-conquer strategy can be encouraged by a combination of instruction and a decision support feature. Application of these results could improve judgment in a variety of important contexts. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
