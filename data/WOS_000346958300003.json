In this algorithm, the choice of search direction is based on empirical gradients by evaluating the responses to the position changes, and the decision of step length is based on human-unique uncertainty reasoning by using a simple fuzzy rule. Furthermore, a canonical version of HGO is proposed. Based on the benchmark functions provided by CEC2005, the canonical HGO is compared with differential evolution (DE) algorithms, particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithms and covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). The simulation results show that the proposed HGO is competitive or even superior to the listed other algorithms for some employed functions.", "paper_title": "Human group optimiser for global numerical optimisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000346958300003"}
