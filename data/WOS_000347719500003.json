The complexity of state space-based analysis methods for finite user finite buffer systems increases exponentially with buffer size and number of users. The presence of multipath frequency selective fading channel further adds to the complexity, making the analysis practically intractable. This paper uses an approximate analysis technique called tagged user analysis (TUA) to analyze the performance parameters of slotted ALOHA over multipath and frequency selective fading channels for finite user finite buffer systems. In TUA, the steady state system performance is evaluated from the analysis of a single user. Moreover, the state flow graph of TUA has just four states, thus reducing the complexity of the analysis. Simulation results confirm the validity of the TUA analysis.
