As about 320 triangles are needed to approximate a single sphere-an atom-in a convincing way, visualizing larger proteins with atomic details requires tens of millions of triangles, far too many for smooth interactive frame rates. We describe a new approach to solve this 'molecular graphics problem', which shares the work between GPU and multiple CPU cores, generates high-quality results with perfectly round spheres, shadows and ambient lighting and requires only OpenGL 1.0 functionality, without any pixel shader Z-buffer access (a feature which is missing inmost mobile devices).", "paper_title": "YASARA View-molecular graphics for all devices-from smartphones to workstations", "paper_id": "WOS:000343083600024"}
