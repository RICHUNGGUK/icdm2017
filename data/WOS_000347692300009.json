Earlier interpolation based approaches have low computation complexity while cause blurring and ringing artifacts in edge regions due to the loss of high frequency details. Patch-based super resolution achieves satisfactory up-scaling images at the penalty of high computation cost. In this paper, we present a scalable edge map to recover high frequency components of edge regions in up-scaled images to improve the sharpness and use a range compression method to reduce ringing artifacts. We propose an efficient 1-D and 2-D approaches to extract edge curves from an original image. Then the cubic spline interpolation is adopted to up-scale an edge map. A smooth function is added to remove zigzag, stair, trapezoid artifacts. Then we apply the patch-based method only on up-scaled edge map to recover the high frequency components. The execution time of our proposed method is only 10 % to 5 % compared to the multi-resolution patch-based super resolution method. Experimental results show that we can achieve similar image quality with G.
