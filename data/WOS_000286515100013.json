The conventional feedback keepers (CONV) can no longer improve the performance of wide dynamic gates for the future technologies. In this paper, we propose an adaptive keeper technique called rate sensing keeper (RSK) that enables faster switching and tracks the variation across different process corners. It can switch upto 1.9x faster (for 20 legs) than CONV and can scale upto 32 legs as against 20 legs for CONV in a 130-nm 1.2-V process. The delay tracking is within 8% across the different process corners. We demonstrate the circuit operation of RSK using a 32 x 8 register file implemented in an industrial 130-nm 1.2-V CMOS process. The performance of individual dynamic logic gates are also evaluated on chip for various keeper techniques. We show that the RSK technique gives superior performance compared to the other alternatives such as Conditional Keeper (CKP) and current mirror-based keeper (LCR).", "paper_title": "Adaptive Keeper Design for Dynamic Logic Circuits Using Rate Sensing Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000286515100013"}
