The discrete wavelet transform is used to determine the energy content over the frequency band of the response in real time. The frequency content was implemented in the Big Bang-Big Crunch algorithm to update the optimum values of the closed-loop poles of the structural system adaptively. To calculate optimum gain matrix, a robust pole placement algorithm was used. The gain matrix is calculated online based on response characteristic in real time and must not be calculated a priori (offline) choice. The WPA is tested on a 10-story structural system subject to several historical ground motions. It is observed that the WPA has advantages in some design problems. Numerical examples illustrate that the proposed approach reduces the displacement response of the structure in real time more than conventional linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller.", "paper_title": "A Wavelet-Based Adaptive Pole Assignment Method for Structural Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000337689500005"}
