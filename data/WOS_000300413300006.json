Our objective is to design a state estimator for the neuron states through available output measurements such that the error state system is guaranteed to be globally exponentially stable. Based on the linear matrix inequality approach, a delay-dependent condition is developed for the existence of the desired state estimator via a novel Lyapunov functional. The obtained condition has less conservativeness than the existing ones, which is demonstrated by a numerical example.", "paper_title": "State estimation for discrete-time neural networks with time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000300413300006"}
