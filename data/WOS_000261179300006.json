Most previous routing protocols are challenged when used in large dynamic networks as they suffer from either poor scalability or the void problem. In this paper, we propose a new geographic routing protocol, SBFR (Scoped Bellman-Ford Routing), for large dynamic wireless sensor networks. The basic idea is that each node keeps a view scope of the network by computing distance vectors using the distributed Bellman-Ford method, and maintains a cost for routing to the sink. When forwarding a packet, a node picks the node with minimum cost in its routing table as a temporary landmark. While achieving good scalability, it also solves the void problem in an efficient manner through the combination of Bellman-Ford routing and cost-based geographic routing. Analytical and simulation results show that SBFR outperforms other routing protocols not only because of its robustness and scalability but also its practicality and simplicity.", "paper_title": "Scoped Bellman-Ford Geographic Routing for Large Dynamic Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000261179300006"}
