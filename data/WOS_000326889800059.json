This paper proposes an integrated adaptive fuzzy inference system (FIS) to estimate and forecast long-term electricity consumption when prices experience large increase. To this end, first a novel procedure for construction and adaptation of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system (TS-FIS) is suggested. Logarithmic linear regressions are estimated with historical data and used to construct an initial first-order TS-FIS. Then, in the adaptation phase, expert knowledge is used to define new fuzzy rules which form a new secondary FIS for electricity forecasting. To show the applicability and usefulness of the proposed model, it is applied for forecasting of annual electricity consumption in Iran where removing energy subsidies has resulted in a hike in electricity prices. Gross domestic product (GDP), population and electricity price are three inputs for the initial TS-FIS. A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect the expert estimation on possible change in electricity per capita, change in electricity intensity and the ratio of GDP elasticity to population elasticity when price hikes. Based on the information collected, a fuzzy rule base is formed and used to construct the secondary FIS which is used for electricity forecasting until 2016. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed model of this paper is compared with three other models namely ANFIS, ANN and one-stage regression in terms of their mean absolute percentage error. The comparison shows a superior performance for the proposed FIS model.", "paper_title": "A new adaptive fuzzy inference system for electricity consumption forecasting with hike in prices", "paper_id": "WOS:000326889800059"}
