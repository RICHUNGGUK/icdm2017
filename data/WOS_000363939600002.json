The advent of large-scale experimental studies of interactions between members of a target family and a diverse set of possible interaction partners offers the opportunity to address these questions. We develop here a method, DgSpi (data-driven graphical models of specificity in protein:protein interactions), for learning and using graphical models that explicitly represent the amino acid basis for interaction specificity (why) and extend earlier classification-oriented approaches (which) to predict the G of binding (how well). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in analyzing and predicting interactions between a set of 82 PDZ recognition modules against a panel of 217 possible peptide partners, based on data from MacBeath and colleagues. Our predicted G values are highly predictive of the experimentally measured ones, reaching correlation coefficients of 0.69 in 10-fold cross-validation and 0.63 in leave-one-PDZ-out cross-validation. Furthermore, the model serves as a compact representation of amino acid constraints underlying the interactions, enabling protein-level G predictions to be naturally understood in terms of residue-level constraints. Finally, the model DgSpi readily enables the design of new interacting partners, and we demonstrate that designed ligands are novel and diverse.", "paper_title": "Learning Sequence Determinants of Protein: Protein Interaction Specificity with Sparse Graphical Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000363939600002"}
