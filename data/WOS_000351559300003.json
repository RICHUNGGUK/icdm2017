Unlike other existing models, the elastoplastic regime of the present model was modelled using two distinct force-indentation relationships based on experimentally and theoretically established indentation characteristics of the elastoplastic regime. The constants in the model were derived from continuity conditions and indention theory. Simulations of the present model show good prediction of experimental data. Also, an approach for determining the maximum contact force and indentation of an elastoplastic half-space from the impact conditions has been proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
