Two sub-problems of multi-objective optimal electric power planning namely Optimal Power Flow (OPF) and Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch (ORPD) problems are considered. The OPF and ORPD problems are formulated as a nonlinear constrained multi-objective optimization problem with competing objectives. The performance of multi-objective algorithms are studied and evaluated on the standard IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus test systems. The proposed algorithm provides better results compared with the other algorithms as demonstrated by simulation results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
