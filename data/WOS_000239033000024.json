Our approach consists of volume enhancement, microtubule localization, and boundary segmentation to exploit the unique geometric and photometric properties of microtubules. The enhancement starts with an anisotropic invariant wavelet transform to enhance the microtubules globally, followed by a three-dimensional (3-D) tube-enhancing filter based on Weingarten matrix to further accentuate the tubular structures locally. The enhancement ends with a modified coherence-enhancing diffusion to complete the interruptions along the microtubules. The microtubules are then localized with a centerline extraction algorithm adapted for tubular objects. To perform segmentation, we novelly modify and extend active shape model method. We first use 3-D local surface enhancement to characterize the microtubule boundary and improve shape searching by relating the boundary strength with the weight matrix of the searching error. We then integrate the active shape model with Kalman filtering to utilize the longitudinal smoothness along the microtubules. The segmentation improved in this way is robust against missing boundaries and outliers that are often present in the tomography volume. Experimental results demonstrate that our automated method produces results close to those by manual process and uses only a fraction of the time of the latter.", "paper_title": "Model-based automated extraction of microtubules from electron tomography volume", "paper_id": "WOS:000239033000024"}
