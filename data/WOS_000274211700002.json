Our error analysis provides two new error estimates which present a direct relationship between the error in the reconstructed fluorophore concentration and the discretization of the forward and inverse problems. In this paper, based on these error estimates, we develop two new adaptive mesh generation algorithms for the numerical solutions of the forward and inverse problems in FDOT, with the objective of error reduction in the reconstructed optical images due to discretization while keeping the size of the discretized forward and inverse problems within the allowable limits. We present three-dimensional numerical simulations to demonstrate the improvements in accuracy, resolution and detectability of small heterogeneities in reconstructed images provided by the use of the new adaptive mesh generation algorithms. Finally, we compare our algorithms both analytically and numerically with the existing conventional adaptive mesh generation algorithms.", "paper_title": "Discretization Error Analysis and Adaptive Meshing Algorithms for Fluorescence Diffuse Optical Tomography: Part II", "paper_id": "WOS:000274211700002"}
