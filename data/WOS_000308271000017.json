Traditional classification techniques assign only one class (e.g., water, soil, grass) to each pixel of remote sensing images. However, the area covered by one pixel contains more than one surface component and results in the mixture of these surface components. In such situations, classical classification is not acceptable for many major applications, such as environmental monitoring, agriculture, mineral exploration and mining, etc. Most methods proposed for treating this problem have been developed for hyperspectral images. On the contrary, there are very few automatic techniques suited to multispectral images. In this paper, we propose new unsupervised spatial methods (called 2D-Corr-NLS and 2D-Corr-NMF) in order to unmix each pixel of a multispectral image for better recognizing the surface components constituting the observed scene. These methods are related to the blind source separation (BSS) problem, and are based on sparse component analysis (SCA), clustering and non-negativity constraints. Our approach consists in first identifying the mixing matrix involved in this BSS problem, by using the first stage of a spatial correlation-based SCA method with very limited source sparsity constraints, combined with clustering. Non-negative least squares (NLS) or non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) methods are then used to extract spatial sources. An important advantage of our proposed methods is their applicability to the possibly globally underdetermined, but locally (over)determined BSS model in multispectral remote sensing images. Experiments based on realistic synthetic mixtures and real multispectral images collected by the Landsat ETM+ and the Formosat-2 sensors are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. We also show that our methods significantly outperform the sequential maximum angle convex cone (SMACC) method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
