The methanol can be used directly for powering Otto engines or fuel cells; it is commonly used in biodiesel production for its reactivity. Biohydrogen is a replacement for fossil and biorenewable liquid fuels. Based on a mechanism composed by 20 reversible elementary reactions among 8 reactive species, we propose a reduction process to obtain the mechanism of hydrogen, and from 129 reversible elementary reactions among 23 reactive species, we obtain a reduced mechanism for the methanol. Therefore, the aim of this work is the development of an algorithm consisting of 7 steps, which eliminates the fastest reactions of the reaction mechanism since the slowest reactions are rate-determining. The main advantage of the strategy is the decrease of the work needed to solve the system of chemical equations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
