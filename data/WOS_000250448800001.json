Consequence of these conditions include optimality of perfect codes with respect to the Zheng-Tse diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT), as well as excellent low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance. Yet perfect space-time codes have been constructed only for two, three, four, and six transmit antennas. In this paper, we construct perfect codes for all channel dimensions, present some additional attributes of this class of ST codes, and extend the notion of a perfect code to the rectangular case.", "paper_title": "Perfect space-time codes for any number of antennas", "paper_id": "WOS:000250448800001"}
