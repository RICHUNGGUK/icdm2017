In particular, an eye-in-hand web camera is employed to visually track the target object while a stereo camera is used to measure the depth information online. A modified image-based controller is developed to utilize the information from the two cameras. In addition, a rule base is integrated into the visual servo controller to adaptively tune its gain based on the image deviation data so as to improve the response speed of the controller. A physical mobile manipulation system is developed and the developed IBVS controller is implemented. The experimental results obtained using the systems validate the developed approach.
