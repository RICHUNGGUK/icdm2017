However, the inter-channel spectrum sensing moments are more likely to be asynchronous, which risks PU suffering more interference. Moreover, the spectrum sensing is usually erroneous, which renders the problem more complex. To address this problem, we propose a proactive FH based DSA method against both erroneous spectrum sensing and asynchronous inter-channel spectrum sensing (moments). We term it as proactive DSA. The optimal FH sequence is obtained by dynamic programming. The complexity is also analyzed. Finally, the simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A Proactive Dynamic Spectrum Access Method against both Erroneous Spectrum Sensing and Asynchronous Inter-Channel Spectrum Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000300519400020"}
