In this paper, we deal with topology optimization problems formulated directly with the design objective of minimizing the sound power radiated from the structural surface(s) into a surrounding acoustic medium. Bi-material elastic continuum structures without material damping are considered. The structural vibrations are excited by time-harmonic external mechanical loading with prescribed frequency and amplitude. It is assumed that air is the acoustic medium and that a feedback coupling to the structure can be neglected. Certain conditions are assumed that imply that the sound power emission from the structural surface can be obtained in a simpler way than by solving Helmholz' integral equation. Hereby, the computational cost of the structural-acoustical analysis is substantially reduced. Several numerical results are presented and discussed for plate- and pipe-like structures with different sets of boundary and loading conditions.", "paper_title": "Minimization of sound radiation from vibrating bi-material structures using topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000244689200003"}
