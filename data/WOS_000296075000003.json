Several motifs for the tile system have been realized so far, although there are some limitations in design. Here we introduce a new tile system based on a DNA motif called 'T-motif', which complies with several design requirements for DNA algorithmic self-assembly. The tile system based on the T-motif has several characteristics arising from a structural difference with other existing motifs. Discussed are details of the structure, a design of tile sets, and some experimental results of algorithmic self-assembly as a demonstration to show the possibility for an implementation of one-dimensional cellular automata using this motif.", "paper_title": "Algorithmic Self-assembly of Single-duplex DNA Nanostructures", "paper_id": "WOS:000296075000003"}
