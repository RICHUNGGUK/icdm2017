The mixing cases investigated were the non-baffled configuration with Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids, and the baffled configuration with only Newtonian fluids. The study focused on the effect of the impeller bottom clearance and the Reynolds number on the power characteristics, the distribution of shear rates and the overall flow conditions in the vessel. It was found that the bottom clearance plays a significant role on the power consumption, and that the value of the Reynolds number and the power law index strongly affect the axial pumping efficiency and the shear rate profile. The best performance was obtained when the impeller Reynolds number is superior to 10. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
