Need for comprehensive and consistent modeling is apparent, and this work presents a contribution in this direction. The extension of a recently developed civil infrastructure simulation framework to the evaluation of resilience, as well as the introduction of a new infrastructure network-based resilience metric represent the novelties of the article and allow one to explore the effect that sources of uncertainty and key vulnerability factors have on the probability distribution of resilience.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic Assessment of Civil Infrastructure Resilience to Earthquakes", "paper_id": "WOS:000356620500007"}
