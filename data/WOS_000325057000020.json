In addition, a technique termed 'element addition' is developed to improve the computational efficiency of both static and dynamic LDFE analyses that involve moving boundaries. The RITSS approach is based on frequent mesh generation to avoid element distortion. In dynamic RITSS, the field variables mapped from the old to the new mesh involve not only the stresses and material properties, but also the nodal velocities and accelerations. Using the element addition technique, new soil elements are attached to the domain boundaries periodically when the soil near the boundaries becomes affected by large displacements of the structure. The procedures of this Abaqus-based dynamic LDFE analysis and element addition technique are detailed, and the robustness of the techniques is validated and assessed through three example analyses: penetration of a flat footing-into a half-space and movement of rigid and deformable landslides down slopes.
