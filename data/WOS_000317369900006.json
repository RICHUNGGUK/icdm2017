The study investigates the patterns of interaction between tutors and students in both platforms, including the manner in which tutors and students engage during the tutoring sessions. The students' experiences and perceptions of e-tutoring interventions are also explored. The findings reveal that although the two modes of tutoring were equally effective (both groups showed improvement in their grammar performance, with no discernible difference between the two groups), the F2F group members overcame their negative feelings toward English to a greater extent than the TB group members. Interestingly, although the findings reveal that the TB tutors engaged in more tutoring strategies than the F2F tutors, the F2F students perceived more self-improvement in their English performance and were more likely to evaluate the tutors and the e-tutoring program positively than the TB group. The paper concludes by offering some recommendations for future studies on different tutoring modes using computer conferencing. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
