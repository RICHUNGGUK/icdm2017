CPSO has been used in different applications, e.g., partitional clustering and project scheduling problems, and it has shown a very good performance. In partitional clustering problem, CPSO needs to determine the number of clusters in advance. However, in many clustering problems, the correct number of clusters is unknown, and it is usually impossible to estimate. In this paper, an improved version, called CPSOII, is proposed as a dynamic clustering algorithm, which automatically finds the best number of clusters and simultaneously categorizes data objects. CPSOII uses a renumbering procedure as a preprocessing step and several extended PSO operators to increase population diversity and remove redundant particles. Using the renumbering procedure increases the diversity of population, speed of convergence and quality of solutions. For performance evaluation, we have examined CPSOII using both artificial and real data. Experimental results show that CPSOII is very effective, robust and can solve clustering problems successfully with both known and unknown number of clusters. Comparing the obtained results from CPSOII with CPSO and other clustering techniques such as KCPSO, CGA and K-means reveals that CPSOII yields promising results. For example, it improves 9.26 % of the value of DBI criterion for Hepato data set.", "paper_title": "Dynamic clustering using combinatorial particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000316008400003"}
