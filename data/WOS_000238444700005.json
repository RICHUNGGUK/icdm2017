By approximating distant potential fields originating at closely spaced sources in a certain way, the preconditioner is given properties similar to, or better than, those of a standard least squares approximate inverse preconditioner while its setup cost is only that of a diagonal block approximate inverse preconditioner. Numerical experiments on iterative solutions of linear systems with up to four million unknowns illustrate how the new preconditioner drastically outperforms standard approximate inverse preconditioners of otherwise similar construction, and especially so when the preconditioners are very sparse.", "paper_title": "Approximate inverse preconditioners for some large dense random electrostatic interaction matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000238444700005"}
