The design is based on MOSFETs translinear principle in strong inversion. A new compensation technique to minimize the second order effects caused by carrier mobility reduction in short channel MOSFETs is proposed. Tanner T-spice simulation tool is used to confirm the functionality of the proposed design in 0.18 A mu m CMOS process technology. Simulation results indicate that the maximum linearity error is 1.2 %; power consumption is 326 A mu W and bandwidth of 340 MHz.", "paper_title": "A CMOS current-mode squaring circuit free of error resulting from carrier mobility reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000342426000004"}
