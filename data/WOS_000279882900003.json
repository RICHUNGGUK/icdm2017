Major differences between our algorithm and conventional label-equivalence-based algorithms are: (1) all conventional label-equivalence-based algorithms scan all pixels in the given image at least twice, whereas our algorithm scans background pixels once and object pixels twice; (2) all conventional label-equivalence-based algorithms assign a provisional label to each object pixel in the first scan and relabel the pixel in the later scan(s), whereas our algorithm assigns a provisional label to each run in the first scan, and after resolving label equivalences between runs, by using the recorded run data, it assigns each object pixel a final label directly. That is, in our algorithm, relabeling of object pixels is not necessary any more. Experimental results demonstrated that our algorithm is highly efficient on images with many long runs and/or a small number of object pixels. Moreover, our algorithm is directly applicable to run-length-encoded images, and we can obtain contours of connected components efficiently.", "paper_title": "A RUN-BASED ONE-AND-A-HALF-SCAN CONNECTED-COMPONENT LABELING ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000279882900003"}
