Only natural landmarks provided by a feature tracking algorithm will be considered, without the help of visual beacons or landmarks with known positions. First, it is described a monocular visual odometer which could be used as a backup system when the accuracy of GPS is reduced to critical levels. Homography-based techniques are used to compute the UAV relative translation and rotation by means of the images gathered by an onboard camera. The analysis of the problem takes into account the stochastic nature of the estimation and practical implementation issues. The visual odometer is then integrated into a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) scheme in order to reduce the impact of cumulative errors in odometry-based position estimation approaches. Novel prediction and landmark initialization for SLAM in UAVs are presented. The paper is supported by an extensive experimental work where the proposed algorithms have been tested and validated using real UAVs.", "paper_title": "Vision-Based Odometry and SLAM for Medium and High Altitude Flying UAVs", "paper_id": "WOS:000264484900009"}
