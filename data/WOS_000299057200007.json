They proved that the projection median in a\"e(2) provides a better approximation of the two-dimensional Euclidean median than the center of mass or the rectilinear median, while maintaining a fixed degree of stability. In this paper we study the projection median of a set of points in a\"e (d) for d >= 2. Using results from geometric measure theory we show that the d-dimensional projection median provides a (d/pi)B(d/2,1/2)-approximation to the d-dimensional Euclidean median, where B(alpha,beta) denotes the Beta function. We also show that the stability of the d-dimensional projection median is at least 1/(d/pi)B(d/2, 1/2) and its breakdown point is 1/2. Based on the stability bound and the breakdown point, we compare the d-dimensional projection median with the rectilinear median and the center of mass, as a candidate for approximating the d-dimensional Euclidean median. For the special case of d=3, our results imply that the three-dimensional projection median is a (3/2)-approximation of the three-dimensional Euclidean median, which settles a conjecture posed by Durocher.", "paper_title": "The Projection Median of a Set of Points in R-d", "paper_id": "WOS:000299057200007"}
