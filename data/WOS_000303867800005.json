Hadoop, a state-of-the-art open source project, is by far the most successful realization of MapReduce framework. While MapReduce is easy- to-use, efficient and reliable for data-intensive computations, the excessive configuration parameters in Hadoop impose unexpected challenges on running various workloads with a Hadoop cluster effectively. Consequently, developers who have less experience with the Hadoop configuration system may devote a significant effort to write an application with poor performance, either because they have no idea how these configurations would influence the performance, or because they are not even aware that these configurations exist. There is a pressing need for comprehensive analysis and performance modeling to ease MapReduce application development and guide performance optimization under different Hadoop configurations. In this paper, we propose a statistical analysis approach to identify the relationships among workload characteristics, Hadoop configurations and workload performance. We apply principal component analysis and cluster analysis to 45 different metrics, which derive relationships between workload characteristics and corresponding performance under different Hadoop configurations. Regression models are also constructed that attempt to predict the performance of various workloads under different Hadoop configurations. Several non-intuitive relationships between workload characteristics and performance are revealed through our analysis and the experimental results demonstrate that our regression models accurately predict the performance of MapReduce workloads under different Hadoop configurations.", "paper_title": "MapReduce Workload Modeling with Statistical Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000303867800005"}
