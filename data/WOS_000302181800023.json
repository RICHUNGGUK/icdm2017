Due to the edge-preserving feature of total variation (TV), variational models with TV regularization have attracted much interest in reducing speckles. Algorithms based on the augmented Lagrangian function have been proposed to efficiently solve speckle-reduction variational models with TV regularization. However, these algorithms require inner iterations or inverses involving the Laplacian operator at each iteration. In this paper, we adapt Tseng's alternating minimization algorithm with a shifting technique to efficiently remove the speckle without any inner iterations or inverses involving the Laplacian operator. The proposed method is very simple and highly parallelizable; therefore, it is very efficient to despeckle huge-size SAR images. Numerical results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for speckle-reduction variational models with a TV regularizer in terms of central-processing-unit time.", "paper_title": "Alternating Minimization Algorithm for Speckle Reduction With a Shifting Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000302181800023"}
