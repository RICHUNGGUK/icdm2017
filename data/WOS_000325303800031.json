In this paper, by considering possible network-induced delays and packet dropouts in either or both of the sensor-to-controller link and the controller-to-actuator link, we present a group of flexible conditions on the network transmission and the controller to guarantee that the data set of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networked control system with no external excitation in the closed-loop is informative. These conditions offer adjustable trade-off between the requirements on the network transmission and the controller by tuning a free parameter. Simulation studies are given to validate the theoretical results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
