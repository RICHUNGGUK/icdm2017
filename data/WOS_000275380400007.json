This paper will describe experiments that examine the evolution of such excursions in erbium doped fiber amplifier based systems with reconfigured channel assignment at transparent nodes along the propagation path. The primary physical effects that couple excursions between different channels will be identified and characterized in terms of the channel loading, distance, time, and radio frequency (RF) dependence.
