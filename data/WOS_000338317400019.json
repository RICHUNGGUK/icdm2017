To detect and respond to them, malwares must first be detected by security monitoring system. In particular, availability of a method to detect and predict such malwares in advance will lead to preventing security incidents. This study will propose a method of prediction based on intrusion detection event and a functional configuration to realize the method and will assess the prediction model based on intrusion detection events proposed through a test consisting of the stages of learning, prediction and evaluation.", "paper_title": "A study on cyber threat prediction based on intrusion detection event for APT attack detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000338317400019"}
