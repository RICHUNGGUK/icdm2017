One side effect of modern technology is termed technostress, which refers to the \"negative impact on attitudes, thoughts, behaviors, or body physiology that is caused either directly or indirectly by technology\" (Well and Rosen, 1997). Based on social cognitive theory, this study developed a conceptual model in which computer-related technostress was studied as consequences of computer self-efficacy and technology dependence. Results show that (a) employees with higher level of computer self-efficacy have lower level of computer-related technostress, (b) employees with higher level of technology dependence have higher level of computer-related technostress, and (c) employees under different individual situations may perceive different levels of technostress. Contributions of this research and implications for theory and managerial practice are also discussed.", "paper_title": "The Impact of Computer Self-Efficacy and Technology Dependence on Computer-Related Technostress: A Social Cognitive Theory Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000299772300001"}
