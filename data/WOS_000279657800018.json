An interesting class of continuous superpositions is defined by a Gamma mixing distribution which can define long memory processes. In contrast, previously studied discrete superpositions cannot generate this behaviour. Efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian inference are developed which allow the estimation of such models with leverage effects. The continuous superposition model is applied to both stock index and exchange rate data. The continuous superposition model is compared with a two-component superposition on the daily Standard and Poor's 500 index from 1980 to 2000. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
