The result extends an earlier result of Z. Chen on the trace of binary sequences derived from Fermat quotients modulo a prime. However, the case of composite modulus brings some interesting twists. Trace representation can help us producing the sequences efficiently and analyzing their cryptographic properties, such as linear complexity.", "paper_title": "Trace representation of pseudorandom binary sequences derived from Euler quotients", "paper_id": "WOS:000363951300005"}
