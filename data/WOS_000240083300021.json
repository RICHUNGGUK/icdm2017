Quantitatively measure the influence of these two kinds of perturbation on the input/output mapping relationship of fuzzy system has great significance, theoretically and practically. In this paper, a statistical-based quantitative measurement for input and rule perturbation is proposed. By using the proposed approach, influence of perturbations on fuzzy system can be computed quantitatively, analytically and efficiently. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Quantitative measurement for fuzzy system to input and rule perturbations", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300021"}
