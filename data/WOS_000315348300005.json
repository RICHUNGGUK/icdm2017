However, users' adoption intention of mobile TV may decrease with their poor experience caused by the lack of usability, such as small screens and slow response. Drawing upon the flow theory, this research examined mobile TV user adoption. The results indicated that perceived ease of use, access speed and content quality have significant effects on the flow experience, which involves three dimensions: perceived enjoyment, perceived control and attention focus. In turn, flow experience affects perceived usefulness and usage intention. Thus, service providers need to present an engaging experience to users in order to facilitate their adoption and usage of mobile TV.", "paper_title": "The effect of flow experience on user adoption of mobile TV", "paper_id": "WOS:000315348300005"}
