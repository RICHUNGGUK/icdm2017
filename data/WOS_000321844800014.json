Multiobjective analysis deals with these problems locating trade-offs between different optimal solutions. Regarding graph search problems, several algorithms based on best-first and depth-first approaches have been proposed to return the set of all Pareto optimal solutions. This article presents a detailed comparison between two representatives of multiobjective depth-first algorithms, PIDMOA* and MO-DF-BnB. Both of them extend previous single-objective search algorithms with linear-space requirements to the multiobjective case. Experimental analyses on their time performance over tree-shaped search spaces are presented. The results clarify the fitness of both algorithms to parameters like the number or depth of goal nodes.", "paper_title": "A comparison of multiobjective depth-first algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000321844800014"}
