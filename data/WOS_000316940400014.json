The proposed model is based on a hybridization of fuzzy sets theory, Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) and compromise solution method. First, linguistic variables are employed to assess performance ratings of alternatives and weights of criteria represented in trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Then, a new version of the GRA is introduced to solve group decision making problems with conventional fuzzy information, in which correlations are captured between the reference/aspiration-level criteria and alternatives. Consequently, a new ranking index is presented based on the concept of the compromise solution to obtain the ranking order of all alternatives. The solution is determined in terms of several conflicting criteria by considering the degree of grey relation to both the positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions concurrently. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to verify the FG-MCGDM model and to demonstrate its suitability in manufacturing systems.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy grey model based on the compromise ranking for multi-criteria group decision making problems in manufacturing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000316940400014"}
