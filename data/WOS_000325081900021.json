However, the conventional method of successive substitution is quite time-consuming. In this work, a continuous predicting method (CPM) is developed for fast determination of CSS in SMB. In CPM, the direct prediction of state variable at CSS and solving model equation are conducted alternately until CSS is reached. In order to give a guideline for the selection of the acceleration factor, CPM is applied on SMB process for enantioseparation of 1,1'-bi-2-naphtol racemate and with the optimized acceleration factor, 59% of computation time saved compared with successive substitution. In addition, this method is further successfully used in a sugar separation process. Given its efficiency and simplicity, this method could provide a useful tool for SMB simulations.
