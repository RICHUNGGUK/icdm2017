MCC takes advantage of the powerful computation and storage capability of cloud servers by offloading heavy computing or storing tasks from mobile devices to cloud servers to keep a thin frontend on the mobile devices. Such benefit is important to MCC leveraging various sensors equipped in modern mobile devices. We explore the sensing capability of MCC and design an application framework that enables a class of exciting mobile applications to be developed in the sensing-oriented MCC environment. A critical issue in such an environment is accountability. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the accountability issues in this new computing context and show how the accountability function is integrated into the application framework.", "paper_title": "An Accountable Framework for Sensing-Oriented Mobile Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000342605500012"}
