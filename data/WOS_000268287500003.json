The solutions envisaged must have a negligible impact on the vehicle geometry. In this context, flow control by continuous suction is seen as a promising alternative. The control configurations identified during a previous 2D numerical analysis are adapted for this purpose and are tested on a 3D geometry. A local suction system located on the upper part of the rear window is capable of eliminating the rear window separation on simplified fastback car geometry. Aerodynamic drag reductions close to 17% have been obtained.
