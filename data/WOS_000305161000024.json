The SPSA allows the near-global optimization of the machining error, even though the corresponding objective is not formulated as a closed-form representation. It adjusts all cutter locations of a tool path simultaneously, and reduces the induced deviation by not considering the CNC interpolation in the tool path planning. The resultant tool path produces a smaller error compared with the greedy approach that was adopted by several previous studies. This study provides a simple but systematic mechanism for machining error control in 5-axis flank milling.", "paper_title": "IMPROVED TOOL POSITIONING IN 5-AXIS FLANK MILLING BY SIMULTANEOUS PERTURBATION STOCHASTIC APPROXIMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000305161000024"}
