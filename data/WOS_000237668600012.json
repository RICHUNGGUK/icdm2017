This is used by the Subnet Bandwidth Management (SBM) protocol, an RSVP-based protocol that provides IntServ-like services at Ethernet level. This paper proposes an alternative way to quality of service provision and resource allocation in Ethernet networks, based on the emerging IETF NSIS framework. The proposed approach was validated as a proof of concept by simulation, showing the ability of NSIS to provide QoS differentiation in Ethernet scenarios.", "paper_title": "NSIS-based quality of service and resource allocation in ethernet networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237668600012"}
