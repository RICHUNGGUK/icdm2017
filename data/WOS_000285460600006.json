However, the available spectrum changes dynamically with the primary user (PU) activity, necessitating frequent PU sensing coordination and exchanging network topology information in a multihop CR ad hoc network. To facilitate these tasks, an always-on, out-of-band common control channel (CCC) design is proposed that uses noncontiguous OFDM subcarriers placed within the guard bands separating the channels of the licensed spectrum. First, the task of choosing the OFDM-specific parameters, including the number, power, and bandwidth of the subcarriers is formulated as a feasibility problem to ensure that the CCC does not adversely interfere with the PU operation. Second, for unicast messaging between a given pair of users, a subset of the guard bands may be chosen, which allows an additional measure of protection for the adjacent PU spectrum. For this, the multiarm bandit algorithm is used that allows the guard band selection to evolve over time based on the observed interference from the PU. Results reveal that our proposed CCC ensures connectivity and improved PU protection with a limited trade-off in data rate when compared to frequency-hopping and cluster-based CCC schemes.", "paper_title": "OFDM-Based Common Control Channel Design for Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000285460600006"}
