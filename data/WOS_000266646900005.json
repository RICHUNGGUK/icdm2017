To extract complex linguistic data summaries, the LOWA operator is used from fuzzy logic and some numerical examples are also provided in this paper. To obtain a complex linguistic data summary with a higher truth degree, genetic algorithms are applied to optimize the number and membership functions of linguistic terms and to select a part of truth degrees for aggregations, in which linguistic terms are represented by the 2-tuple linguistic representation model.
