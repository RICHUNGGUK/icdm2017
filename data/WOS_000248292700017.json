Visualization techniques employed in this study include Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Result for the sloshing period is compared with the theoretical result of a small time-harmonic irrotational flow of an inviscid and incompressible fluid, and several results for 3D view of the rotary sloshing and the velocity vector in the vertical and horizontal cross-sections are given.", "paper_title": "Self-induced rotary sloshing caused by an upward round jet in a cylindrical container", "paper_id": "WOS:000248292700017"}
