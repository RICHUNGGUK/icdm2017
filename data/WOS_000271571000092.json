The experimental database used for NF modeling is based on a laboratory study of saturated mixtures with various mix ratios under a 100 kPa effective stress. Emphasis was placed on assessing the role of fines content in mixture and strain level on the deviatoric stress and pore water pressure generation in a 100 mm diameter triaxial testing apparatus. The input variables in the developed rule based NF models are the Leighton Buzzard Sand fraction E content, and strain, and the outputs are deviatoric stress, pore water pressure generation and undrained Young's modulus. Experimental results show that Leighton Buzzard Sand fraction B and Leighton Buzzard Sand fraction E mixtures exhibits clay-like behavior due to particle-particle effects with the increase in Leighton Buzzard Sand fraction E content. It is also shown that the performance of capacities of proposed NF models are quite satisfactory. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
