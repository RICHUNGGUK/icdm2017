However, the worst case execution time (WCET) of the tasks scheduled by DVS must be known ahead of time to ensure their schedulability. In reality, a system's workloads may change significantly without satisfying any prediction. In other words, a task's WCET may not provide useful information about its future real execution time (RET). This paper presents a novel Dynamic-Mode EDF scheduling algorithm when workloads change significantly. One of the Single-Mode, Dual-Mode, and Three-Mode frequency setting formats can be applied, based on the RET and the accumulated slack at run-time. Only one combination of the number of modes/speeds, speed-switching transition points, and the frequency scaling factor for each mode can lead to the best energy saving. Experimental results show that, given an RET pattern, our Dynamic-Mode DVS algorithm achieves an average 15% energy savings over the traditional two-mode DVS scheme on hard real-time systems. Additionally, we also consider speed-switching or energy transition overhead, and implement a preliminary test of our proposed algorithm. With a less aggressive voltage scaling strategy (fewer speed changes for each job), deadlines can still be strictly satisfied and an average of 14% energy consumption saving over a non-DVS scheme is observed.", "paper_title": "A dynamic voltage scaling algorithm for dynamic workloads", "paper_id": "WOS:000255742500004"}
