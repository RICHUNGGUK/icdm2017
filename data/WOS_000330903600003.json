Compared to controls, cortical excitability was higher in the isolated seizure group at 250-300 ms. Compared to epilepsy, cortical excitability was lower in patients with isolated seizures also at 250 and 300 ms. Lowered seizure threshold caused by disturbances within inhibitory circuits is present in patients who experience a seizure even if no further seizures occur.", "paper_title": "ON THE MIDWAY TO EPILEPSY: IS CORTICAL EXCITABILITY NORMAL IN PATIENTS WITH ISOLATED SEIZURES?", "paper_id": "WOS:000330903600003"}
