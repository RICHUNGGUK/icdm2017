The PSD is formulated as a discrete optimization problem by removing all negative minima with minimum cost. Experiments show that our PSD is perceptually relevant and robust against distortion and hand variations, and thus improves the recognition system performance.", "paper_title": "Hand Gesture Recognition Based on Perceptual Shape Decomposition with a Kinect Camera", "paper_id": "WOS:000326409300033"}
