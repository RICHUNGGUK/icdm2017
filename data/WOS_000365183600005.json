We show here that these two notions can be simply characterized geometrically: through orthogonality between certain affine subspaces. We also use this characterization to study operations preserving hereditary bijectiveness, and to provide effective methods for constructing hereditarily bijective maps and even or odd self-dual networks.", "paper_title": "Asynchronous Boolean networks and hereditarily bijective maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000365183600005"}
