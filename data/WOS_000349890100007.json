The designed scheme tries to explore the effect of the power allocation for the SLNR precoded multiuser multiple-input single-output system on sum capacity performance. This power allocation problem can be formulated as an optimization problem. With high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio assumption, it can be converted into a convex optimization problem through the geometric programming and hence can be solved efficiently. Because the assumption of high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio cannot be always satisfied in practice, we design a globally optimal solution algorithm based on a combination of branch and bound framework and convex relaxation techniques. Theoretically, the proposed scheme can provide optimal power allocation in sum capacity maximization. Then, we further propose a judgement-decision algorithm to achieve a trade-off between the optimality and computational complexity. The simulation results also show that, with the proposed scheme, the sum capacity of all the users can be improved compared with three existing power allocation schemes. Meanwhile, some meaningful conclusions about the effect of the further power allocation based on the SLNR precoding have been also acquired. The performance improvement of the maximum sum capacity power allocation scheme relates to the transmit antenna number and embodies different variation trends in allusion to the different equipped transmit antenna number as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) changes.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Power allocation scheme based on sum capacity maximization for signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio precoded multiuser multiple-input single-output downlink", "paper_id": "WOS:000349890100007"}
