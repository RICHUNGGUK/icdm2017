We encode an instance of a \"problem\" as a pot of such tiles for which a \"solution\" is an assembled complete complex without any free sticky ends. Using the number of tiles in an assembled complex as a measure of complexity we show how NTIME classes (such as NP and NEXP) can be represented with corresponding classes of the model.
