We first obtain Laplace transform of the problem and then we find numerical inversion of Laplace transform by improved operational matrix of integration. Numerical examples show that the approximate solutions have a good degree of accuracy.", "paper_title": "A direct method to solve integral and integro-differential equations of convolution type by using improved operational matrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000319179800004"}
