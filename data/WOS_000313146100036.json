But there are little architecture presented to support both LDPC and Turbo codes, especially by the means of ASIC. This paper have implemented a common architecture that can decode LDPC and Turbo codes, and it is capable of supporting the WiMAX, WiFi, 3GPP-LTE standard on the same hardware. In this paper, we will carefully describe how to share memory and logic devices in different operation mode. The chip is design in a 130 nm CMOS technology, and the maximum clock frequency can reach up to 160 MHz. The maximum throughput is about 104 Mbps@5.5 iteration for Turbo codes and 136 Mbps@10iteration for LDPC codes. Comparing to other existing structure, the design speed, area have significant advantage.", "paper_title": "A Flexible Architecture for TURBO and LDPC Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000313146100036"}
