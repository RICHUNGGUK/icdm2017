A simple iterative procedure which involves the successive solution of linear programming sub-problems is presented in the paper. Using the procedure a specially modified Mohr-Coulomb failure surface is adopted at each contact interface, with all failure surfaces updated at each iteration until a converged solution is obtained. The procedure is applied to problems from the literature and also to new, considerably larger, benchmark problems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
