The set-valued mapping in the system is assumed to be upper semi-continuous, closed, convex, bounded and monotone. The full-order and reduced-order observers are designed to make the corresponding error systems exponentially stable in the mean square, respectively. The criteria are given to guarantee the existence of both full-order and reduced-order observers. The rotor system is considered as an example to show the validity of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Observer design for the Lur'e differential inclusion system with Markovian jumping parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000320191500014"}
