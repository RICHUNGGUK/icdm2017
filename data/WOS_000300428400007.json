Hence, it is important to make the most effective use of the time assigned and minimize the time that students spend in activities which can be performed outside the laboratory sessions. Familiarizing with the basic configuration commands is one such activity. We have developed a computer game to allow students to learn these in a motivating and pleasant environment. This game has been designed so that rules are easily learned and both cooperative and competitive learning are promoted. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
