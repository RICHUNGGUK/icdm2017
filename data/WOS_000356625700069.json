There is thus a high demand to develop computational methods capable of detecting these potential interacting targets efficiently. Results: As biologically annotated chemical data are becoming increasingly available, it becomes feasible to explore such existing knowledge to identify potential ligand-target interactions. Here, we introduce an online implementation of a recently published computational model for target prediction, TarPred, based on a reference library containing 533 individual targets with 179 807 active ligands. TarPred accepts interactive graphical input or input in the chemical file format of SMILES. Given a query compound structure, it provides the top ranked 30 interacting targets. For each of them, TarPred not only shows the structures of three most similar ligands that are known to interact with the target but also highlights the disease indications associated with the target. This information is useful for understanding the mechanisms of action and toxicities of active compounds and can provide drug repositioning opportunities.", "paper_title": "TarPred: a web application for predicting therapeutic and side effect targets of chemical compounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000356625700069"}
