Hybrid ecologies are new class of digital ecology that merge multiple environments, physical and digital, together. Collaboration in these emerging environments is characterized by 'fragmented interaction' in that it is mediated by interaction mechanisms that are differentially distributed. Unpacking the collaborative nature of fragmented interaction requires that we uncover the ordinary interactional competences that users exploit to make differentially distributed mechanisms of interaction work and the distributed practices that articulate 'seamful' representations and provide for awareness and coordination.", "paper_title": "Hybrid ecologies: understanding cooperative interaction in emerging physical-digital environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000259008600001"}
