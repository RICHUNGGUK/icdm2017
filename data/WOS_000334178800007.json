The so-called non-quadratic membership-dependent Lyapunov function is first proposed, which is formulated in a higher order form of both the system states and the normalized membership functions than existing techniques in the literature. Then, new membership-dependent stability conditions are developed by the new Lyapunov function approach. It is shown that the conservativeness of the obtained criteria can be further reduced as the degree of the Lyapunov function increases. Two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and less conservativeness of the obtained theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Novel Stability Criteria for T-S Fuzzy Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000334178800007"}
