Specially, we first study the MC-RWA problem under the target of minimize maximum hops, an efficient MC-RWA algorithm was proposed for that case. But for the objective of minimizing the total number of wavelength conversions, problem turns out to be NP-hard, we proposed a new approximation MC-RWA algorithm based on group Steiner tree. At last, combining the two objectives, a bi-factor approximation algorithm was introduced to minimize the both targets in the system simultaneously.", "paper_title": "New algorithms for multicast routing and wavelength assignment in multi-hop optical WDM networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000301333100006"}
