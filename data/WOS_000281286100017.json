We study the effective dimension of light transport over a neighborhood on the scene manifold and show that under plausible assumptions the dimensionality is characterized by the spectrum of the spatio-spectral concentration problem. This allows us to improve existing estimates for the dimension in computer graphics using a more insightful derivation and for the first time we obtain optimal representations. The relevance of our results for existing rendering applications is discussed.", "paper_title": "On the Effective Dimension of Light Transport", "paper_id": "WOS:000281286100017"}
