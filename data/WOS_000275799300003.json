In spite of this heterogeneity, seamless intersystem mobility is a mandatory requirement. One of the major challenges for seamless mobility is the creation of a vertical handover scheme, which is for users that move between different types of networks. In this article a seamless mobility handover scheme is presented. The novelty of the proposed scheme is that handover is fully controlled by the terminal. To improve the performance of the proposed handover scheme, a network discovery algorithm with fuzzy logic and a handover decision algorithm using multi criteria decision making (MCDM) based on vague sets are derived, which are both User-centric. With these algorithms, the handover scheme is power-saving, cost-aware, and performance-aware. Simulation results show that the novel handover scheme can perform network discovery in time to reduce handover dropping rate and present unnecessary activation of its interface to save the battery power, while effectively choose the optimum network through making trade-off among the user preference, network condition, and system performance.
