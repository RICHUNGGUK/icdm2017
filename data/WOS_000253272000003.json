We focused on the structure of intracellular water. It is the main unacceptable factor to change volume of cell under low temperature. Because this report is a preliminary study for new organ preservation technology, we considered a simple system that contains only water and hydrogen molecules. We simulated a stability of clathrate hydrate crystal by using a code of molecular dynamics method; MXDTRICL. In this paper, we give a new suggestion to suppress the change of intracellular volume under low temperature.", "paper_title": "The molecular dynamics calculation of clathrate hydrate structure stability for innovative organ preservation method", "paper_id": "WOS:000253272000003"}
