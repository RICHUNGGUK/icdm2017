The data portal allows collaborative users to register and discover distributed datasets across a multi-domain Lambda Grid through a web-service based dataset registry and search engine, and to deliver the discovered datasets through dynamic established lightpaths to specified computing cluster locations for dataset manipulation. The data portal employs the novel Secure Photonic Inter-domain Negotiator (SPIN) as a secure multi-domain control plane to set up dynamic lightpaths between the source and destination clusters for respective storage and manipulation of the discovered datasets over a multi-domain Lambda Grid. The data portal employs lambda-aware middleware and transport protocol to optimize transfer of the discovered datasets over the dynamic established lightpaths. Implementation details and observed performance results from the demonstrations of the SPIN-based Lambda Grid data portal are reported. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
