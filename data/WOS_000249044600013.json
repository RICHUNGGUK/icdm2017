Assuming that some mechanism exists to detect network element failures, the discussion concentrates on protocols that propagate information about customer reachability and how this information reroutes traffic in the event of a fault. Each router holds a database indicating which other routers, and which LR-PONs, are available within the network, and these are synchronized between routers using IP. This information is used to reroute traffic in the event of failure. Simulation and analysis show that signaling time lies well within 50 ms, leaving sufficient time for redirection of user traffic.
