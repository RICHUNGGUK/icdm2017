The proposed scheme is based on the RSA cryptography and the concept of key exchange. It reduces the load of computation on clients to fit the low-power property of clients without yield the security. Through the comparisons with other protocols, we show that the proposed scheme is more suitable to apply in imbalanced wireless communication environment.", "paper_title": "An Advanced Password Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol for Imbalanced Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000285732400012"}
