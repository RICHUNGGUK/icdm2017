The LSM is an effective approach to image the geometrical features of unknown targets from multi-view data collected from measurement of casual waves. This study emphasizes the exploitation of the LSM using spectral finite element method (SFEM). A comprehensive set of numerical simulations on two-dimensional elastodynamic problems is presented to highlight many efficient features of the proposed fast qualitative LSM identification method such as its ability to locate an inclusion (e.g., a crack) and estimate its dimensions.
