As a result, in this paper, we establish an inventory model for the purchaser in which the supplier provides different trade credits. We then solve the inventory problem by using a discounted cash-flow (DCF) approach, characterize the optimal solution, and obtain some theoretical results to find the optimal order quantity and the optimal replenishment time. Finally, we provide several numerical examples to illustrate the results. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
