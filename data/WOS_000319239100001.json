For the deterministic solution, the exact mode and an approximative approach using so called \"cosinusoidal polynomials\" by Filonenko-Borodich are used. Next, the uncertainty is represented by a convex set and subsequently by random variables. The comparison between both uncertainty descriptions is carried out numerically on the level of the design time of the considered beam. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
