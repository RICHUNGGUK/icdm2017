Both currently existing logical-link identifier (LLID) assignment systems [ namely, one LLID per optical network unit (ONU) and one LLID per queue] are examined in depth, and a missing scenario (one LLID per multiqueue) is discussed. Simulation results conducted using C++ based implementation of standard EPON networks with support for extended GATE REPORT MPCP data units (DUs) prove that the design assumptions for both new flow-control messages were met to their fullest extent. The eGATE/eREPORT MPCP DUs allow for per-queue scheduling from the central packet controller in the optical line terminal (OLT) at the cost of ONU-based operation, thereby maintaining the benefits of two standard solutions. The obtained simulation results indicate superiority of the proposed IEEE 802.3ah, clause 64 extension in terms of network resource management, bandwidth efficiency, and system setup flexibility.
