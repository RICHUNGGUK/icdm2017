This SWA is based on the IEEE 1484 LTSA (Learning Technology System Architecture) specification and the software development pattern of the Intelligent Reusable Learning Components Object Oriented (IRLCOO). IRLCOO are a special type of Sharable Content Object (SCO) according to the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM). SCORM 2004 is used to create reusable and interoperable learning content. The SWA that is described in this paper is used to develop anthoring and evaluation tools oriented to offer application level interoperability under the philosophy of Web Services (WS). Other used technology is AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML), this is used for communication between component and LMS's API. Jade, Struts, Servlets, JSPs and JavaBeans implement the functionality of the system under the model MVC. The new component-based model is blended with metadata (SCORM 2004, RDF, XML), to be used for the rule-based inference engine known as Jena and Joseki server for implement a semantic platform.", "paper_title": "A Semantic Web Application to automate the construction of didactic material for Web-Based Education system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624300031"}
