Many uncertainty factors contribute to the dispersion of the estimated mechanical properties of trabecular bone. This study was undertaken in order to propose a computational scheme that will be able to predict the effective apparent elastic moduli of trabecular bone considering the uncertainties that are primarily caused by image-based modelling and trabecular stiffness orientation. The effect of image-based modelling which focused on the connectivity was also investigated. A stochastic multi-scale method using a first-order perturbation-based and asymptotic homogenisation theory was applied to formulate the stochastically apparent elastic properties of trabecular bone. The effective apparent elastic modulus was predicted with the introduction of a coefficient factor to represent the variation of bone characteristics due to inter-individual differences. The mean value of the predicted effective apparent Young's modulus in principal axis was found at approximately 460MPa for respective 15.24% of bone volume fraction, and this is in good agreement with other experimental results. The proposed method may provide a reference for the reliable evaluation of the prediction of the apparent elastic properties of trabecular bone.", "paper_title": "Stochastic multi-scale prediction on the apparent elastic moduli of trabecular bone considering uncertainties of biological apatite (BAp) crystallite orientation and image-based modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000343606800007"}
