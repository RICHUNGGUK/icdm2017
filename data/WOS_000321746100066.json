However, as unwanted protein aggregates are segregated to the cell poles and, after divisions, accumulate at older poles, generate asymmetries in sister cells' vitality. Novel single-molecule detection techniques allow observing aging-related processes in vivo, over multiple generations, informing on the underlying mechanisms. Results: CellAging is a tool to automatically extract information on polar segregation and partitioning in division of aggregates in E. coli, and on cellular vitality. From time-lapse, parallel brightfield and fluorescence microscopy images, it performs cell segmentation, alignment of brightfield and fluorescence images, lineage construction and pole age determination, and it computes aging-related features. We exemplify its use by analyzing spatial distributions of fluorescent protein aggregates from images of cells across generations.", "paper_title": "CellAging: a tool to study segregation and partitioning in division in cell lineages of Escherichia coli", "paper_id": "WOS:000321746100066"}
