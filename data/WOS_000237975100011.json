Such interval ranges may result from uncertainty in the specification of an actor or as a design freedom of the model. Major questions such as consistencyand buffer memory requirementsfor single-processor scheduleswill be analyzed here for such specifications for the first time. Also, metamodeling formulations of interval limited dataflow are discussed, with special emphasis on the application to cyclo-static dataflow modeling.", "paper_title": "Analysis of dataflow programs with interval-limited data-rates", "paper_id": "WOS:000237975100011"}
