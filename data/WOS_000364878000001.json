Motivated by finding reduced power consumption and improved performance of multiple access in UW-ASNs, a multilinear chirp-Code Division Multiple Access (MLC-CDMA) scheme is proposed. The differences between single slope chirp signal and multilinear chirp signal are analyzed in the paper. At the receiving end, a new detection technique called mixing-change rate along with fractional Fourier transform (MCR-FrFT) is proposed to detect the multirate chirp (MRC) signal and reduce complexity of node. There are two steps to realize the detection technique MCR-FrFT. By using the MCR-FrFT, the computation of detection can be decreased to 50% compared with direct FrFT. The simulation results indicate that, using the MCR-FrFT technique, the different users' signal can be separated and detected rapidly.", "paper_title": "Design and Detection of Multilinear Chirp Signals for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000364878000001"}
