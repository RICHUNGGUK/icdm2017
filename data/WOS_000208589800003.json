This paper points out two important features of the random forest implementation cforest available in the party package: The resulting forests are unbiased and thus preferable to the randomForest implementation available in randomForest if predictor variables are of different types. Moreover, a conditional permutation importance measure has recently been added to the party package, which can help evaluate the importance of correlated predictor variables. The rationale of this new measure is illustrated and hands-on advice is given for the usage of recursive partitioning tools in R.", "paper_title": "Party on!", "paper_id": "WOS:000208589800003"}
