The resulting species of importance is ZLA. The reaction equations are given by Akzo Nobel as an Initial Value Problem (IVP). This IVP is a stiff system of six non-linear Differential Algebric Equations (DAEs) of index one. In this paper mathematical description of the problem is presented and the results of solving this problem via Model Maker software is illustrated.", "paper_title": "Chemical Akzo Nobel Problem; Mathematical Description and Its Solution Via Model Maker Software", "paper_id": "WOS:000331850800003"}
