In Escherichia coli, DamMT is involved in multiple aspects of DNA maintenance, replication initiation, daughter chromosome segregation, DNA mismatch repair, gene expression control, etc. The participation of DamMT in such a diverse set of functions required that other genes adapted, or emerged through evolution, in response to the DamMT-induced modification of the genomic environment. One example is SeqA, a protein that senses the methylation status of the origin of replication of the chromosome to control the timing of replication initiation. Interestingly, seqA is only present in a few DamMT-specifying proteobacteria. This observation led us to hypothesize that other genes, specifying related functions, might also be found in these organisms. To test this hypothesis, we implemented a large-scale comparative genomic screen meant to identify genes specifying DNA methylation sensing domains, probably involved in DNA maintenance functions. Results: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of DamMT, identifying two contrasting behaviors of the protein. Based on this phylogeny, we defined precisely a set of genomes, in which the protein activity is likely to be involved in DNA maintenance functions, the 'resident' dam genomes. We defined a second set of genomes, in which DamMT is not resident. We developped a new tool, 'DomainSieve', in order to screen these two sets for protein domains that are strictly associated with 'resident' dam genomes. This approach was rewarding and generated a list of genes, among which some, at least, specify activities with clear linkage to DamMT-dependent DNA methylation and DNA maintenance.", "paper_title": "DomainSieve: a protein domain-based screen that led to the identification of dam-associated genes with potential link to DNA maintenance", "paper_id": "WOS:000239900200002"}
