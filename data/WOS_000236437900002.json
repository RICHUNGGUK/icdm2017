This notion is naturally extended from the monoid case. With this new concept we are able to prove that if a Rees matrix semigroup M[S; I, J; PI has FDT then the semigroup S also has FDT. Given a monoid S and a finitely presented Rees matrix semigroup M[S; I, J; P] we prove that if the ideal of S generated by the entries of P has FDT, then so does M[S; I, J; P]. In particular, we show that, for a finitely presented completely simple semigroup M, the Rees matrix semigroup M = M[S; I, J; P] has FDT if and only if the group S has FDT. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
