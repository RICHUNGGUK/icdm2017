By numerical simulation, we find some inherent laws for the burst phase response curve (BPRC) of the interneuron. The onto Poincare return mapping combined with the phase portrait analysis can be used to explain the inherent properties of the BPRC effectively. For understanding the relationship between phase response curve and synchronization, we compare the synchronization properties of the interneuron with the Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) neuron which has the almost opposite shapes of BPRC to that of the interneuron, and find perfect phase synchronization exists in the interneuron model, but cannot be observed in the HR model under excitatory weak synaptic connectivity.
