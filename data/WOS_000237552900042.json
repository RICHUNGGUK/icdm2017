The proposed method combines the capabilities of classical and photometric stereo, allowing for accurate reconstruction of both textured and non-textured surfaces. In particular, we present a variational method implemented as a PDE-driven surface evolution interleaved with reflectance estimation. The surface is represented on an adaptive mesh allowing topological change. To provide the input data, we have designed a capture setup that simultaneously acquires both viewpoint and light variation while minimizing self-shadowing. Our capture method is feasible for real-world application as it requires a moderate amount of input data and processing time. In experiments, models of people and everyday objects were captured from a few dozen images taken with a consumer digital camera. The capture process recovers a photo-consistent model of spatially varying Lambertian and specular reflectance and a highly accurate geometry.", "paper_title": "Variational shape and reflectance estimation under changing light and viewpoints", "paper_id": "WOS:000237552900042"}
