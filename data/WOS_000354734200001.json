In fingerprint-based positioning, the received signal strengths (RSS) from WLAN access points (APs) usually are regarded as positioning fingerprint to label physical location. However, the RSS variance caused by heterogeneous devices and dynamic environmental status will significantly degrade the positioning accuracy. In this paper, we first show the RSS variance based on a real dataset and analyze the relation existing in the RSS raw values. Then, we utilize both the raw RSS values and their relation to construct a new stable and robust fingerprint for indoor positioning. Experiment results indicate that our method can solve the RSS variance problem without any manual calibration.", "paper_title": "Weight-RSS: A Calibration-Free and Robust Method for WLAN-Based Indoor Positioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000354734200001"}
