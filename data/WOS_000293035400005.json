The exploration of local SAR components and prioritization of compound subsets have thus far mostly relied on graphical analysis methods that capture similarity and potency relationships in a systematic manner. A currently unsolved problem in large-scale SAR analysis is how to automatically select those compound subsets from large data sets that carry most SAP. information. For this purpose, we introduce a numerical optimization scheme that is based on particle swarm optimization guided by an SAR scoring function. The methodology is applied to four large compound sets. We demonstrate that compound subsets representing the most discontinuous local SARs are consistently selected through particle swarm optimization.", "paper_title": "Extraction of Discontinuous Structure-Activity Relationships from Compound Data Sets through Particle Swarm Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000293035400005"}
