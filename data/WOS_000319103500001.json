Using an original analytical approach, the present study establishes a relation enabling the value of this effective radius to be easily computed. The limits of validity of this relation are then discussed and precisely defined. By way of an illustration, an example of how this relation can be used to generate a numerical tool for analysis of the possibilities for machining free-form surfaces on multi-axis machine-tools is also presented.
