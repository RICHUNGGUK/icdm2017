Prior research has shown that person, artifact, and task are important determinants of flow. The present research investigates two aspects of the person, i.e., need for cognition (NFC) and mood, and their relationships with four dimensions of online flow experience. Two studies were conducted. Based on data collected from two different samples, NFC was positively associated with focused attention, control, and curiosity. No significant association was found between NFC and temporal dissociation. Mood was positively associated with all four dimensions. The interaction effect of NFC and mood was also significant. Implications for human-computer interaction research and practice are discussed.", "paper_title": "The role of need for cognition and mood in online flow experience", "paper_id": "WOS:000237466700002"}
