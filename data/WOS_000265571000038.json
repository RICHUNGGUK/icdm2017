In addition to considering groups of individuals of a similar preference pattern, homogeneous groups of objects are also considered, such that within each group there are clustered objects perceived to have similar attributes. A dual latent class model is proposed for a matrix of preference ratings data, which will partition the individuals and the objects into classes, and simultaneously represent the cluster centers in a low dimensional space, while individuals and objects retain their preference relationship. Both the categories achieved and the unfolding configuration are estimated to be simultaneously optimal, by means of a conditional maximum likelihood estimation procedure, in a simulated annealing framework that enables us to take a statistical decision about the parameters of the model. The adjusted BIC statistic is employed to test the number of mixture components, and the dimensionality of the representation. Real and artificial data sets are analyzed to illustrate the model's performance. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
