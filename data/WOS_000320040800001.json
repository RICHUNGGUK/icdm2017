It provides a fast implementation of the most efficient, current algorithms when the input is a dissimilarity index. Moreover, it features memory-saving routines for hierarchical clustering of vector data. It improves both asymptotic time complexity (in most cases) and practical performance (in all cases) compared to the existing implementations in standard software: several R packages, MATLAB, Mathematica, Python with SciPy. The fastcluster package presently has interfaces to R and Python. Part of the functionality is designed as a drop-in replacement for the methods hclust and flashClust in R and scipy. cluster. hierarchy. linkage in Python, so that existing programs can be effortlessly adapted for improved performance.", "paper_title": "fastcluster: Fast Hierarchical, Agglomerative Clustering Routines for R and Python", "paper_id": "WOS:000320040800001"}
