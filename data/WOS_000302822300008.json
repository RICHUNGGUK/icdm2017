Precisely, the proposed solution of k-SAT, k >= 3, uses evolution and communication rules, as well as membranes creation and division of non-elementary membranes; however, it does not use neither polarisations nor membrane dissolution rules. Our solution of MAJORITY-SAT makes use of polarisations as well as evolution and communication rules, together with rules for dividing non-elementary membranes. We also prove that these systems can simulate partially blind register machines; the converse simulation holds for a constrained version of our P systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
