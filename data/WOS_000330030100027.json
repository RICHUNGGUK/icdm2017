The proposed method provides a simple control architecture that merges from the cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) network and hierarchical fuzzy logic; therefore, the complicated CMAC structure can be simplified. The overall adaptive scheme guarantees the uniform stability of the closed-loop system. A simulation is presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical fuzzy CMAC control for nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000330030100027"}
