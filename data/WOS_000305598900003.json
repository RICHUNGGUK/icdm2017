By introducing a basic unit-interval monotonic (BUM) function Q we extract the attitudinal character from a person's information about his/her decision attitude,. and formalize the person's subjective opinions against alternatives as IFVs based on the expected attribute values associated with attitude Q thus transforming a hybrid decision matrix, with full consideration of a person's attitude, into an intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix. The intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators are then used to aggregate the intuitionistic fuzzy attribute values of each alternative and a new approach is employed to rank these intuitionistic fuzzy alternatives based on the amount of information and its reliability. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate the proposed approach and to examine its feasibility and validity. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.
