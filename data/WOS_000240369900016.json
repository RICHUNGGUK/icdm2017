Fracture in the interfacial transition zone (ITZ), between cement paste and aggregate-inclusion, is related to restraint caused by, among others, aggregates that obstruct free deformation of the paste. Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) test results are used as a base for the developed method for measuring shrinkage deformations during drying. Modeling of moisture flow in the heterogeneous samples is numerically performed with Lattice Gas Automata (LGA). Fracture coupling of the LGA and Lattice Fracture Model (LFM) requires coupling with ESEM tests regarding shrinkage coefficient. (c) 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
