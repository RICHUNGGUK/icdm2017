Ambiguity is introduced when enterprise organizations devise natural language specifications to describe the service capabilities. Consequently, consumers often misinterpret operational details while using these services, resulting in unfavorable side-effects. Practical, verifiable, and reusable solutions are required to mitigate these issues.", "paper_title": "Demystifying Data-Centric Web Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000269716300012"}
