A novel joint speech coding and transmission algorithm is proposed by fully exploiting the correlation between speech coding, channel coding and the transmission process. The proposed algorithm requires no algorithm delay and less bandwidth expansion while greatly enhancing, the error correcting performance and the reconstructed speech quality compared with conventional algorithms. Simulations show that the residual error rate is reduced by 84.36% and the MOS (Mean Opinion Score) is improved over 38.86%.", "paper_title": "Realtime Joint Speech Coding and Transmission Algorithm for High Packet Loss Rate Wireless Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000262010400017"}
