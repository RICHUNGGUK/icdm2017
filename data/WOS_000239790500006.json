In this paper we present an experimental analysis of the reliability of clusters discovered in lung tumor patients using DNA microarray data. In particular we investigate if subclasses of lung adenocarcinoma can be detected with high reliability at bio-molecular level. To this end we apply cluster validity measures based on random projections recently proposed by Bertoni and coworkers. The results show that at least two subclasses of lung adenocarcinoma can be detected with relatively high reliability, confirming and extending previous findings reported in the literature.", "paper_title": "Characterization of lung tumor subtypes through gene expression cluster validity assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000239790500006"}
