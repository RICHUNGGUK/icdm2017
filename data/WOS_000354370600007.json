For such a purpose, the authors propose a method to calibrate the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters (including radial distortion parameters) of two/multiple fish-eye cameras simultaneously by using a wand under general motions. Thanks to the generic camera model used, the proposed calibration method is also suitable for two/multiple conventional cameras and mixed cameras (e.g. two conventional cameras and a fish-eye camera). Simulation and real experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, the authors develop the camera calibration toolbox, which is available online.", "paper_title": "Calibration of multiple fish-eye cameras using a wand", "paper_id": "WOS:000354370600007"}
