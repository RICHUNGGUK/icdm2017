The purpose of this paper is to design the control laws to enable the group to asymptotically exhibit the flocking motion while preserving the network rigidity at all times. Design/methodology/approach - The novel approach for designing control laws is derived from a smooth artificial potential function based on an undirected infinitesimally rigid formation which specifies the target formation. Then the potential function is used to specify a gradient control law, under which the original system then becomes an orderly infinitesimally rigid formation. Findings - The strong relationship between the stability of the target formation and the gradient control protocol are utilized to design the control laws which can be proved to make the target formation stable. However, the rigidity matrix is not utilized in the design of control law. Future research will mainly focus on formation control with the relationship of rigidity matrix. Originality/value - The value of this paper is focused on the control laws design and the control laws could enable the group to asymptotically exhibit the flocking motion while preserving the network rigidity at all times. Also the detailed simulations and experiments are given to prove that the novel approach is available.", "paper_title": "Distributed rigid formation control algorithm for multi-agent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000312434100020"}
