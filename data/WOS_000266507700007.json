The frequency of the field is modulated in the forms of sine and rectangle. It is found that the field-frequency variation has a great influence on the properties of the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model. Appropriate frequency modulation can enhance and stabilize the degree of entanglement between the atom and the field.", "paper_title": "ENTANGLEMENT CONTROLLING OF A THREE-LEVEL CASCADE ATOM INTERACTING WITH A TIME-DEPENDENT COHERENT FIELD", "paper_id": "WOS:000266507700007"}
