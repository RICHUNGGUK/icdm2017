This paper presents a system for hand gesture recognition devoted to control windows applications. Starting from the images captured by a time-of-flight camera (a camera that produces images with an intensity level inversely proportional to the depth of the objects observed) the system performs hand segmentation as well as a low-level extraction of potentially relevant features which are related to the morphological representation of the hand silhouette. Classification based on these features discriminates between a set of possible static hand postures which results, combined with the estimated motion pattern of the hand, in the recognition of dynamic hand gestures. The whole system works in real-time, allowing practical interaction between user and application.", "paper_title": "Real-time user independent hand gesture recognition from time-of-flight camera video using static and dynamic models", "paper_id": "WOS:000313097100013"}
