We compare two approaches: the first one (baseline system) shows the user whole passages (maximum context: 10 sentences). The second one (experimental system) shows only a clause (minimum context). As cross-language system, the main problem is that the language of the question (Spanish) and the language of the answer context (English) are different. The results show that large context is better. However, there are specific relations between the context size and the knowledge about the language of the answer: users with poor level of English prefer context with few words.", "paper_title": "How much context do you need?: An experiment about the context size in interactive cross-language question answering", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000032"}
