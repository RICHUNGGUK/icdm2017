This problem concerns finding digital optimal full and reduced-order output feedback controllers for linear time-varying and time-invariant systems with white stochastic parameters. It can subsequently be solved in the delta domain using the strengthened optimal projection equations that we recently formulated in this domain as well. If the sampling rate becomes high, stating and solving the problem in the delta domain becomes necessary because the conventional discrete-time problem formulation and solution become ill-conditioned. In this article, by means of several numerical examples and compensator implementations, we demonstrate this phenomenon. To compute and quantify the improved performance when the sampling rate becomes high, a new delta-domain algorithm is developed. This algorithm computes the performance of arbitrary digital compensators for linear systems with white stochastic parameters. The principle application concerns nonconservative robust digital perturbation feedback control of nonlinear systems with high sampling rates.", "paper_title": "Equivalent optimal compensation problem in the delta domain for systems with white stochastic parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000335668300016"}
