In particular. we are interested in establishing the general large deviation rate functions that are derivable as the Fenchel-Legendre transform of the cumulant generating function. The final goal is to show, under some mild condition. a necessary and sufficient condition for the IS rate function to be derivable as the Fenchel-Legendre transform of the cumulant generating function. i.e., to be a rate function of Gartner-Eills type.", "paper_title": "Large Deviation Theorems Revisited: Information-Spectrum Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000260400600003"}
