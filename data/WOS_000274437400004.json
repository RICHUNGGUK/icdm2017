The PFEC mechanism of recovering from errors in a source packet requires an entire FEC redundant packet even though the error involves a few bit errors. The recovery capability of the BFEC mechanism is only half of the FEC redundancy. Accordingly, an adaptive Sub-Packet FEC (SPFEC) mechanism is proposed in this paper to improve the quality of video streaming data over wireless networks, simultaneously enhancing the recovery performance and reducing the end-to-end delay jitter. The SPFEC mechanism divides a packet into n sub-packets by means of the concept of a virtual packet. The SPFEC mechanism uses a checksum in each sub-packet to identify the position of the error sub-packet. Simulation experiments show the adaptive SPFEC mechanism achieves high recovery performance and low end-to-end delay jitter. The SPFEC mechanism outperforms traditional FEC mechanism in terms of packet loss rate and video Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). SPFEC offers an alternative for improved efficiency video streaming that will be of interest to the designers of the next generation environments.", "paper_title": "Sub-packet forward error correction mechanism for video streaming over wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000274437400004"}
