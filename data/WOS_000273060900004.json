The work is grounded in the emerging field of adaptable design, and is motivated by the need to reduce the uncertainty and cost of the product development process through the systematic reuse of design information. The article focuses primarily on an analytical exploration of an adaptability quantification framework that is intended to provide designers with the ability to quantify adaptability and make objective design decisions based on this information during the design process. The proposed framework is illustrated with a simple case study that compares the relative adaptability of a personal computer versus a calculator.", "paper_title": "A Method for Quantifying Adaptability in Engineering Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000273060900004"}
