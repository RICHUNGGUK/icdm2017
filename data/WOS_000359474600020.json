On one hand, the iris feature extraction method using the traditional Gabor filters can cause time-consuming and high-feature dimension. On the other hand, we can find that the changes of original iris texture in angle and radial directions are more obvious than the other directions by observing the iris images. These changes in the preprocessed iris images are mainly reflected in vertical and horizontal directions. Therefore, the local directional Gabor filters are constructed to extract the horizontal and vertical texture characteristics of iris. First, the iris images are preprocessed by iris and eyelash location, iris segmentation, normalization and zooming. After analyzing the variety of iris texture and 2D-Gabor filters, we construct the local directional Gabor filters to extract the local Gabor features of iris. Then, the Gabor & Fisher features are obtained by Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Finally, the nearest neighbor method is used to recognize the iris. Experimental results show that the proposed method has better iris recognition performance with less feature dimension and calculation time.", "paper_title": "Iris Recognition Based on Local Gabor Orientation Feature Extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000359474600020"}
