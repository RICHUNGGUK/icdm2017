It involves data grouping and ELM based data projection in multiple levels. Given a test action instance, a neural network is trained by using labeled action instances forming the groups that reside to the test sample's neighborhood. The action instances involved in this procedure are, subsequently, mapped to a new feature space, determined by the trained network outputs. This procedure is performed multiple times, which are determined by the test action instance at hand, until only a single class is retained. Experimental results denote the effectiveness of the dynamic classification approach, compared to the static one, as well as the effectiveness of the ELM in the proposed dynamic classification setting.
