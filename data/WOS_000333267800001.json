In this paper, we investigate energy efficient uplink power control and subchannel allocation in two-tier femtocell networks. Taking transmit power and circuit power into account, we model the power control and subchannel allocation problem as a supermodular game to maximize energy efficiency of femtocell users. To reduce the cochannel interference from femtousers to neighboring femtocells and macrocells, we introduce a convex pricing scheme to curb their selfish behavior. We decompose the resource allocation problem into two subproblems, that is, a distributed subchannel allocation scheme and a distributed power control scheme to reduce costs and complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve user utilities significantly, compared with existing power control and subchannel allocation algorithms.", "paper_title": "Game Theory Based Energy-Aware Uplink Resource Allocation in OFDMA Femtocell Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000333267800001"}
