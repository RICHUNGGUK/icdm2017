The most prominent among its activities is the annual Symposium on Combinatorial Search that has been organized regularly since 2008 as a result of the success of other scientific meetings, typically workshops co-located with high-level Artificial Intelligence conferences (AAAI and IJCAI). This paper reviews the history of the Symposium making emphasis on the last edition that was held in July 2011 in Barcelona (Spain).", "paper_title": "The Symposium on Combinatorial Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000307702000001"}
