One innovative approach to addressing this problem is Exergaming. A combination of Exercise and Gaming, the objective is to motivate people participate in exercise regimes, usually in their home environment. In this article a more holistic interpretation of this exercise paradigm is proposed.

The design and implementation of a platform for Freegaming is described and illustrated through the description of a sample game.", "paper_title": "Freegaming: Mobile, collaborative, adaptive and augmented exergaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000312680700001"}
