In 2008, Chan, Hu, and Jiang [3] proposed a hihyly efficient, secure event signature protocol (EASES) for P2P-based MMOGs. The security of EASES is based on one-time signature keys and hash-chain keys. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that the cheat-prevention EASES protocol, introduced by Chan et al. is vulnerable to a passive attack. As a result, an attacker, Known as an Eve, can masquerade as a legal player to deceive other players and lead them to believe Eve's, illegitimate actions. A simple improvement is suggested to eliminate this vulnerability.", "paper_title": "A SECURE EVENT UPDATE PROTOCOL FOR PEER-TO-PEER MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER ONLINE GAMES AGAINST MASQUERADE ATTACKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272566800031"}
