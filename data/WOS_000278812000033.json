Similarly, an encryption scheme is entropically indistinguishable if the encrypted version of a message whose min-entropy is high enough is statistically indistinguishable from a fixed distribution. We present full generalizations of these two concepts to the encryption of quantum states in which the quantum conditional min-entropy, as introduced by Renner, is used to bound the adversary's prior information on the message. A proof of the equivalence between quantum entropic security and quantum entropic indistinguishability is presented. We also provide proofs of security for two different ciphers in this model and a proof for a lower bound on the key length required by any such cipher. These ciphers generalize existing schemes for approximate quantum encryption to the entropic security model.", "paper_title": "Quantum Entropic Security and Approximate Quantum Encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000278812000033"}
