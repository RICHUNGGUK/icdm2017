Each server provides a unique service which is of certain benefit to each user. Now comes an attacker, who wishes to destroy a set of edges of the network in the fashion that maximizes his net gain, namely, the total disconnected benefit of users minus the total edge-destruction cost. We first discuss that the problem is polynomially solvable in the single-server case. In the multiple-server case, we will show, the problem is, however, NP-hard. In particular, when there are only two servers, the network disconnection problem becomes intractable. Then a 3/2-approximation algorithm is developed for the two-server case.", "paper_title": "Two-server network disconnection problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300083"}
