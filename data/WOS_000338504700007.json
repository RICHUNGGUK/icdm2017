We prove upper and lower bounds of on the worst case number of iterations needed by both of these algorithms for providing non-trivial approximations to the value of a game with N non-terminal positions and m actions for each player in each position. In particular, both algorithms have doubly-exponential complexity. Even when the game given as input has only one non-terminal position, we prove an exponential lower bound on the worst case number of iterations needed to provide non-trivial approximations.", "paper_title": "The Complexity of Solving Reachability Games Using Value and Strategy Iteration", "paper_id": "WOS:000338504700007"}
