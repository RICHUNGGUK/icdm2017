Alternative clustering analysis is an emerging subfield involving techniques for the generation of multiple different clusterings, allowing the data to be viewed from different perspectives. We present two new algorithms for alternative clustering generation. A distinctive feature of our algorithms is their principled formulation of an objective function, facilitating the discovery of a subspace satisfying natural quality and orthogonality criteria. The first algorithm is a regularization of the Principal Components analysis method, whereas the second is a regularization of graph-based dimension reduction. In both cases, we demonstrate a globally optimum subspace solution can be computed. Experimental evaluation shows our techniques are able to equal or outperform a range of existing methods.", "paper_title": "Generating multiple alternative clusterings via globally optimal subspaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000331632100001"}
