The four dimensional cyclographic model of the set of spheres in R-3 is an appropriate framework to show that a quadratic triangular Bezier patch in R-4 corresponds to a two-parameter family of spheres with rational envelope surface. The construction shows also that the envelope has rational offsets. Further we outline how to generalize the construction to obtain a much larger class of surfaces with similar properties.
