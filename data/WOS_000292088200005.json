This symmetrical structure avoids bianisotropy and it shows a controllable low-loss double negative (DNG) band. Its electrical size is less than half of the well-known S-shaped resonator, which makes it to be considered as a good homogenous effective media. Although the structure is not uniplanar, it is not vulnerable to fabrication errors stem from misalignment of both sides. Both the simulation and experiment results demonstrate left-handed properties. Also, a circuit model is proposed which can accurately predict the magnetic resonant frequency.
