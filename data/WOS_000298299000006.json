A key distinguishing characteristic of this problem is that each decision maker knows only a part of the weight matrix and/or controls a subset of the assets. Here, we extend the distributed algorithm developed for blackboard communication structure in another part of this work to the point-to-point communication structure. Our results indicate that edge organizations with horizontal and vertical information structures exhibit shorter delays than those with block diagonal and checkerboard information structures. We also showed how our findings can be applied effectively to mission planning of the Navy's maritime operations center.", "paper_title": "Quantifying the Impact of Information and Organizational Structures via Distributed Auction Algorithm: Point-to-Point Communication Structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000298299000006"}
