The conditions are derived by means of vector Lyapunov functions. The obtained results are applied to traffic networks for the derivation of sufficient conditions for global exponential stability of the uncongested equilibrium point of the network. Specific results and algorithms are provided for freeway traffic models. Various examples illustrate the applicability of the obtained results.", "paper_title": "Global Exponential Stability for Discrete-Time Networks With Applications to Traffic Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000365084700007"}
