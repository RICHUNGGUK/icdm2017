Firstly, the performance of the constitutive models is checked against undrained triaxial tests. The models are then used to replicate the behaviour of an embankment built on soft clay. The numerical results are compared with the field data in terms of settlements, lateral displacements and excess pore pressures. Additionally, the numerical predictions are also analysed in terms of yield area, contours of vertical effective stresses, horizontal effective stresses and shear stresses and in terms of effective stress paths.
