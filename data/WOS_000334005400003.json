Influencing these measures are interconnections (i.e., interdependencies) among infrastructure systems. Understanding the nature of system interdependencies can play an essential role in minimizing and/or reducing the probabilities and consequences of cascading failures in interdependent systems. This paper discusses the need for policy-makers, infrastructure operators and researchers to consider alternative approaches to formulating risk and enabling solutions to challenging 21st century issues related to interdependent infrastructures. Using the healthcare sector as an example, this paper suggests that identifying the risks associated with maintaining public health goes beyond traditional risk formulation to include the structural complexity brought about by infrastructure interdependencies.
