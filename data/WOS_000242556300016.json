It is also the interaction information between Agents. Agent has the ability to evaluate its path in the past. In this way, Agent can find optimization object rapidly and avoid partial extremum at the same time. Finally, several benchmark problems are considered to evaluate the performance of this model. The experimental results prove the efficiency of this model when solving optimization problems.", "paper_title": "Solving optimization problem using multi-agent model based on belief interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300016"}
