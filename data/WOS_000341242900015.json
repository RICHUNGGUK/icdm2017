Both of them have the capability for operating in a low-voltage environment and, also, for orthogonal electronic adjustment between the resonance frequency and Q factor. Employing MOS transistors models from the AMS 0.35 mu m process, the performance of the proposed topologies has been evaluated by exploiting the analog design environment of Cadence software.", "paper_title": "SINH-DOMAIN UNIVERSAL BIQUAD FILTERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000341242900015"}
