Although two-level supersaturated designs are becoming increasingly popular, mixed-level designs are scarcely used. Mixed-level designs are needed when the response is based on a polynomial response surface model or in situations where factors are nominal variables (with more than two modalities). The aim of this study is to explore the construction of mixed-level supersaturated designs and to evaluate their performance from the analysis of peppermint oil using a gas chromatographic method as application. This experimental setup requires the study of seven factors at two levels and five factors at three levels. Different building methods are tested from asymmetric or symmetric supersaturated designs. The mixed-level supersaturated designs obtained are compared from the point of view of a priori criteria with the aim of evaluating which criteria are better suited to judge the quality and fitness for purpose of these experimental designs. Finally, the results of the supersaturated designs are compared to the complete classical design. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
