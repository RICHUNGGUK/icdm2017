Given an MDP, M, and given multiple linear-time (omega-regular or LTL) properties phi(i), and probabilities r(i) is an element of [0, 1], i = 1, ..., k, we ask whether there exists a strategy sigma for the controller such that, for all i, the probability that a trajectory of M controlled by sigma satisfies phi(i) is at least r(i). We provide an algorithm that decides whether there exists such a strategy and if so produces it, and which runs in time polynomial in the size of the MDP. Such a strategy may require the use of both randomization and memory. We also consider more general multi-objective omega-regular queries, which we motivate with an application to assume-guarantee compositional reasoning for probabilistic systems. Note that there can be trade-offs between different properties: satisfying property phi(1) with high probability may necessitate satisfying phi(2) with low probability. Viewing this as a multi-objective optimization problem, we want information about the \"trade-off curve\" or Pareto curve for maximizing the probabilities of different properties. We show that one can compute an approximate Pareto curve with respect to a set of omega-regular properties in time polynomial in the size of the MDP. Our quantitative upper bounds use LP methods. We also study qualitative multi-objective model checking problems, and we show that these can be analysed by purely graph-theoretic methods, even though the strategies may still require both randomization and memory.", "paper_title": "MULTI-OBJECTIVE MODEL CHECKING OF MARKOV DECISION PROCESSES", "paper_id": "WOS:000268642100008"}
