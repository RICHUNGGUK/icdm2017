Analytical modelling is a cost-effective tool and plays an important role in achieving a clear understanding of the network performance. However, most of the existing models for PCS are unable to capture the realistic nature of message behaviours generated by real-world applications, which have a significant impact on the design and performance of communication networks. This paper presents a new analytical model for PCS in interconnection networks in the presence of bursty and correlated message arrivals coupled with hot-spot destinations, which can capture the bursty message arrival process and non-uniform distribution of message destinations. Such a traffic pattern has been found in many practical communication environments. The accuracy of the proposed analytical model is validated through extensive simulation experiments. The model is then applied to investigate the effects of the bursty message arrivals and hot-spot destinations on the performance of interconnection networks with PCS. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
