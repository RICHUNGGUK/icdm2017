If Alice is using classical resources, and she wants to approach unconditional security, then the key and the message must have comparable sizes. But if Alice prepares a quantum state, the size of the key can be comparatively negligible. This effect is called quantum locking. Entanglement does not play a role in this quantum advantage. We show that, in this scenario, the quantum discord quantifies the advantage of the quantum protocol over the corresponding classical one for any classical-quantum state.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM LOCKING OF CLASSICAL CORRELATIONS AND QUANTUM DISCORD OF CLASSICAL-QUANTUM STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000297939700007"}
