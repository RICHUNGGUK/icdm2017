The decomposition network has also been described. The adsorption energies under the most stable configuration of the possible species and the energy barriers of the possible elementary reactions involved are obtained. Desorption is preferred for adsorbing methylamine and hydrogen, whereas for the other species, decomposition is more favorable. Our calculated results show that methylamine decomposition on Ru(0001) starts with H2CNH2 formation from methyl dehydrogenation, followed by subsequent methylene dehydrogenation, bond breaking of N-H and C-N in HCNH 2, CH dehydrogenation and C-N bond cleavage in HCNH, and dehydrogenation of NH2, NH, and CH.", "paper_title": "Reaction mechanism of methylamine decomposition on Ru(0001): a density functional theory study", "paper_id": "WOS:000332180100031"}
