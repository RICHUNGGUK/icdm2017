Compared with some popular multi-antenna techniques, the advantage of this scheme is proven in ideal channel conditions, where the channel is spatially white and the perfect channel state information is assumed available at the receiver. The main objective of this paper is to present an information theoretical study on IGCH in realistic propagation environments with channel degeneracy due to spatial correlation and keyhole phenomena as well as imperfect channel estimation. It is proven that good performance promised by IGCH can be achieved in a variety of non-ideal channel conditions. Moreover, the analysis in this paper provides a convenient tool for the corresponding system design in practical operating environments.
