A pseudopipelined word-serial finite field multiplier, with word size w, suitable for the scalar multiplication is also developed. Implemented in hardware, this system performs a scalar multiplication in approximately 6 inverted right perpendicular m/w inverted left perpendicular (m - 1) clock cycles, and the gate delay in the critical path is equal to T(AND) + inverted right perpendicular log(2)(w/k) inverted left perpendicular T(XOR), where T(AND) and T(XOR) are delays due to two-input AND and XOR gates, respectively, and 1 <= k << w is used to shorten the critical path.", "paper_title": "High-performance architecture of elliptic curve scalar multiplication", "paper_id": "WOS:000259364700002"}
