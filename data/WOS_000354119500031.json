The front position is obtained as the weighted mean of fronts calculated by means of the level set method, using as weight-function the probability density function which characterizes the anomalous diffusion process. Since anomalous diffusion is assumed to be governed by a time-fractional diffusion equation, its fundamental solution is the required probability density function. It is shown that this fundamental solution can be expressed in the multi-dimensional case in terms of the well-known M-Wright/Mainardi function, as in the one-dimensional case. Making use of this representation for the practical purpose of numerical evaluation, the propagation of random fronts in two-dimensional subdiffusive media is discussed and investigated.
