By adjusting the length of the cross dipole and rotation angle of split double ring, two classes of elements achieve the required reflection phase. Then, a reflectarray with these two types of elements is fabricated and tested. It is worth noting that the designed reflectarray obtains broadband performance at both bands. Measurement results demonstrate that the fabricated reflectarray obtains a 1 dB gain bandwidth of more than 14% for both bands and a 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth of 22.9% for the lower band and 40% for the upper band.
