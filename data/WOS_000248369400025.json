Thus, faster solvers for eddy current analyses are necessary. Parallel computation methods for linear solvers in electromagnetic field analyses have been investigated. These methods have gained importance due to the diffusion of PC clusters and multi-core CPUs in recent years. Design/methodology/approach - This paper discuses linear solvers for the finite element method in eddy current analyses on parallel computers. The preconditioned conjugate gradient method with overlapping domain decomposition is treated. Some techniques treated to improve the convergence was investigated. Findings - The numerical results show that the overlapping effect results in good convergence in eddy current analyses. Originality/value - The preconditioned conjugate gradient method with overlapping domain decomposition has been treated. The numerical results show that the overlapping method works more efficiently for eddy current analyses. Moreover, this method enables large-scale analyses on popular computers such as PC clusters.", "paper_title": "An efficient parallel PCG method for eddy current analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000248369400025"}
