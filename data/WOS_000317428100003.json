I support this claim with four ideas about cognition: (1) interacting with tools changes the way we think and perceive - tools, when manipulated, are soon absorbed into the body schema, and this absorption leads to fundamental changes in the way we perceive and conceive of our environments; (2) we think with our bodies not just with our brains; (3) we know more by doing than by seeing - there are times when physically performing an activity is better than watching someone else perform the activity, even though our motor resonance system fires strongly during other person observation; (4) there are times when we literally think with things. These four ideas have major implications for interaction design, especially the design of tangible, physical, context aware, and telepresence systems.", "paper_title": "Embodied Cognition and the Magical Future of Interaction Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000317428100003"}
