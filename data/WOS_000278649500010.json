In order to solve the uncertainly problem caused by the randomly generated parameter of the heterogeneous players, fuzzy evaluation is used to obtain the evaluation results of all heterogeneous players on various roles. A fuzzy inference system is constructed to dynamically select equal heterogeneous players for various roles All passing routes are estimated and the best dribbling angle is chosen by correspondingly fuzzy inference system Additionally considering shooting decision, the ball controlling strategy of a player agent is finally formed The simulation experiments and competition results show that the behavior strategies are feasible and effective.", "paper_title": "Agent Behavior Strategy Based on Fuzzy Evaluation and Inference in RoboCupSoccer", "paper_id": "WOS:000278649500010"}
