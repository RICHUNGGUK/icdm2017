However, students from the virtual group reported enjoying the class more, being more engaged, and having greater intentions to participate than students from the traditional group The plausible explanation for this can be found in the qualitative data The implications of these results and improvement proposals are also discussed in this work (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
