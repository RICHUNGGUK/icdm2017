In particular, we focus on the issue of uniqueness of the optimal solution to the SDP relaxation for QKP. We first give a counterexample which shows that the optimal solution to the SDP relaxation for QKP could be non-unique. This is in contrast with the case of unconstrained 0-1 quadratic problems. A necessary and sufficient condition is then derived to ensure the uniqueness of the optimal solution to the SDP relaxation for QKP.", "paper_title": "A note on semidefinite relaxation for 0-1 quadratic knapsack problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000320925500017"}
