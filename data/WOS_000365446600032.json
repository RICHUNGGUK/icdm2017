The noisy image is firstly decomposed into different subbands of frequency and orientation responses using NSST. The NSST detail coefficients are then divided into edge/texture-related coefficients and noise-related ones by FSVMs classifier. And finally the detail subbands of NSST coefficients are denoised by using the adaptive Bayesian threshold. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach is competitive relative to many state-of-the-art denoising techniques. Especially, the proposed method can preserve edges very well while removing noise.", "paper_title": "An edge-preserving adaptive image denoising", "paper_id": "WOS:000365446600032"}
