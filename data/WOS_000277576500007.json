A switched system model is constructed for describing the considered system. Then, based on switching strategy of average dwell time method, under the condition that the total activation time ratio between the stable subsystem and the unstable one is required to be lower bounded, criteria for the existence of such controllers which guarantee the resulting closed-loop systems exponentially stable are derived and formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities. A parameterized characterization of the Controllers is given in terms of the feasibility solutions to the LMIs. The effectiveness of the proposed robust control scheme is demonstrated by simulation examples.", "paper_title": "STATE FEEDBACK CONTROLLER DESIGN FOR A CLASS OF UNCERTAIN SYSTEMS WITH TIME-VARYING DELAYS AND CONTROLLER FAILURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000277576500007"}
