These tools often aren't suitable in scenarios involving Web-enabled, intercompany cooperation and IT outsourcing, however. The authors analyze how these scenarios impact information quality in business intelligence applications and lead to nontrivial research challenges. They describe the idea of uncertain events and key indicators and present a model to express and store uncertainty and a tool to compute and visualize uncertain key indicators.", "paper_title": "Toward Uncertain Business Intelligence The Case of Key Indicators", "paper_id": "WOS:000279138300006"}
