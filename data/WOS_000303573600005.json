The vagueness in the data causes that the prior probabilities of the classes are not precisely known, and therefore the degree of imbalance can also be uncertain. In this paper we propose suitable extensions of different resampling algorithms that can be applied to interval valued, multi-labelled data. By means of these extended preprocessing algorithms, certain classification systems designed for minimizing the fraction of misclassifications are able to produce knowledge bases that are also adequate under common metrics for imbalanced classification.", "paper_title": "Equalizing imbalanced imprecise datasets for genetic fuzzy classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000303573600005"}
