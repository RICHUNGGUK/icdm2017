Analyzing these structures enables us to detect several inter and intra connections between people in and outside their organizations. In this context, we construct a multi-relational scientific social network where researchers may have four different types of relationships with each other. We adopt some criteria such as relationship age in order to assign a weight to relationships and to enable the modeling of a scientific social network as close as possible to reality. Using clustering techniques with maximum flow measure, we identify the social structure and research communities in a way that allows us to evaluate the knowledge flow in the Brazilian scientific community.", "paper_title": "Modeling, Mining and Analysis of Multi-Relational Scientific Social Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000305457500006"}
