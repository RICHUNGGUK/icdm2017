In particular, we give the first general lower bound holding for any monotone distance distribution, that is induced by a monotone generating function. Namely, we prove that the expected oblivious diameter is Omega (log(2)n) even on a path of n nodes. We then focus on deterministic constructions and after showing that the problem of minimizing the oblivious diameter is generally intractable, we give asymptotically optimal solutions, that is with a logarithmic oblivious diameter, for paths, trees and Cartesian products of graphs, including d-dimensional grids for any fixed value of d.", "paper_title": "Asymptotically optimal solutions for small world graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000254920900010"}
