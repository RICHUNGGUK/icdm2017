Recently, security and privacy have become important issues in electrical power grids. In this paper, we describe two quantum privacy-enhancing protocols: one of them requires that the parties initially share a certain amount of quantum entangled states, while the other uses only quantum key distribution methods without sharing quantum entangled states. The two proposed protocols are resistant to attacks from quantum computers. This paper also describes some recent advances of classical and quantum privacy-enhancing technologies.
