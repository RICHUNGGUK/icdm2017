The learning platform is composed by four nodes with real industrial devices, common in automation applications. The course has been put into practice by the CITCEA-UPC in collaboration with Schneider Electric Spain. The course is devised both for university students and industry professionals. The problem proposed to the students is the configuration of a CANopen bus and the automation of a machine movement sequence. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
