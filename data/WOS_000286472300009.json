This paper propose a new semantic model that can integrate keyword, relation and visual information in a uniform framework. Based on this semantic representation framework, the news exploration and retrieval applications can be organized by not only keywords and categories but also relations and visual properties. We also proposed a set of algorithms to automatically extract the proposed semantic model automatically from large collection of multimedia news reports.", "paper_title": "Multimedia news exploration and retrieval by integrating keywords, relations and visual features", "paper_id": "WOS:000286472300009"}
