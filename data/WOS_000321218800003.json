The best feature of group-key-based systems is the ability to enjoy the broadcast nature in delivery multimedia contents, while the major advantage of public-key systems is consolidating the security foundation to withstand various attacks, such as collusion attacks. However, the problems of group-key-based systems include collusion attacks, lack of nonrepudiation, and troublesome key distribution. Even worse, the benefit of broadcast efficiency is confined to a group size of no more than 512 subscribers. For public-key systems, the poor delivery scalability is the major shortcoming because the unique private key feature is only suitable for one-to-one delivery. In this article, we introduce a scalable access control scheme to integrate the merits of broadcasting regardless of group size and sound security assurance, including fine-grained access control and collusion attack resistance. For subscriber revocation, a single message is broadcast to the other subscribers to get the updated key, thus significantly boosting subscriber revocation scalability. Due to mobile subscribers' dynamic movements, this article also analyzes the benefit of retransmission cases in our system. Through the performance evaluation and functionality comparison, the proposed scheme should be a decent candidate to enhance the security strength and transmission efficiency in a mobile pay-TV system.", "paper_title": "A Conditional Access System with Efficient Key Distribution and Revocation for Mobile Pay-TV Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000321218800003"}
