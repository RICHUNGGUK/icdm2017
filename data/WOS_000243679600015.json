In this model, traffic is classified into several service classes with different priorities inside queues of IP routers. The premium service class has the highest priority. Due to the high priority of premium traffic, the global network behaviour against this service class, including routing and scheduling of premium packets, may impose significant influences on traffic of other classes. These negative influences, which could degrade the performance of low-priority classes with respect to some important metrics such as the packet loss probability and the packet delay, are often called the interclass effects. To reduce the inter-class effects, the premium-class routing algorithm must be carefully selected such that (1) it works correctly (i.e., without loop) under the hop-by-hop routing paradigm; and (2) the congestion resulted from the traffic of premium class over the network becomes minimum. In this paper, we first introduce a novel routing framework, named compatible routing, that guarantees loop-freedom in the context of hop-by-hop routing model. Then, upon this framework, we propose two multipath architectures for load balancing of high-priority traffic on DiffServ networks. Our extensive simulations clearly demonstrate that the proposed methods distribute the premium bandwidth requirements more efficiently over the whole network and perform better than the existing algorithms, especially in the case of complex and highly loaded networks.
