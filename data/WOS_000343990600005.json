The undeniable role of accurate development effort estimation in the success of software project management has attracted the attention of researchers over the past few years. Among various algorithmic and non-algorithmic estimation methods, analogy based estimation (ABE) is a widely accepted method due to its simplicity and estimation capability. This paper investigates the improvement process of ABE method during 2000 to 2012. Six research questions are defined to be addressed through evaluation of prior ABE-based studies. The review domain includes 24 papers selected through a tough filtration process. The results show that improvement of ABE can be performed through adjustment, grey theory, attribute weighting and attribute selection techniques. Moreover, ABE configurations can significantly affect the results.", "paper_title": "Towards Improvement of Analogy-Based Software Development Effort Estimation: A Review", "paper_id": "WOS:000343990600005"}
