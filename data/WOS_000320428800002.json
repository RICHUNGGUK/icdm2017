First, DC architectures should be incrementally scalable allowing the creation of DCs of arbitrary size with consistent, performance characteristics. Second, initial DC deployments should be incrementally expandable supporting small-scale upgrades without decreasing operation efficiency. A DC architecture possessing both properties satisfies the requirement of free-scaling. Recent work in DC design focuses on traditional performance and scalability characteristics, therefore resulting in symmetric topologies whose upgradability is coarse-grained at best. In our earlier work we proposed Scafida, an asymmetric, scale-free network inspired DC topology which scales incrementally and has favorable structural characteristics. In this paper, we build on Scafida and propose a full-fledged DC architecture achieving free-scaling called FScafida. Our main contribution is threefold. First, we propose an organic expansion algorithm for FScafida; this combined with Scafida's flexible original design results in a freely scalable architecture. Second, we introduce the Effective Source Routing mechanism that provides near-shortest paths, multi-path and multicast capability, and low signaling overhead by exploiting the benefits of the FScafida topology. Third, we show based on extensive simulations and a prototype implementation that FScafida is capable of handling the traffic patterns characteristic of both enterprise and cloud data centers, tolerates network equipment failures to a high degree, and allows for high bisection bandwidth.
