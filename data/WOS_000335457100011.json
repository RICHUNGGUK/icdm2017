BudgetedSVM trains models with accuracy comparable to LibSVM in time comparable to LibLinear, solving non-linear problems with millions of high-dimensional examples within minutes on a regular computer. We provide command-line and Matlab interfaces to BudgetedSVM, an efficient API for handling large-scale, high-dimensional data sets, as well as detailed documentation to help developers use and further extend the toolbox.", "paper_title": "BudgetedSVM: A Toolbox for Scalable SVM Approximations", "paper_id": "WOS:000335457100011"}
