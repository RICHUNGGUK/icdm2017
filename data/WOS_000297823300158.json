This high relative humidity is related with mould exposure and allergy history, although it is difficult or impossible to determine health risks with current assessment methods. The aim of this paper is to compile information on microbiological levels in Spanish flats and relate this with a predictive method based on indoor air acceptability, noting the percentage of dissatisfied. Results showed a clear relationship between local humidity problems in walls with fungi growth and the presence of pets with total bacteria in the air. Furthermore, local thermal comfort indices could be employed to prevent the presence of water-damaged buildings and its related health risks. As a consequence, future research works must be carried out to implement this methodology. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
