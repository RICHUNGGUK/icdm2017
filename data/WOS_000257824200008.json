The new color spaces are derived from the RGB color space that defines the tristimuli R, G, and B component images. While the UCS decorrelates its three component images using principal component analysis (PCA), the ICS derives three independent component images by means of blind source separation, such as independent component analysis (ICA). The DCS, which applies discriminant analysis, defines three new component images that are effective for face recognition. Effective color image representation is formed in these color spaces by concatenating their component images, and efficient color image classification is achieved using the effective color image representation and an enhanced Fisher model (EFM). Experiments on the face recognition grand challenge (FRGC) and the biometric experimentation environment (BEE) show that for the most challenging FRGC version 2 Experiment 4, which contains 12 776 training images, 16 028 controlled target images, and 8014 uncontrolled query images, the ICS, DCS, and UCS achieve the face verification rate (ROC III) of 73.69%, 71.42%, and 69.92%, respectively, at the false accept rate of 0.1%, compared to the RGB color space, the 2-D Karhunen-Loeve (KL) color space, and the FRGC baseline algorithm with the face verification rate of 67.13%, 59.16%, and 11.86%, respectively, with the same false accept rate.", "paper_title": "Learning the uncorrelated, independent, and discriminating color spaces for face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000257824200008"}
