When several online topics are published at the same time, the spread of these topics will affect each other. We propose a model to study the development tendency of relationship between two different online topics. We make use of stability theory of differential equations to analyze the model, utilize the phase trajectory to analyze the stability of the equilibrium point, and finally simulate the model with actual data and varied parameters. Simulation results indicate that the proposed model is useful in understanding and explaining the phenomena presented in the diffusion of online topics, especially the interaction and competition among different topics.", "paper_title": "THE RESEARCH ON STABILITY OF DIFFUSION AND COMPETITION BETWEEN ONLINE TOPICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612800008"}
