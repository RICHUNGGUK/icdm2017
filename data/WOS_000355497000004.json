In history-based parametric modeling systems, design intent information is usually expressed implicitly within the model. However, there is evidence that suggests that an explicit representation can increase productivity and quality and facilitate the transferring of design knowledge throughout the different stages of the product lifecycle. In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of 3D annotations as mechanisms for explicit design intent representation and examine their impact in model alteration processes that require a direct interaction with the model's geometry. We present the results of a series of studies aimed at measuring user performance and model quality in two scenarios. First, we hypothesized that annotations are valuable tools to provide design information when inadequate modeling assumptions can be made by designers. Second, we evaluated annotations as tools to communicate design decisions when multiple options are available. In both cases, results show statistically significant benefits of annotated models, suggesting the use of this technique as a valuable approach to improve design intent communication.
