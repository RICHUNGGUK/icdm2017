The mathematical theory of these operators, both in the space of continuous functions and in Orlicz spaces, show how it is possible to approximate/reconstruct multivariate signals, such as images. In particular, to obtain applications for thermographic images a mathematical algorithm is developed using MATLAB and matrix calculus. The setting of Orlicz spaces is important since allow us to reconstruct not necessarily continuous signals by means of S-w. The reconstruction of thermographic images of buildings by our sampling Kantorovich algorithm allow us to obtain models for the simulation of the behavior of structures under seismic action. We analyze a real world case study in term of structural analysis and we compare the behavior of the building under seismic action using various models.", "paper_title": "Applications of sampling Kantorovich operators to thermographic images for seismic engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000348559400001"}
