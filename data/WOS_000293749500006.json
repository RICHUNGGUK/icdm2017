By using the Lie algebra theory, a linear node-and-node pinning method is proposed to achieve a consensus of a MNDN for all nonlinear functions satisfying a given set of conditions. Based on some optimal algorithms, large-size networks are aggregated to small-size ones. Then, by applying the principle minor theory to the small-size networks, a sufficient condition is given to reduce the number of controlled nodes. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed criteria.", "paper_title": "Consensus Analysis of Multiagent Networks via Aggregated and Pinning Approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000293749500006"}
