Without any off-line pre-training, the algorithm achieves very high control performance through a three-stage algorithm: (1) output scale factor, (2) adaptation of the fuzzy rule consequents and (3) optimization of the position of the membership functions. The design is simple, in the sense that both the membership functions and the rule-base can be initialized from arbitrary values. It can be applied to a large class of monotonic dynamic or static plants, due the fact that the system is able to modify its behaviour in real time, i.e., during the control process.
