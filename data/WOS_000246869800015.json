Information required by the cancer center researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI, Pittsburgh, PA) was identified through interviews, query analysis, and analysis of publications. For topical matters, the study found that the most frequent types of questions were the following: clinical (50.18%), prognosis (17.87%), diagnosis/disorder-based (50.72%), and research-oriented (51.9%) queries. In terms of the required data elements, pathology data (17.32%) was the most frequently required, followed by clinical history and outcomes (15.18%). In addition, the study identified the 10 main questions, concerning human biological samples, and the majority of the questions were represented in a fairly discrete set of information spaces that could be well mapped into the conceptual data model created through the study. The results found in this study can be used for an initial data modeling, when creating a biomedical research data warehouse that would support the majority of the transitional research requirements of the UPCI.
