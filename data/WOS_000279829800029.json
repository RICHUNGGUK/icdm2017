As a popular technology, the state of the art MDM solution is claimed by the software company such as IBM, Oracle to provide the quality data for decision making. This solution is based on completing operational information system. However, most of middle and small companies do not complete information system in China. To construct a MDM system, the metadata in a MDM system should be designed first. So a new design methodology that is purposed in, this paper can capture metadata of master data from the enterprise business process. The design procedure consists of four steps including business processes analysis, metadata of master data recognition, metadata of master data integration, and metadata of master data representation. Following the methodology, the metadata of master data can be designed easily and MDM system can be set up before the construction of operational system. The concepts in this paper are not specific to the Chinese industry only. It can be effectively adapted to other enterprises which have not set up any information system. At the same time, a universal mechanism in, the management of MDM system that maintaining data accuracy, completeness, and consistency is established, while utilizing master data across different operational and recording system.", "paper_title": "A NEW DESIGN METHODOLOGY FOR METADATA OF MASTER DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000279829800029"}
