By using the Survey of Pre-service Teachers' Knowledge of Teaching and Technology developed by Schmidt et al. (2009), the study sought to determine if significant differences could be found in pre-service teachers' perceptions of TPACK when examined by gender, age, educational program, year of study, kind of instruction (day or night education) and field experience. Regression analysis was also used to examine if technology knowledge (TK), pedagogical knowledge (PK) and content knowledge (CK) significantly contributed to pre-service teachers' TPACK development. Participants of this study were 491 elementary pre-service teachers who attended the summer semester at Pamukkale University. The analysis of the collected data found a significant difference in pre-service teachers' perceptions of the TPACK when examined across gender, program, year of study and field experience, but no significant differences were found regarding age and kind of instruction. Finally, our regression model showed that CK and PK contributed significantly to pre-service teachers' TPACK development, but TK was not a significant predictor.", "paper_title": "An Investigation of Turkish Pre-Service Teachers' Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000364151000003"}
