They have become popular as a language for fuzzy ontology representation. To date, most of the work in this direction has focused on the so-called Zadeh family of fuzzy operators (or fuzzy logic), which has several limitations. In this paper, we generalize existing proposals and show how to reason with a fuzzy extension of the logic SROIQ, the logic behind the language OWL 2, under finitely many-valued Lukasiewicz fuzzy logic. We show for the first time that it is decidable over a finite set of truth values by presenting a reasoning preserving procedure to obtain a non-fuzzy representation for the logic. This reduction makes it possible to reuse current representation languages as well as currently available reasoners for ontologies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
