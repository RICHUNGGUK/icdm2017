The RFMapp is based on the approach previously described by Reuveni et al., and unlike other traditional approaches in the field, which are mainly related to the genes' mean codon translation efficiency, the RFM additionally considers the codon order, the ribosomes' size and their order. Thus, it has been shown that RFM outperforms traditional predictors when analyzing both heterologous and endogenous genes.", "paper_title": "RFMapp: ribosome flow model application", "paper_id": "WOS:000305419800058"}
