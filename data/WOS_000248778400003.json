The projection method is implemented on a half-staggered, moving quadrilateral mesh to keep the velocity field divergence-free, and the conjugate gradient or multigrid method is employed to solve the discrete Poisson equations. The current algorithm is composed by two independent parts: evolution of the governing equations and mesh-redistribution. In the first part, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved on a fixed half-staggered mesh by the rotational incremental pressure-correction scheme, and the Allen-Cahn type of phase equation is approximated by a conservative, second-order accurate central difference scheme, where the Lagrangian multiplier is used to preserve the mass-conservation of the phase field. The second part is an iteration procedure. During the mesh redistribution, the phase field is remapped onto the newly resulting meshes by the high-resolution conservative interpolation, while the non-conservative interpolation algorithm is applied to the velocity field. The projection technique is used to obtain a divergence-free velocity field at the end of this part. The resultant numerical scheme is stable, mass conservative, highly efficient and fast, and capable of handling variable density and viscosity. Several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
