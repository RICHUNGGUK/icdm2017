Microorganisms in the soil are supplied with some nutrients, which they convert into calcium carbonate. These nutrients and the side product of the reaction are dissolved in water. Because of these chemicals, the fluid is denser than water. Moreover, the density changes as a result of the varying composition. This changing density has a significant impact on the flow. Since the composition and hence, the density is not known beforehand, a careful choice of the (pressure) boundary conditions, especially on the outflow boundary, is needed. In this article, several methods to approximate the pressure on the outflow boundary are compared. The method that we propose also works for an unstructured mesh, which gives a large freedom in the mesh generation.", "paper_title": "A robust method to tackle pressure boundary conditions in porous media flow: application to biogrout", "paper_id": "WOS:000336396700001"}
