If where g is the genus of , then there is an embedding of onto in the projective space of the linear series of the divisor E. Moreover, if , then , the vanishing ideal of , is generated by , the homogeneous elements of degree two in . If , then , where is the image of under the map from to . These three results imply that, if , an AG representation of the code can be obtained just using a generator matrix of where is a normal curve in which is the intersection of quadrics. This fact gives us some clues for breaking McEliece cryptosystem based on AG codes provided that we have an efficient procedure for computing and decoding the representation obtained.", "paper_title": "On the unique representation of very strong algebraic geometry codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000329240200018"}
