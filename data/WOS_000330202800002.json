Accumulation of PLIs is increased with long reached optical transparent links, supported data rate and power economy. In the present paper we have designed and implemented dynamic Impairment-Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) heuristic algorithms which introduce impairment awareness in optical transparent links without deploying any additional regenerators. The first IA-RWA solution monitors the effects of PLIs through Distributed Light-path Monitoring modules to obtain certain QoTs. The second IA-RWA algorithm demonstrates substantial reduction in the effects of non-linear PLIs with the implementation of dynamic channel spacing (DCS). In the third IA-RWA solution, instead of dropping the complete light-path we use the available curtailed bandwidth of the impaired light-path to enhance the utilization of the optical capacity and reduce the blocking probability. We also provide the experimental implementation of impairment aware automatic switching of the light-paths. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
