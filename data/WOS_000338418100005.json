To accomplish this, the user must be able to discover which types of network connectivity are available. The IEEE 802.21 standard specifies a media independent information service (MIIS) providing capabilities for discovering network information within a geographical area. The representation and distribution of mobility information in heterogeneous networks are a big challenge, especially in multi-operator environments. In this paper, we introduce a decentralised information service architecture that improves the user experience and ensures scalability for large system deployments. Additionally, an evaluation using the NS-2 network simulator is presented. The results demonstrate that our proposal outperforms the existing approaches in terms of query delay, users optimal handovers and communication overhead, contributing to a traffic decrease at the operators core network and internet.", "paper_title": "Design and evaluation of a decentralised information service architecture for IEEE 802.21 networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000338418100005"}
