In reality, the throughput of MPTCP is far lower than expected. In this paper, we conduct an extensive simulation-based study on this phenomenon, and the results indicate that a subflow experiencing high delay and loss severely affects the performance of other subflows, thus becoming the bottleneck of the MPTCP connection and significantly degrading the aggregate goodput. To tackle this problem, we propose Fountain code-based Multipath TCP (FMTCP), which effectively mitigates the negative impact of the heterogeneity of different paths. FMTCP takes advantage of the random nature of the fountain code to flexibly transmit encoded symbols from the same or different data blocks over different subflows. Moreover, we design a data allocation algorithm based on the expected packet arriving time and decoding demand to coordinate the transmissions of different subflows. Quantitative analyses are provided to show the benefit of FMTCP. We also evaluate the performance of FMTCP through ns-2 simulations and demonstrate that FMTCP outperforms IETF-MPTCP, a typical MPTCP approach, when the paths have diverse loss and delay in terms of higher total goodput, lower delay, and jitter. In addition, FMTCP achieves high stability under abrupt changes of path quality.", "paper_title": "FMTCP: A Fountain Code-Based Multipath Transmission Control Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000353143800010"}
