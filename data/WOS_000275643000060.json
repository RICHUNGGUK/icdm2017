By employing a novel augmented Lyapunov-Krasoviskii functional (LKF), an improved stability condition is obtained in linear matrix inequalities form. The special cases of the obtained criterion turn out to be equivalent to some existing results but include the less number of variables. With the present stability conditions, the computational burden and conservatism are largely reduced. Examples are provided to demonstrate the advantage of the stability results.
