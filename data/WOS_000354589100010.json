However, most of the proposed protocols emphasized on the Cluster Head (CH) selection ignoring how the CHs will send the aggregated data back to the Base Station (BS). Furthermore, they tend to use nonrealistic parameters and assumptions. Such examples include the use of infinite transmission range and location awareness. They also used an energy model that is fundamentally flawed for modelling radio power consumption in sensor networks. In this paper, two Linear Programming (LP) formulations to the problems of clustering and routing are presented followed by two proposed algorithms for the same based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The clustering algorithm finds the optimal set of CHs that maximize the energy efficiency, cluster quality and network coverage. The routing algorithm is developed with a novel particle encoding scheme and fitness function to find the optimal routing tree that connects these CHs to the BS. These two algorithms are then combined into a two-tier protocol to provide a complete and practical clustering model. The effect of using a realistic network and energy consumption model in cluster-based communication for WSN will be investigated. Extensive simulations on 50 homogeneous and heterogeneous WSN models are evaluated and compared against well-known cluster-based sensor network protocols. The results demonstrate that the proposed protocol performs better than such protocols in terms of various performance metrics such as scalability, Paket Delivery Rate (PDR) at the CHs and delivery of total data packets to the BS.
