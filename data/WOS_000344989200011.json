Cyclic sleep control is an effective power-saving technique for optical network units (ONUs) in PON systems. In conventional controllers based on the frame interarrival time (FIAT) information, however, downstream queuing delay at an optical line terminal is greatly affected by the amount of downstream traffic. Our proposed QL-based controllers with feedback control techniques, i.e., QL-based proportional and proportional-derivative controllers, effectively reduce the power consumption of ONUs while maintaining the downstream queuing delay at a constant level. The simulation results confirm that the proposed controllers provide better performance than the conventional FIAT-based controller in terms of power consumption and average queuing delay.", "paper_title": "QoS-Aware Cyclic Sleep Control With Proportional-Derivative Controllers for Energy-Efficient PON Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000344989200011"}
