This paper embraces a number of techniques covering all the steps of water motion simulation and focuses on the dynamic river surface generation and animation, we describes a combination of modeling methods for flood routing process simulation: FFT-based (Fast Fourier Transform) large-scale water surface modeling and dynamic flood peak generation on water surface using a physically based approach. The real-time rendering techniques for the large-scale 3D scene rendering such as LOD and seamless tiling of LOD patches were discussed in detail, we have adapted them to the rendering of flowing river, new method called template culling for fast clipping were also developed. The methods allow the user to interactively fly over a virtual valley, and there are presented results of implementation of the 3D visualization for river flood routing simulation.
