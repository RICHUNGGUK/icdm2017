By examining the technical, relational and business components of an e-business process, we propose a three-layer structure to identify the source of e-business value in procurement, channel management, and customer service processes. We tested research model using structural equation modeling with data collected from 196 manufacturing firms in China. Our results provide support for the following: (1) platform capability and relational governance integrated to enhance e-business process capabilities (EBPCs) and (2) EBPCs, as process enablers, facilitate digital operations activities across organizational interfaces to improve process performance.
