It has been extensively applied in commercial iris recognition systems. IrisCode representing an iris based on coarse phase has a number of properties including rapid matching, binomial impostor distribution and a predictable false acceptance rate. Because of its successful applications and these properties, many similar coding methods have been developed for iris and palmprint identification. However, we lack a detailed analysis of IrisCode. The aim of this paper is to provide such an analysis as a way of better understanding IrisCode, extending the coarse phase representation to a precise phase representation, and uncovering the relationship between IrisCode and other coding methods. Our analysis demonstrates that IrisCode is a clustering algorithm with four prototypes; the locus of a Gabor function is a 2-D ellipse with respect to a phase parameter and can be approximated by a circle in many cases; Gabor function can be considered as a phase-steerable filter and the bitwise hamming distance can be regarded as a bitwise phase distance. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of the impostor binomial distribution. We use this analysis to develop a precise phase representation which can enhance accuracy. Finally, we relate IrisCode and other coding methods.", "paper_title": "An Analysis of IrisCode", "paper_id": "WOS:000273708100019"}
