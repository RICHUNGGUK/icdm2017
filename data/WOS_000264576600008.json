That is, a compartment model of a ship is being generated by modeling all compartments one by one. However, this method requires much time and efforts because the ship consists of compartments of several tens to several hundreds. To solve this problem, a new compartment modeling method of the top-down approach is proposed in this study. The proposed method is based on space subdivision as if we cut food into many small pieces. For this, a new modeling operation named a \"Place\" operation which is a kind of Boolean operations is developed. A non-manifold polyhedron modeling kernel containing the Place operation is also developed. Furthermore, a ship compartment modeling system was developed based on the modeling kernel. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed method and the developed kernel, it is applied to compartment modeling of various ships. As a result, it is shown that a designer can perform easily and rapidly compartment modeling by using the proposed method in early time. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
