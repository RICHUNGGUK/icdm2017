In analogy with existing approaches to a similar problem from other fields of human endeavor, we call this software solution 'a spatial data recommendation service.' In its final version, this service should be capable of matching requests created in the user's mind with the content of the existing datasets, while taking into account the user's preferences obtained from the user's previous use of the service. As a result, the service should recommend a list of datasets best suited to the user's needs. In this regard, we consider metadata, particularly natural language definitions of spatial entities, a crucial piece of the solution. To be able to use this information in the process of matching the user's request with the dataset content, this information must be semantically preprocessed. To automate this task we have applied a machine learning approach. With inductive logic programming (ILP) our system learns rules that identify and extract values for the five most frequent relations/properties found in Slovene natural language definitions of spatial entities. The initially established quality criterion for identifying and extracting information was met in three out of five examples. Therefore we conclude that ILP offers a promising approach to developing an information extraction component of a spatial data recommendation service.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of inductive logic programming for information extraction from natural language texts to support spatial data recommendation services", "paper_id": "WOS:000298083800005"}
