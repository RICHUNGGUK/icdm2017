In order to solve the drawbacks of BP neural network, a novel approach which combines particle swarm optimization and support vector machine (PSO-SVM) is presented to traffic safety forecasting. Firstly, influencing factors of traffic safety and evaluation indexes are analyzed, then traffic safety forecasting model by PSO-SVM is established according to the influencing factors. Finally, the data about traffic safety in China from 1970 to 2006 are applied to research the forecasting ability of the proposed method. The experimental results show that traffic safety forecasting by PSO-SVM is better than that by BP neural network. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
