In this paper, we investigate the diagnosability of fuzzy discrete event systems by proposing a new algorithm based on the concept of undistinguishable strings. Moreover, a necessary and sufficient condition for fuzzy diagnosability is obtained in terms of certain properties of the diagnoser, which is constructed with respect to the minimal observable event. The computing process to check the diagnosability of fuzzy DESs and some examples serving to illuminate the applications are developed and described. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
