This equation governs the field of activation times in a domain where conduction properties are specified. This approach has been applied to knowledgebased interpolation of sparse measurements of activation times and to the creation of initial conditions for detailed ionic models of cardiac propagation. This paper presents the mathematical basis, matrix formulation, and compact Matlab implementation of an iterative finite-element solver (triangular meshes) for the eikonal-diffusion equation extended to reentrant activations, which automatically identifies the period of reentry and computes the resulting isochrones. An iterative algorithm is designed to perform Laplacian interpolation of reentrant activation maps to be used as initial estimate for the eikonal-diffusion solver. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed in test-case geometries (ventricular slice and simplified atrial surface model). (c) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
