In this approach, the effect of flow separation due to stall at any wing section is modeled as an effective reduction in section camber. The approach uses a wing analysis method for potential-flow calculations and viscous airfoil lift curves for the sections as input. The calculation procedure is implemented using a Newton-Raphson iteration to simultaneously satisfy the boundary condition, which comes from potential-flow wing theory, and drive the sectional operating points toward their respective viscous lift curves, as required for convergence. Of particular interest in this research is the calculation of the residuals during the Newton iteration. Unlike a typical implementation of the Newton iteration, the residual calculation is not performed via a straightforward function evaluation, but rather by estimating the target operating points on the input viscous lift curves. Estimation of these target operating points depends on the assumptions made in the cross-coupling of the decambering at the different sections. This paper presents four residual calculation schemes for the decambering approach. The residual calculation schemes are compared against each other to assess computational speed and robustness. Decambering results are also compared with higher-order computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solutions for rectangular and swept wings. Results from the best scheme compare well with the CFD solutions for the rectangular wing, motivating further development of the method. Poor predictions for the swept wings are traced to spanwise propagation of separated flow at stall, highlighting the limitations of the current approach.
