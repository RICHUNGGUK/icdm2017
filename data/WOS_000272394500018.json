A new sufficient condition is proposed that guarantees the global robust synchronizing of such a network. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated by performing simulations on two illustrative examples.", "paper_title": "A Novel Robust Impulsive Chaos Synchronization Approach for Uncertain Complex Dynamical Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000272394500018"}
