In this paper, we introduce a novel and efficient reclaiming algorithm, named M-CASH, for multiprocessor platforms. M-CASH leverages the resource reservation approach offered by the Multiprocessor CBS server offering significant improvements. The correctness of the algorithm is formally proven and its performance is evaluated through extensive synthetic simulations.", "paper_title": "M-CASH: A real-time resource reclaiming algorithm for multiprocessor platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000258324100004"}
