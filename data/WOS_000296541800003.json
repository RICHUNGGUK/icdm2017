The increasing focus of the computer sciences community is motivated by a large panel of applications where other welfare notions do not suit. Centralized approaches are usually used, but they suffer from important drawbacks. Because relationships among society members are not considered, the provided resource allocation may not be achievable in practice. This study seeks to provide an evenly distributed approach based on a multiagent system, which overcomes the main drawbacks of centralized approaches. We provide an adaptive, anytime, and scalable algorithm to hold efficient egalitarian negotiations. Negotiation processes lead to socially efficient allocations as an emergent phenomenon. We also evaluate the \"price of the social graph\" toward the negotiation efficiency, and we provide the agent behavior to implement in order to achieve fair allocations.", "paper_title": "EGALITARIAN NEGOTIATIONS IN AGENT SOCIETIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000296541800003"}
