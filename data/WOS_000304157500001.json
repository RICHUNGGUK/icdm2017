This has resulted in the global governments' appeal to people to take public transportation systems as much as possible. But, the public transportation system has a lot of problems that cause people's interest in taking the public transportation system to get lower and lower. For example, many passengers use many kinds of management loopholes to avoid buying tickets. This action forces the companies involved in providing the public transportation system to strengthen manpower for inspecting tickets. Hence, the companies will shift cost to the customers forcing ticket prices higher and higher as well as passengers becoming more frustrated with the increase in inspecting tickets. In this paper, we take the Taiwan Railways Administration (it owns different ticket types and different train types in the same public transportation system) as our implement environment and we use Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) methods conforming to EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2 (C1G2) standards to solve this train-jumping problem and reduce the manpower cost of the public transportation system companies. And most importantly, our scheme also enhances higher security.
