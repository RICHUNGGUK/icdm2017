They are equivalent to convex rank tests and to polyhedral fans that coarsen the reflection arrangement of the symmetric group S,,. In this paper we resolve two problems on semigraphoids posed in Studeny's book (2005), and we answer a related question of Postnikov, Reiner and Williams on generalized permutohedra. We also study the semigroup and the toric ideal associated with semi-graphoids.", "paper_title": "Three counter-examples on semi-graphoids", "paper_id": "WOS:000254483900004"}
