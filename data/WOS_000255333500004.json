In this paper, a novel approach of clustering based on Fuzzy C- means clustering is proposed, which is called cooperative clustering, and use it for selection of centers of radial basis function neural network. Experimental results show that the performance of classification using our approach is better than radial basis function neural network.", "paper_title": "A novel radial basis function neural network classifier with centers set by cooperative clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000255333500004"}
