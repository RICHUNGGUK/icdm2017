Through a dataset of 229 academic patent inventors, this paper reveals that the effects of research commercialization on publication quantity, application-oriented research, and disclosure delay are moderated by the entrepreneurial commitment of faculty members. This paper concludes that encouraging entrepreneurial commitment of faculty members may possibly drive academics away from their traditional approaches in producing and diffusing knowledge.", "paper_title": "Academic research commercialization and knowledge production and diffusion: the moderating effects of entrepreneurial commitment", "paper_id": "WOS:000276499500006"}
