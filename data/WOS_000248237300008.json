To offer low power consumption, each node and coordinator to be active and sleep states based on the time-slot schedule of Chinese remainder theorem. To provide low packet latency, our C-MAC protocol provides an adaptive time-slot scheme to distributively and dynamically wake up time slots for the burst data transmission in a duty cycle. Finally, simulation results illustrate our performance achievements to verify that C-MAC performs better than existing TDMA-based MAC protocols, BMA and EMAC, in terms of power consumption and average packet latency.", "paper_title": "C-MAC: An energy-efficient MAC scheme using Chinese-remainder-theorem for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000248237300008"}
