The review shows information retrieval systems, filtering systems, recommender systems, and web quality evaluation tools, which are based on tools of fuzzy linguistic modelling. The fuzzy linguistic modelling allows us to represent and manage the subjectivity, vagueness and imprecision that is intrinsic and characteristic of the processes of information searching, and, in such a way, the developed systems allow users the access to quality information in a flexible and user-adapted way.", "paper_title": "A Review on Information Accessing Systems Based on Fuzzy Linguistic Modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000282754200004"}
