To send data through a channel, one guarantees that the environment gets no information about it. Uhlmann's theorem then ensures that the receiver must be able to decode. While a wide range of problems can be solved this way, one of the most basic coding problems remains impervious to a direct application of this method, sending classical information through a quantum channel. We will show that this problem can, in fact, be solved using decoupling ideas, specifically by proving a dequantizing theorem, which ensures that the environment is only classically correlated with the sent data. Our techniques naturally yield a generalization of the Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland theorem to the one-shot scenario, where a quantum channel can be applied only once.", "paper_title": "Decoupling Approach to Classical Data Transmission Over Quantum Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000331902400015"}
