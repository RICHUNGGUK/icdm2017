The Biometric Menagerie illustrates how each person in a given dataset performs in a biometric system, by using their genuine and impostor scores, and providing them a classification based upon those scores. This research examined the biometric menagerie classifications across different force levels in a fingerprint recognition study to uncover if individuals performed the same over five force levels. The study concluded that they did not, and a new metric has been created to quantify this phenomenon. As a result of this discovery, the new metric, Stability Score Index is described to showcase the movement of individuals in the menagerie.", "paper_title": "Stability of Individuals in a Fingerprint System across Force Levels An Introduction to the Stability Score Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000365355200003"}
