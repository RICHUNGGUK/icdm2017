In this study, the authors present detection and tracking of single and multiple objects in video sequences using AM-FM features. The authors use the particle filtering framework for estimating the motion parameters. The single object tracking algorithm uses an affine motion model and a subspace-based appearance model. The multiple object tracking algorithm, which is a logical extension of single object tracking, can handle varying number of interacting objects. The performance of both single and multiple object tracking is illustrated on real-world videos.", "paper_title": "Object tracking using AM-FM image features", "paper_id": "WOS:000284306600006"}
