Inadequate spatial resolution is often found to cause inaccuracies in spray simulation using the Lagrangian-Eulerian approach due to the over-estimated diffusion and inappropriate liquid-gas phase coupling. Dynamic mesh refinement algorithms adaptive to fuel sprays and vapor gradients were developed in order to increase the grid resolution in the spray region to improve simulation accuracy. The local refinement introduced the coarse-fine face interface that requires advanced numerical schemes for flux calculation and grid rezoning with moving boundaries. To resolve the issue in flux calculation, this work implemented the refinement/coarsening algorithms into a collocated solver to avoid tedious interpolations in solving the momentum equations. A pressure correction method was applied to address unphysical pressure oscillations due to the collocation of pressure and velocity. An edge-based algorithm was used to evaluate the edge-centered quantities in order to account for the contributions from all the cells around an edge at the coarse-fine interface. A quasi-second-order upwind scheme with strong monotonicity was also modified to accommodate the coarse-fine interface for convective fluxes. To resolve the issue related to grid rezoning, rezoning was applied to the initial baseline mesh only and the new locations of the refined grids were obtained by interpolating the updated baseline mesh. The time step constraints were also re-evaluated to account for the change resulting from mesh refinement. The present refinement algorithm was used in simulating fuel sprays in an engine combustion chamber. It was found that the present approach could produce the same level of results as those using the uniformly fine mesh with substantially reduced computer time. Results also showed that this approach could alleviate the artifacts related to the Lagrangian discrete modeling of spray drops due to insufficient spatial resolution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
