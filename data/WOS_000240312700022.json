Developed to flesh out events used in natural language semantics, the approach supports reasoning about action in AI, including the frame problem and inertia. Representational and inferential aspects of the approach are explored, centering on conciseness of language, context update and constraint application with bias.", "paper_title": "Finite-state temporal projection", "paper_id": "WOS:000240312700022"}
