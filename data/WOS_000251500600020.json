Similar to direct LDA (D-LDA), PD-LDA is a modification of KLB (the Karhunen-Loeve expansion based on the between-class scatter matrix). As an improvement of D-LDA and KLB, PD-LDA inherits two important advantages of them. That is, it can be directly applied to high-dimensional input spaces and implemented with great efficiency. Meanwhile, experimental results conducted on two benchmark face image databases, i.e., AR and FERET, demonstrate that PD-LDA is much more effective and robust than D-LDA. In addition, it outperforms state-of-the-art facial feature extraction methods such as KLB, eigenfaces, and Fisherfaces. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
