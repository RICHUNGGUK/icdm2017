This problem is known as resource co-allocation which has evolved as a hot topic in network computing. How to design a kind of high-performance protocol for deadlock and livelock avoidance resource co-allocation becomes a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a new protocol OODP(3) (Optimal ODP(3)) which is based on the currently popular protocol ODP(3) (Order-based Deadlock Prevention Protocol with Parallel requests).OODP(3) not only inherits the advantage of ODP(3) but also guarantees the fulfillment of resource co-allocation within polynomial time. Theoretical proof is conducted to verify the correctness of OODP(3). Experimental results also show that OODP(3) achieves the better performance improvements than the existing deadlock and livelock avoidance protocol.", "paper_title": "An Improved Protocol for Deadlock and Livelock Avoidance Resource Co-allocation in Network Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000278585500006"}
