Though IDS has been developed for many years, the large number of alerts makes the system inefficient. In this paper, we proposed a classification method based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a weighted voting schema to detect intrusions. First, the entropy and TF-IDF (term frequency and inverse documents frequency) features are extracted from processes. Next, entropy and TF-IDF features are sent to the SVM model for learning and testing. Finally, we use a voting schema named Weighted Voting SVM (WV-SVM) to determine whether a process is an intrusion. Our experiments demonstrate improved efficiency.", "paper_title": "Intrusion detection using a hybrid support vector machine based on entropy and TF-IDF", "paper_id": "WOS:000253272000019"}
