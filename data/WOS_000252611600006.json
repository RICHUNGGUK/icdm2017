The algorithm is based on a blockwise subdivision of the method-of-moment potential coefficient matrix. Matrix subblocks corresponding to distant sub-regions of the problem geometry are not calculated directly but approximated in a compressed form. Subsequently, the matrix is decomposed using an algorithm that preserves the compression. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on a common benchmark problem-a 6 x 6 bus crossing. The numerical cost of the algorithm is shown, both theoretically and numerically, to scale with N log(3) N and the storage space with N log(2) N.", "paper_title": "Compressed block-decomposition algorithm for fast capacitance extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000252611600006"}
