The rate constants of the isomerization reaction are reported by employing the direct ab initio dynamics method. The geometries of all the stationary points were optimized using the B3LYP and CCSD methods with the cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets. The information along the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) was also calculated at the CASSCF/6-31+G (d,p) level of theory. The energies were refined at the G3, G3MP2, G3MP2B3, CBS-Q, CBS-QB3, and two high-level (HL) methods based on the geometries optimized using CASSCF/6-31+G(d,p). The rate constants were evaluated using conventional transition-state theory (TST), canonical variational transition-state theory (CVT), and canonical variational transition-state theory with small curvature tunneling correction (CVT/SCT) and conventional transition-state theory with Eckart tunneling correction (TST/Eckart). According to the calculated results, we conclude that the tunneling effect is very important to this isomerization reaction.", "paper_title": "The reaction of the aminoboranylidene-iminoborane isomerization: a CASSCF direct dynamics study", "paper_id": "WOS:000234444400008"}
