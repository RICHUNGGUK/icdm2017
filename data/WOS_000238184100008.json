Analytically derived performance results indicate a potential capacity gain when introducing multihop communication. In this paper a novel resource allocation scheme is presented that beneficially exploits these potentials of relaying by means of concurrent resource scheduling under control of a central station. However, whether multihop communication can be advantageously deployed strongly depends on parameters like noise power, interference, selected modulation and coding scheme, attenuation, and distance between source and destination. These dependencies will be demonstrated by means of analytical performance evaluations taking into account link-level simulations. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
