Most existing mobility models have not been developed with consideration of the obstacles that exist in a disaster environment. This paper proposes two methods of mobility that realistically represent movement in an environment with obstacles. Unmarked Point Model (UPM) uses a high granularity strategy and Adjacency Vertex Model (AVM) uses a method that selects the shortest pathway. UPM consumes more resources than AVM to generate node mobility patterns in an ad hoc network, on a real map area of an urban area, where obstacles have been placed to simulate an emergency and rescue scenario. In addition, a comparative analysis of both models in its routing performance is done using AODV [18].", "paper_title": "Unmarked Point and Adjacency Vertex, Mobility Models for the Generation of Emergency and Rescue Scenarios in Urban Areas", "paper_id": "WOS:000344446100003"}
