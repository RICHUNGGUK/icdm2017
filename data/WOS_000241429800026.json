Template matching is performed using edginess-based representation of face images. The edginess-based representation of face images is computed using onedimensional (1-D) processing of images. An approach is proposed based on autoassociative neural network (AANN) models to verify the identity of a person using score obtained from template matching.", "paper_title": "Template matching approach for pose problem in face verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800026"}
