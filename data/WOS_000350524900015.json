By utilizing the pinning control technique and constructing the appropriate stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, several sufficient conditions are proposed to ensure the finite-time synchronization for the neutral complex dynamical networks with Markovian switching, on the basis of Kronecker product, inequality techniques and finite-time stability theorem. Finally, numerical examples and simulations are given to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
