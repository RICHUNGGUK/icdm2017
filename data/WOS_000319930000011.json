In this paper, some properties of communication between information systems based on fuzzy rough sets are investigated. The concepts of fuzzy relation mappings between universes are first proposed in order to construct a fuzzy relation of one universe according to the given fuzzy relation on the other universe. The main properties of the mappings are studied. The notions of homomorphism of information systems based on fuzzy rough sets are then proposed, and it is proved that properties of relation operations in the original information system and structural features of the system, such as approximations of arbitrary fuzzy sets and attribute reductions, are guaranteed in its image system under the condition of homomorphism.", "paper_title": "Communication Between Information Systems Using Fuzzy Rough Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000319930000011"}
