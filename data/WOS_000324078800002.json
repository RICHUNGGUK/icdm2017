The algorithm works by extending to dimension one the local generic position method for solving zero-dimensional polynomial equation systems. Here, certified means that the approximation curve and the original curve have the same topology and their Hausdorff distance is smaller than a given precision. The main advantage of the algorithm, inherited from the local generic position method, is that the topology computation and approximation for a space curve are directly reduced to the same tasks for two plane curves. In particular, an error bound of the approximation space curve is deduced explicitly from the error bounds of the approximation plane curves. The complexity of the algorithm is also analyzed. Its effectivity is shown on some non-trivial examples. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
