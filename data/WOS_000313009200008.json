In semi-supervised clustering, pairwise constraints, that is, must-link and cannot-link, are frequently used in order to improve clustering performances. From the viewpoint of handling pairwise constraints, a new semi-supervised fuzzy c-means clustering is proposed by introducing clusterwise tolerance-based pairwise constraints. First, a concept of clusterwise tolerance-based pairwise constraints is introduced. Second, the optimization problems of the proposed method are formulated. Especially, must-link and cannot-link are handled by opposite criteria in our proposed method. Third, a new clustering algorithm is constructed based on the above discussions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified through numerical examples.", "paper_title": "On semi-supervised fuzzy c-means clustering for data with clusterwise tolerance by opposite criteria", "paper_id": "WOS:000313009200008"}
