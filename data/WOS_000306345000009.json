Most of these inaccurate results are due to a failure to understand the user's search goal. This paper proposes a method to extract users' intentions and to build an intention map representing these extracted intentions. The proposed method makes intention vectors from clicked pages from previous search logs obtained on a given query. The components of the intention vector are weights of the keywords in a document. It extracts user's intentions by using clustering the intention vectors and extracting intention keywords from each cluster. The extracted the intentions on a query are represented in an intention map. For the efficiency analysis of intention map, we extracted user's intentions using 2,600 search log data a current domestic commercial search engine. The experimental results with a search engine using the intention maps show statistically significant improvements in user satisfaction scores.", "paper_title": "Automatic extraction of user's search intention from web search logs", "paper_id": "WOS:000306345000009"}
