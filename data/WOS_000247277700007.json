This paper proposes a novel Anomaly detection system based on the comparison of real traffic and DSNS (Digital Signature of Network Segment), generated by BLGBA (Baseline for Automatic Backbone Management) model, within a hysteresis interval using the residual mean and on the correlation of the detected deviations. Extensive experimental results on real network servers confirmed that our system is able to detect anomalies on the monitored devices, avoiding the high false alarms rate.", "paper_title": "Anomaly detection aiming pro-active management of computer network based on digital signature of network segment", "paper_id": "WOS:000247277700007"}
