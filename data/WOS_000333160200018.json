These polynomials can be optimized for maximum model identification stability under different input signal distributions. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed polynomial models are demonstrated and compared to the ones of previously published models. The obtained results revealed an exceptional numerical stability regardless of the input signal statistics, making the proposed new models suitable for multimode and broadband nonlinear wireless transmitters.
