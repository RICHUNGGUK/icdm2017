To extrapolate the product's reliability at use condition, the ADT requires a known functional link relating the harsh testing environment to the usual use environment. Practitioners are often faced with a great challenge to designate an explicit form of the stress-degradation relationship a priori in accelerated degradation models. In this paper, we propose three methods to make direct inference on the lifetime distribution itself without invoking arbitrary assumptions on the degradation model: delta approximation, multiple imputation of failure-times, and the lifetime distribution-based (LDB) method. The methods are easy to implement without computational difficulty, hence they have potential in a wide range of applications for estimating lifetime distributions from ADT data. We applied the methods to two ADT data sets including a real application of commercial organic light-emitting diodes (OLED). The analysis of the examples and simulation results suggests parametric LDB and multiple imputation method as more potential alternatives to traditional failure-time approaches, especially for the case where there is neither enough physical background, nor historical evidence supporting presumed relationships between stress and the parameters of the degradation model.", "paper_title": "Direct Prediction Methods on Lifetime Distribution of Organic Light-Emitting Diodes From Accelerated Degradation Tests", "paper_id": "WOS:000278618100009"}
