It is mainly dedicated to researchers and programmers who want a simple basis for studying Situated Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and more generally AI algorithms, in the context of Autonomous Robotics and Autonomous Agents. It is is kept voluntarily readable and simple for fast implementation in the field of Research and/or Education. Moreover, Simbad embeds two stand-alone additional packages : a Neural Network library (feed-forward NN, recurrent NN, etc.) and an Artificial Evolution Framework for Genetic Algorithm, Evolutionary Strategies and Genetic Programming. These packages are targeted towards Evolutionary Robotics.", "paper_title": "Simbad: An autonomous robot simulation package for education and research", "paper_id": "WOS:000242125300068"}
