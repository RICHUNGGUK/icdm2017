The realization of this process (the order in which the transformation operations must be executed) should be preceded by a specification of the transformation process at a higher level of abstraction. The specification is given through mappings representing abstract operations specific to the transformation process. These mappings are defined through weaving models and metamodels. A generated weaving metamodel (GWMM) is proposed giving the complete mapping semantics through specific link types (representing the abstract operations) and appropriate OCL constraints. Weaving models specifying the actual mappings must be in accordance with this proposed GWMM.", "paper_title": "The Specification of ETL Transformation Operations based on Weaving Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000310664900020"}
