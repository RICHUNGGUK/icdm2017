It integrates the merits of evolutionary structure optimization (ESO) and level set method (LSM). Traditional LSM algorithm is largely dependent on the initial guess topology. The proposed method combines the merits of ESO techniques with those of LSM algorithm, while allowing new holes to be automatically generated in low strain energy within the nodal neighboring region during optimization. The validity and robustness of the new algorithm are supported by some widely used benchmark examples in topology optimization. Numerical computations show that optimization convergence is accelerated effectively. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
