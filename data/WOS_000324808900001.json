This paper proposed a new design method for the mix proportion of recycled aggregate concrete to reduce the number of trial mixes. Genetic algorithm is adapted for the method, which has been an optimization technique to solve the multi-criteria problem through the simulated biological evolutionary process. Fitness functions for the required properties of concrete such as slump, density, strength, elastic modulus, carbonation resistance, price and carbon dioxide emission were developed based on statistical analysis on conventional data or adapted from various early studies. Then these fitness functions were applied in the genetic algorithm. As a result, several optimum mix proportions for recycled aggregate concrete that meets required performances were obtained.", "paper_title": "Genetic algorithm in mix proportion design of recycled aggregate concrete", "paper_id": "WOS:000324808900001"}
