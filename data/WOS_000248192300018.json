A clustering-based technique has been devised for estim ating globally matched wavelet filters using a collection of groundtruth images. We have extended our text extraction scheme for the segmentation of document images into text, background, and picture components (which include graphics and continuous tone images). Multiple, two-class Fisher classifiers have been used for this purpose. We also exploit contextual information by using a Markov random field formulation-based pixel labeling scheme for refinement of the segmentation results. Experimental results have established effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Text extraction and document image segmentation using matched wavelets and MRF model", "paper_id": "WOS:000248192300018"}
