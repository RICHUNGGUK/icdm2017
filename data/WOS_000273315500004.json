On the one hand, we prove that an efficient computation for these P systems can be described using linear algebra techniques. In particular, we show that the Computation for getting a configuration in Such P systems call be carried out by multiplying appropriate matrices. Oil the other hand, we also show that membrane computing techniques can be used to get the nth power of it given matrix.", "paper_title": "Efficient computation in rational-valued P systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000273315500004"}
