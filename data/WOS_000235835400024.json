This paper introduces a new paradigm that is based on the concept of soft-hierarchical operators implemented in a pyramid architecture to retrieve global versus local symmetries. The concept of symmetry is mathematically well defined in geometry whenever patterns are crisp images (two levels). Necessity for a soft approach occurs whenever images are multi-levels and the separation between object and background is subjective or not well defined. The paper describes a new pyramid operator to detect symmetries and shows some experiments supporting the approach.
