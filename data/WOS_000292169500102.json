In the practical applications, the cost of misclassification is worthy of consideration in the modeling in order to make accurate and desirable decisions. An effective prediction system requires the integration of the cost preference into the construction and optimization of prediction models. This paper presents an evolutionary approach for optimizing simultaneously the complexity and the weights of learning vector quantization network under the symmetric cost preference. Experimental evidences on a real-world data set demonstrate the proposed algorithm leads to significant reduction of features without the degradation of prediction capability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
