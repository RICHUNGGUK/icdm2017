Our security core is based on a one-time pad (OTP) encryption circuit and a CRC-based integrity checking module. These modules safeguard external memory used by embedded processors against a series of well-known attacks, including replay attacks, spoofing attacks and relocation attacks. Our implementation limits on-chip memory space overhead to less than 33% versus memory used by a standard microprocessor and reduces memory latency achieved by previous approaches by at least half. The performance loss for software execution with our solution is only 10% compared with a non-protected implementation. An FPGA prototype of our security core has been completed to validate our findings. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
