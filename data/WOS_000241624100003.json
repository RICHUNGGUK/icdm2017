This opportunity naturally requires a methodology to assess to what extent the legacy e-services are transformed to the uT-based services. However, research about assessing the level of u-Transformation has been still very few. Hence, this paper aims-to propose a methodology for assessing the level of u-Transformation oriented by the teleology of ubiquitous services. A case study, GPS-based navigation services, is performed to show the feasibility of the methodology addressed in this paper.", "paper_title": "A methodology for assessing the level of U-transformation of ubiquitous services", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624100003"}
