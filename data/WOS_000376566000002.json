In drawing together intersecting interests in Geographic Information Systems and spatio-cultural narratives and experiences, this work defines an interdisciplinary field of research that is gathering momentum as geolocative technologies that shape and reshape the ways in which we perceive and experience the world become increasingly prevalent in academic life and in the cultural mainstream.", "paper_title": "CONCEPTUALIZING AND MAPPING GEOCULTURAL SPACE", "paper_id": "WOS:000376566000002"}
