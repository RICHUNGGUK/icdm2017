An adaptive version of a consistent and conservative scheme has been developed for simulating the MHD flows. Besides, the present study forms the first attempt to apply the cut-cell approach for irregular wall-bounded MHD flows, which is more flexible and conveniently implemented under adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique. It employs a Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) approach to represent the fluid-conducting wall interface that makes it possible to solve the fluid-solid coupling magnetic problems, emphasizing at how electric field solver is implemented when conductivity is discontinuous in cut-cell. For the irregular cut-cells, the conservative interpolation technique is applied to calculate the Lorentz force at cell-center. On the other hand, it will be shown how consistent and conservative scheme is implemented on fine/coarse mesh boundaries when using AMR technique. Then, the applied numerical schemes are validated by five test simulations and excellent agreement was obtained for all the cases considered, simultaneously showed good consistency and conservative properties.
