Many fitting algorithms have been developed. This paper proposes several novel plug-and-play components or strategies: the use of T-splines for fitting, a curvature-guided strategy, faithful re-parameterization and initial spline knot re-placement, which can be used to enhance fitting algorithms. We also present an adaptive T-spline fitting algorithm integrating these components and strategies. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate these components. Our fitting algorithm can generate spline surfaces that well respect the geometrical features of input mesh models and have a more compact representation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
