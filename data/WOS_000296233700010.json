However, UPnP doesn't support sharing this content between homes (for example, with friends, relatives, or workmates), and content can be difficult to find. A UPnP extension provides uniform access to multimedia content belonging to different homes, such as content from a user's Facebook friends. In addition, an extended UPnP control point lets users add semantic annotations to their multimedia resources and link them to the linked data cloud to facilitate their discovery by others.", "paper_title": "A Semantically Enhanced UPnP Control Point for Sharing Multimedia Content", "paper_id": "WOS:000296233700010"}
