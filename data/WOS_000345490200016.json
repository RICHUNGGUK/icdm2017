The practical efficiency of the Symmetric Split-Step method is highly dependent on the computational grid points distribution along the fiber, therefore an efficient adaptive step-size control strategy is mandatory. The most common approach for step-size control is the \"step-doubling\" approach. It provides an estimation of the local error for an extra computational cost of around 50%. Alternatively there exist in optics literature other approaches based on the observation along the propagation length of the behavior of a given optical quantity. The step-size at each computational step is set so as to guarantee that the known properties of the quantity are preserved. These approaches derived under specific physical assumptions are low cost but suffer from a lack of generality. In this paper we present a new method for estimating the local error in the Symmetric Split-Step method when solving the NLSE. It conciliates the advantages of the step-doubling approach in terms of generality without the drawback of requiring a significant extra computational cost. The method is related to Embedded Split-Step methods for nonlinear evolution problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
