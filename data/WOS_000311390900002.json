Authors have developed different approaches in order to detect automatically the safety for mid-small railway networks. Although these approaches are very simple to implement, they have the drawback of being unsuitable to large networks since the algorithm takes large time to be run. In this paper, we show a new algebraic model which, besides being also simple to implement, has the advantage of being very fast and consequently can be used for checking the safety in a large railway network.", "paper_title": "A logic-algebraic approach to decision taking in a railway interlocking system", "paper_id": "WOS:000311390900002"}
