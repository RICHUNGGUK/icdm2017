The P-model is proposed to obtain the maximum probability of the objective functions and rough approximation is applied to deal with the feasible set with random parameters. The fuzzy programming technique and genetic algorithm are then applied to solve the crisp programming problem. Finally, the application to Auchan's inventory system is given in order to show the efficiency of the proposed models and algorithms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
