Essentially the management of the system is being handed to the system itself, therefore the issue of trust in terms of the decisions the system makes regarding itself, is of paramount interest. This paper considers four aspects of trust in self-adaptive computing systems with the aim to identify trends and pinpoint areas that require more investigation.", "paper_title": "Can self-managed systems be trusted?
