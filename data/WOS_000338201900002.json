In this study, a measurement-based model was developed to calibrate an a-Si EPID response to dose for transit dosimetry by comparison with a reference ionization chamber. The ionization chamber reference depth and the required additional buildup thickness for electronic portal imaging devices (EPID) transit dosimetry were determined. The combined effects of changes in radiation field size, phantom thickness, and the off-axis distance on EPID transit dosimetry were characterized. The effect of scattered radiation on out-of-field response was investigated for different field sizes and phantom thicknesses by evaluation of the differences in image profiles and in-water measured profiles. An algorithm was developed to automatically apply these corrections to EPID images based on the user-specified field size and phantom thickness. The average phantom thickness and an effective field size were used for IMRT fields, and images were acquired in cine mode in the presence of an anthropomorphic phantom. The effective field size was defined as the percentage of the jaw-defined field that was involved during the delivery. Nine head and neck dynamic IMRT fields were tested by comparison with a MatriXX two-dimensional array dosimeter using the Gamma (3 %, 3 mm) evaluation. A depth of 1.5 cm was selected as the ionization chamber reference depth. An additional 2.2 mm of copper buildup was added to the EPID. Comparison of EPID and MatriXX dose images for the tested fields showed that using a 10 % threshold, the average number of points with Gamma index < 1 was 96.5 %. The agreement in the out-of field area was shown by selection of a 2 % threshold which on average resulted in 94.8 % of points with a Gamma index < 1. The suggested method is less complicated than previously reported techniques and can be used for all a-Si EPIDs regardless of the manufacturer.", "paper_title": "Transit dosimetry in dynamic IMRT with an a-Si EPID", "paper_id": "WOS:000338201900002"}
