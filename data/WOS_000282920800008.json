In the case k = 2, our criteria are equally strong to the best methods known so far, while in all other cases there are currently no comparable criteria known. We also show how the criteria can be implemented experimentally.", "paper_title": "CRITERION FOR K-SEPARABILITY IN MIXED MULTIPARTITE STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000282920800008"}
