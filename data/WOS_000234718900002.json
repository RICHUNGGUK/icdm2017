Tool support for localizing the faulty statements is critical, because it reduces development time and overall project costs. Automated source-level debugging and a new and novel debugging model allow for source-level debugging of large VHDL designs at the granularity of statements and expressions. This technique is fully automated and does not require that an engineer be familiar with formal verification techniques.", "paper_title": "Automated source-level error localization in hardware designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000234718900002"}
