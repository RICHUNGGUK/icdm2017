However, since conventional self-reconfigurable devices are LUT-array-based fine-grained devices, their time efficiency is spoiled by overhead for reconfiguration time to load large amount of configuration data. Therefore, we have to improve architectures. At the architecture design phase, it is difficult to estimate the performance, including reconfiguration overhead, of self-reconfigurable devices by static analysis, since it depends on many architecture parameters and unpredictable run-time behavior. In this paper, we propose a simulation-based platform for design exploration of self-reconfigurable devices. As a demonstration of the proposed platform, we implement an adaptive load distribution model on the devices of various reconfiguration granularities and evaluate performance of the devices.", "paper_title": "A simulation platform for designing cell-array-based self-reconfigurable architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000245929500012"}
