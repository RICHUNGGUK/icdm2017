Frequency hopping sequences are used in FH-CDMA systems. In this paper, an earlier idea of constructing optimal sets of frequency hopping sequences is further investigated. New optimal parameters of sets of frequency hopping sequences are obtained with subcodes of the Reed-Solomon codes. Optimal sets of frequency hopping sequences are constructed with a class of irreducible cyclic codes. As a byproduct, the weight distribution of a subclass of irreducible cyclic codes is determined.", "paper_title": "Optimal Sets of Frequency Hopping Sequences From Linear Cyclic Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000278812000045"}
