Cost-sensitive learning methods can help them achieve this goal. In this paper, we introduce Pessimistic Active Learning (PAL). PAL employs a novel pessimistic measure, which relies on confidence intervals and is used to balance the exploration/exploitation trade-off. In order to acquire an initial sample of labeled data, PAL applies orthogonal arrays of fractional factorial design. PAL was tested on ten datasets using a decision tree inducer. A comparison of these results to those of other methods indicates PAL's superiority.", "paper_title": "Pessimistic cost-sensitive active learning of decision trees for profit maximizing targeting campaigns", "paper_id": "WOS:000258601500007"}
