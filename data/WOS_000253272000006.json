Furthermore, mRNA transcription suppression caused by antisense also clearized and made possible the speedy result of the cell biological investigation. We created primer design protocol using fuzzy deducing theory, because most of the traditional computer protocol succeeded less than 20%. 90% of our primers functioned after following checking (1. GC Contents Check; 2. Self Homology Check; 3. Fuzzy Deducing Homologous Check: [versus a.: GAPDH, b: Profilin, c: beta-actin]). We also added 4: gene family checking to target into a real mRNA out of similar sequences, and 5: 5'-, & -3' homology checking. Fuzzy deducing checking protocol made it possible to select real VEGF mRNA from a gene family in which there are many similar sequences.", "paper_title": "Design of RT-PCR primers method considered by gene family", "paper_id": "WOS:000253272000006"}
