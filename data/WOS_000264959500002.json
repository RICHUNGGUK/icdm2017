At its core is a new method that enables direct intersection and Boolean operations between designed geometry (objects bounded by NURBS and polygonal surfaces) and scanned geometry (objects represented by point cloud data). We use the moving least-squares (MLS) surface as the underlying surface representation for acquired point-sampled geometry. Based on the MLS surface definition, we derive closed formula for computing curvature of planar curves on the MLS surface. A set of intersection algorithms including line and MLS surface intersection, curvature-adaptive plane and MLS surface intersection, and polygonal mesh and MLS surface intersection are successively developed. Further, an algorithm for NURBS and MLS surface intersection is then developed. It first adaptively subdivides NURBS surfaces into polygonal mesh, and then intersects the mesh with the MLS surface. The intersection points are mapped to the NURBS surface through the Gauss-Newton method. Based on the above algorithms, a prototype system has been implemented. Through various examples from the system, we demonstrate that direct Boolean intersection between designed geometry and acquired geometry offers a useful and effective means for the shape modeling applications where point-cloud data is involved.
