Their time complexities are not optimal, however; in particular, they are always multiplied by a factor that depends on the alphabet size. In this article, we achieve, for the first time, full alphabet independence in the time complexities of self-indexes while retaining space optimality. We also obtain some relevant byproducts.", "paper_title": "Alphabet-Independent Compressed Text Indexing", "paper_id": "WOS:000343962200007"}
