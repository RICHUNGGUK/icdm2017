We developed a high-performance dynamic on-chip memory-allocation method for SIMD processors by considering the memory access pattern as well as the access frequency. The access pattern and the access count for an array of a loop are determined by both code analysis and profiling, which are performed on a developed compiler framework. This framework not only conducts dynamic on-chip memory allocation but also generates optimized codes for a target processor. The proposed allocation method has been tested with several multimedia benchmarks including motion estimation, 2-D discrete cosine transform, and MPEG2 encoder programs.", "paper_title": "Access-Pattern-Aware On-Chip Memory Allocation for SIMD Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164100015"}
