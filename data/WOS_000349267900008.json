This shift increased the probability that a fault occurring in an application propagates to others with the risk of a failure of the entire safety-critical system. This calls for new tools for the on-line detection of anomalous behaviors of the system, predicting thus a system failure before it happens, allowing the deployment of appropriate mitigation policies. The paper proposes a novel architecture, namely CASPER, for online failure prediction that has the distinctive features to be (i) black-box: no knowledge of applications internals and logic of the system is required (ii) non-intrusive: no status information of the components is used such as CPU or memory usage; The architecture has been implemented to predict failures in a real Air Traffic Control System. CASPER exhibits high degree of accuracy in predicting failures with low false positive rate. The experimental validation shows how operators are provided with predictions issued a few hundred of seconds before the occurrence of the failure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
