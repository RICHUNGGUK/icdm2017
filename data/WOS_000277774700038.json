This paper is concerned with the passivity and passification problems of the stochastic discrete-time T-S fuzzy systems with delay. We first propose the definition of passivity in the sense of expectation. Then, by utilizing the Lyapunov functional method, the stochastic analysis combined with the matrix inequality techniques, a sufficient condition in terms of linear matrix inequalities is presented, ensuring the passivity performance of the T-S fuzzy models. Finally, based on this criterion, state feedback controller is designed, and several criteria are obtained to make the closed-loop system passive in the sense of expectation. The results acquired in this paper are delay dependent in the sense that they depend on not only the lower bound but also the upper bound of the time-varying delay. Numerical examples are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our criteria.", "paper_title": "On Passivity and Passification of Stochastic Fuzzy Systems With Delays: The Discrete-Time Case", "paper_id": "WOS:000277774700038"}
