Type-2 fuzzy systems are able to handle the different sources of uncertainty and imprecision encountered in AlEs to give a very good response. The presented agent architecture uses a one pass method to learn in a nonintrusive manner the user's particular behaviors and preferences for controlling the AIE. The agent learns the user's behavior by learning his particular rules and interval,type-2 Membership Functions (MFs), these rules and MFs can then be adapted online incrementally in a lifelong learning mode to suit the changing environmental conditions and user preferences. We will show that the type-2 agents generated by our one pass learning technique outperforms those generated by genetic algorithms (GAs). We will present unique experiments carried out by different users over the course of the year in the Essex Intelligent Dormitory (iDorm), which is a real AIE test bed. We will show how the type-2 agents learnt and adapted to the occupant's behavior whilst handling the encountered short term and long term uncertainties to give a very good performance that outperformed the type-1 agents while using smaller rule bases.", "paper_title": "An incremental adaptive life long learning approach for type-2 fuzzy embedded agents in ambient intelligent environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000244803400005"}
