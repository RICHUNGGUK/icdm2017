In the proposed method, a membership degree matrix is calculated using FKNN, then the membership degree is incorporated into the definition of the between-class scatter matrix and within-class scatter matrix to get the fuzzy between-class scatter matrix and fuzzy within-class scatter matrix. Experimental results on the ORL, FERET face databases and pulse signal database show that the new method outperforms Fisherface, fuzzy Fisherface and inverse Fisher discriminant analysis.
