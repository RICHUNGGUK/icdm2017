Although increasing attention to IDSs is evident in the literature, network security administrators are still faced with the task of analyzing enormous numbers of alerts produced from different event streams, The intrusion detection model therefore needs to be continuously tuned, in order to reduce correlative alerts and help the administrator to accurately determine critical attacks. In this work, an alert correlation detection module is proposed to analyze the alerts produced by IDSs, providing a more succinct and comprehensive view of intrusions. An automatically-tuned IDS rule-generation module that is based on a type-2 fuzzy logic technique is used to block highly correlative alerts. The experimental results reveal that the proposed model is effective in achieving alert reduction and abstraction.", "paper_title": "APPLICATION OF TYPE-2 FUZZY LOGIC TO RULE-BASED INTRUSION ALERT CORRELATION DETECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000302664400031"}
