In this paper we describe a hybrid method to integrate multiple ontologies in several levels, such as the element level, internal structure, and relational structure. A semantic supporting environment (SSE) combining special domains (e.g., WordNet) and text corpus are defined in the proposed approach. An enriched ontology model (EOM) has been proposed to reduce the initial complexity of the process of ontology integration. Subsequently, the semantic network called OnConceptSNet is provided. The relations between the concepts in the OnConceptSNet are derived from the SSE. An enhanced algorithm (EA) has been proposed to enhance OnConceptSNet.", "paper_title": "A HYBRID METHOD FOR INTEGRATING MULTIPLE ONTOLOGIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000263144100005"}
