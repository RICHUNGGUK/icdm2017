The proposed design combines advantages of the binary-weighted resistor approach and thermometer coded approach. The final design is composed of two 12-bit DACs to achieve a pseudo differential output signal. The converter was designed with a Silterra 0.18 mu m 1.8 V/3.3 V CMOS process technology. The post-layout simulation results show that this design achieves 12-bit resolution with INL and DNL of 0.375 LSB and 0.25 LSB, respectively. The power consumption is 6.291 mW when the designed DAC is biased with supply voltage equal to 3V. The performance is accomplished with a design area of 230 mu m x 255 mu m.", "paper_title": "12-BIT PSEUDO-DIFFERENTIAL CURRENT-SOURCE RESISTOR-STRING HYBRID DAC", "paper_id": "WOS:000293032100010"}
