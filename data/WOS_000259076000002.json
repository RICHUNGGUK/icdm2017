This article presents a new approach to model and query the spatiotemporal data of fuzzy spatial and complex objects and/or spatial relations. In our case study, we use a meteorological database application in an intelligent database architecture, which combines an object-oriented database with a knowledgebase for modeling and querying spatiotemporal objects.
