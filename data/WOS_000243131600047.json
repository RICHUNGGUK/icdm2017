Existing commercial CMSs address this issue by deploying structured metadata (e.g. XML) to categorise content and produce search indices. Unfortunately, these metadata are not expressive enough to represent content for sophisticated searching. This paper presents an open architecture framework and a Java-based reference implementation for Ontology-enabled Content Management System. The reference implementation uses an open-source CMS called OpenCMS, the Protege's OWL library, and RacerPro reasoning engine. The implemented system is a web-based management system for learning objects which were derived from the course and instructional materials used in several postgraduate taught courses. We believe that our OeCMS architecture and implementation would provide a strong platform for developing semantic web protals in general.", "paper_title": "An open architecture for ontology-enabled Content Management Systems: A case study in managing learning objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000243131600047"}
