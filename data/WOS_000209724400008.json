This paper introduces a new scheme called Green Backup Paths (GBP) that intelligently exploits these existing backup paths to perform energy-aware traffic engineering without adversely impacting the primary role of these backup paths of preventing traffic loss upon single link failures. This is in sharp contrast to most existing schemes that tackle energy efficiency and link failure protection separately, resulting in substantially high operational costs. GBP works in an online and distributed fashion, where each router periodically monitors its local traffic conditions and cooperatively determines how to reroute traffic so that the highest number of physical links can go to sleep for energy saving. Furthermore, our approach maintains quality-of-service by restricting the use of long backup paths for failure protection only, and therefore, GBP avoids substantially increased packet delays. GBP was evaluated on the point-of-presence representation of two publicly available network topologies, namely, GEANT and Abilene, and their real traffic matrices. GBP was able to achieve significant energy saving gains, which are always within 15% of the theoretical upper bound.", "paper_title": "Leveraging MPLS Backup Paths for Distributed Energy-Aware Traffic Engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000209724400008"}
