Beyond measuring the individual journals' position within the communication network, we shed light on their cognitive background as well. Language barrier and lacking internationality proved one of the main hindrances for integration into the communication network. Moreover, some document types hinder journals from establishing self-links. Against our expectations, we have found a clear divergence between strongly interlinked and high-entropy journals. Furthermore, the analysis of strong links among different fields allows the detection of high-interdisciplinary journals.", "paper_title": "Tracing the role of individual journals in a cross-citation network based on different indicators", "paper_id": "WOS:000271989600017"}
