In this paper, a new technique is proposed for fast and automatically paired 2-D DOA estimation. This technique uses the magnitude and phase of the eigenvalues of the rotational transformation matrix of the ESPRIT algorithm. A special array geometry is chosen in order to take advantage of the ESPRIT method. The proposed technique is used in two different ways. In one case, array geometry is selected as two parallel uniform linear arrays (PULA). In the second approach, a virtual PULA is generated by using array interpolation. These two cases are compared in terms of the 2-D DOA estimation. While the PULA composed of the physical elements is a robust structure, virtual PULA has the advantage of decreasing the number of antennas and the following hardware. Several experiments are done and it is shown that both of the cases solve the pairing problem in 2-D DOA estimation effectively.", "paper_title": "2-D PAIRED DIRECTION-OF-ARRIVAL ANGLE ESTIMATION WITH TWO PARALLEL UNIFORM LINEAR ARRAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291711600018"}
