Our formulation for inference rules is viewed from the standpoint of process-description. The relations in DIO are now described as resource-sensitive linear logical implications. The compositional reasoning on certain drug-interactions discussed in our previous work on DIO is represented as a construction of a linear logical proof. As examples of our formulation, we use some anti-cancer drug interactions.", "paper_title": "Drug Interaction Ontology (DIO) and the resource-sensitive logical inferences", "paper_id": "WOS:000239518200032"}
