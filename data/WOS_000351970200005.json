By using well-known differential invariants of space curves, namely the curvature and torsion, the method is significantly faster, simpler, and more general than an earlier method addressing a similar problem (Alcazar et al., 2014b). To support this claim, we present an analysis of the arithmetic complexity of the algorithm and timings from an implementation in Sage. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
