Recent \"molecular surgery\" synthesis of endohedral complexes of fullerenes with selected atoms and small molecules has opened a new path for experimental and theoretical studies on structural and spectroscopic properties of these molecular systems. Among them are fullerenes with molecular hydrogen confined within a nanoscale cavity. In this work we report on quantum-chemical prediction of nuclear magnetic shielding (and chemical shift) and indirect spin-spin coupling constant in free HD and H-2 molecules, as well as models of confined dihydrogen using the coupled cluster with single and double excitations (CCSD) and density functional theory (DFT) levels of theory. Inspired with the recent experimental NMR studies on HD and H-2 molecules confined inside C-60 fullerene we systematically investigated the sensitivity of H-1 nuclear magnetic shielding of H-2 and indirect spin-spin coupling constant (1)J(HD) in HD molecules to the interatomic separation in the gas phase, in the presence of benzene and inside fullerene cages of different size. The sensitivity of both NMR parameters to confinement is discussed in terms of very weak non-covalent interactions of HD and H-2 with fullerene cage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
