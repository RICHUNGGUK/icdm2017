This approach is consistent with the flow physics and transport properties. Based on the theory of characteristics, which is a rigorous mathematical technique, multidimensional flows can be decomposed into acoustic, entropy, and vorticity waves. Nonreflecting boundary conditions are derived by setting corresponding characteristic variables of incoming waves to zero and by partially damping the source terms of the incoming acoustic waves. In order to obtain the resulting optimal damping coefficient, analysis is performed for problems of pure acoustic plane wave propagation and arbitrary flows. The proposed boundary conditions are tested on two benchmark problems: cylindrical acoustic wave propagation and the wake flow behind a cylinder with strong periodic vortex convected out of the computational domain. This new approach substantially minimizes the spurious wave reflections of pressure, density, temperature, and velocity as well as vorticity from the artificial boundaries, where strong multidimensional flow effects exist. The numerical simulations yield accurate results, confirm the optimal damping coefficient obtained from analysis, and verify that the method substantially improves the 1-D characteristics-based nonreflecting boundary conditions for complex multidimensional flows.
