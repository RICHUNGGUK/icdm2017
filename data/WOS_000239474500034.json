No such previous result holds for IS when the probability of key collisions is measurable. Moreover, our data structure exhibits O(1) expected search time with high probability for a wide class of input distributions that contains all those for which o(log log n) expected search time was previously known.", "paper_title": "Dynamic interpolation search revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474500034"}
