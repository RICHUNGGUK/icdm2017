We provide an a priori approximation bound on the ratio of the optimal affine (in b) solution to the optimal adjustable solution that depends on two fundamental geometric properties of u: (a) the \"symmetry\" and (b) the \"simplex dilation factor\" of the uncertainty set u and provides deeper insight on the power of affine policies for this class of problems. The bound improves upon a priori bounds obtained for robust and affine policies proposed in the literature. We also find that the proposed a priori bound is quite close to a posteriori bounds computed in specific instances of an inventory control problem, illustrating that the proposed bound is informative.", "paper_title": "On the performance of affine policies for two-stage adaptive optimization: a geometric perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000364330300011"}
