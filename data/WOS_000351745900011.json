We derive explicit formulae for the number of irreducible TSRs of order two. An interesting connection between TSRs and self-reciprocal polynomials is outlined. We use this connection and our results on TSRs to deduce a theorem of Carlitz on the number of self-reciprocal irreducible monic polynomials of a given degree over a finite field.", "paper_title": "Enumeration of linear transformation shift registers", "paper_id": "WOS:000351745900011"}
