It is suggested that each element of the cepstral coefficients represents the frequency degree of the changing components in the envelope of the log-spectrum. With this motivation, in the proposed method, variational noise models are formulated by selectively applying perturbation factors to the mean parameters of a basis model, resulting in a collection of noise models that more accurately reflect the natural range of spectral patterns Fen in the log-spectral domain. The basis noise model is obtained from the silence segments of the input speech. The perturbation factors are designed separately for changes in the energy level and spectral envelope. The proposed variational model composition (VMC) method is employed to generate multiple environmental models for our previously proposed parallel combined gaussian mixture model (PCGMM) based feature compensation algorithm. The mixture sharing technique is integrated to reduce computational expenses, caused by employing the variational models. Experimental results prove that the proposed method is considerably more effective at increasing speech recognition performance in time-varying background noise conditions, with +31.31%, +10.65%, and +20.54% average relative improvements in word error rate for speech babble, background music, and real-life in-vehicle noise conditions respectively, compared to the original basic PCGMM method.
