This structure as a whole defines an opto-sensitive single-pixel sensor, being fabricated in a 0.35 A mu m 1P4M CMOS process with integrated PIN photodiodes. Since two correlators are exploited, the sensor is able to detect the modulated optical signal in the frequency domain, as well as its phase, which can be used in numerous applications. Among the others, the time-of-flight and interferometry based distance measurement system can benefit from this structure. The single pixel occupies an active area of 120 x 100 A mu m(2) at 58 % fill factor. The measurement results show that a dynamic range of 27 dB could be achieved at a modulation frequency of 10 MHz. While the bandwidth of the LIA is adjustable, a signal can be detected up to a modulation frequency of 35 MHz and beyond dependent on the received optical power.", "paper_title": "Dual-lock-in sensor IC with integrated PIN photodetectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000345842200024"}
