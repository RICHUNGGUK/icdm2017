It is shown that the local exact penalization of the lower order penalty function with any positive penalty parameter holds under the local lower order calmness condition. A necessary and sufficient condition for global exact penalization of the lower order penalty function is given in terms of global lower order calmness condition. Furthermore, a formula of least global exact penalty parameter for the lower order penalty function is obtained.", "paper_title": "Lower order calmness and exact penalty function", "paper_id": "WOS:000238565200002"}
