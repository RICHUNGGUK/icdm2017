Indeed, any episturmian word can be infinitely decomposed over the set of pure episturmian morphisms. Thus, an episturmian word can be defined by one of its morphic decompositions or, equivalently, by a certain directive word. Here we characterize pairs of words directing the same episturmian word. We also propose a way to uniquely define any episturmian word through a normalization of its directive words. As a consequence of these results, we characterize episturmian words having a unique directive word.", "paper_title": "DIRECTIVE WORDS OF EPISTURMIAN WORDS: EQUIVALENCES AND NORMALIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000264879300009"}
