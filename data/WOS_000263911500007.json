Students design and solve exam questions while evaluating their peers' solutions using an anonymous, structured process enabled by Internet technologies. APE achieves higher-level learning by encouraging students to tap into all levels of cognitive skills. Compared to the traditional exam experiences in most classes, most students prefer APE, enjoy its process, and recommend its use. APE liberates both students and instructors by reengineering the examination process and deepening learning throughout.", "paper_title": "Asynchronous Participatory Exams Internet Innovation for Engaging Students", "paper_id": "WOS:000263911500007"}
