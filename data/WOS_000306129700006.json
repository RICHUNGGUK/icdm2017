To answer how the state-of-the-art of MA in a wide range of ubiquitous and sensor environments is, this paper investigates the current progress of MA. It proposes a taxonomy, by which MA systems in ubiquitous computing environments are decomposed and discussed. Then, this paper provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing efforts. Finally, it presents a series of solutions from the viewpoint of various roles of MA in ubiquitous environments and situations.", "paper_title": "A Taxonomy of Agent Technologies for Ubiquitous Computing Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000306129700006"}
