As such, monitoring and diagnosis of variation is essential towards continuous quality improvement. This becomes more challenging when involving two correlated variables (bivariate), whereby selection of statistical process control (SPC) scheme becomes more critical. Nevertheless, the existing traditional SPC schemes for bivariate quality control (BQC) were mainly designed for rapid detection of unnatural variation with limited capability in avoiding false alarm, that is, imbalanced monitoring performance. Another issue is the difficulty in identifying the source of unnatural variation, that is, lack of diagnosis, especially when dealing with small shifts. In this research, a scheme to address balanced monitoring and accurate diagnosis was investigated. Design consideration involved extensive simulation experiments to select input representation based on raw data and statistical features, artificial neural network recognizer design based on synergistic model, and monitoring-diagnosis approach based on two-stage technique. The study focused on bivariate process for cross correlation function, rho = 0.1-0.9 and mean shifts, mu = +/- 0.75-3.00 standard deviations. The proposed two-stage intelligent monitoring scheme (2S-IMS) gave superior performance, namely, average run length, ARL(1) = 3.18-16.75 (for out-of-control process), ARL(0) = 335.01-543.93 (for in-control process) and recognition accuracy, RA = 89.5-98.5%. This scheme was validated in manufacturing of audio video device component. This research has provided a new perspective in realizing balanced monitoring and accurate diagnosis in BQC.
