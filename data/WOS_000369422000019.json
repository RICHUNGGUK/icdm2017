These coefficients are needed for lumped parameter thermal models in the design process. Design/methodology/approach - The computational fluid dynamics simulation in combination with conjugate heat transfer (CHT) validates the accuracy of the HTM. The theoretical approach describes the formulation of the heat transfer coefficient and the Gauss-Newton method has been applied to find the coefficients of the approximation model. Findings - The paper describes the new analytical approximation model for the heat transfer coefficient at the end winding bars of hydro generators and shows also the validation to simulation results. Originality/value - The analytical approximation model for the heat transfer coefficient at the end winding bars has been described and a comparison with CHT results has shown a good agreement.", "paper_title": "Validation of a heat transfer model for end winding bars of large hydro generators", "paper_id": "WOS:000369422000019"}
