Hybrid uncertainty consists of the randomness in search process and the fuzziness of offered wage. The expected value criterion and the risk tolerance criterion are designed for the job searcher to accept or reject the job offer. Under these two criteria, computing formulas to calculate the expected return of the job searcher are presented. Simultaneously, the average search times and the average chances that search returns exceed reservation wages are provided. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the relationships between the expected returns of the job searcher under two criteria, and the relationships between two average chances as well.", "paper_title": "A novel job search problem in hybrid uncertain environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000322655700002"}
