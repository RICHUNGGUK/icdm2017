Experimental investigation of the mechanisms involved in shot peening is very expensive and complicated. Therefore, the Finite Element (FE) method has been recognized as an effective mean for characterizing the shot peening process and several types of FE models have been developed to evaluate the effects of shot peening parameters. However, in most of the existing FE models, the shot peening sequence and impact location were defined a priori. It is therefore the purpose of this study to consider the random property of the shot peening process. A novel 3D FE model with multiple randomly distributed shots was developed combining a Matlab program with the ANSYS preprocessor. The explicit solver LS-DYNA has been used to simulate the dynamic impingement process. Several potential applications of this novel model such as: the quantitative relationship of the peening intensity, coverage and roughness with respect to the number of shots have been presented. Moreover, simulations with multiple oblique impacts have been carried out in order to compare with results from normal impingements. Our work shows that such a computing strategy can help understanding and predicting the shot peening results better than conventional FE simulations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
