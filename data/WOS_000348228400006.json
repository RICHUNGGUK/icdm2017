This paper describes and proves correct a formal method for accurate high-level casting of optimal adders and subtractors. The proposed approach allows for an early accurate estimation of resource usage which is then available for high-level decision-taking in the design flow. As a result, decoupling between high-level and low-level synthesis is achieved. Results concerning the impact of the approach on resource estimates and a discussion on the wide applicability of the method are presented.", "paper_title": "A Formal Method for Optimal High-Level Casting of Heterogeneous Fixed-Point Adders and Subtractors", "paper_id": "WOS:000348228400006"}
