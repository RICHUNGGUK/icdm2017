This paper deals with the RCPSP considering the makespan minimization as the objective. Due to the complexity of this problem, a metaheuristic algorithm called Artificial Immune Algorithm (AIA), which is inspired by the vertebrate immune system, is adopted to solve this problem. In order to confirm the performance of the proposed algorithm, in terms of solution quality, the algorithm is applied to various test problems available in the literature and the reliability of it is compared with well-reported benchmark algorithms. The computational results show that the proposed algorithm has competitive results in comparison with the existing benchmark algorithms inspiring for solving real-world problems.
