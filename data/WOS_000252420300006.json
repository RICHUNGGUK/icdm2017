The approach does not assume a particular form of the underlying space, allows a natural handling of occluding objects, and permits dynamic changes of the scale and size of the sampled region. The implementation of the algorithm runs comfortably in modest hardware at video-rate.", "paper_title": "Tracking with general regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000252420300006"}
