One reason for this is that FL provides powerful mechanisms for handling and processing symbolic information stated using natural language. In this respect, fuzzy rule-based systems are white-boxes, as they process information in a form that is easy to understand, verify and, if necessary, refine. The synergy between artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are notorious for their black-box character, and FL proved to be particularly successful. Such a synergy allows combining the powerful learning-from-examples capability of ANNs with the high-level symbolic information processing of FL systems. In this paper, we present a new approach for extracting symbolic information from recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The approach is based on the mathematical equivalence between a specific fuzzy rule-base and functions composed of sums of sigmoids. We show that this equivalence can be used to provide a comprehensible explanation of the RNN functioning. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by using it to extract the knowledge embedded within an RNN trained to recognize a formal language. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
