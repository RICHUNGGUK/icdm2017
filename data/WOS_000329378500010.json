An algorithm is provided, specifying which information should be tracked to reconstruct an instantaneous map of traffic flow. We test the accuracy of our method in a simple cellular automata traffic simulation model, for which the traffic condition can be controlled and analyzed theoretically. We show how local communication parameters affect the method accuracy.", "paper_title": "Traffic Prediction Based on a Local Exchange of Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000329378500010"}
