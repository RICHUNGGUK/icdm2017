Passenger transport can be managed by mobility providers by combining and extending various mobility services either directly or by using available mobility service platforms. This paper evaluates the capabilities and technical features of existing mobility service platforms with a special focus on electric mobility. Based upon this evaluation, criteria are presented which future platforms should address. As part of this work, a marketplace approach is developed which addresses the identified criteria. Potential marketplace architectures are presented which are deemed to establish marketplace interconnectivity. The developed marketplace approach and the proposed architectures contribute to the vision of an interconnected service ecosystem for mobility services. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
