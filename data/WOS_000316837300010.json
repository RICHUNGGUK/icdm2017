Our first main result characterises those indexed families of recursive languages that can be inferred by such learners,, and we demonstrate that this characterisation shows enlightening connections to Angluin's corresponding result for exact inference. Furthermore, this result reveals that our model can be interpreted as an instance of a natural extension of Gold's model of language identification in the limit. Using a notion of descriptiveness that is restricted to the natural subclass of terminal-free E-pattern languages, we introduce a generic inference strategy, and our second main result characterises those classes of languages that can be generalised by this strategy. This characterisation demonstrates that there are major classes of languages that can be generalised in our model, but not be inferred by a normal Gold-style learner. Our corresponding technical considerations lead to insights of intrinsic interest into combinatorial and algorithmic properties of pattern languages. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
