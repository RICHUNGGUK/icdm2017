In this work, we adapt a feature computed from wavelet transform called wavelet energy to represent the region information. The wavelet energy is embedded into a level set model to formulate the segmentation model called wavelet energy-guided level set-based active contour (WELSAC). The WELSAC model is evaluated using several synthetic and CT images focusing on tumour cases, which contain regions demonstrating the characteristics of intra-region intensity variations and having high similarity in intensity distributions with the adjacent regions. The obtained results show that the proposed WELSAC model is able to segment regions of interest in close correspondence with the manual delineation provided by the medical experts and to provide a solution for tumour detection.
