How to determine an effective path for throughput gain and overhead reduction is emerging and crucial in IEEE 802.16 multi-hop relay networks. This paper introduces a load-aware spectral-efficient routing metric, called LASER, to evaluate paths, and proposes an efficient scheme to determine a proper path. Based on the LASER metric, the proposed path selection scheme formulates the path cost as the summation of cost of each link, and the path with the minimum cost will be selected as the appropriate one. Simulation results show that the proposed LASER-based path selection scheme significantly outperforms existing path selection schemes in network throughput and map overhead. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
