We evaluate and compare the information processing capabilities of various formal and informal control configurations under different information uncertainty conditions. We find that a wide range of formal controls can be used to direct subordinates performing interdependent tasks while a more narrow range of informal controls are most effective for directing subordinates who perform complex tasks. Results of this study provide a basis for formalizing an information processing perspective on organizational control implementation that differs but is complementary to the current emphasis on agency in organizational control research.", "paper_title": "How controls influence organizational information processing: insights from a computational modeling investigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000363967000004"}
