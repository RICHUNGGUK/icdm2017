We have designed and implemented JAVACOP, a program constraint system for implementing practical pluggable type systems for Java. JAVACOP enforces user-defined typing constraints written in a declarative and expressive rule language. We have validated our design by (re)implementing a range of type systems and program checkers. By using a program constraint system to implement pluggable types, programmers are able to check that their programs will operate correctly in restricted environments, adhere to strict programming rules, avoid null pointer errors or scoped memory exceptions, and meet style guidelines, while programming language researchers can easily experiment with novel type systems.", "paper_title": "A framework for implementing pluggable type systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000202972500006"}
