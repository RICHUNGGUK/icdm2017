Sufficient conditions for the existence and exponential stability of anti-periodic solutions are established by using Krasnoselski's fixed point theorem and Lyapunov functions with inequality techniques. In the end, example and numerical simulations are given to illustrate our main results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
