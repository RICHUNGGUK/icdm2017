The first aspect is magnitude dynamicity, in which the IDS has to efficiently determine whether the changes occurring in the network are due to malicious behaviors or or due to normal changing of user requirements. The second aspect is nature dynamicity that occurs when a malicious node is continuously switching its behavior between normal and anomalous to cause maximum network disruption without being detected by the IDS. The third aspect, named spatiotemporal dynamicity, happens when a malicious node moves out of the IDS range before the latter can make an observation about its behavior. The first aspect is solved by defining a normal profile based on the invariants derived from the normal node behavior. The second aspect is handled by proposing an adaptive reputation fading strategy that allows fast redemption and fast capture of malicious node. The third aspect is solved by estimating the link duration between two nodes in dynamic network topology, which allows choosing the appropriate monitoring period. We provide analytical studies and simulation experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions.", "paper_title": "Fortifying Intrusion Detection Systems in Dynamic Ad Hoc and Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000347822800001"}
