IntegraL provides a lightweight approach to improve and augment search functionality by dynamically generating context-focused \"anchors\" for recognized elements of interest generated by library services. This article includes a description of how IntegraL's design supports users' information-seeking behavior. A full user study with both objective and subjective measures of IntegraL and hypothesis testing regarding IntegraL's effectiveness of the user's information-seeking experience are described along with data analysis, implications arising from this kind of virtual integration, and possible future directions.", "paper_title": "Seeking Beyond With IntegraL: A User Study of Sense-Making Enabled by Anchor-Based Virtual Integration of Library Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000322870300015"}
