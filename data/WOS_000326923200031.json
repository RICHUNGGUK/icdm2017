Our method requires neither a turntable nor a second operator, and is robust to the small deformations and changes of pose that inevitably arise during scanning. After the users rotate themselves with the same pose for a few scans from different views, our system stitches together the captured scans using multi-view non-rigid registration, and produces watertight final models. To ensure consistent texturing, we recover the underlying albedo from each scanned texture and generate seamless global textures using Poisson blending. Despite the minimal requirements we place on the hardware and users, our method is suitable for full body capture of challenging scenes that cannot be handled well using previous methods, such as those involving loose clothing, complex poses, and props.", "paper_title": "3D Self-Portraits", "paper_id": "WOS:000326923200031"}
