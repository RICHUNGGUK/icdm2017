Sensing Web targets large data such as image data or voice data, which may include privacy information. In this paper, we propose an architecture named SW-agent to realize the idea of Sensing Web. SW-agent protects privacy information by elimination of privacy information and appropriate access control. The elimination is done with data processing by a remote execution program shipped to a node near a sensor. We found that an SW-agent can execute a remote execution program with up to 7% overhead in performance compared to its direct execution. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
