These measurements are prone to error due to intrinsic properties of the localizer used. The error and thus accuracy of a localizer can be determined using various techniques, many of which assume that the error is isotropic and free of bias. A bias error adds an orientation dependence to the error of measured points. Determination of the presence of a bias error is an important component in the characterization of a localizer's performance. Statistical analysis of localized points on a rigid phantom can be used to detect the presence of a bias error. In this paper, we will examine the use of statistical techniques in the characterization of a series of localizers and how that information is useful in determining localizer efficacy.", "paper_title": "Determining the Presence of Bias Error Using Statistical Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000262429100001"}
