This article presents an active binocular vision system with saccade and vergence capabilities to simulate fundamental human vision. A saccade generation model based on image segmentation and color attention was developed to provide simple behaviors of bottom-up attentive saccade. A vergence control model utilizing the retino-cortical log polar mapping in the primate visual cortex was developed to effectively control the vergence of two cameras in a cluttered environment. The combination of these two mechanisms provides the system a way to explore and reconstruct positional information of attended objects in the environment.", "paper_title": "A BINOCULAR VISION SYSTEM WITH ATTENTIVE SACCADE AND SPATIAL VARIANT VERGENCE CONTROL", "paper_id": "WOS:000286901200004"}
