Design/methodology/approach - The use of power cable system responses to power line carrier signals are proposed to conduct the required signal analysis for damage location purpose. This technique is based on the fact that the water tree degradation in power cables can make the system behave nonlinearly. Consequently, the location of water tree degradation can be determined by detecting the position of nonlinear components in power cable systems. Findings - A novel method has been proposed for locating water tree degradation in power cable systems; numerical simulation studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the new technique. Originality/value - The proposed technique has the potential to be applied in practice to more effectively resolve the power cable damage location problem.", "paper_title": "A nonlinear frequency analysis based approach for power cable insulation fault detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000302384700003"}
