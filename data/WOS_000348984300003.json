In addition, we situate the PS agent in different learning scenarios, and study its learning abilities. A variety of new scenarios are being considered, thereby demonstrating the model's flexibility. Furthermore, to put the PS scheme in context, we compare its performance with those of Q-learning and learning classifier systems, two popular models in the field of reinforcement learning. It is shown that PS is a competitive artificial intelligence model of unique properties and strengths.", "paper_title": "Projective Simulation for Classical Learning Agents: A Comprehensive Investigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000348984300003"}
