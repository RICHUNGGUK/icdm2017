This problem is the formalization of the problem of knowledge compression for speeding up queries to propositional Horn expert systems, and it is known to be NP-hard. There are two subclasses of Horn functions for which HM is known to be solvable in polynomial time: acyclic and quasi-acyclic Horn functions. In this paper we define a new class of Horn functions properly containing both of the known classes and design a polynomial time HM algorithm for this new class.", "paper_title": "A subclass of Horn CNFs optimally compressible in polynomial time", "paper_id": "WOS:000280226500003"}
