The solution described is based on encapsulating and reusing the proprietary environment Matlab and the corresponding Wavelet Toolbox. This will allow for developing custom user applications, with well-defined and specific characteristics, aimed at learning the wavelet transform and applications. Since functionality is reused, and therefore it has not to be implemented, we gain the possibility to build in powerful and ad hoc tools for teaching and investigating, in a short term and at low costs. The application developed was presented to several users and evaluated in terms of usability. The results obtained are encouraging and indicate that using Visual Wavelet-Lab can be a useful tool for educational purposes. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
