Burst assembly algorithms are generally designed without taking into consideration the control plane load they lead to. In this study, we propose traffic-adaptive burst assembly algorithms that attempt to minimize the average burst assembly delay subject to burst rate constraints and hence limit the control plane load. The algorithms we propose are simple to implement and we show using synthetic and real traffic traces that they perform substantially better than the usual timer-based schemes.", "paper_title": "Dynamic threshold-based assembly algorithms for optical burst switching networks subject to burst rate constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000281986700003"}
