This paper investigates a novel monitoring trail (m-trail) scenario, called Global Neighborhood Failure Localization (G-NFL), that aims to enable any shared protection scheme, including FDP, for achieving all-optical and ultra-fast failure restoration. We first define the neighborhood of a node, which is a set of links whose failure states should be known to the node in restoration of the corresponding working lightpaths (W-LPs). By assuming every node can obtain the on-off status of traversing m-trails and W-LPs via lambda monitoring, the proposed G-NFL problem routes a set of m-trails such that each node can localize any failure in its neighborhood. Bound analysis is performed on the minimum bandwidth required for m-trails under the proposed G-NFL problem. Then, a simple yet efficient heuristic approach is presented. Extensive simulation is conducted to verify the proposed G-NFL scenario under a number of different definitions of nodal neighborhood that concern the extent of dependency between the monitoring plane and data plane. The effect of reusing the spare capacity by FDP for supporting m-trails is examined. We conclude that the proposed G-NFL scenario enables a general shared protection scheme, toward signaling-free and ultra-fast failure restoration like p-Cycle, while achieving optimal capacity efficiency as FDP.", "paper_title": "Neighborhood Failure Localization in All-Optical Networks via Monitoring Trails", "paper_id": "WOS:000367100900002"}
