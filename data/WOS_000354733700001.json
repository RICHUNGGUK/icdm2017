In this paper, a Wi-Fi fingerprint localization method is proposed on the basis of important access points (IAP). For the Wi-Fi fingerprint, Wi-Fi access point with the highest received signal strength (RSS) is denoted as the important access point. At the localization stage, the fingerprints are chosen with the same IAP as the estimated fingerprint from the database. Then, the distance and the AP repetition of the fingerprints are used to calculate the similarity degree. The location of the fingerprint which matches the estimated finger print well can be regarded as the estimated location. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve high accuracy in indoor environment.", "paper_title": "Indoor Mobile Localization Based on Wi-Fi Fingerprint's Important Access Point", "paper_id": "WOS:000354733700001"}
