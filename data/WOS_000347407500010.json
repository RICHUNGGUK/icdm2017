Then concepts like fuzzy homorelation, correlation, cohomorelation, fuzzy function and fuzzy morphism are introduced and discussed. The presentation is uniform and integrated in the sense that every concept is developed on fuzzy set as base and is organized from the angle of foundational aspects of fuzzy set theory.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy relation and fuzzy function over fuzzy sets: a retrospective", "paper_id": "WOS:000347407500010"}
