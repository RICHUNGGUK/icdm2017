The system can make more and more media devices in the car automatically collaborate, sharing of audio, video and other data, but its own power consumption has not been a better optimization. In the paper, depending on the network management and the notification mechanism, a distributed power management solutions was designed that the slave nodes can sleep independently and the master node manages the network state, and the wake-up mechanisms in the sleep state were proposed. A mathematical modeling and analysis of MOST networks power were built in MATLAB. This program takes full advantage of MOST network protocol for the intelligent management. Simulation results shown that, with the increasing number of nodes in MOST, energy saving become more effective. More than 20% power saved can be achieved with distributed power management solution in 8-node MOST.", "paper_title": "A Distributed Power Management Design Based on MOST Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000297859500009"}
