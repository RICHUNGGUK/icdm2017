The proposed method utilizes a finite mixture partial least squares (FIMIX-PLS) approach to examine bidder behaviors and personality characteristics, evaluate bidder differences, and then segment the bidders. The empirical experiment is conducted for two different auction mechanisms - English and Vickrey. Results from both auction mechanisms indicate that FIMIX-PLS is capable of profiling and segmenting the bidders based on their individual characteristics. The post hoc analysis confirms the segmentation scheme and the capability of FIMIX-PLS in segmenting bidders into statistically identifiable homogeneous groups without a priori information of group characteristics. Such advantage is practical for online businesses dealing with increasing amount of data about their customers on a real time basis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
