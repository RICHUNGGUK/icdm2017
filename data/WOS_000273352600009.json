The numerical model is based on the Generalized Interpolation Material Point Method. A simplified slope with a house placed on top is analysed. An elasto-plastic material model based on the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion is employed for the soil. The slide is triggered for the initially stable slope by removing the cohesion of the soil and the slide is followed from the triggering until a state of static equilibrium is again reached. Parameter studies, in which the angle of internal friction of the soil and the degree of discretisation are varied, are presented.", "paper_title": "Modelling of landslides with the material-point method", "paper_id": "WOS:000273352600009"}
