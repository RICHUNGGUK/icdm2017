The algorithms dynamically support all k-allowable traffic matrices, where k denotes an arbitrary integer vector [k(1), k(2),..., k(N)], and node i, 1 <= -i <= N, can transmit at most k(i) wavelengths and receive at most k(i) wavelengths. Both algorithms support the changing traffic in a rearrangeably non-blocking fashion. Our first algorithm, for a bidirectional ring, uses [(Sigma(N)(i=1) k(i))/3] wavelengths in each fiber and requires at most three lightpath rearrangements per new session request regardless of the number of nodes N and the amount of traffic k. When all the k(i)'s are equal to k, the algorithm uses [kN/3] wavelengths, which is known to be the minimum for any off-line rearrangeably non-blocking algorithm. Our second algorithm, for a torus topology, is an extension of a known off-line algorithm for the special case with all the ki's equal to k. For an R x C torus network with R >= C nodes, our on-line algorithm uses [kR/2] wavelengths in each fiber, which is the same as in the off-line algorithm, and is at most two times a lower bound obtained by assuming full wavelength conversion at all nodes. In addition, the on-line algorithm requires at most C - 1 lightpath rearrangements per new session request regardless of the amount of traffic k. Finally, each RWA update requires solving a bipartite matching problem whose time complexity is only O(R), which is much smaller than the time complexity O (kCR(2)) of the bipartite matching problem for an off-line algorithm.", "paper_title": "On-line routing and wavelength assignment for dynamic traffic in WDM ring and torus networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237033500008"}
