Currently, many scientific researchers are focused on this issue with the goal of achieving high security and privacy protection. Recently, Chen et al. proposed an RFID access control protocol that can satisfy the practical requirements of the authentication mechanism and infrastructure for access authorization. In this paper, we demonstrate that Chen et al.'s protocol cannot validate the legitimacy of tag when replay attacks occur. Moreover, our analysis indicated that location privacy and forward secrecy are not well protected in this protocol. To surmount the above weaknesses, we propose an advanced RFID access control protocol based on challenge-response, and its novel improvements make the proposed protocol more secure, efficient, practicable, and suitable for limited-power RFID systems.", "paper_title": "ADVANCED CONSTANTLY UPDATED RFID ACCESS CONTROL PROTOCOL USING CHALLENGE-RESPONSE AND INDEFINITE-INDEX", "paper_id": "WOS:000312435200022"}
