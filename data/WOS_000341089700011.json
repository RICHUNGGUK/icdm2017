The time evolution of the system is described by an iterative algorithm, which determines the movement of the objects according to the actions they perform, and the constraints they are subjected to. We exemplify our approach with a model of the morphogenesis of Dictyostelium discoideum, and present the results of its simulation.", "paper_title": "Morphogenesis through moving membranes", "paper_id": "WOS:000341089700011"}
