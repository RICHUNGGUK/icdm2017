The connection between the two properties is derived by defining a Riemannian manifold whose geodesics trace the edges of the mesh. A function phi, proportional to the logarithm of the cell size, is shown to obey the Poisson equation, with localized charges corresponding to irregular vertices. The problem of finding a suitable manifold for a given domain is thus shown to exactly reduce to an Inverse Poisson problem on phi, of finding a distribution of localized charges adhering to the conditions derived for boundary alignment. Possible applications to mesh generation are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
