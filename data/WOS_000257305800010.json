However, no detailed study on the performance analysis of these algorithms was done in any of these implementations. In this paper we developed performance models for these explicit group methods and present detailed study of their hypothetical implementation on two distributed memory multicomputers with different computation speed and communication bandwidth. Detailed performance analysis based on these models predicted different theoretical performance if the methods were implemented on the clusters. This was confirmed by the experimental results performed on the two distinct clusters. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicated that both explicit group methods are scalable with respect to number of processors and the problem size.
