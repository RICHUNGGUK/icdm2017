In this paper, three new paradigms are proposed to obtain signatures that are secure against existential forgery under adaptively chosen message attacks (fully-secure, in short), from any weakly-secure signature. These transformations are generic, simple, and provably secure in the standard model. In the first paradigm, based on a weakly-secure signature scheme, the construction of a fully-secure signature scheme requires one-time signature additionally. However, the other two are built only on weakly-secure signatures. To the best of our knowledge, it is observed for the first time in this paper that two weakly-secure signature schemes are sufficient to construct a fully-secure signature scheme. Based on the new proposed paradigms, several efficient instantiations without random oracles are also presented. We also show that these fully-secure signature schemes have many special interesting properties in application. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
