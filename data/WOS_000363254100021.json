Despite its importance, it is still an open problem for efficient network bandwidth sharing in a multitenant environment, especially when applications have diverse bandwidth requirements. More precisely, it is not only that different tenants have distinct demands, but also that one tenant may want to assign bandwidth differently across her virtual machines (VMs), i.e., the heterogeneous bandwidth requirements. In this paper, we tackle the problem of VM allocation with bandwidth guarantee in multitenant data center networks. We first propose an online VM allocation algorithm that improves on the accuracy of the existing work. Next, we develop a VM allocation algorithm under heterogeneous bandwidth demands. We conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the efficiency of our method.", "paper_title": "Guaranteeing Heterogeneous Bandwidth Demand in Multitenant Data Center Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000363254100021"}
