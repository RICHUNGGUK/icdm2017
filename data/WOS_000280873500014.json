We describe these compute technologies and our parallelization approach in detail, present our performance results, and then compare them with those from our previous implementations based on the native CUDA and Cell SDKs. The OpenCL framework allows us to execute identical source-code on both architectures and yet obtain strong performance gains that are comparable to what can be derived from the native SDKs.
