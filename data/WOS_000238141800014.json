The tensor structure inherently involves a product state space but, inside this product state space, the actual reachable state space can be much smaller. For such cases, we propose an improvement of the standard numerical algorithm, the so-called \"shuffle algorithm\", which necessitates only vectors of the size of the actual state space. With this contribution, numerical algorithms based on tensor products can now handle larger models. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
