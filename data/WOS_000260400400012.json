This paper presents a two-stage algorithm for PPM problem using ellipse fitting and dual Hilbert scans. In the first matching stage, transformation parameters, are coarsely estimated by using four node points of ellipses which are fitted by Weighted Least Square Fitting (WLSF). Then, Hilbert scans are used in two aspects of the second matching stage: it is applied to the similarity measure and it is also used for search space reduction. The similarity measure named Hilbert Scanning Distance (HSD) can be computed fast by converting the 2-D coordinates of 2-D points into 1-D space information using Hilbert scan. On the other hand, the N-D search space can be converted to a 1-D search space sequence by N-D Hilbert Scan and art efficient search strategy is proposed on the 1-D search space sequence. In the experiments. we use both simulated point set data and real fingerprint images, to evaluate the performance of our algorithm and our algorithm gives satisfying results both in accuracy and efficiency.", "paper_title": "A Two-Stage Point Pattern Matching Algorithm Using Ellipse Fitting and Dual Hilbert Scans", "paper_id": "WOS:000260400400012"}
