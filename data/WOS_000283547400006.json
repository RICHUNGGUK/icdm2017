A sequence of random variables, all of which are mutually independent but obey the Bernoulli distribution, is introduced to account for the probabilistic communication delays. The measurement-missing phenomenon occurs in a random way. The missing probability for each sensor satisfies a certain probabilistic distribution in the interval [0 1]. Here, the attention is focused on the analysis and design of H-infinity fuzzy output-feedback controllers such that the closed-loop Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy-control system is exponentially stable in the mean square. The disturbance-rejection attenuation is constrained to a given level by means of the H-infinity-performance index. Intensive analysis is carried out to obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of admissible output feedback controllers, which ensures the exponential stability as well as the prescribed H-infinity performance. The cone-complementarity-linearization procedure is employed to cast the controller-design problem into a sequential minimization one that is solved by the semi-definite program method. Simulation results are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design technique in this paper.", "paper_title": "Robust H-infinity Fuzzy Output-Feedback Control With Multiple Probabilistic Delays and Multiple Missing Measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000283547400006"}
