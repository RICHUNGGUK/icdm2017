Instead of the 12 bits used in previous works, 9-bit distributed arithmetic-precision is chosen for this work so as to meet peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) requirements. Thus, an area-efficient DCT core is implemented to achieve 1 Gpels/s throughput rate with gate counts of 22.2 K for the PSNR requirements outlined in the previous works.", "paper_title": "High Throughput DA-Based DCT With High Accuracy Error-Compensated Adder Tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000288681400019"}
