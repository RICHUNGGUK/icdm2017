The covariance of two mask counts is derived, and it is shown that under appropriate conditions the mask counts in linear cryptanalysis are stochastically independent, whether or not the masks are linearly independent. Some consequences of these observations are also considered.", "paper_title": "The independence of linear approximations in symmetric cryptanalysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000242503300024"}
