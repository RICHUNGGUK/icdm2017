Based on the recommendations achieved the trusting agent can decide whether to interact or not with the trusted agent. If the trusting agent decides to proceed, then after its interaction it should adjust the creditability of the recommending agents, whose recommendation it considered. Doing this would help the future trusting agents to classify the recommending agents according to their trustworthiness and ignore those which are un-trustworthy. In this paper we propose such an approach by which the trusting agent adjusts the credibility of the recommending agent after its interaction depending on the recommendation that it gave.", "paper_title": "A methodology for determining the creditability of recommending agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100141"}
