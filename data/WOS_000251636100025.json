For this purpose, we extended a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) developed in previous works, taking into account simultaneously maximization of the net present value (NPV) and two other performance criteria, i.e. the production delay/advance and a flexibility criterion. The former is computed by comparing the fuzzy computed production time to a given fuzzy production time horizon and the latter is based on the additional fuzzy demand that the plant is able to produce. The methodology provides a set of scenarios that are helpful to the decision's maker and constitutes a very promising framework for taken imprecision into account in new product development stage.
