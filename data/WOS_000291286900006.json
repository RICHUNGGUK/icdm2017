Thermal management has become a prominent issue in system design. This paper explores thermal-aware scheduling for sporadic real-time tasks to minimize the peak temperature in a homogeneous multicore system, in which heat might transfer among some cores. By deriving an ideally preferred speed for each core, we propose global scheduling algorithms which can exploit the flexibility of multicore platforms at low temperature. We perform simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
