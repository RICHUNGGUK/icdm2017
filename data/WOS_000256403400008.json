From a variety of feature selection methods and classifiers, it is difficult to find optimal ensembles composed of any feature-classifier pairs. This paper proposes a novel method based on the evolutionary algorithm (EA) to form sophisticated ensembles of features and classifiers that can be used to obtain high classification performance. In spite of the exponential number of possible ensembles of individual feature-classifier pairs, an EA can produce the best ensemble in a reasonable amount of time. The chromosome is encoded with real values to decide the weight for each feature-classifier pair in an ensemble. Experimental results with two well-known microarray datasets in terms of time and classification rate indicate that the proposed method produces ensembles that are superior to individual classifiers, as well as other ensembles optimized by random and greedy strategies.", "paper_title": "An evolutionary algorithm approach to optimal ensemble classifiers for DNA microarray data analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000256403400008"}
