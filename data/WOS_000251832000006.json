Galactose azide was clicked onto single-stranded and double-stranded 300mer DNA in order to investigate the efficiency of sugar labeling of DNA under various conditions. Single-stranded alkyne-modified DNA was prepared by selective lambda exonuclease digestion of 5'-phosphate-labeled double strands. A comparison of the click reaction efficiency on modified single and double stranded 300mers under identical conditions shows a pronounced effect of the strandedness on the yield of the click reaction.", "paper_title": "Pronounced effect of DNA hybridization on click reaction efficiency", "paper_id": "WOS:000251832000006"}
