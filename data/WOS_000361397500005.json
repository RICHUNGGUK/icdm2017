This controller encodes the preprocessed environmental and target information provided by CCD cameras, encoders and ultrasonic sensors into spike trains, which are integrated by a three-layer spiking neural network (SNN). The outputs of SNN are generated based on the competition between the forward/backward neuron pair corresponding to each motor, with the weights evolved by the Hebbian learning. The application to target tracking of a mobile robot in unknown environment verifies the validity of the proposed controller.", "paper_title": "Spiking neural network-based target tracking control for autonomous mobile robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000361397500005"}
