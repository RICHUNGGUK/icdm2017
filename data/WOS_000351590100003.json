We describe a process framework to structure our knowledge of online personalization both from academia and from applied attempts. This framework is expected to aid researchers and practitioners in understanding existing e-commerce personalization efforts and in developing novel personalization approaches. We argue that, from a psychological perspective, the content that is used in the personalization of e-commerce should have a heterogeneous effect that is consistent with customers' needs. From a technological perspective, the ability to measure the outcomes of personalization attempts, and the speed and scalability of the personalization technology are essential. We detail the framework and present a case study to highlight how new methods of e-commerce personalization can be developed. We also use the framework to suggest a number of novel avenues for e-commerce personalization.", "paper_title": "Advancing E-Commerce Personalization: Process Framework and Case Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000351590100003"}
