We applied a quantitative approach to establish a measure for justice perception by fuzzy logic in the frame of the Fairness theory. This research was designed and implemented within three Iranian Banks. It's main aim was to increasing the reliability and accuracy of justice perception measurement. The outputs of this fuzzy measurement are significantly different and more realistic compared to the other conventional methods. It can also represent the latent factors of human cognitive judgment and therefore, contribute to improve the justice perception process in organizations. The most significant power of this fuzzy method is the ability to discriminate the justice perception levels by providing a broad range of variations of the justice perception scores. Also the results of this empirical testing confirm the elements of Fairness theory. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
