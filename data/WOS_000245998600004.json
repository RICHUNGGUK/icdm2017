All three models are formulated based upon the 3D theory of elasticity. The stress model is modified from the element developed by Ramtekkar, et al. (2002) to incorporate material nonlinearity in the formulation. Both transverse stress and displacement components are used as nodal degrees-of-freedom to ensure the continuity of both stress and displacement components between the elements. The displacement model uses only displacement components as nodal degrees-of-freedom. The transition model has both stress and displacement components as nodal degrees-of-freedom on one surface, and only displacement components as nodal degrees-of-freedom on the opposite surface. The transition model serves as a connector between the stress and the displacement models. The developed models are validated by comparing the results of the analyses with an existing experimental result. Parametric studies of the effects of the externally reinforced FRP on the load capacity of reinforced concrete (RC) beams and concrete plates are performed to demonstrate the practicality and the efficiency of the proposed models.", "paper_title": "3D nonlinear mixed finite-element analysis of RC beams and plates with and without FRP reinforcement", "paper_id": "WOS:000245998600004"}
