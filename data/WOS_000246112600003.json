New capabilities such as on-demand computing power, self-adaptiveness and self-optimization capabilities by restructuring the hardware on the fly at run-time is seen as a driving technology factor for current research initiatives such as autonomic (Kephart and Chess, Computer, 36:41-52, 2003; IBM Autonomic Computing Initiative, (http://www.research.ibm.com/autonomic/)) and organic computing (Muller-Schloer, von der Malsburg, and Wurtz, Inform.-Spektrum, 27:332-336, 2004; The Organic Computing Page, (http://www.organic-computing.org)). Much research work is currently devoted to models for partial hardware module relocation (SPP1148 Reconfigurable Computing Priority Program, (http://www12.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/spprr/)) and dynamically reconfigurable hardware reconfiguration on e.g., FPGA-based platforms. However, there are many physical restrictions and technical problems limiting the scope or applicability of these approaches. This led us to the development of a new FPGA-based reconfigurable computer called the Erlangen Slot Machine. The architecture overcomes many architectural constraints of existing platforms and allows a user to partially reconfigure hardware modules arranged in so-called slots. The uniqueness of this computer stems from (a) a new slot-oriented hardware architecture, (b) a set of novel inter-module communication paradigms, and (c) concepts for dynamic and partial reconfiguration management.", "paper_title": "The Erlangen Slot Machine: A dynamically reconfigurable FPGA-based computer", "paper_id": "WOS:000246112600003"}
