However, for most engineering systems the dimension of the dynamics is expected to be very large yet the flow field data is available only for a finite time. In this context, it is important to establish the amount of data required to compute the asymptotic value of the Karhunen-Loeve dimension given a finite amount of data. Using direct numerical simulations of Rayleigh-Benard convection in a finite cylindrical geometry we compute the asymptotic value of the Karhunen-Loeve dimension. The amount of time required for the Karhunen-Loeve dimension to reach a steady value is very slow in comparison with the time scale of the convection rolls. We show that the asymptotic value of the Karhunen-Loeve dimension can be determined using much less data if one uses the azimuthal symmetry of the governing equations prior to performing a KLD. The Karhunen-Loeve dimension is found to be extensive as the system size is increased and for a dimension measurement that captures 90% of the variance in the data the Karhunen-Loeve dimension is approximately 20 times larger than the Lyapunov dimension.
