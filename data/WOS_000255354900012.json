The system has been the result of a three-year European Community Research Project. The goal was to move from a centralized control architecture to a fully distributed one, Where each component of the system makes a decision by itself and the control of the whole system is a shared task. The interchange of information between components is performed via fieldbuses. The graphic computer tool developed is able to perform an automatic code generation starting from a graphic description of the system provided by the user. Thus, different aircraft fuel system configurations can be considered. According to the specific aircraft under study, they can include more or less tanks and components in the system. For each case, the control code of the distributed system can be quickly modified. It can, then, be integrated in each component device to operate in the system. This paper describes the main ideas of the new distributed avionic system and the graphical tool. Some experimental results in a laboratory plant simulator are also shown.", "paper_title": "Computer tool with a code generator for avionic distributed fuel control systems with smart sensors and actuators", "paper_id": "WOS:000255354900012"}
