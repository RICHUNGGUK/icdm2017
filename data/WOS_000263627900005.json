Starting from the flow equation of the deterministic Initial Value Problem (IVP) associates to FIVP, we obtain the FIVP flow, through the principle of Zadeh. Follow, we introduce the concept of fuzzy equilibrium stability of FIVP and some examples are given.", "paper_title": "STABILITY OF FUZZY DYNAMIC SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000263627900005"}
