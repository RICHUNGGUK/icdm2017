For a fixed epsilon, the running time of our algorithm is heuristic polynomial in (log(2) N). Our factoring algorithm is based on a lattice-based algorithm of solving any k-variate polynomial equation over Z, which might be an independent interest.", "paper_title": "Factorization of square-free integers with high bits known", "paper_id": "WOS:000252617400033"}
