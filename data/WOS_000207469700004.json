In this paper, a novel time-frequency algorithm for GNSS application is proposed. The use of infinite impulse-response notch filters for the interference excision is introduced and analytical formulas for the detection of the disturbing signals are derived. The proposed method is tested by simulations and compared with time-frequency excision algorithms reported in literature, proving its effectiveness for interference removal.", "paper_title": "Time-Frequency Excision for GNSS Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000207469700004"}
