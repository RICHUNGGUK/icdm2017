Most existing trust and reputation systems calculate a general trust value or vector based on the gathered feedback without regard to trust's locality and subjectivity; therefore, they cannot effectively support a personal selection with consumer preferences. Our goal is to build a trust and reputation mechanism for facilitating a trustworthy and personal service selection in a service-oriented Web, where service peers can act as a service provider and/or a service consumer. A user-centric trust and reputation mechanism distinguishing the different trust context and content to enable a personal service selection with regard to trust preference in a service-oriented Web is represented in detail. It is widely recognized that reputation-based trust methods must face the challenge of malicious behaviors. To deal with the malicious feedback behaviors, we introduce a \"bidirectional\" feedback mechanism based on QoS experience similarity in our trust and reputation framework. The test run demonstrates that our method can significantly increase the success rate of service transactions and is effective in resisting various malicious behaviors of service peers, when it is compared to other similar methods.
