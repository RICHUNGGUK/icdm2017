The proposed approach is apt for modeling scenarios, where standard ANN multilayer perceptron (MLP) and Prior Knowledge Input (PKI) models fail to deliver a satisfactory model. This approach feeds output of standard ANN model as knowledge input to PKI model. The ANN model and the PKI model form a symbiotic pair to yield accurate results. In this paper, the dogleg routine is exploited in the process of optimization to obtain valid trust region steps. The proposed method is compared with sensitivity technique via several RF/microwave components. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
