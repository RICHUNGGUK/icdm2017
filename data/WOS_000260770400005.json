The stability conditions containing diffusion term are different from those obtained in the previous papers in their exponential stability conditions. One example is given to illustrate the feasibility of this method in the end.", "paper_title": "W (1,2)(Omega)- and X(1,2) Omega)-stability of reaction-diffusion cellular neural networks with delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000260770400005"}
