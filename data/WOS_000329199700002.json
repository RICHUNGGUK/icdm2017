Inverse dynamic methods based on the kinematics of the given motion and on the use of optimisation approach are the most widely used for muscle force estimation. The aim of this study was to estimate how the choice of muscle model influences predicted muscle forces. Huxley's (1957, Prog Biophys Biop Chem. 7: 255-318) and Hill's (1938, Proc R Soc B. 126: 136-195) muscle models were used for determination of muscle forces of two antagonistic muscles of the lower extremity during cycling. Huxley's model is a complex model that couples biochemical and physical processes with the microstructure of the muscle whereas the Hill's model is a phenomenological model. Muscle forces predicted by both models are within the same range. Huxley's model predicts more realistic patterns of muscle activation but it is computationally more demanding. Therefore, if the overall muscle forces are to be assessed, it is reasonable to use a simpler implementation based on Hill's model.", "paper_title": "A comparative study of muscle force estimates using Huxley's and Hill's muscle model", "paper_id": "WOS:000329199700002"}
