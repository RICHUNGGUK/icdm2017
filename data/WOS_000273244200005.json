A substitute to the subdifferential is proposed. Then generalised monotonicity is considered. A representation of generalised monotone maps allows us to obtain a symmetry between maps and their inverses. Finally, maximality of generalised monotone maps is analysed.", "paper_title": "A geometrical insight on pseudoconvexity and pseudomonotonicity", "paper_id": "WOS:000273244200005"}
