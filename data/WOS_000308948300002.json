This paper proposes a technique for decomposing a function into 2-to-1 multiplexers performing area-power tradeoff. To the best of our knowledge this is the first ever effort to incorporate leakage into power calculation for multiplexer-based decomposition. With respect to an initial ROBDD (reduced ordered binary decision diagram)-based representation of the function, the scheme shows more than 30% reduction in area, leakage and switching for the LGSynth91 benchmarks without performance degradation. It also enumerates the trade-offs present in the solution space for different weights associated with these three quantities.", "paper_title": "MULTIPLEXER-BASED MULTI-LEVEL CIRCUIT SYNTHESIS WITH AREA-POWER TRADE-OFF", "paper_id": "WOS:000308948300002"}
