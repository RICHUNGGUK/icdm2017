The calculation results reveal that bulky 3-pentyloxy groups at the non-peripheral positions of the phthalocyanine ring evince great changes in structure and properties: they deflect the isoindole units, lift the frontier molecular orbitals, alter the atomic charge distribution, shift the bands of IR and electronic absorption spectra, etc. Though the central metal can shorten or lengthen the bond length, its effect on the electronic structure and properties of the phthalocyanine complex is very limited. Axial coordination significantly enhances the non-planarity of the phthalocyanine ring and, thus, alters the electronic structure, which is important for the formation of novel dimeric supramolecular structures through intermolecular hydrogen bonds. In addition, the calculated structures of 3 as well as the simulated IR and electronic absorption spectra of 4 were compared with the experimental data and showed good agreement.
