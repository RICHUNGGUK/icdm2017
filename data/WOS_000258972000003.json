A reference solution for this model flow is obtained by two-time scale asymptotic development in the zero Mach number limit. The solution can be decomposed into variations with a slow convective and a fast acoustic time scale. A selection of numerical schemes widely used to solve unsteady compressible low Mach number flows has been implemented to simulate this flow for two Mach number values, M = 0.1 and M = 0.01. The ability of the schemes to predict low Mach number flows and their behavior with the value of the Mach number have been analyzed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
