We investigate the use of support vector machines to improve the classification of InftyReader, a free system for the OCR of mathematical documents. First, we compare the performance of SVM kernels and feature definitions on pairs of letters that InftyReader usually confuses. Second, we describe a successful approach to multi-class classification with SVM, utilizing the ranking of alternatives within InftyReader's confusion clusters. The inclusion of our technique in InftyReader reduces its misrecognition rate by 41%. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
