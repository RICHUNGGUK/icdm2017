In cases of mCryton-64/96/128, our attacks require computational complexities of and , respectively. These results are the first known biclique cryptanalytic results on mCrypton. The attack on a 29-round reduced LED-64 needs 29-round reduced LED-64 encryptions. In the cases of LED-80/96/128, we propose the attacks on two versions. First, to recover the secret key of 45-round reduced LED-80/96/128, our attacks require computational complexities of and , respectively. To attack the full version, we require computational complexities of and , respectively. However, in these cases, we need the full codebook. These results are superior to known biclique cryptanalytic results on LED.", "paper_title": "Weakness of lightweight block ciphers mCrypton and LED against biclique cryptanalysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000356580800018"}
