It is known that every plane graph admits a 2-facial coloring using 8 colors [D. Kral T. Madaras. R. Skrekovski. Cyclic. diagonal and facial coloring, European J. Cornbin. 3-4 (26) (2005) 473-490]. We improve this bound for plane graphs with large girth and prove that if G is a plane graph with girth g >= 14 (resp. 10. 8) then G admits a 2-facial coloring using 5 colors (resp. 6. 7). Moreover, we give exact bounds for outerplanar graphs and K-4-minor free graphs. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
