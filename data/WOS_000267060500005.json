The approach centres on the construction of a grammar in which a predefined and fixed set of abstract join points and join point environments are linked with their concrete counterparts within the DSL. This connection enables the behaviour of static weaving to be expressed in a generic manner. The resulting framework is one in which aspect orientation is accessible to non-experts across a wide spectrum of abstractions.", "paper_title": "Making aspect-orientation accessible through syntax-based language composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000267060500005"}
