The nonlinear system is assumed to verify the usual Lipschitz condition that permits us to transform the nonlinear system into a linear time-delay system with structured uncertainties. The existence of the observer-gain is ensured by the solution of a one linear matrix inequality. An illustrative example is included to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed observation technique.", "paper_title": "Observer design for discrete-time systems subject to time-delay nonlinearities", "paper_id": "WOS:000239238200004"}
