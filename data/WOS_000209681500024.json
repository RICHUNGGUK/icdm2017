Generic analytical expressions for the diversity and coding gains are deduced, which reveal fundamental properties of MIMO SM systems. The presented analysis can be used to obtain closed-form upper bounds for the average bit error probability (ABEP) of MIMO SM systems under generalized fading, which become asymptotically tight in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic Error Performance Analysis of Spatial Modulation Under Generalized Fading", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681500024"}
