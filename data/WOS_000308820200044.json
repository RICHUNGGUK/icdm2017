However, based on the long term observation of wafer diffusion factories, the traffic jams happen frequently, when the overhead hoist transport is loading or unloading. This kind of traffic jams will definitely hamper the performance of the delivery of the products, specifically for those high priority lots. Therefore, this paper develops an effective dispatching rule, named heuristic preemptive dispatching rule to resolve this critical subject. This study uses a simulation method for a 300 mm wafer manufacturing factory to analyze the issue and verify the results. Compare with the recent differentiated preemptive dispatching, the results demonstrate that the proposed method by this study can expedite the movement of lots and reduce lot transport time significantly with no additional investment of resources. This is a very big advantage for the capital intensive wafer manufacturing companies.", "paper_title": "The heuristic preemptive dispatching method of material transportation system in 300 mm semiconductor fabrication", "paper_id": "WOS:000308820200044"}
