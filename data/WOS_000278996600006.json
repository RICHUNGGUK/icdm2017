This paper proposes a novel X-filling technique, namely \"iFill\", to address the above issue, by analyzing the impact of X-bits on switching activities of the circuit nodes in the two different phases. In addition, different from prior X-filling methods for shift-power reduction that can only reduce shift-in power, our method is able to cut down power consumptions in both shift-in and shift-out processes. Experimental results on benchmark circuits show that the proposed technique can guarantee the power safety in both shift and capture phases during at-speed scan-based testing.", "paper_title": "X-Filling for Simultaneous Shift- and Capture-Power Reduction in At-Speed Scan-Based Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000278996600006"}
