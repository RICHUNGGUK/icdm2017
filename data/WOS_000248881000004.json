Dynamic and stochastic scheduling problems with possible scheduling environments are presented. Based on our review of the related literature, frequently applied rescheduling approaches for solving dynamic and stochastic job-shop scheduling problems are analyzed. Schedule evaluation techniques, related measures, and simulation-based schedule evaluation solutions are also introduced and categorized. Certain stability-oriented evaluations of periodic and hybrid rescheduling methods are described for both single- and multi-machine (job-shop) cases. Finally, an industrial application of the proposed method is presented. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
