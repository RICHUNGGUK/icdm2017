It leads to powerful attacks against the stream ciphers based on them. A new representation called ring representation has been proposed to avoid the attacks. It was considered to circumvent the weaknesses of Galois FCSRs. This correspondence presents a class of ring FCSRs, which meet the implementation criteria, but are still possible to maintain linear behavior for several clock cycles. Their LFSRization probability and how to improve their security are also mentioned.", "paper_title": "On the LFSRization of a Class of FCSR Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464100048"}
