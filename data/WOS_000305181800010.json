Such innovative techniques use information gathered by the hardware accelerator during the computation of the alignment scores to constrain the size of the subsequence that has to be post-processed in the traceback phase using a general purpose processor (GPP). Moreover, the proposed structure is also capable of computing the n-best local alignments according to the Waterman-Eggert algorithm, becoming the first hardware architecture that is able to simultaneously evaluate the n-best alignments of a given sequence pair, by incorporating a set of ordering units that work in parallel with the systolic array. A complete alignment system was developed and implemented in a Virtex-4 FPGA, by integrating the proposed accelerator architecture with a Leon3 GPP. The obtained experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system is flexible and allows the alignment of large sequences in memory constrained systems. As an example, a speedup of 17 was obtained with the conceived system when compared with a regular implementation of the LALIGN35 program running on an Intel Core2 Duo processor running at a 40x higher frequency.", "paper_title": "Integrated Hardware Architecture for Efficient Computation of the n-Best Bio-Sequence Local Alignments in Embedded Platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000305181800010"}
