Accordingly, computer-aided diagnosis has become an increasingly important area for intelligent computational systems. This paper describes a competitive/collaborative neural computing system designed to support the medical decision process using medical imaging databases. A concrete example concerning an application to support the differential diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer is also provided.", "paper_title": "Competitive/collaborative neural computing system for medical diagnosis in pancreatic cancer detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000286836200004"}
