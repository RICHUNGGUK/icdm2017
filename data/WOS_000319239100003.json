Complex elastic moduli and complex stiffness are defined to derive an analytical model that predicts the hysteretic system damping for the whole structure. The prediction model comprises two parts, the first related to bending, and the second related to shear. Reliable experimental damping evaluations on overhanging timber beams are used to calibrate the model and obtain fitted values of loss factors for two types of wood. The good agreement of the derived model with experimental data reveals an efficient approach in the prediction of material damping. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
