To speed-up the detection process, the system searches the entire frame for the potential face regions by using skin color detection and segmentation. Then it scans the skin color segments of the image and applies the weak classifiers along with the strong classifier for face detection and expression classification. This system detects human face in different scales, various poses, different expressions, partial-occlusion, and defocus. Our major contribution is proposing the weak hybrid classifiers selection based on the Harr-like (local) features and Gabor (global) features. The multipose face detection algorithm can also be modified for facial expression recognition. The experimental results show that our face detection system and facial expression recognition system have better performance than the other classifiers. (C) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society.
