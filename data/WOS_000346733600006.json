Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) has been a key technique in exploiting the hardware characteristics of cloud datacenters to save energy by lowering the supply voltage and operating frequency. This paper presents a novel stochastic framework for energy efficiency and performance analysis of DVS-enabled cloud. This framework uses virtual machine request arrival rate, failure rate, repair rate, and service rate of datacenter servers as model inputs. Based on a queuing-network-based analysis, this paper gives analytic solutions of three metrics. The proposed framework can be used to help the design and optimization of energy-aware high performance cloud systems.", "paper_title": "A Stochastic Approach to Analysis of Energy-Aware DVS-Enabled Cloud Datacenters", "paper_id": "WOS:000346733600006"}
