Our first algorithm uses [log(2) n] number of binary consensus instances where n is the number of processes, while our second algorithm uses at most 2 (k) over tilde binary consensus instances, where V is the maximum length of the binary representation of all proposed values in the run. Both algorithms are significant improvements over the previous algorithm in [A. Mostefaoui, M. Raynal, F. Tronel, From binary consensus to multivalued consensus in asynchronous message-passing systems, Information Processing Letters 73 (5-6) (2000) 207-212], where the number of binary consensus instances needed to solve one multivalued consensus is unbounded.
