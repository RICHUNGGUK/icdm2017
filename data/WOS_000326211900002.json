NN (nearest neighbor) approaches provide an efficient method to compute relevance scores, by using estimated densities of relevant and non-relevant samples in a particular feature space. In this paper, particularities of the CBIR problem are exploited to propose an improved relevance feedback algorithm based on the NN approach. The resulting method has been tested in a number of different situations and compared to the standard NN approach and other existing relevance feedback mechanisms. Experimental results evidence significant improvements in most cases. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
