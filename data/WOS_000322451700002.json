The object is to develop a modulation of a class-D audio amplifier with high power efficiency in this paper. The traditional H-bridge class-D audio amplifier has a shortcoming of large signal distortion which is worse than realized. However, the proposed circuit improves the drawback and provides high power efficiency at the same time. The circuit implements a modified scheme of pulse-width modulation. In this paper, we presented two class-D amplifiers, compared their differences and explained why the efficiency and distortion performance can be modified. The increase in total harmonic distortion (THD) is due to non-linearity in the triangle wave. To overcome this problem, a negative feedback from the output of the switching power stage is adopted to reduce the THD. When a 0.7-V-PP and 1 kHz sine wave is used as an input signal, the minimum THD is 0.029 % and the maximum power efficiency is 83 %. The fully differential class-D audio amplifier is implemented with a TSMC 0.35-mu m 2P4M CMOS process, and the chip area is 2.57 x 2.57 mm(2) (with PADs).", "paper_title": "Performance comparison of integrated fully-differential filterless class-D amplifiers with different feedback techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000322451700002"}
