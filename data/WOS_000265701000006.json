The spurious noise is induced by charge injection generated from the parasitic capacitors associated with switches and the current-mismatch between the charging and discharging currents of the charge pump. A new charge pump is configured by adding an operational amplifier, a sample-and-hold circuit, and switches to a basic charge pump. During the idling time of the charge pump, the currents of the current sources are adjusted and the current-mismatch are reduced to 0.3%. Applying the proposed charge pump to a phase-locked loop, we can suppress the spurious noise by 18 dB compared with a PLL using a basic one.", "paper_title": "Reduction of Charge Injection and Current-Mismatch Errors of Charge Pump for Phase-Locked Loop", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701000006"}
