The governing idea is to include geometry, topology, load carrying, energy transfer, actuating, sensing and control of a machine in one single mathematical state model and, thereby, enable a formulation of the design and configuration problem as an optimization problem. We have focused our attention on a type of NMN consisting of what we call active trusses. For these, we have established a state model and given a design optimization problem from which we have obtained numerical solutions. These solutions show that the approach has the possibility to suggest new families of designs that are superior to those of classical passive trusses. We also indicate how activation may result in singularities, the treatment of which is, so far, essentially an open problem.", "paper_title": "Design and configuration of neuro mechanical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000261037600002"}
