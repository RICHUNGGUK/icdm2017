We investigate the extra conditions needed on f exponentiable in Pos to be exponentiable in omega-Cpo by showing the existence of partial products of the two-point ordered set S = {0 < 1} (Theorem 22.8). Using this characterisation and the embedding through the Scott topology of omega-Cpo in the category Top of topological spaces, we compare exponentiability in each setting and find that a morphism in omega-Cpo that is exponentiable in both Top and Pos is exponentiable in omega-Cpo also. Furthermore, we show that the exponentiability in Top and Pos are indedpendent of each other.", "paper_title": "Exponentiable morphisms of domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000260638200007"}
