This necessitates the usage of algorithms for resolving batch collisions (conflicts) with unknown conflict multiplicity n. In this paper we present a novel approach to the problem of collision resolution for batch conflicts. We show how the conventional tree algorithms for collision resolution can be used to obtain progressively accurate estimation of the multiplicity. We use the estimation to propose a more efficient binary tree algorithm, termed Estimating Binary Tree (EBT) algorithm. The EBT algorithm is suited for implementation when the conflicting nodes are passive, such as e.g. RFID tags. We extend the approach to design the Interval Estimation Conflict Resolution (IECR) algorithm. For n -> infinity we prove that the efficiency achieved by IECR for batch arrivals is identical with the efficiency that Gallager's FCFS algorithm achieves for Poisson packet arrivals. For finite n, the simulation results show that IECR is, to the best of our knowledge, the most efficient batch resolution algorithm reported to date.", "paper_title": "A class of algorithms for collision resolution with multiplicity estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000251455500003"}
