One of its attributes (like height, age, weight, etc.) is first mapped to a real number (often by means of a physical instrument) and a parametric function then maps this real number to a membership degree in some fuzzy set (like \"tall,\" \"old,\" \"heavy,\" etc.). A very common parametric function is the trapezoidal one. This paper presents some conditions guaranteeing the existence of such a trapezoidal membership function representing the knowledge of an expert. Further experimental research is needed for testing whether these conditions are satisfied by human agents.", "paper_title": "A measurement-theoretic axiomatization of trapezoidal membership functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000245684800009"}
