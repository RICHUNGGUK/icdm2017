The hybrid chaotic optimization algorithm (HCOA), which can avoid being trapped in local minima and improve convergence in dealing with the large space and high-dimension optimization problems, is used to perform real-time nonlinear minimization of the cost function of a mobile robot to enhance the control accuracy. The proposed improved bidirectional extreme learning machine is employed to model the mobile robot plant and estimate future plant output. The experimental results of tracking the automation mobile robot indicate that the proposed controller can provide more accuracy and faster tracking performance than traditional neural network predictive controllers.", "paper_title": "Predictive Control Strategy Based on Extreme Learning Machine for Path-Tracking of Autonomous Mobile Robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000346832900001"}
