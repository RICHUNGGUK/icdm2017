When features are of different natures, combining the value of distances or (dis-) similarity measures is not easy since each feature has its own amount of variability. Statistical models are therefore needed. This article proposes a statistical method, namely an a contrario method, to merge features derived from several families of size functions. This merging is usually achieved through a touchy normalizing of the distances. The proposed model consists in building a probability measure. It leads to a global shape recognition method dedicated to perceptual similarities.", "paper_title": "Shape recognition via an a contrario model for size functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600037"}
