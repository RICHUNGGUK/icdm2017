This paper presents a scalogram and phase spectrum analyzing approach for the high-frequency switching noise detection. A complex Gaussian wavelet is used to extract the oscillation feature of the noise signal. The proposed scheme is more suitable in discriminating the type of switching noise than conventional wavelet transform approaches. Simulation results show the effectiveness and advantages of the method.", "paper_title": "AN APPLICATION OF COMPLEX WAVELETS FOR HIGH FREQUENCY SWITCHING NOISE DETECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000264491200008"}
