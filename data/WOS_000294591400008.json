Let d(i) be the degree of the i-th vertex of G, i = 1,...,n. The first Zagreb index M(1) is the sum of d(i)(2) over all vertices of C. The second Zagreb index M(2) is the sum d(i) d(j) over pairs of adjacent vertices of C. In this paper we search for graph for which M(1)/n = M(2)/m, and show how numerous such graphs can be constructed. In addition, we find examples of graphs for which M(1)/n > M(2)/m, which are counterexamples for the earlier conjectured inequality M(1)/n <= M(2)/m.", "paper_title": "Some Observations on Comparing Zagreb Indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000294591400008"}
