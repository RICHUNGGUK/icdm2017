It is designed to help ecologists, evolutionary biologists and conservation biologists analyze effect size data extracted from published studies in a comparative phylogenetic context. This software estimates phylogenetic versions of all the traditional meta-analytical statistics used for: pooling effect sizes with weighted regressions; evaluating the homogeneity of these effect sizes; performing moderator tests akin to ANOVA style analyses; and analyzing data with fixed- and random-effects models. phyloMeta is developed in C/C++ and can be used via command line in MS Windows environments.", "paper_title": "phyloMeta: a program for phylogenetic comparative analyses with meta-analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000294755400026"}
