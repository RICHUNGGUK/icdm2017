It is shown that the known results constitute in many cases only lower bounds for WSNB operation under the blocking window algorithm. New necessary and sufficient conditions are derived and proved. The obtained results can also be extended to networks with a limit imposed on the multicast group size. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
