We address the following question: To what extent the time-varying delays can exist while the system is stable? Moreover, a new concept of stability, global it mu-stability, is proposed. Under mild conditions, we prove that the dynamical systems with unbounded time-varying delays are globally mu-stable.", "paper_title": "Global mu-stability of delayed neural networks with unbounded time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000250789100022"}
