Despite its nondifferentiability, the contrast function is endowed with attractive properties such as discriminacy, and hence warrants an effort to be effectively handled by a derivative-free optimizer. Aside from tailoring the Nelder-Mead technique to the constraint set, namely, oblique manifold, the source separation results attained in an empirical study with quasi-correlated synthetic signals and digital images are presented, which favor the proposed method on a comparative basis.", "paper_title": "Nonsmooth ICA Contrast Minimization Using a Riemannian Nelder-Mead Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000348854800015"}
