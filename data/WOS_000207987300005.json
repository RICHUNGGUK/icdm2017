According to the production system theory, we can define a geometrically based problem-solving model as a production system operating on vectors of fixed dimensions (Icons). Our goal is to form a sequence of associations, which lead to a desired state represented by a vector, from an initial state represented by a vector. We define a simple and universal heuristics function, which takes into account the relationship between the vector and the corresponding similarity of the represented object or state in the real world.", "paper_title": "Sub-Symbols and Icons", "paper_id": "WOS:000207987300005"}
