Taking a non-maximal Poisson disk sampling as input, our algorithm efficiently detects the regions allowing additional samples and then generates Poisson disks in these regions. The key idea is to convert the complicated plane or space searching problem into a simple searching on circles or spheres, which is one dimensional lower than the original sampling domain. Our algorithm is memory efficient and flexible, which generates maximal Poisson disk sampling in an arbitrary 2D polygon or 3D polyhedron. Moreover, our parallel algorithm can be extended from the Euclidean space to curved surfaces in an intrinsic manner. Thanks to its parallel structure, our method can be implemented easily on modern graphics hardware. We have observed significance performance improvement compared to the existing techniques.
