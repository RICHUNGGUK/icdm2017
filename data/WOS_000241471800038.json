The CIC scheme is based on combination of single Chain scheme and Hash Tree Chains scheme, and integrates the advantages of both. In this scheme, stream is firstly divided into blocks with n packets, and each block consists of m clusters, everyone of which contains a tree of packets. All clusters are chained together. Through CIC, packets of one cluster can be authenticated by any packet of the previous cluster. Compared to other multicast authentication protocols, the proposed scheme has the following advantages: 1) dramatically improves the resistance to burst packets loss, 2) low computation and communication overhead, 3) imposes low delay on the sender side and no delay on the receiver side, assuming no loss occurs.", "paper_title": "Source authentication of media streaming based on Chains of Iso-hash Clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800038"}
