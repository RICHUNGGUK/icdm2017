Aspects such as price, licensing, service and data quality play a major role in selecting data sources. We therefore advocate quality-aware data services as a natural data source model for complex data integration tasks and mash-ups. This paper focuses on requirements, state of the art, and the main research challenges on the way to the realization of such services.", "paper_title": "Quality-aware Service-Oriented Data Integration: Requirements, State of the Art and Open Challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000302966900002"}
