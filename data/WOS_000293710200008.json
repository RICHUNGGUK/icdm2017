In our method, we designed a general framework for modeling noisy distribution using a probability matrix and devised an efficient algorithm to identify approximate matched frequent subgraphs. We have used APGM to both synthetic data set and real-world data sets on protein structure pattern identification and structure classification. Our experimental study demonstrates the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "An efficient graph-mining method for complicated and noisy data with real-world applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000293710200008"}
