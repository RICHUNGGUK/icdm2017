Complete imaging systems can thus be integrated into a single chip. A large number of recent articles have explored this feature. This paper presents a detailed explanation of the design of a chip that performs image compression at the focal plane by means of an algorithm based on wavelet transform, namely the embedded zero-tree wavelet algorithm. The imager performs current-mode five-level Haar wavelet decomposition on a 32 x 32 image, and, from numerical simulations, decoded image peak signal-to-noise ratio around 20 dB is expected for compression ratio around 4:1. Electrical simulations comparing image quality and bit rate for different images are presented, as well as experimental measurements regarding the imager modulation transfer function.", "paper_title": "CMOS imager with current-mode sub-band image coding at the focal plane", "paper_id": "WOS:000360664400010"}
