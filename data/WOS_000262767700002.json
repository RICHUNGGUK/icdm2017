A solution technique for the governing magnetohydrodynamic equations in primitive variable formulation has been developed. A co-ordinate transformation has been employed to map the infinite irregular domain into a finite regular computational domain. The governing equations are discretized using finite-difference approximations in staggered grid. Pressure Poisson equation and pressure correction formulae are derived and solved numerically. It is found that with increase in the magnetic field, the size of the flow separation zone diminishes and for sufficiently large magnetic field, the separation zone disappears completely. The peak it-velocity decreases with increase in the magnetic field. It is also found that the asymmetric flow in a symmetric geometry. which occurs at moderate Reynolds numbers, becomes symmetric with sufficient increase in the transverse magnetic field. Thus. a transverse magnetic field of suitable strength has a stabilizing effect in controlling flow separation, as also in delaying the transition to turbulence.
