The control approach encompasses a fuzzy system and a robust controller. The fuzzy system is designed to mimic an ideal controller, based on sliding-mode control. The robust controller is designed to compensate for the difference between the fuzzy controller and the ideal controller. The parameters of the fuzzy system, as well as uncertainty bound of the robust controller, are tuned adaptively. The adaptive laws are derived in the Lyapunov sense to guarantee the stability of the controlled system. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
