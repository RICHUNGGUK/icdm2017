When performance is measured using a per-symbol loss function satisfying mild regularity conditions, we develop a sequence of denoisers that although independent of the distribution of the underlying \"clean\" sequence, is universally optimal in the limit of large sequence length. This sequence of denoisers; is universal in the sense of performing as well as any sliding-window denoising scheme which may be optimized for the underlying clean signal. Our results are initially developed in a \"semi-stochastic\" setting, where the noiseless signal is an unknown individual sequence, and the only source of randomness is due to the channel noise. It is subsequently shown that in the fully stochastic setting, where the noiseless sequence is a stationary stochastic process, our schemes universally attain optimum performance. The proposed schemes draw from nonparametric density estimation techniques and are practically implementable. We demonstrate efficacy of the proposed schemes in denoising Gray-scale images in the conventional additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) setting, with additional promising results for less conventional noise distributions.", "paper_title": "Universal Denoising of Discrete-Time Continuous-Amplitude Signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000261648100022"}
