In this paper, we present some sketching interactions for 3D modeling, based on a set of two different bidimensional sketches (profile curve and silhouette curve). By using these two sketches and combining them with a gesture grammar, a very large variety of shapes (including shapes with topological holes) can be easily produced by our interactive modeling environment.", "paper_title": "3D sketching with profile curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566000011"}
