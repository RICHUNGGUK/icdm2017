It generalizes a previous technique on stochastic marked graphs. The approach has two basic foundations. First, a deep understanding of the qualitative behavior of WTS leads to a general decomposition technique. Second, after the decomposition phase, an iterative response-time approximation method is applied for the throughout computation. Existence of convergence points for the iterative approximation method can be proved. Experimental results generally have an error of less than 5%. The state space is usually reduced by more than one order of magnitude; therefore, the analysis of otherwise intractable systems is possible.", "paper_title": "Approximate throughput computation of stochastic weighted T-systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000246034500013"}
