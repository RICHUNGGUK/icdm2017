We consider a stable historical period of length m. The goal is to propose a test,with asymptotically small probability of false alarm and power 1 as the length of the historical period tends to infinity. The asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis and consistency under the alternative hypothesis is derived. A small simulation study illustrates the finite sample performance of the monitoring scheme.", "paper_title": "SEQUENTIAL MONITORING FOR CHANGE IN SCALE", "paper_id": "WOS:000261942400008"}
