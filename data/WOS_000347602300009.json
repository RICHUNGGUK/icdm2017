The proposed mathematical model exploits positive Dirac's deltas in the corresponding flexibility functions of the beam elements, and allows also considering shear deformations and rotatory inertia. Such contributions may have a huge impact on the higher modes of vibration, as confirmed by the numerical examples. (C) 2014 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
