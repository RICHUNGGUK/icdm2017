Technology prototypes are first investigated in simplified contexts, and these simulations are scaled up to conditions of practice step by step as more becomes known about the technology. This paper discusses empirical research methods for scaling up new requirements engineering (RE) technology. When scaling up to practice, researchers want to generalize from validation studies to future practice. An analysis of scaling up technology in drug research reveals two ways to generalize, namely inductive generalization using statistical inference from samples, and analogic generalization using similarity between cases. Both are supported by abductive inference using mechanistic explanations of phenomena observed in the simulations. Illustrations of these inferences both in drug research and empirical RE research are given. Next, four kinds of methods for empirical RE technology validation are given, namely expert opinion, single-case mechanism experiments, technical action research and statistical difference-making experiments. A series of examples from empirical RE will illustrate the use of these methods, and the role of inductive generalization, analogic generalization, and abductive inference in them. Finally, the four kinds of empirical validation methods are compared with lists of validation methods known from empirical software engineering. The lists are combined to give an overview of some of the methods, instruments and data analysis techniques that may be used in empirical RE. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
