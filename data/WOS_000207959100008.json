The current state of the art of computer-aided drug design and selected recent applications to Cancer and AIDS are discussed. Novel targets and drugs in Cancer and AIDS are analyzed. In conclusion, future perspectives for drug discovery, design and therapeutics in cancer and AIDS are presented.", "paper_title": "Cancer and Aids: New Trends in Drug Design and Chemotherapy", "paper_id": "WOS:000207959100008"}
