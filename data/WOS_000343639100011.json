This settles an open problem raised by Biedl [1], in the context of computing minimum height planar straight line drawings of outerplanar graphs, with their vertices placed on a two-dimensional grid. In conjunction with the result of this paper, the constant factor approximation algorithm for this problem obtained by Biedl [1] for 2-vertex-connected outerplanar graphs will work for all outer planar graphs.
