While set agreement generalizes consensus in terms of the number of decisions allowed, the CD problem generalizes consensus in the sense of considering many instances of consensus and requiring a processor to decide in at least one instance. In more detail, in the CD problem each one of a set of n processes has a (possibly distinct) value to propose to each one of a set of b consensus problems, which we call committees. Yet a process has to decide a value for at least one of these committees, such that all processes deciding for the same committee decide the same value. We study the CD problem in the context of a wait-free distributed system and analyze it using a combination of distributed algorithmic and topological techniques, introducing a novel reduction technique. We use the reduction technique to obtain the following results. We show that the (2, 3)-CD problem is equivalent to the musical benches problem introduced by Gafni and Rajsbaum in [10], and both are equivalent to (2, 3)-set agreement, closing an open question left there. Thus, all three problems are wait-free unsolvable in a read/write shared memory system, and they are all solvable if the system is enriched with objects capable of solving (2, 3)-set agreement. While the previous proof of the impossibility of musical benches was based on the Borsuk-Ulam (BU) Theorem, it now relies on Sperner's Lemma, opening intriguing questions about the relation between BU and distributed computing tasks.", "paper_title": "The committee decision problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000236886100047"}
