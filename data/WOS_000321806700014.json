In particular, the paper presents the BreakTies algorithm for breaking ties in cost measures when selecting the next arc to reverse in a variable elimination operation. BreakTies is based upon using a sequence of cost measures instead of randomly selecting an arc to reverse when multiple arcs share the same cost. The paper reports on an experimental evaluation of LPAR for belief update in Bayesian networks considering six sequences of five cost measures for breaking ties using BreakTies. The experimental results show that using BreakTies to select the next arc to reverse in a variable elimination operation can improve performance of LPAR. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
