Specifically, the paper considers observers which asymptotically estimate the local state, in the sense that the error tends to zero as the reconstructed local state evolves away from possibly mismatched boundary values, modulo a detectability subspace. Ultimately, the synthesis of such observers in the absence of explicit input information is addressed.", "paper_title": "Detectability subspaces and observer synthesis for two-dimensional systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000298881400005"}
