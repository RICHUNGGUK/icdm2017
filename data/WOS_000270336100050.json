Some stability criteria that ensure the convergence of valid solutions are obtained. It is proved that an equilibrium state is stable if and only if it corresponds to a valid solution of the TSP. Thus, a valid solution can always be obtained whenever the network convergence to a stable state. A set of analytical conditions for optimal settings of LVNN is derived. Simulation results illustrate the theoretical analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
