A Mobility Anchor Point is a router located in a network visited by the Mobile Node. The Mobile Node uses the Mobile Anchor Point as a local Home Agent. The absence of any protections between Mobile Node and Mobile Anchor Point may lead to malicious Mobile Nodes impersonating other legitimate ones or impersonating a Mobile Anchor Point. In this paper, we propose a mechanism of the secure Mobile Anchor Point discovery in HMIPv6. The performance analysis and the numerical results presented in this paper show that our proposal has superior performance to other methods.", "paper_title": "Mechanism of the secure MAP discovery in hierarchical MIPv6", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100093"}
