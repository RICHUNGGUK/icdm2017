Registration is a fundamental stage in a 3D reconstruction process. Basically the task is to match two or more images taken in different times, from different sensors, or from different viewpoints. In this paper, we discuss a number of possible approaches to the registration problem and propose a new method based on the manual pre-alignment of the images followed by an automatic registration process using a novel genetic optimization algorithm. Results for real range data are presented. This procedure focuses, on the problem of obtaining the best correspondence between points through a robust search method between partially overlapped images.", "paper_title": "Robust three-dimensional registration of range images using a new genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000239567900037"}
