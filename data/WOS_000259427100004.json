In dynamic service-oriented computing environment, situation awareness (SAW) is needed for system monitoring, adaptive service coordination and flexible security policy enforcement. To greatly reduce the development effort of SAW capability in service-based systems and effectively support runtime system adaptation, it is necessary to automate the development of reusable and autonomous software components, called SAW agents, for situation-aware service-based systems. In this paper, a logic-based approach to declaratively specifying SAW requirements, decomposing SAW specifications for efficient distributed situation analysis, and automated synthesis of SAW agents is presented. This approach is based on AS(3) calculus and logic, and our declarative model for SAW. Evaluation results of our approach are also presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
