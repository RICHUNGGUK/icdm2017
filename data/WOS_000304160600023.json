In this paper, a facility location problem with stochastic customer demand and immobile servers is studied. Two objectives considered in this problem are: (1) minimizing the average customer waiting time and (2) minimizing the average facility idle-time percentage. We formulate this problem using queuing theory and solve the model by a genetic algorithm within the desirability function framework. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the applications of the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "Genetic application in a facility location problem with random demand within queuing framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000304160600023"}
