The admissible evolution and asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop system is ensured by means of suitable choice of the terminal cost and terminal constraint. However, most of the existing results on MPC are designed for a regulation problem. If the desired steady-state changes, the MPC controller must be redesigned to guarantee the feasibility of the optimisation problem, the admissible evolution as well as the asymptotic stability. Recently, a novel MPC has been proposed to ensure the feasibility of the optimisation problem, constraints satisfaction and asymptotic evolution of the system to any admissible target steady-state. A drawback of this controller is the loss of a desirable property of the MPC controllers: the local optimality property. In this article, a novel formulation of the MPC for tracking is proposed aimed to recover the optimality property maintaining all the properties of the original formulation.", "paper_title": "Optimal MPC for tracking of constrained linear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000292642900004"}
