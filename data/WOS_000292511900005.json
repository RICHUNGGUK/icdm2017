The scheme first uses the VQ-compression method to compress a secret image. This allows senders to share a larger secret image than other methods. Moreover, the proposed method also allows participants to reconstruct a lossless secret image. The generated shadows are meaningful with high quality, so the image does not attract any suspicion from attackers. Because the scheme uses XOR operation during the construction and revealing phases, it is suitable for secret sharing applications.", "paper_title": "LOSSLESS SECRET SHARING SCHEME WITH HIGH QUALITY SHARES BASED ON VQ-COMPRESSED IMAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000292511900005"}
