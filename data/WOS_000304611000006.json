To implement these protocols we have used the strong modulating pulses (SMP) and the various stages of each implementation were verified by quantum state tomography (QST). The results for the computational base states, Toffolli logic gates, and Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover algorithms are presented here. Also, we discuss the difficulties and advantages of implementing such protocols using the SMP technique in quadrupolar systems.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM STATE TOMOGRAPHY AND QUANTUM LOGICAL OPERATIONS IN A THREE QUBITS NMR QUADRUPOLAR SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000304611000006"}
