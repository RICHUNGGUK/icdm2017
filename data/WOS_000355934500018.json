SFLA is a population-based algorithm that combines the advantages of memetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization. This paper compares previous researches on SFLA and its effectiveness, with the most applied optimization algorithms reviewed and analyzed. Based on the literature, many efforts by previous researchers on SFLA denote the next generations of basic SFLA with diverse structures for modified SFLA or hybrid SFLA. As well, an attempt is made to highlight these structures, their enhancements and advantages. Moreover, this paper considers top improvements on SFLA for solving multi-objective optimization problems, enhancing local and global exploration, avoiding being trapped into local optima, declining computational time and improving the quality of the initial population. The measured enhancements in SFLA are based on the statistical results obtained from 89 published papers and by considering the most common and effective modifications done by a large number of researchers. Finally, the quantitative validations address the SFLA as a robust algorithm employed in various applications which outperforms the other optimization algorithms.", "paper_title": "The role of basic, modified and hybrid shuffled frog leaping algorithm on optimization problems: a review", "paper_id": "WOS:000355934500018"}
