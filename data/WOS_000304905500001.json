More specifically, we introduce the concept of a grouping function, i.e., a specific type of aggregation function that combines two degrees of support (weak preference) into a degree of information or, say, a degree of comparability between two alternatives, and we relate this new concept to that of incomparability. Grouping functions of this type complement the existing concept of overlap functions in a natural way, since the latter can be used to turn two degrees of weak preference into a degree of indifference. We also define the so-called generalized bientropic functions that allow for a unified representation of overlap and grouping functions. Apart from analyzing mathematical properties of these types of functions and exploring relationships between them, we elaborate on their use in fuzzy preference modeling and decision making. We present an algorithm to elaborate on an alternative preference ranking that penalizes those alternatives for which the expert is not sure of his/her preference.", "paper_title": "Grouping, Overlap, and Generalized Bientropic Functions for Fuzzy Modeling of Pairwise Comparisons", "paper_id": "WOS:000304905500001"}
