In this study, we present a three-dimensional cellular automaton model performing the growth simulation of normal and cancerous cells. The necessary nutrient supply is provided by an artificial arterial tree which is generated by constrained constructive optimization. Spatial oxygen diffusion is approximated again by a cellular automaton model. All results could be illustrated dynamically by three-dimensional volume visualization. Because of the chosen modelling approach, an extension of the model to simulate angiogenic processes is possible.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional cellular automaton simulation of tumour growth in inhomogeneous oxygen environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000264510500004"}
