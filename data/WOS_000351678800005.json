Based on social Web data, this study describes the building of an ontology based on fuzzy sets. At the end of a recurring harvesting of folksonomies by Web agents, the aggregated tags are purified, linked, and transformed to a so-called fuzzy grassroots ontology by means of a fuzzy clustering algorithm. This self-updating ontology is used for online reputation analysis, a crucial task of reputation management, with the goal to follow the online conversation going on around an organization to discover and monitor its reputation. In addition, an application of the Fuzzy Online Reputation Analysis ( FORA) framework, lessons learned, and potential extensions are discussed in this article. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
