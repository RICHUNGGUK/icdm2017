Obstacles or holes make many existing protocols suffer from the narrow bottlenecks. So, it is very desirable to have a generic algorithm to recognize the bottleneck sections as a high order geometric feature in the irregular shaped field. In this paper, we propose a distributed and location-unaware algorithm enlightened by an observation of heat conduction to identify the bottlenecks in the field. The robustness and consistency of our algorithm are also tested in harsh configuration of low density in deployment and imperfect boundary recognition.", "paper_title": "Bottleneck Recognition by Virtual Temperature Field in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000306150100002"}
