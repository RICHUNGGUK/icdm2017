To overcome this problem we have devised a primal SVM method with the following properties: (1) it solves for the SVM representation without the need to invoke the representer theorem, (2) forward and backward selections are combined to approach the final globally optimal solution, and (3) a criterion is introduced for identification of support vectors leading to a much reduced support vector set. In addition to introducing this method the paper analyzes the complexity of the algorithm and presents test results on three public benchmark problems and a human activity recognition application. These applications demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
