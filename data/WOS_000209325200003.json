A novel tree in-motion mapping method combining simplicity and speed of computation with low storage and communications requirements is proposed for the management of a network of robotic agents, each possessing limited sensing, processing and communicating operational entities. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed system architecture and mapping method.", "paper_title": "Distributed intelligent sensor agent system for environment mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000209325200003"}
