Several of its members are analyzed and their asymptotic behaviour is revealed, including a member whose model and performance closely follows the one of hardware pipelined processors. This similarity is exposed. An optimizing algorithm is finally proposed and discussed as a general strategy to increase the performance of the base algorithms. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
