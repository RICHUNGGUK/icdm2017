J. Numer Meth. Fluids 1999; 29:289-309), a segregated Petrov-Galerkin/generalized least-squares method, for the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with heat transfer. Such a formulation produces symmetric, positive-definite matrices, allowing the use of a preconditioned conjugate gradient solver for each unknown. The formulation also intrinsically introduces streamline upwinding by the choice of adequate time steps, providing a suitable description of convective dominated flows. The code was primarily written using element-based data structures, making use of parallel/vector techniques and mesh adaptivity. However, schemes based on edge-based data structures have been introduced with the aim of reducing flop count, memory demands and indirect addressing. In this work, the De Sampaio-Coutinho formulation has been re-written considering an edge-based arrangement. The effectiveness of the new scheme was observed solving some standard test cases, as shown in this paper, with a comparatively high gain in computational efficiency.
