The objective is to devise joint routing, power control and transmission scheduling policies in order to gather data in the most efficient manner while respecting the needs of different sensing tasks (fairness). We formulate the problem as maximizing the utility of transmissions subject to explicit fairness constraints and propose an efficient decomposition algorithm drawing upon large-scale decomposition ideas in mathematical programming. We show that our algorithm terminates in a finite number of iterations and produces a policy that is asymptotically optimal at low transmission power levels. Furthermore, we establish that the utility maximization problem we consider can, in principle, be solved in polynomial time. Numerical results show that our policy is near-optimal, even at high power levels, and far superior to the best known heuristics at low power levels. We also demonstrate how to adapt our algorithm to accommodate energy constraints and node failures. The approach we introduce can efficiently determine near-optimal transmission policies for dramatically larger problem instances than an alternative enumeration approach.", "paper_title": "Asymptotically optimal transmission policies for large-scale low-power wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000244410300009"}
