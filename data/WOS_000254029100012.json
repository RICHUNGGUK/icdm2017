Design/methodology/approach - With the systemic yoyo model and its methodology used as the road-map, the traditional calculus-based methods are employed. Findings - From the angle of whole systemic evolution, an astonishing theorem is established, named the Theorem of Never-Perfect Value Systems. It states that, no matter how a value system is introduced and reinforced, the system will never be perfect. Also, it is shown that, when a tender loving parent exists, his selfish child would take advantage of the parent by putting as little effort into his work as possible. Originality/value - With recent development of systems research as the foundation, two brand new insights into household economics were discovered.", "paper_title": "Economic yoyos and never-perfect value systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000254029100012"}
