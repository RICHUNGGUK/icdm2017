The optimization is performed using space mapping and manifold mapping techniques in which a coarse model is used along with the fine model to be optimized. Different coarse models are applied and the results and computation time are compared to gradient based optimization using the full model. It is found that the use of space and manifold mapping reduces the computational cost significantly due to the fact that fewer function evaluations and no fine model gradient information is required.", "paper_title": "Optimization of friction stir welding using space mapping and manifold mapping-an initial study of thermal aspects", "paper_id": "WOS:000264330500005"}
