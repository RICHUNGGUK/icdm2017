The approach to asset pricing based on lambda-fuzzy measures breaks through the traditional \"identical rationality\" assumption, and provides an useful analytical tool for recent researches of behavioral economics and finance.", "paper_title": "The generalization of lambda-fuzzy measures with application to the fuzzy option", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000093"}
