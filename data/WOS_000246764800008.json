The proposed topology features reduced power consumption by exploiting dc current reuse for mixer biasing. Moreover, a new low-consumption control circuit is introduced, which achieves a temperature-stable and linear-in-dB characteristic, providing a 40-dB dynamic range within +/- 1 dB gain error.", "paper_title": "Variable-gain up-converter with current reuse for 5-GHz WLAN applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000246764800008"}
