Since learning process is the main function of fuzzy neural networks, in this study, we focus on review and comparison of the existing learning algorithms, so that the theoretical achievement and the application agenda of each considered algorithm can be clarified from the aspects of computation complexity and accuracy. Two numerical examples of nonlinear mapping of fuzzy numbers and realization of fuzzy IF-THEN rules are used for illustration and analysis.", "paper_title": "Overview of fuzzified neural networks with comparison of learning mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000257848100001"}
