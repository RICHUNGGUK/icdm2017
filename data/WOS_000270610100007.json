The verification proceeds by augmenting the TPN model under analysis with a special TPN, called Alarm-clock, to allow the capture of relevant time events. A forward on-the-fly exploration is then applied on the resulting TPN state class space to verify a timed property. A relaxation operation on state classes is also introduced to further improve performances. Alarm-clock is the same for all properties, whereas the exploration technique is not. Three exploration techniques are presented to cover most interesting TCTL properties. We prove the decidability of our verification technique for bounded TPN models and compare it with the reachability algorithm implemented in the tool UPPAAL [G. Behrmann, J. Bengtsson, A. David, K.G. Larsen, P. Pettersson, W. Yi, Uppaal implementation secrets, in: Proc. of the 7th International Symposium on Formal Techniques in Real-Time and Fault-Tolerant Systems, 2002]. Finally, we give some experimental results to show the efficiency of Our verification technique. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
