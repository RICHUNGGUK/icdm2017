Can we represent these more general structures using points and arrows? We prove this can be done by introducing higher order arrows: the switches. The possibility of expressing the dependency of the future states of the accessibility relation on individual transitions by the use of higher-order relations, that is, coding meta-relational concepts by means of relations, strongly suggests the use of modal languages to reason directly about these structures. We introduce a hybrid modal logic for this purpose and prove its completeness.", "paper_title": "Global view on reactivity: switch graphs and their logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000312272700005"}
