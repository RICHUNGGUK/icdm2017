Here we shall introduce two operations, subtraction and division, derived from the deconvolution for equations using addition and multiplication operations, respectively. In addition, we shall give some conditions to examine the correctness regarding the defined operations. The remarks in this paper can be immediately expressed in terms of interval-valued fuzzy sets.", "paper_title": "Remarks on the subtraction and division operations over intuitionistic fuzzy sets and interval-valued fuzzy sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000255333400006"}
