Despite well-known difficulties in analyzing such systems, they are of significant interest as they can describe a wide range of Internet-based communication protocols. Previous work has shown that the piecewise languages play important roles in the study of FIFO systems. In this paper, we show that FIFO systems composed of piecewise components can in fact be analyzed algorithmically. We demonstrate that any FIFO system composed of piecewise components can be described by a finite state, abridged structure, representing an expressive abstraction of the system. We present a procedure for building the abridged model and prove that this procedure terminates. We show that we can analyze the infinite computations of the more concrete model by analyzing the computations of the finite, abridged model. This enables us to check properties of the FIFO systems including safety properties of the components as well as a general class of end-to-end system properties. Finally, we apply our analysis method to an IP-telecommunication architecture to demonstrate the utility of our approach.", "paper_title": "Piecewise FIFO channels are analyzable", "paper_id": "WOS:000235836700017"}
