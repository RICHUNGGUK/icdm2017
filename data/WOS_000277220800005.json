The result of fuzzy weighted linear combination and fuzzy order weighted averaging approaches are compared with the application of a Dempster-Shafer MCE. We discuss the implications of different approaches in light of decision making associated with suitability in a context where (i) suitability (wildness) may not be very well defined, (ii) the decision makers may not fully understand the informatics aspects associated with applying weights, but (iii) require decisions to be accountable and transparent. In such situations we suggest that the outputs of Dempster-Shafer MCE may be more appropriate than a fully fuzzy model of suitability. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
