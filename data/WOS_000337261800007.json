Objective: This work aims at evaluating the usability of CSRML Tool 2012, thus identifying any possible usability flaw to be solved in the next releases of the application, as well as giving a general overview on how to develop a DSL tool similar to the one evaluated in this work by means of Visual Studio Modelling SDK. Method: In this evaluation, which was reported by following the ISO/IEC 25062:2006 Common Industry Format for usability tests, 28 fourth-course Computer Science students took part. They were asked to carry out a series of modifications to an incomplete CSRML requirements specification. Usability was assessed by measuring the task's completion rate, the elapsed time, number of accesses to the help system of the tool and the instructor's verbal assistance. The participants' arousal and pleasantness were assessed by analyzing both facial expressions and a USE questionnaire. Results: In spite of obtaining high usability levels, the test outcome revealed some usability flaws that should be addressed. Conclusion: The important lessons learnt from this evaluation are also applicable to the success of other usability tests as well as to the development of new CASE tools. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
