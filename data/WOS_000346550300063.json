First, we find knowledge sets in the input space by using estimated density functions. Then, we find the final solution outside knowledge sets. We derived bounds for classification error based OD knowledge sets. We estimate knowledge sets with examples and find the solution by using support vector machines (SVM). We performed tests on various real world data sets, and we achieved similar generalization performance compared to SVM with significantly smaller number of support vectors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
