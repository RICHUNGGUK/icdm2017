This article discusses the application of Petri nets in systems biology. Using an example from biochemistry, concepts for the automatic decomposition of biochemical systems are introduced. The article focuses on those concepts that fulfill steady-state conditions. Interestingly, all the concepts are based on minimal, semi-positive transition invariants. The article describes, which new definitions for network decomposition can be derived and how they can be interpreted in the context of biology. This is illustrated with the example of the citric acid cycle, for which a new metabolic pathway could be predicted with the help of such an analysis.", "paper_title": "Petri nets in systems biology", "paper_id": "WOS:000354094400012"}
