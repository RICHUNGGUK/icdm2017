We show that the existence of a (d + 1)-dimensional Barker array implies the existence of a d-dimensional Barker array with the same number of +/- 1 elements. We deduce that there are no Barker arrays having more than two dimensions, as conjectured by Dymond in 1992.", "paper_title": "There are no Barker arrays having more than two. dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000247208100002"}
