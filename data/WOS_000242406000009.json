This is based on the novel application of control plane separation and semantic-based matching to Content-Based Networks. Here we evaluate the performance issues involved in attempting to perform ontology-based reasoning for content-based routing. This provides us with the motivation to explore peer-clustering techniques to achieve efficient aggregation of semantic queries. The clustering of super-peers using decentralized policy engineering will deliver the incremental deployment of new peer-clustering strategies.", "paper_title": "Towards a managed extensible control plane for knowledge-based networking", "paper_id": "WOS:000242406000009"}
