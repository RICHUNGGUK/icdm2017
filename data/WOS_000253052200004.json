The force control is added by visual feedback that makes the system more responsive and accurate. There are two popular control methods widely used in haptic controller design. First, is impedance control when user motion input is measured, and then, the reaction force is fed back to the operator. The alternative method is admittance control, when forces exerted by user are measured and motion is fed back to the user. Both, impedance and admittance control are also basic ways for interacting with a virtual environment. In this paper, several experiments were performed to evaluate the suitability of force-impedance control for haptic interface development. The difference between conventional application of impedance control in robot motion control and its application in haptic interface development is investigated. Open loop impedance control methodology is implemented for static case and a general-purpose robot under open loop impedance control was developed as a haptic device, while a closed loop model based impedance control was used for haptic controller design in both static and dynamic case. The factors that could affect to the performance of a haptic interface are also investigated experimentally using parametric studies. Experimental results for 1 DOF rotational motion and 2 DOF planar translational motion systems are presented. The results show that the impedance control aided by visual feedback broaden the applicability of the haptic device and makes the system more responsive and accurate.", "paper_title": "Haptic force control based on impedance/admittance control aided by visual feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000253052200004"}
