In the setting of the CESE method, four approaches ire employed: (i) the original CESE method without any additional treatment, (ii) a simple corrector procedure to update the spatial derivatives of magnetic field B after each time marching step to enforce del B-. = 0 at all mesh nodes, (iii) a constraint-transport method by using a special staggered mesh to calculate magnetic field B. and (iv) the projection method by solving a Poisson solver after each time marching step. To demonstrate the capabilities of these methods, two benchmark MHD flows are calculated: (i) a rotated one-dimensional MHD shock tube problem and (ii) a MHD vortex problem. The results show no differences between different approaches and all results compare favorably with previously reported data. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
