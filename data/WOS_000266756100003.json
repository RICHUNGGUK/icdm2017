The program is written in Visual Basic programming language. The program provides an intuitive user interface by linking databases such as tractor specifications, tyre data, implement and trailer specifications and traction equation coefficients to predict the performance of a selected tractor model. The program has been proven to be user friendly and efficient for various field operations under frictional-cohesive soils. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
