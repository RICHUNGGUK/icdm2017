In such applications, user satisfaction, as measured in terms of response time (QoS) and content freshness (QoD), determines their success especially under heavy workload. The novelty of our materialization approach over existing ones is that, it considers the data dependencies between content fragments of a dynamic web page. We introduce two new semantic-based data freshness metrics that capture the content dependencies and propose two materialization algorithms that balance QoS and QoD. In our evaluation, we use a real-world experimental system that resembles an online bookstore and show that our approach outperforms existing QoS-QoD balancing approaches in terms of server-side response time (throughput), data freshness and scalability.", "paper_title": "Performance vs. freshness in web database applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000340684500006"}
