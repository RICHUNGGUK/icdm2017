However, nowadays information systems include more than single interaction, there is a need to explicitly include multi user interaction during the design process of information systems. One of this approaches are workflow systems. Workflow information systems present the view of the organization, while modelling their business process; workflow systems define explicitly the role of each actor during the performance of the different tasks. The introduction of aspects such as: organizational units, agendas, Wok list, user stereotypes and resources, allows the design of more robust systems, especially when all of them are considered during the development of the User Interfaces needed. In this paper, we present a model-driven approach to derive user interfaces of a workflow information system from a series of models. A graphical editor has been developed. It is described and exemplified on a real-world case study for designing the user interfaces of a workflow information system.", "paper_title": "Model-Driven Approach to Design User Interfaces for Workflow Information Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000264754600009"}
