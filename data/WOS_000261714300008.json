Since SVC offers spatial, temporal, and quality combined scalability, extracting proper bitstreams for different viewing devices can be a non-trivial task, and naive choices usually produce poor playback quality. In this paper, we propose a two-prong approach to achieve rate-distortion (R-D) optimal extraction of SVC bitstreams. For SVC encoding, we developed a set of adaptation rules for setting the quantization parameters and the inter-layer dependencies among the SVC coding layers. A well-adapted SVC bitstream thus produced manifests good R-D trade-offs when its scalable layers are extracted along extraction paths consisting of successive refinement steps. For extracting R-D optimized bitstreams for different viewing devices, we formalized the notion of optimal and near-optimal extraction paths and devised computationally efficient strategies to search for the extraction paths. Experiment results demonstrated that our R-D optimized adaptation schemes and extraction strategies offer significant improvement in playback picture quality among heterogeneous viewing devices. Particularly, our adaptation rules promise R-D convexity along optimal extraction paths and permit the use of steepest-descent strategy to discover the optimal/near-optimal paths. This simple search strategy performs only half of the computation necessary for an exhaustive search. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
