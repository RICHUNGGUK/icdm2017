It is an important tool for analyzing information in research areas where there is a huge collection of data. The aim of this study is to determine the various patterns that characterize multidimensional marine environments. In particular, we wish to determine the association patterns, the characterize Taiwan's Dapeng Bay. The processes of association rule (AR) mining and decision tree (DT) analysis are the main methodologies used in this study. We also utilize Weka, a comprehensive suite of Java class libraries for implementing many machine learning algorithms and the Clementine 10.1 software package for data mining analysis. Applications constructed from the AR model and decision tree model can be applied in other scientific domains. This paper describes the data mining process for Dapeng Bay, which is located in the south of Taiwan.", "paper_title": "ASSOCIATION RULE MINING FOR EVALUATION OF REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTS: CASE STUDY OF DAPENG BAY, TAIWAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000281072400008"}
