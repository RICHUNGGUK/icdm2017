Structural equation modeling is adopted in the confirmatory factor analysis to validate the questionnaire data as well as the Web-based test. In designing and developing the new score report, multiple regression analysis is employed to quantitatively analyze the relationship between sub-scale scores and testee use of cognitive regulation. The experiment is then qualitatively complemented by the one-to-one interview. Results indicate that the new score report is more efficient to students' self-regulated learning than the traditional one. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
