In order to obtain a detailed structure of the interface, a solution adaptive method for compressible multi-fluid flows developed by Zheng et al. is employed. Firstly, the method is verified by a planar shock and interface interaction problem, which is compared with the front tracking method for the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability problem. Following the verification, the interaction between a circular shock and a sinusoidally perturbed circular interface in cylinder vessel is firstly investigated in our paper. The results show that the solution adaptive method can be employed to study the compressible multi-fluid cases with relatively complex geometry as well as capturing the fine details of interfacial structures of the interaction.", "paper_title": "INTERACTION OF SHOCK WAVE WITH MULTI-FLUIDS INTERFACE USING QUADRILATERAL-BASED ADAPTIVE MESH", "paper_id": "WOS:000304886400002"}
