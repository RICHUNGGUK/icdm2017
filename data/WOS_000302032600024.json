Compared to PID controller, the tuning of FOPID is more complex and remains a challenge problem. This paper focuses on the design of FOPID controller using chaotic ant swarm (CAS) optimization method. The tuning of FOPID controller is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem, in which the objective function is composed of overshoot, steady-state error, raising time and settling time. CAS algorithm, a newly developed evolutionary algorithm inspired by the chaotic behavior of individual ant and the self-organization of ant swarm, is used as the optimizer to search the best parameters of FOPID controller. The designed CAS-FOPID controller is applied to an automatic regulator voltage (AVR) system. Numerous numerical simulations and comparisons with other FOPID/PID controllers show that the CAS-FOPID controller can not only ensure good control performance with respect to reference input but also improve the system robustness with respect to model uncertainties.
