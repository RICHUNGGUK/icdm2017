Henceforth, its round complexity has been the subject of intense study. The best known unconditionally secure protocol takes 3 rounds in sharing phase, which is known to be optimal, and 1 round in reconstruction. Recently, by introducing a negligible probability of error in the definition of VSS, Patra et al. [CRYPTO 2009] have designed a novel protocol which takes only 2 rounds in sharing phase. However, the drawback of their protocol is that it takes 2 rounds in reconstruction as well. Hence, the total number of rounds required for VSS remains the same. In this paper, we present a VSS protocol which takes a total of 3 rounds only-2 rounds in sharing and 1 round in reconstruction. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
