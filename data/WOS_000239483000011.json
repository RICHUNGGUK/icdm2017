Given that AAM has been also used in tracking the moving object, we thought it could be effective in recognizing the facial expressions of humans. Our results show that the performance of the facial expression recognition using AAM is reliably high when it combined with an enhanced Fisher classification model.", "paper_title": "Facial expression recognition using Active Appearance Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000011"}
