Our type structure reflects a resource sensitive model, where a parallel composition type operator expresses resource independence, a sequential composition type operator expresses resource synchronization, and a type modality expresses resource ownership. We model the intended computational systems using a concurrent object calculus. Soundness of our type system is established using a logical relations technique, building on a interpretation of types as properties expressible in a spatial logic. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
