This technique is applied to the \"PublicSpending.ner initiative to show how the unification of corporate names is the cornerstone to provide a visualization service that can serve policy-makers to detect and prevent upcoming necessities. Furthermore, a research study to evaluate the precision, recall and robustness of the proposed technique is conducted using more than 40 million of names extracted from public procurement datasets (Australia, United States and United Kingdom) and the CrocTail project.
