The novel graphical representation uniquely represents proteins and allows one to easily and quickly visually observe and inspect similarity/dissimilarity between them. It also leads to a novel protein descriptor, a 10-dimensional vector derived from a novel structure matrix S associated with the map. The introduced numerical characterization of proteins is not only useful for their comparative study, but also for cataloguing information on a single protein. The approach is illustrated with the A chain of human insulin and the A chain of human insulin analogue glargine.
