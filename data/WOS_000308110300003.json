Hence, energy conservation and avoidance of frequent re-construction of broadcast paths are crucial to ensure robust and uninterrupted service of multimedia broadcasting applications. This paper introduces a class of distributed broadcast algorithms based on variations of Relative Neighborhood Graphs (RNG). In contrast to the original RNG-based algorithms, the proposed algorithms consider the remaining battery energy of nodes and the distance between nodes as criteria for determining the relative neighborhood of a node. This approach is intended to boost the resiliency of the broadcast path by avoiding the choice of nodes with low remaining battery capacity as rebroadcast nodes. Extensive simulations are conducted, demonstrating that the proposed algorithms improve over the original RNG in several aspects, including the reduction of broadcast storms, longer path lifetime, and shorter broadcast latency.", "paper_title": "Revisiting relative neighborhood graph-based broadcasting algorithms for multimedia ad hoc wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000308110300003"}
