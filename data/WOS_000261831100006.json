Scherer's component process model provides predictions regarding particular face muscle deformations that are attributed as reactions to the cognitive appraisal stimuli in the study of emotion episodes. In the current work, MPEG-4 facial animation parameters are used in order to evaluate these theoretical predictions for intermediate and final expressions of a given emotion episode. We manipulate parameters such as intensity and temporal evolution of synthesized facial expressions. In emotion episodes originating from identical stimuli, by varying the cognitive appraisals of the stimuli and mapping them to different expression intensities and timings, various behavioral patterns can be generated and thus different agent character profiles can be defined. The results of the synthesis process are consequently applied to Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs), aiming to render their interaction with humans, or other ECAs, more affective.", "paper_title": "Towards modeling embodied conversational agent character profiles using appraisal theory predictions in expression synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000261831100006"}
