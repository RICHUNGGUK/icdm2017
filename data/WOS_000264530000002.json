Previous studies have investigated the possible role of place cells as building blocks for 'cognitive maps' representing place, distance and direction. Studies also show, however, that when animals are restrained, the spatial selectivity of place cells is partially or completely lost. This suggests that the role of place cells in spatial cognition depends not only on the place cells themselves, but also on representations of the animal's physical interactions with its environment. This hypothesis is tested in a population of evolved robots. The results suggest that successful place cognition requires not only the ability to process spatial information, but also the ability to select the environmental stimuli to which the agent is exposed. If this is so, theories of active perception can make a useful contribution to explaining the role of place cells in spatial cognition.", "paper_title": "Place cognition and active perception: a study with evolved robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000264530000002"}
