In this paper, a multiagent system, namely, the global learning scheme for BI, is proposed to perform a data-brain driven process planning. Utilizing the obtained three types of mining workflows, a three-step analytical process can be carried out for multiaspect brain data analysis. The proposed work presents a practical approach toward the data-brain driven systematic brain data analysis. A scenario is provided to demonstrate the significance and usefulness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Toward the Data-Brain Driven Systematic Brain Data Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000317613400020"}
