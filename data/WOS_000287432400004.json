More specifically, an application of regularization techniques to a ID cohesive model is proposed. The standard \"triangle\" damageable elastic model, which is often used in finite element codes to describe fracture of brittle materials, was chosen. Results associated with the load-unload cycle showed that ANM is convenient for numerically taking this specific irregular behavior into account. Moreover, the present paper also shows that the chosen damageable interface model can be introduced in the generalized standard material formalism, thus unabling us to define a complete energy balance associated with the damage process. In such a framework, the damage state is described by a new displacement variable. Finally, a 1D finite element application to a simple elastic damageable structure is shown to highlight the potential of this approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
