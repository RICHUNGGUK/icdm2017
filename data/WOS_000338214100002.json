In this paper, a novel ant system with multiple tasks is modeled for jointly estimating the number of cells and individual states in cell image sequences. In our ant system, in addition to pure cooperative mechanism used in traditional ant colony optimization algorithm, we model and investigate another two types of ant working modes, namely, dual competitive mode and interactive mode with cooperation and competition to evaluate the tracking performance on spatially adjacent cells. For adjacent ant colonies, dual competitive mode encourages ant colonies with different tasks to work independently, whereas the interactive mode introduces a trade-off between cooperation and competition. In simulations of real cell image sequences, the multi-tasking ant system integrated with interactive mode yielded better tracking results than systems adopting pure cooperation or dual competition alone, both of which cause tracking failures by under-estimating and over-estimating the number of cells, respectively. Furthermore, the results suggest that our algorithm can automatically and accurately track numerous cells in various scenarios, and is competitive with state-of-the-art multi-cell tracking methods.", "paper_title": "Modeling analysis of ant system with multiple tasks and its application to spatially adjacent cell state estimate", "paper_id": "WOS:000338214100002"}
