Several such cage isomers of C7N5H11, created by modifying the most stable N-12 cage, were examined by performing theoretical calculations to evaluate their suitability as potential HEDMs. Calculations were carried out with density functional theory and Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) using the basis sets 6-31+G(d,p) and cc-pvdz. The relative thermodynamic stabilities of the isomers were explored in two ways: (1) the thermodynamic stability of one isomer was compared to that of another isomer based on their relative energies; (2) the kinetic stabilities of the isomers were determined by calculating the corresponding bond-breaking energies.", "paper_title": "Comparative theoretical investigation of the structures, energetics, and stabilities of C(7)N(5)H(11)cages", "paper_id": "WOS:000351477800015"}
