Although this kind of rules can't be strong in the final rule set, they can decide the developing trend of the rule. Experiment with the UCI datasets shows that our algorithm can efficiently discover this kind of rules which are very useful for decision, including criminal symptom analysis and terrorism forecasting.", "paper_title": "Mining the acceleration-like association rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800085"}
