However, in the context of peer review methodology, there is no previous work about adaptation of the process according to the student's profile. In this paper, a methodology for adaptive peer review is introduced. Experimental application of adaptive peer review through two courses allows to confirm pedagogical benefits with actual students' results.", "paper_title": "Adaptive peer review based on student profiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100099"}
