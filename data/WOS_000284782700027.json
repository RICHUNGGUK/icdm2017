A control approach based on the so-called sliding mode control (SMC) that is both efficient and suitable is used for power generation control and harmonic-current compensation. The WECS then behaves as an active power filter (APF). The method aims at improving the overall efficiency, dynamic performance and robustness of the wind power generation system. Simulation results obtained on a 20-kW, 380-V, 50-Hz DFIG confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Variable Structure Control of DFIG for Wind Power Generation and Harmonic Current Mitigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000284782700027"}
