These demi-matroids are proven to determine important properties of the chain, and it is shown that linear code chain duality is represented by demi-matroid duality in a natural and yet surprising way. Profiles are defined for arbitrary demi-matroids and thus for linear code chains, which generalizes previous results in the literature and provides simple and transparent proofs thereof.
