The growth in the leakage power consumption of servers along with its exponential dependence on the ever increasing process variation in nanometer technologies has made it inevitable to move toward variation-aware power reduction strategies in data centers. In this paper, we address the problem of joint server placement and chassis consolidation to minimize power consumption of high-performance computing data centers under process variation. To this end, we introduce two variation-aware server placement heuristics as well as an integer linear programming (ILP)-based server placement method to find the best location of each server in the data center based on its power consumption and the data center heat recirculation model. We then incorporate a novel ILP-based variation-aware chassis consolidation technique to find the optimum task assignment solution under the obtained server placement approach to minimize total power consumption. Experimental results show that by applying the proposed joint variation-aware server placement and chassis consolidation techniques, up to 14.6 % improvement can be obtained at common data center utilization rates compared to state-of-the-art variation-unaware approaches.", "paper_title": "Power reduction in HPC data centers: a joint server placement and chassis consolidation approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000344552400028"}
