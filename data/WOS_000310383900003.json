We express the coherence problem for (symmetric) monoidal categories as an asphericity problem for a track category and use rewriting methods on polygraphs to solve it. The setting is extended to more general coherence problems, viewed as 3-dimensional word problems in a track category, including the case of braided monoidal categories.", "paper_title": "Coherence in monoidal track categories", "paper_id": "WOS:000310383900003"}
