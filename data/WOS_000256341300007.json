The atomic system is treated as a truss-type structure. The interatomic forces between the hydrogen-iron and the iron-iron atoms are defined by Morse and modified Morse potential functions, respectively. Two-dimensional hexagonal and 3D bcc crystal structures were subjected to tensile numerical tests. It was shown that the Inverse Broyden's Algorithm-a quasi-Newton method-provides a computationally efficient technique for modeling of the hydrogen-assisted cracking in iron crystal. Simulation results demonstrate that atoms of hydrogen placed near the crack tip produce a strong deformation and crack propagation effect in iron lattice, leading to a decrease in the residual strength of numerically tested samples.", "paper_title": "Modeling of hydrogen-assisted cracking in iron crystal using a quasi-Newton method", "paper_id": "WOS:000256341300007"}
