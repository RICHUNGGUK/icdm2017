When making evaluations based on inputs from multiple criteria, sources or experts, the resulting output can be seen as the value which best represents the individual contributions. However it may also be desirable to know the extent to which the inputs agree. Does the representative value reflect a universal opinion? Or has there been a high degree of tradeoff? We consider the properties relating to such consensus measures and propose two general models built component-wise from aggregation functions and fuzzy implications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
