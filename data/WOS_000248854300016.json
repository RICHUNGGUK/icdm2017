The \"nonlinear\" spectrum of the associated Lax pair reveals topological properties of the NLS phase space that are difficult to assess by other means. In this paper we use the invariance of the nonlinear spectrum to examine the long time behavior of exponential and multisymplectic integrators as compared with the most commonly used split step approach. The initial condition used is a perturbation of the unstable plane wave solution, which is difficult to numerically resolve. Our findings indicate that the exponential integrators from the viewpoint of efficiency and speed have an edge over split step, while a lower order multisymplectic is not as accurate and too slow to compete.
