However, this kind of mapping schemes has high resolution latency because each lookup needs to contact several servers in sequence, typically O(log n) hops (n is the number of peers in the system), which is practically impossible practical for the Internet. In this paper, we present a one-hop DHT-based identifier-to-locator mapping service, called OH-MAP, which is able to achieve the maximal performance of the system with reasonable maintenance traffic overhead even for huge and dynamic networks. We design a fast and efficient event (such as peers join or leave the system) notification algorithm to maintain the complete network topology with the acceptable bandwidth usage, so that peers can map identifiers to locators using the accurate routing tables. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in terms of effectiveness and feasibility. The analysis and simulation results show that even for very large systems the scheme has good scalability and low resolution delay.", "paper_title": "OH-MAP: Using DHT to Map Identifiers onto Locators in One Hop", "paper_id": "WOS:000295869700013"}
