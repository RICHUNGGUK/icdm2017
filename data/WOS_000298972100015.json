In this paper, a novel supervised segmentation evaluation scheme is proposed that is designed by combining segment area and boundary information. Using the evaluation metric, a ranking of the popular segmentation algorithms is carried out. A comparative analysis with existing supervised metrics that are commonly used for grading segmentation schemes is performed. Experimental results indicate that the performance of the proposed measure is promising. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
