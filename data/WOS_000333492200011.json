We discuss some of the (dis)advantages of the most widely used performance metrics and conclude that is difficult to assess the external validity of performance using some of these measures. Moreover, there remain many questions as to the real-world applicability of these empirical models. In the first part of this study we design novel stock price prediction models, based on state-of-the-art text-mining techniques to assert whether we can predict the movement of stock prices more accurately by including indicators of irrationality. Along with this, we discuss which metrics are most appropriate for which scenarios in order to evaluate the models. Finally, we discuss how to gain insight into text-mining-based stock price prediction models in order to evaluate, validate and refine the models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
