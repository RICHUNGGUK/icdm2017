In particular we analyze the residua from the process of methane emissions from wetlands in the sedge-grass marsh, in South Bohemia, Czech Republic. Relation to entropy and a specific version of Kullback-Leibler divergence will be given. A graphical tool to assess the amount of entropy in the system is developed and illustrated on real data from the sedge-grass marsh methane emission. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
