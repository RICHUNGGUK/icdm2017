However, complex behavioral and social problems often exhibit strong couplings and heterogeneity between values, attributes and objects (i.e., non-IIDness). This fundamentally challenges the IIDness-based learning methodologies and techniques. This paper presents a high-level overview of the needs, challenges and opportunities of non-IIDness learning for handling complex behavioral and social problems. By reviewing the nature and issues of classic IIDness-based algorithms in frequent pattern mining, clustering and classification to complex behavioral and social applications, concepts, structures, frameworks and exemplar techniques are discussed for non-IIDness learning. Case studies, related work and prospects of non-IIDness learning are presented. Non-IIDness learning is also a fundamental issue in big data analytics.", "paper_title": "Non-IIDness Learning in Behavioral and Social Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000342922700007"}
