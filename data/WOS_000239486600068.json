To have such a framework, it is essential to find optimized solutions, especially for the various physics-based tasks, which is the main bottleneck in the simulation. In this paper, we discuss various technical advancements and achievements that have been made in formulating key techniques to handle the different challenging issues involved in simulation of hair at interactive rates. Effort has been put in all the three modules of the hair simulation-hair shape modeling, hair dynamics and hair rendering.", "paper_title": "Optimized framework for real time hair simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600068"}
