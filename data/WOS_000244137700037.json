To exclude the influence of pose on face recognition, a multi-route detection module is adopted, with parallel processing technology to speed the authentication process. Parallel processing technology is used to speed the authentication process. Fusion of face and fingerprint by support vector machine (SVM) which introduced a new normalization method improved the authentication accuracy. A new concept of optimal two-dimensional face is proposed to improve the performance of the dynamic face authentication system. Experiments on a real database showed that the proposed system achieved better results compared with face-only or fingerprint-only system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
