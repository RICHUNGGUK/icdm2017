Exponential stability of stochastic memristor-based recurrent neural networks with time-varying delays is studied and some sufficient conditions in terms of inequalities are derived. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stability criteria. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
