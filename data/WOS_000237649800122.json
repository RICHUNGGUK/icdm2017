More recently partial replication has been proposed as an hybrid strategy. This paper shows a quantitative justification to advantages achieved by using this approach in terms of storage capacity usage and reliability. Our analytical study proves that partial replication offers much higher storage capacity than full replication and that its reliability is much higher than full distribution reaching to levels equivalent to those provided by full replication.", "paper_title": "A quantitative justification to partial replication of web contents", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800122"}
