Design/methodology/approach - FE equations for electromagnetic fields are examined, in particular nodal elements using scalar potential formulation and edge elements for vector potential formulation. Findings - It is shown how the equations usually obtained via variational approach may be more conveniently derived using integral methods, employing a geometrical description of the interpolating functions of edge and facet elements. Moreover, the resultant equations describe the equivalent multi-branch circuit models. Originality/value - The approach proposed in the paper explores the analogy of the FE formulation to loop or nodal magnetic or electric networks and has been shown to be very beneficial in teaching, especially to students well familiar with circuit methods. The presented methods are also helpful when formulating classical network models. Finally, for the first time, the geometrical forms of edge and facet element functions have been demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Geometric formulation of edge and nodal finite element equations in electromagnetics", "paper_id": "WOS:000311269800004"}
