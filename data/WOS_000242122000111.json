The R&D groups in global now have paid attention to integrate RFID with mobile phone devices as well as to associate with the existing mobile telecommunication network. Such a converged technology and services would lead to make new markets and research challenges. However, privacy threats on RFID tags embedded into products has become stumbling block. Therefore, this paper propose a new security technique for mobile RFID service, which can be support to secure RFID service and uses the privacy protection in mobile RFID network services.", "paper_title": "Security techniques based on EPC gen2 tag for secure mobile RFID network services", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000111"}
