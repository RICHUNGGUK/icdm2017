Pseudo software achieves this aim by serving as a mediating instrument to empower stakeholders to participate in requirements elicitation and validation through model construction and manipulation, and to provide guidance to the development team to correctly interpret the requirements in the downstream development activities. Pseudo software obtains its traits as a mediating instrument through the choice of requirements information bits and the use of multimodal representations with tool support to integrate the requirements. Using historical data of fifty projects in the enterprise computing domain, pseudo software is shown to effectively cut the requirements-related errors committed by both the customer and the development team.
