For such systems to remain effective, the profiles need to be able to adapt and reflect the users' changing behaviour. In this paper, we introduce a set of methods designed to capture and track user interests and maintain dynamic user profiles within a personalisation system. User interests are represented as ontological concepts which are constructed by mapping web pages visited by a user to a reference ontology and are subsequently used to learn short-term and long-term interests. A multi-agent system facilitates and coordinates the capture, storage, management and adaptation of user interests. We propose a search system that utilises our dynamic user profile to provide a personalised search experience. We present a series of experiments that show how our system can effectively model a dynamic user profile and is capable of learning and adapting to different user browsing behaviours.
