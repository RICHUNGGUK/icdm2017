In the same way that the World Wide Web needs a web browser to load and display web pages, the World-Wide Sensor Web needs a sensor web browser to access distributed and heterogeneous sensor networks. However, most existing sensor web browsers are just mashups of sensor locations and base maps that do not consider the scalability issues regarding transmitting large amounts of sensor readings over the Internet. While caching is an effective solution for alleviating the latency and bandwidth problems, a method for efficiently loading sensor data(1) from sensor web servers is currently missing. Therefore, we present LOST-Tree as a sensor data loading component that also manages the client-side cache on a sensor web browser. By applying LOST-Tree, redundant transmissions are avoided, enabling efficient loading with cached sensor data. We demonstrate that LOST-Tree is lightweight and scalable, in terms of sensor data volume. We implemented LOST-Tree in the GeoCENS sensor web browser for evaluation with a real sensor web dataset.", "paper_title": "LOST-Tree: a spatio-temporal structure for efficient sensor data loading in a sensor web browser", "paper_id": "WOS:000319497900008"}
