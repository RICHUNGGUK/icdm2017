The smallest number k for which a graph G can have a 2nd-order conditional k-coloring is the 2nd-order conditional chromatic number, denoted by X-d (G). in this paper, we investigate the 2nd-order conditional 3-colorings of claw-free graphs. First, we prove that it is NP-complete to determine if a claw-free graph with maximum degree 3 is 2nd-order conditionally 3-colorable. Second, by forbidding a kind of subgraphs, we find a reasonable subclass of claw-free graphs with maximum degree 3, for which the 2nd-order conditionally 3-colorable problem can be solved in linear time. Third, we give a linear time algorithm to recognize this subclass of graphs, and a linear time algorithm to determine whether it is 2nd-order conditionally 3-colorable. We also give a linear time algorithm to color the graphs in the subclass by 3 colors. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
