Researchers have worked from decades on this topic, as witnessed by the scientific literature. However, document image analysis is the special case in image analysis as their spatial properties are different from natural images. Therefore, the main focus of this paper is to describe image denoising issues in general and document image issues in particular. Since the field of document processing is relatively new, it is also dynamic, so current methods have room for improvement and innovations are still being made. Several algorithms proposed in the literature are described. Critical discussions are reported about the current status of the field and open problems are highlighted. It is also demonstrated that, there are rarely definitive techniques for all cases of a certain problem. We surveyed the state of art, analyzed recent trends and tried to identify challenges for future research in this field.", "paper_title": "Document image analysis: issues, comparison of methods and remaining problems (Retracted article.
