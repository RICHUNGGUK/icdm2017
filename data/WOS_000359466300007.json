With the development of tissue sectioning and medical imaging techniques, microscope renal biopsy image sequences are consequently obtained for computer-aided diagnosis. This paper proposes a new context-based segmentation algorithm for acquired image sequence, in which an improved genetic algorithm (GA) patching method is developed to segment different size target. To guarantee the correctness of first image segmentation and facilitate the use of context information, a boundary fusion operation and a simplified scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)-based registration are presented respectively. The experimental results show the proposed segmentation algorithm is effective and accurate for renal biopsy image sequence.", "paper_title": "Context-Based Segmentation of Renal Corpuscle from Microscope Renal Biopsy Image Sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466300007"}
