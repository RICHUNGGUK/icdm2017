First, the linguistic values are modeled as generalized fuzzy numbers, which is more efficient in dealing with uncertain information and representing experts' opinions than normal fuzzy numbers due to the fact that the degree of confidence of decision makers' opinions is taken into consideration. In addition, compared with existing methods, the result of the proposed method is more reasonable because it can correctly determine the degree of similarity between the assessment and the linguistic terms. A numerical example is used to show that the proposed method can provide a useful way to handle subjective mental workload assessments in a linguistic manner.", "paper_title": "Subjective Mental Workload Assessment Based on Generalized Fuzzy Numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000291462800002"}
