The switched systems consist of stable and unstable subsystems. Based on the average dwell time method, some switching signals will be found to guarantee exponential stability of these systems. The explicit state decay estimation is also given in the form of the solutions of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). An example relating to networked control systems (NCSs) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Stability of linear discrete switched systems with delays based on average dwell time method", "paper_id": "WOS:000278159000011"}
