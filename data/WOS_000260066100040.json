In neural networks, information can be coded by characteristics of the timing of each neuronal firing, including the order of firing or the relative phase differences of firing. We derive the learning rule for this network and show that the network consisting of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with the dynamical synaptic kinetics can learn the appropriate timing of each neuronal firing. We also investigate the system size dependence of learning efficiency. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
