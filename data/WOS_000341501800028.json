After reviewing the classical definition of intelligence and its levels, this paper provides a new approach to help increase the responsiveness of management and control to changes and disturbances in the manufacturing supply chain. The ancient concept of the \"Tertium Quid\" has inspired a three-level community of agents (MAS-TRIO) that is proposed to improve the coordination of all actors involved. The proposed model combines Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) to make possible a certain level of Autonomous Intelligence in the decision-taking process. This paper analyses how these levels of intelligence can be applied to management and control, and the performance of the proposed model has been tested at low and mid-levels on an experimental platform representing the facilities of a distribution centre controlled by a network of programmable logic controllers (PLCs).", "paper_title": "Application of the classical levels of intelligence to structuring the control system in an automated distribution centre", "paper_id": "WOS:000341501800028"}
