In the proposed structure 1, we suggest a hierarchical structure composed of 8 and 16 tap sub-correlators instead of ordinary 128 tap correlators. In the proposed structure 2, we suggest a structure which uses quantized coefficients and simplified multipliers. Results of simulations indicates that the hardware complexities of proposed structures are reduced to about 54% and 31% with minor performance loss, compared with a conventional method.", "paper_title": "New structures of packet/frame synchronizer for MB-OFDM UWB", "paper_id": "WOS:000236290000026"}
