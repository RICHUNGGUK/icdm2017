We studied the properties of BoNT/A at various temperatures and pH values in order to understand its toxicity and structure variations. The pH values of the environment of BoNT/A are obtained by changing the protonation states of certain titratable residue groups. Our results show that certain parts of the protein are active at acidic pH environments or at high temperatures. The protein is more stable in neutral environments at normal human body temperature, whereas, at high temperature, the protein is more stable in acidic environments. Also, the three domains of the protein tend to have relative motion rather than within individual domains.", "paper_title": "Long-time molecular dynamics simulations of botulinum biotoxin type-A at different pH values and temperatures", "paper_id": "WOS:000246098500002"}
