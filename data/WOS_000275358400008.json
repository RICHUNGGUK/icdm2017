The introduction of Internet-based Web 2.0 applications for scientists and engineers is currently changing the way research is being done. In the near future, participants in the research community will be able to share ideas, data and results on a whole new level. They will also be able to manage the rapidly increasing amount of scientific information much more effectively than today through collaborative efforts enabled by the new Internet tools. However, a necessary premise for such a development is the availability of research material. Many research results are currently well protected behind expensive subscription schemes that impede the free sharing of information. At the same time, an increasing amount of research is being published through open access channels with unrestricted availability. Interestingly, recent studies show that such policies contribute to an increased number of citations compared to the pay-based alternatives. In sum, the parallel development of new tools for research collaboration and an increased access to research material may help spur a revolution in the way research is being done.", "paper_title": "Trends in Research and Publication: Science 2.0 and Open Access", "paper_id": "WOS:000275358400008"}
