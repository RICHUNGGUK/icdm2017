This result is actually an instance of a more general result covering canonical graph decompositions like the modular decomposition and the Tutte decomposition of 2-connected graphs into 3-connected components. As an application, we prove that the set of graphs having the same cycle matroid as a given 2-connected graph can be defined from this graph by Monadic Second-Order formulas.", "paper_title": "THE MONADIC SECOND-ORDER LOGIC OF GRAPHS XVI: CANONICAL GRAPH DECOMPOSITIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000209479400002"}
