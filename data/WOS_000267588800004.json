Topology Control (TC) is a well-known energy saving technique which tries to assign transmission ranges of nodes to optimize their energy utilization while keeping the network connected. In current TC schemes, the transmission range of each node is mostly accounted as the exclusive estimator for its energy consumption, while ignoring the amount of data it forwards. Especially when such schemes are coupled with the popular shortest path routing, they usually create a highly-loaded area at the center of the network in which nodes deplete their battery very quickly. In this paper, we introduce efficient strategies that take both load and range into account to handle this problem. We first consider the simple strategy in which a proper transmission range is computed for all nodes of the network to optimize their energy utilization under the presence of the shortest path routing. Inspiring from the results of this strategy, we then propose our combined strategy and argue that a combination of circular paths and shortest paths could result in a much better solution. We also provide detailed analytical models to measure the forwarding load and interference of nodes and then corroborate them with simulation results. Using the combined strategy, the achieved improvement in terms of traffic load, interference, and maximum energy consumption is about 50%, as compared with the simple strategy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
