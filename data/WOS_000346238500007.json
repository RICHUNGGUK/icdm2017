The dexterous hand has 5-fingers with 6-DOFs and each finger is equipped with a small harmonic drive gear and a fine high-power mini actuator. To achieve the goal of grasping with high accuracy, each fingertip is covered with the tactile array sensors for determination of the force between the finger and the grasped object. Some preliminary experiments are conducted to illustrate the performance of the grasping of the developed dexterous hand.", "paper_title": "Development of multi-fingered dexterous hand for grasping manipulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000346238500007"}
