In the proposed WNN, the nonlinear activation function is a linear combination of wavelets, that can be updated during the networks training process. As a result the approximate error is significantly decreased. The BP algorithm and the QR decomposition based training method for the proposed WNN is derived. The obtained results indicate that this new type of WNN exhibits excellent learning ability compared to the conventional ones.", "paper_title": "Wavelets based neural network for function approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000012"}
