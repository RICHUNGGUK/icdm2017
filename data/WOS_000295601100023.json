Their closed-form expressions of diversity multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) are derived, respectively. From the results, DDF always outperforms SDF in terms of DMT, achieves DMT gain over nonorthogonal amplify-and-forward (NAP) in low spectral efficiency scenarios, but is inferior to NAF in high spectral efficiency scenarios.", "paper_title": "On the Achievable Diversity Multiplexing Tradeoff for Dynamic and Static DF in the Two-Way Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000295601100023"}
