The system performs all sensing and computations on-board, making the system independent of any base station or remote control. High level navigation, computer vision and control tasks are carried out in an external processing unit that steers the vehicle to a desired location. We experimentally demonstrate the properties and capabilities of three systems to autonomously following several trajectory patterns, visually estimate its position and detecting and following a person and evaluate the performance of the systems.", "paper_title": "Framework for Autonomous On-board Navigation with the AR.Drone", "paper_id": "WOS:000329629400028"}
