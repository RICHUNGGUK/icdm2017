The requirements of a well-defined data model for IoT involve in six aspects: semantic supporting, active data extracting and explaining, flexibility and extensibility, enabling to manage massive and heterogeneous data, supporting formal organization, and solid mathematic-based theory. This paper aims to exploring an extensible and active semantic information organization model for IoT to meet the above requirements, and the primary idea is \"Object-cored organizing data, event-based explaining data, and knowledge-based using data.\" The proposed model involves two layers: the object layer and the event layer, and both of them are discussed in detail including conceptions, schema definitions, and the rule-based knowledge representation. Semantic reasoning can be supported by the knowledge base which involves in a set of reasoning rules on semantic relations among objects or among events correspondingly.", "paper_title": "An extensible and active semantic model of information organizing for the Internet of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000344812200004"}
