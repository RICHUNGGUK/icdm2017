Most of all, the SDN technique can be used in several areas because it is one of the software technology. However, the SDN technology is applied partially in the cloud computing until now because it is corresponded well with the cloud computing concepts and applications. Although these are very natural and common instances so far, the problem is very narrow the applying scope of SDN. Due to the fact that cooperative intelligent transportation system (C-ITS) has many variable features, it is very suitable for applying SDN technique. So, we propose the new information exchange architecture, which is based on the SDN technology, for CITS. The proposed architecture has improved the throughput than the legacy systems and can be adjusted the traffic flow based on the necessity. The proposed information exchange architecture can be transmitted data, which can be handled various information like as the road traffic flows, tracking the car, based on the interworking data forwarding scheme. Based on these schemes, the proposed architecture outperforms than the legacy systems in several aspects, and we have verified these results through the computer simulations using the OPNet.", "paper_title": "Information exchange architecture based on software defined networking for cooperative intelligent transportation systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000354412400025"}
