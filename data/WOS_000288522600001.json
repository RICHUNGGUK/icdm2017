The all digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) system has been successfully used for decades in order to track the carrier phase of a frequency modulation (FM) signal. In tins paper, we combine the ADPLL and the all-digital amplitude-locked loop (ADALL) system structure for modulation,signals of the separation co-channel transmission system. It is demonstrated co-channel separation signals from FM system with the results of simulation experiments. The least mean square (LMS) theory is introduced more efficiently to eliminate the noise interference and to separate the multi-channel signals. This paper is also shown and demonstrated the multi-channel signal in FM system which is combined the ADPLL and the ADALL algorithms with an adaptive finite impulse response (FIR) filter. The multi-channel transmission with the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) interference has been solved by using the proposed algorithm. The demodulated signals are operated and demodulated by the LMS algorithm. The separation signals of the multi-channel can be obtained the prefect performance and process for high speed and low cost. The proposed system of this paper is the virtue and advantage to implement the communication security field. In general words, it can be substituted and replaced the encryption (or decryption) system.", "paper_title": "THE IMPROVEMENT OF ALL-DIGITAL AMPLITUDE-LOCKED LOOP SEPARATION ANALYSIS COMBINED MIMO SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000288522600001"}
