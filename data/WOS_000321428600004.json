Borrowing the idea from Church-Turing Thesis, we introduce C-calculus as a minimal interaction model. We give model independent characterization for asynchronous bisimulation equivalence which is generalized to subbisimilarity used as the criteria for Interaction Completeness of interaction models. We present an encoding from C-calculus to asynchronous pi-calculus and prove that it satisfies the subbisimilarity statements.", "paper_title": "FROM COMPUTING TO INTERACTION: ON THE EXPRESSIVENESS OF ASYNCHRONOUS PI-CALCULUS", "paper_id": "WOS:000321428600004"}
