Rooted in the theories of technology-organization alignment and strategy maps, this article develops a framework for successful implementation of eRx systems. The proposed strategy map outlines the key strategic processes that would make implementation of eRx systems not only feasible and successful, but also a profitable venture for healthcare organizations.", "paper_title": "Successful Implementation of eRx Systems: Creating Technology-Organization Alignment using the Strategy-Map Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000334943500003"}
