Each turn is usually divided into segments and these segments are labelled with dialogue acts (DAs). A DA is a representation of the functional role of the segment. Each segment is labelled with one DA, representing its role in the ongoing discourse. The sequence of DAs given a dialogue turn is used by the dialogue manager to understand the turn. Probabilistic models that perform DA labelling can be used on segmented or unsegmented turns. The last option is more likely for a practical dialogue system, but it provides poorer results. In that case, a hypothesis for the number of segments can be provided to improve the results. We propose some methods to estimate the probability of the number of segments based on the transcription of the turn. The new labelling model includes the estimation of the probability of the number of segments in the turn. We tested this new approach with two different dialogue corpora: SWITCHBOARD and DIHANA. The results show that this inclusion significantly improves the labelling accuracy.", "paper_title": "Estimating the number of segments for improving dialogue act labelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000307465900002"}
