In our approach the ultrasonic radiofrequency (RF) signal is considered as a sequence affected by Intersymbol Interference (ISI) and AWG noise. In order to reduce the computational cost, the estimation is performed with a reduced-state Viterbi algorithm. The channel effect is estimated in two different ways: either measuring the transducer response with an experimental setting or with blind homomorphic techniques. We observed an enhancement in image quality with respect to different metrics. Extensive tests were made to estimate the quantization alphabet that gives the best performances.
