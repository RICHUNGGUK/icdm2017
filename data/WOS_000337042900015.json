This requires simultaneous scheduling of both forward and reverse flows of goods over a supply chain network. This paper studies time dependent vehicle routing problems with simultaneous pickup and delivery (TD-VRPSPD). We formulate this problem as a mixed integer programming model, where the time step function is used to calculate the travel time. To efficiently solve this complex problem, we develop a hybrid algorithm that integrates both Ant Colony System (ACS) and Tabu Search (TS) algorithms. Our algorithm uses the pheromones, travel time and vehicle residual loading capacity as a factor structure according to the characteristics of TD-VRPSPD. In our computational experiments, 56 groups of benchmark instances are used to evaluate the performance of our hybrid algorithm. In addition, we compare the performance of our hybrid algorithm with those of individual ACS and TS algorithms. The computational results suggest that our hybrid algorithm outperform stand-alone ACS and the TS algorithms.", "paper_title": "Integrated Ant Colony and Tabu Search approach for time dependent vehicle routing problems with simultaneous pickup and delivery", "paper_id": "WOS:000337042900015"}
