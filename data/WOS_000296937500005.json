Design/methodology/approach - The authors employ SCI to propose a mechanism for simultaneously checking the authenticity and degrees of similarity between different information objects, and present an empirical investigation of the method. A management scenario for the control of the authentication process and the detection of the degree of violation of documents is proposed. Findings - Such a mechanism could be adopted as a component of libraries' strategy for the protection of the copyrights for documents published on the web. Practical implications - The use of the proposed numeric code can be utilised efficiently as a constituent part of the digital object identifier (DOI) system, making its computation more efficient and meaningful. Originality/value - The identifier proposed in the paper can result in a more efficient index for identifying and retrieving objects in a digital library, as well as online repositories and commercial applications that can handle information retrieval requests more effectively.", "paper_title": "Towards text copyright detection using metadata in web applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000296937500005"}
