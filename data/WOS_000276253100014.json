After the demonstration of the good accuracy and effectiveness of the developed schemes, a flow over three equal circular cylinders arranged in equilateral-triangle arrangement is numerically investigated on unstructured mesh systems. The examined Reynolds number is 100 and the flow is supposed to be laminar. Computations by the developed algorithm are then performed for six gap spacings, s, ranging from 0.5 to 4.0, and for three incidence angles, alpha = 0 degrees, 3 degrees and 6 degrees. Numerical results show that, at sufficiently small and large s, the range of which is different for different alpha, the flow interference is dominated by proximity and wake effect, respectively. And in the intermediate range of the spacing, the flow pattern is influenced by both of them. The mean force results are compared with the existing experimental measurements and that shows a similar trend in the variation of mean force with the spacing for different Reynolds number. It is also observed that the interference effect transitions plays an important role in the variation of the fluctuating forces and Strouhal number. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
