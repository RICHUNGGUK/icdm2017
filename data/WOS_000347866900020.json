The scale parameter of Erlang distribution and consequently the reliability of each component are imprecise in terms of interval data, and only the lower and upper bounds are known. This problem, for the first time, is formulated through Min-Max regret criterion, which is commonly used to define robust solutions. The resulting problem formulation contains an unlimited number of constraints, and a Benders' decomposition method is implemented to deal with the given problem. This method is compared with an enumeration method to show its effectiveness. The performance of the proposed model using the Benders' decomposition method is examined over different problem sizes, and the associated results are analyzed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
