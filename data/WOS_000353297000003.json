Given the specific requirement specified by a certain user, normally, a composition (or chain) of OWSs, rather than a single OWS, can fulfill this requirement. Consequently, retrieving and recommending sub-chains of possible service invocations is an important research challenge. Leveraging the semantic similarity between the name and text description of parameters, a degree that represents the invocation possibility between operations in OWSs is calculated. Thereafter, a service network model is constructed for capturing possible invocations between operations. Given a user's requirement which is represented in terms of a pair of initial and ending operations, possible sub-chains of operations are retrieved, ranked and recommended. Based on which the user can select the most appropriate sub-chain with respect to her specific requirement. The result of evaluation leveraging a real OWSs set indicates that our technique is applicable in real applications from both the functional and performance perspectives.", "paper_title": "A Sub-Chain Ranking and Recommendation Mechanism for Facilitating Geospatial Web Service Composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000353297000003"}
