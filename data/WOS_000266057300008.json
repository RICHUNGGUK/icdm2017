The convergence at the network-technology level was achieved by using the Internet protocol (IP), and therefore both integrated systems have to provide IP connectivity. To enable communication between the HASS and the IP-based services, we have implemented the WebService/Konnex gateway. The IPTVSS are IP based: therefore. an easy convergence at the network-technology level is possible. The convergence at the user-interface level was achieved by a hardware and software user-interface implementation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
