In this study, several neural and neurofuzzy models with different learning algorithms are examined for prediction of several benchmark chaotic systems and time series. The prediction performance of locally linear neurofuzzy models with recently developed Locally Linear Model Tree (LoLiMoT) learning algorithm is compared with that of Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network with Orthogonal Least Squares (OLS) learning algorithm, MultiLayer Perceptron neural network with error back-propagation learning algorithm, and Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference System. Particularly, cross validation techniques based on the evaluation of error indices on multiple validation sets is utilized to optimize the number of neurons and to prevent over fitting in the incremental learning algorithms. To make a fair comparison between neural and neurofuzzy models, they are compared at their best structure based on their prediction accuracy, generalization, and computational complexity. The experiments are basically designed to analyze the generalization capability and accuracy of the learning techniques when dealing with limited number of training samples from deterministic chaotic time series, but the effect of noise on the performance of the techniques is also considered. Various chaotic systems and time series including Lorenz system, Mackey-Glass chaotic equation, Henon map, AE geomagnetic activity index, and sunspot numbers are examined as case studies. The obtained results indicate the superior performance of incremental learning algorithms and their respective networks, such as, OLS for RBF network and LoLiMoT for locally linear neurofuzzy model.", "paper_title": "Predicting chaotic time series using neural and neurofuzzy models: A comparative study", "paper_id": "WOS:000241750900003"}
