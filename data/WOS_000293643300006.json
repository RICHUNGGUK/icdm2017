Another bound of order type for the minimum distance of general linear codes, and for codes from order domains in particular, was given in [1]. Here we investigate in detail the application of that bound to one-point algebraic geometry codes, obtaining a bound d* for the minimum distance of these codes. We establish a connection between d* and the order bound and its generalizations. We also study the improved code constructions based on d*. Finally we extend d* to all generalized Hamming weights.", "paper_title": "ON THE ORDER BOUNDS FOR ONE-POINT AG CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000293643300006"}
