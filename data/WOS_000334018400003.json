However, the evolving behaviour of Smart Phone users is somewhat tempered by concerns over M-Payments. If Smart Phones are to reach their full M-Commerce potential, the ability of consumers to transact and pay for products/services through these devices in an easy, safe and reliable manner must be addressed. In response, this paper contributes a theoretical model and empirically tests the model to explore Irish consumers' perceptions of using Smart Phones to make M-Payments for products/services. The findings present conclusive evidence that trust is the most powerful factor influencing consumers' willingness to use Smart Phones to make M-Payments. While perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use influence the payment decision, their impact is much lower. Mobile self-efficacy and personal innovativeness have almost no direct impact. The paper concludes that irrespective of individuals' high levels of personal innovativeness or mobile self-efficacy and irrespective of whether Smart Mobile Media Services are perceived as useful and easy to use, consumers will not make M-Payments, until they are convinced that Smart Phone M-Payment systems are safe and reliable.", "paper_title": "Realising M-Payments: modelling consumers' willingness to M-pay using Smart Phones", "paper_id": "WOS:000334018400003"}
