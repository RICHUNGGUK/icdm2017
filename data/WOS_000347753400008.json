This model is a single-hidden-layer neural network (SLN) where the input layer represents the antenna( lobe (AL). The remaining layers are in the MBs that are formed by the Kenyon cell (I(C) layer and the output neurons that are responsible for odor learning. The binary code obtained for each odorant in the output layer by unsupervised learning was used to measure the classification error. this classification error allows us to identify the neural variability paradigm that achieves a better odor classification. The neural variability is provided by the neural threshold of activation. We compare two hypotheses: a unique threshold for all the neurons in the MB layer, which leads to no variability (homogeneity), and different thresholds for each MB layer (heterogeneity). The results show that when there is threshold variability, odor classification performance improves. Neural variability induces populations of neurons that are specialists and generalists. Specialist neurons respond to fewer stimulus than the generalists. The proper combination of these two neuron types leads to performance improvement in the bioinspired classifier.
