This method is based on vector forms of block-pulse functions. By using this approach, solving the linear Fredholm integral equation reduces to solve a linear system of algebraic equations. The advantages of the proposed method are low cost of setting up the equations without applying any projection method such as collocation, Galerkin, etc., setting up a linear system of algebraic equations of appropriate condition number, and good accuracy. Test problems are provided to illustrate its accuracy and computational efficiency, and some practical one- and two-dimensional scatterers are analyzed by it. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
