However, many installations still use the broken WEP protocol or even run with no security settings enabled. Furthermore, several threats are only partially addressed by the new security standards, e.g. rogue access points or denial of service. Specialised wireless intrusion detection systems are promising means to protect wireless networks against these threats. They can further improve the reliability and security of these networks. In our contribution we present such a wireless IDS to reveal common attacks on wireless LAN. We describe the development and evaluation of our prototype solution that seamlessly integrates with approaches for traditional wired networks.", "paper_title": "A sophisticated solution for revealing attacks on wireless LAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000241622700023"}
