In the proposed work visual localization, detection and classification of non-stationary power signals are achieved using hyperbolic S-transform known as HS-transform and automatic pattern recognition is carried out using GA based Fuzzy C-means algorithm. Time-frequency analysis and feature extraction from the non-stationary power signals are done by HS-transform. Various non-stationary power signal waveforms are processed through HS-transform with hyperbolic window to generate time-frequency contours for extracting relevant features for pattern classification. The extracted features are clustered using Fuzzy C-means algorithm and finally the algorithm is optimized using genetic algorithm to re. ne the cluster centers. The average classification accuracy of the disturbances is 93.25% and 95.75% using Fuzzy C-means and genetic based Fuzzy C-means algorithm, respectively. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
