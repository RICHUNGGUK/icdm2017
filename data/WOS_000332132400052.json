The mean square exponential stability is investigated for such kind of neural networks. In terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, a delay-dependent stability criterion is derived for the considered neural networks via a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. An example with simulation results is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical result. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
