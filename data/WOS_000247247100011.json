The iMouse system integrates WSN technologies into surveillance technologies to support intelligent mobile surveillance services. The authors suggest several ways to improve or extend iMouse. One option is to facilitate mobile sensor navigation by, for example, integrating localization schemes to guide mobile sensors instead of using color tapes. A second option is to exploit coordination among mobile sensors, especially when they're on the road.", "paper_title": "iMouse: An integrated mobile surveillance and wireless sensor system", "paper_id": "WOS:000247247100011"}
