The extant optimization models for product family design assume that the known information for modeling can be determined precisely. However, many collected information for product design are prone to be imprecise due to the inherent uncertainty of human knowledge and expression. For example, when human experts estimate market demand of a product, imprecise information may be involved and influence the results of optimization. In this research, an optimization model with maximizing imprecise part-worth utility function is established for product family design problem. A linear programming embedded genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the proposed fuzzy optimization model. An industrial case of printing calculator product is used to illustrate the proposed approach. Experiments and sensitivity analysis based on the case study are also performed to analyze the relationship among the parameters and to explore the characteristics of the optimization model.", "paper_title": "Linear programming embedded genetic algorithm for product family design optimization with maximizing imprecise part-worth utility function", "paper_id": "WOS:000345534100004"}
