A full exploration of the MR-MC wireless network capacity incurs challenging cooperative networking issues including transmission cooperation, resource allocation cooperation, and cross-layer protocol cooperation. In this article, rather than focus on protocol designs for specific cooperative networking issues, we present a generic theoretical framework that could guide the protocol or algorithm development to approach the maximum network capacity. Based on our multidimensional conflict graph (MDCG) tool, we could achieve a cross-layer linear programming framework to study the optimal cooperative networking in two complementary aspects: optimal network dimensioning and throughput-optimal control. While certain NP-hard computing issues hindered the MR-MC network optimization for a long time, the MDCG-based framework can readily generate simple polynomial and distributed algorithms with guaranteed capacity region.", "paper_title": "A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR OPTIMAL COOPERATIVE NETWORKING IN MULTIRADIO MULTICHANNEL WIRELESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000303393200011"}
