Substitution with -NF2, -CH2NF2, -CF2NF2, or -C(NO2)(2)NF2 groups increased the densities of the salts. The densities of the tetrazole-based salts are affected not only by different substituents but also by different cations. The -CN or -N-3 groups are effective substituents for increasing the HOFs of the salts. The triaminoguanidinium cation is more effective than the ammonium cation for increasing the HOF of the tetrazole-based salts. Substitution with -NO2, -NF2, or -C(NO2)(2)NF2 groups enhances the explosive properties of the salts. The thermodynamics of formation of the salts reveal that all of the tetrazole-based salts with the triaminoguanidinium or ammonium cation could be synthesized using the proposed reactions. Our calculated methods provide a straightforward and inexpensive route for screening a large number of potentially energetic ionic salts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
