Our study shows that these requirements are matched by CONTsys on a general level. However, certain attributes are not explicit in CONTsys, for example agents responsible for performing planned interventions, and support for monitoring outcome of interventions. We further studied how the care plan conceptual model can be implemented using the openEHR reference model. The study demonstrates the feasibility of developing shared care plans combining a standard concept model, for example CONTsys with an electronic health records (EHR) interoperability specification, that is the openEHR, while highlighting areas that need further exploration. It also explores the reusability of existing clinical archetypes as building blocks of care plans and the modeling of new shared care plan archetypes.", "paper_title": "Modeling shared care plans using CONTsys and openEHR to support shared homecare of the elderly", "paper_id": "WOS:000289218000011"}
