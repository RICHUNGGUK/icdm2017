Mobile users are eager to get their interested and reliable services quickly. A considerable number of research works have been dedicated to service recommendation based on users' preferences and locations. In this paper, we study the credibility of recommended services, and propose a set of composite measures on how to provide more reliable services. We further propose the trustworthy Skyline of LBS recommendation in terms of the trust degree based on the newly introduced composite measures to achieve more credibility to provide recommendation services. Experimental results show that our method can recommend desired and trusted services to users.", "paper_title": "Recommendation of location-based services based on composite measures of trust degree", "paper_id": "WOS:000342454300011"}
