In this paper, we will show that it is possible to compensate the error in CLT, thereby correcting the resultant probability density function, particularly in the tail regions. We will provide a detailed mathematical analysis to quantify the error in CLT. This provides a design space with more than four degrees of freedom to build a variety of GRN generators (GRNGs). A framework utilizes this design space to generate customized hardware architectures. We will demonstrate designs of five different architectures of GRNGs, which vary in terms of consumed memory, logic slices, and multipliers on field-programmable gate array. Similarly, depending upon application, these architectures exhibit statistical accuracy from low (4 sigma) to extremely high (12 sigma). A comparison with previously published designs clearly indicate advantages of this methodology in terms of both consumed hardware resources and accuracy. We will also provide synthesis results of same designs in application-specific integrated circuit using 65-nm standard cell library. Finally, we will highlight some shortcomings associated with such architectures followed by their remedies.", "paper_title": "Revisiting Central Limit Theorem: Accurate Gaussian Random Number Generation in VLSI", "paper_id": "WOS:000355212000005"}
