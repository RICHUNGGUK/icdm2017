A q-Gaussian function is chosen as the radial basis function of the RBF neural network, and a particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to select the parameters of the network. The non-extensive entropic index q is encoded in the particle and adjusted adaptively in the evolutionary process of population. Simulation results of the function approximation indicate that an RBF neural network based on q-Gaussian function achieves the best generalization performance.", "paper_title": "RBF neural network based on q-Gaussian function in function approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000297646300001"}
