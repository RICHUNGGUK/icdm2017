This was achieved in the context of neural network training, and has allowed for a unified treatment of both second-order circular and noncircular signals, that is, both those with rotation invariant and rotation-dependent distributions. In this paper, we revisit the augmented complex KF, augmented complex extended KF, and augmented complex unscented KF in a more general context, and analyze their performances for different degrees of noncircularity of input and the state and measurement noises. For rigor, a theoretical bound for the performance advantage of widely linear KFs over their strictly linear counterparts is provided. The analysis also addresses the duality with bivariate real-valued KFs, together with several issues of implementation. Simulations using both synthetic and real world proper and improper signals support the analysis.", "paper_title": "Class of Widely Linear Complex Kalman Filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000303507000008"}
