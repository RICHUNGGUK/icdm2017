A new model of network-based control with simultaneous consideration of network-induced delays and packet dropouts is proposed. By using a fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF), we derive a less conservative delay-dependent stability condition for the closed-loop NCSs. Robust H-infinity fuzzy controller is developed for the asymptotical stabilisation of the NCSs. Since it is not expressed as strict LMI conditions, the cone complementary linearisation procedure is exploited to solve the nonconvex feasibility problem. A numerical example shows the feasibility applications of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "Robust H-infinity networked control for discrete-time fuzzy systems with state quantisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000309720900007"}
