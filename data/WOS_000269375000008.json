The method uses an Eulerian approach, and is based on an upwind method to compute the temporally evolving base state and a flux vector splitting method for the perturbations. The method is applicable to either gas dynamics or magnetohydrodynamics. Numerical examples are presented for cases in which a hydrodynamic shock interacts with a single or double density interface, and a doubly shocked single density interface. Convergence tests show that the method is spatially second-order accurate for smooth flows, and between first and second-order accurate for flows with shocks. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
