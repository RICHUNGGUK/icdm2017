The importance of targets, along with the timeliness of completing their tasks determines how effective a system is performing. Through simulation, this paper examines a system with multiple UAVs assigned to respond to fixed-location, multiple-priority targets. Dispatching rules and loitering strategies are implemented to insure rapid service for high-priority targets and effective management of medium-priority levels. The design of a study is discussed, for multiple dispatching rules and loitering strategy combinations under varying conditions of: region size, on-scene service rate, arrival rate, and target priority. The decision policy with the think-ahead and distance-based dispatching rules created the greatest benefit, when implemented with the loitering policy based on arrival location probabilities with continual consideration of busy UAV's future availability.", "paper_title": "Dispatching and loitering policies for unmanned aerial vehicles under dynamically arriving multiple priority targets", "paper_id": "WOS:000330683400002"}
