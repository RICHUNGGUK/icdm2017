Organizations share their user and group data with each other through a common communication protocol using XML-RPC. Arranging users into groups and roles makes it easier to grant or deny permissions to many users at once. We argue that our model may be used across organizations, based on the group structure and independent collaborative administration and because it provides a high level of flexibility and usability.", "paper_title": "Sharing protected web resources using distributed role-based modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000047"}
