In the context of image processing and its simplest form, CVT-based algorithms reduce to the well-known k-means clustering and are easy to implement. In this paper, we develop an edge-weighted centroidal Voronoi tessellation (EWCVT) model for image segmentation and propose some efficient algorithms for its construction. Our EWCVT model can overcome some deficiencies possessed by the basic CVT model; in particular, the new model appropriately combines the image intensity information together with the length of cluster boundaries, and can handle very sophisticated situations. We demonstrate through extensive examples the efficiency, effectiveness, robustness, and flexibility of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "An Edge-Weighted Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation Model for Image Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000268033300013"}
