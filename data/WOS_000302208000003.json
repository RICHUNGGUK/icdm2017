The governing equations of motion and boundary conditions are derived in an arc coordinate system. Unlike previous studies based on von Karman nonlinearity or considering mid-plane stretching only, the present study does not involve any assumptions on nonlinear deformation. Differential quadrature method and Petzold-Gear BDF method are employed to obtain the nonlinear electro-dynamic behavior of curved micro-beams. The effects of nonlinear deformation, initial gap and initial rise on the nonlinear electrodynamic characteristics are studied. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
