Our method is based on the following motivation: if the available exemplar texture is used as a priority to upsample the synthesized texture, a high resolution result that prevents image blurring can be obtained. Our multi-scale joint bilateral upsampling applies a spatial filter on each multi-scale layer of the synthesized texture, and jointly applies a similar range filter on exemplar texture, which guides the interpolation from low to high resolution, by magnifying and combining the upsampled information; the details of the upsampled texture are progressively enhanced, and the image blurring artifacts can be effectively avoided. We offer an accelerated joint bilateral filter, which enables our upsampling method to interactively generate a large texture. In addition, we propose a detail-aware texture optimization approach that incorporates image detail in texture optimization to improve the quality of the synthesized texture, on which the multi-scale joint bilateral filter works to generate a more convincing result. We show results for upsampling image and video textures and compare them to traditional upsampling methods, by this demonstrating that with low computational and memory costs, our method achieves better results.", "paper_title": "Fast multi-scale joint bilateral texture upsampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000276746600004"}
