The proposed nonlinear adaptive controller is designed using sliding mode control (SMC) technique based on the system nonlinear model. The latter accounts for the boost converter large-signal dynamics as well as for the fuel-cell nonlinear characteristics. The adaptive nonlinear controller involves online estimation of the DC bus impedance 'seen' by the converter. The control objective is threefold: (i) asymptotic stability of the closed loop system, (ii) output voltage regulation under bus impedance uncertainties and (iii) equal current sharing between modules. It is formally shown, using theoretical analysis and simulations, that the developed adaptive controller actually meets its control objectives. (c) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
