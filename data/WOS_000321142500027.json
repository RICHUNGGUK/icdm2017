Techniques for automated detection and classification of microorganisms can be a great help in preventing outbreaks and maintaining the safety of the nation's food supply. Identification and classification of foodborne pathogens using colony scatter patterns is a promising new label-free technique that utilizes image-analysis and machine-learning tools. However, the feature-extraction tools employed for this approach are computationally complex, and choosing the right combination of scatter-related features requires extensive testing with different feature combinations. In this study, we used computer clusters to speed up the feature-extraction process, which enables us to analyze the contribution of different scatter-based features to the overall classification accuracy. A set of 1000 scatter patterns representing ten different bacterial strains was used. Zernike and Chebyshev moments as well as Haralick texture features were computed from the available light-scatter patterns. The most promising features were first selected using Fisher's discriminant analysis, and subsequently a support-vector-machine classifier with a linear kernel was used. With extensive testing, we were able to identify a small subset of features that produced the desired results in terms of classification accuracy and execution speed. The use of distributed computing for scatter-pattern analysis, feature extraction, and selection provides a feasible mechanism for large-scale deployment of a light scatter-based approach to bacterial classification.", "paper_title": "Classification of Bacterial Contamination Using Image Processing and Distributed Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000321142500027"}
