We propose a novel approach where these two features are managed in an integrated mechanism with mode assignment embedded in scheduling. The problem is first reformulated as a special single-mode task scheduling problem, and then is modeled as a graph interval T-coloring. Finally, a tabu-like metaheuristic is proposed for this latter graph coloring problem, and the performance of our approach is compared to known multi-mode scheduling heuristics.", "paper_title": "A new approach for scheduling independent tasks with multiple modes", "paper_id": "WOS:000267222800001"}
