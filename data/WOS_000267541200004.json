This central theoretical condition also has striking algorithmic consequences: in the case of two sets, one of which satisfies a further regularity condition (convexity or smoothness, for example), we prove that von Neumann's method of \"alternating projections\" converges locally to a point in the intersection, at a linear rate associated with a modulus of regularity. As a consequence, in the case of several arbitrary closed sets having linearly regular intersection at some point, the method of \"averaged projections\" converges locally at a linear rate to a point in the intersection. Inexact versions of both algorithms also converge linearly.", "paper_title": "Local Linear Convergence for Alternating and Averaged Nonconvex Projections", "paper_id": "WOS:000267541200004"}
