Under this secrecy criterion, using the Renyi entropy of order 1 + s for s is an element of [0, 1] we derive a new upper bound of Eve's distinguishability under the application of the universal(2) hash functions. It is also shown that this bound gives the tight exponential rate of decrease in the case of independent and identical distributions. The result is applied to the wiretap channel model and to secret key generation (distillation) by public discussion.", "paper_title": "Tight Exponential Analysis of Universally Composable Privacy Amplification and Its Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000325981100048"}
