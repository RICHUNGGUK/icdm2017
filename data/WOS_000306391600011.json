The emulator accurately reproduces both static and dynamic fuel cell behaviors, and its main features are the estimation of the oxygen excess ratio and its ability to safely interact with electrical loads such as switching converters. Consequently, the proposed emulator can be used to design and test devices prior to their connection to real fuel cells, preventing undesired phenomena. The emulator was adjusted to the Ballard NEXA 1.2 kW fuel cell, obtaining a satisfactory experimental validation. Finally, the emulator was used to design a hardware-in-the-loop test system to analyze the oxygen starvation effect generated by a DC/DC power converter. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
