The construction is finally applied to develop a one-way function whose security lies on the combinatorial properties of the expander graph. It is shown that while the forward transformation of the one-way function is computationally efficient the inverse operation appears to be intractable. Such a one-way function can be an ideal candidate for one-way functions and thus help to develop fast and secure key establishment protocols.", "paper_title": "Generation of expander graphs using cellular automata and its applications to cryptography", "paper_id": "WOS:000241484300072"}
