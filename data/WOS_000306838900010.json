The author presents a network function of ideal fractance and decomposes it in continued fractions (CFs) form to obtain the corresponding analog fractance approximation circuit. The new circuit consists of ordinary passive RC component through network synthesis method. Simulations are performed for the verification of the new circuit. Experimental evidence has proved that the performance of novel -1/2(n) order analog fractance approximation circuit is good in both amplitude-frequency response and phase-frequency response.", "paper_title": "DESIGN OF-1/2(n) ORDER ANALOG FRACTANCE APPROXIMATION CIRCUIT USING CONTINUED FRACTIONS DECOMPOSITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000306838900010"}
