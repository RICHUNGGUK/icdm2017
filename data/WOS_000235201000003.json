For example, a program in Prolog can reason about a program written in Smalltalk. Reflection is a more powerful form of meta programming where the same language is used to reason about, and act upon, itself in a causally connected way. Thus on the one hand we have meta programming that allows different languages or paradigms to be used, but without causal connection, while on the other hand we have reflection that offers causal connection but only for a single language. This paper combines both and presents inter-language reflection that allows one language to reason about and change in a causally connected way another language and vice versa. The fundamental aspects of inter-language reflection and the language symbiosis used therein, are discussed. Moreover the implementation of two symbiotic reflective languages is discussed: Agora/Java and SOUL/Smalltalk. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
