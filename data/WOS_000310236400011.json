Cognitive radios are solutions proposed to address the problem of using the spectrum efficiently. Regulatory bodies around the world, FCC included, have introduced specifications intended for cognitive radio applications. TV White Space devices, which operate in the spectrum holes caused by transition from analog to digital transmission, were the first targeted applications for cognitive radio specifications (IEEE 802.22, ECMA-392). However, to maximize the potential of the idea of cognitive radios it is desirable to be able to sense the spectrum across a wide band and accordingly transmit 'smartly'. This paper presents a possible transceiver architecture meant for integrated solutions while providing tentative block level specifications for the proposed architecture. Existing spectrum sensing techniques are discussed and an integrated low power system architecture at the PHY level suitable for waveform-based spectrum sensing technique that utilizes co-operative spectrum sensing methods is proposed.", "paper_title": "An integrated low power system architecture for spectrum sensing enabled cognitive radios", "paper_id": "WOS:000310236400011"}
