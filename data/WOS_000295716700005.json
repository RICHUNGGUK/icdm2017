Inclusion of size effects is considered in the analysis by incorporating Eringen's nonlocal elasticity continuum into the classical Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. To include the surrounding elastic medium, the Pasternak elastic foundation model is utilized, including shear deformation of the elastic medium. A high-order compact finite difference method (CFDM) is employed for sixth-order discretization of the nonlocal beam model to obtain the fundamental frequencies of nanobeams corresponding to three commonly used boundary conditions, namely simply supported-simply supported, clamped-clamped, and clamped-free. Numerical results are presented to indicate the accuracy of the method based on the sixth-order discretization for predicting the vibrational response of embedded nanobeams subject to various boundary conditions.
