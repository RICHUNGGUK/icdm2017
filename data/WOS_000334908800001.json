The instrument in this study consists of 13 items across 3 factors and serves as a reliable, valid, and useful measure for assessing older adults' information technology ability. In total, 396 usable responses are obtained from 231 male and 165 female participants, where the average age was 71.66. Drawing on some of the key factors that influence older adults' information technology ability, this article offers a new perspective on this multifaceted topic. The results provide evidence of the dimensionality, reliability, and validity of older adults' abilities in terms of information technology.", "paper_title": "Assessing Older Adults' Information Technology Ability: The Development of a Multiple Item Scale", "paper_id": "WOS:000334908800001"}
