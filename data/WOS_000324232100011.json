Such a problem arises from numerous applications and is known to be NP-hard. In this paper we focus on a special scenario of the StQP where all the elements of the data matrix Q are independently identically distributed and follow a certain distribution such as uniform or exponential distribution. We show that the probability that such a random StQP has a global optimal solution with k nonzero elements decays exponentially in k. Numerical evaluation of our theoretical finding is discussed as well.", "paper_title": "Sparse solutions to random standard quadratic optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000324232100011"}
