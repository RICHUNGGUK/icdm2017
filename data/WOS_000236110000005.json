The current study introduces a feature extraction technique, independent component analysis. to the method to remove the correlations and dependencies between descriptors and reduce the dimension prior to similarity and dissimilarity calculations. in addition, a goal attainment multi-objective optimisation technique is used for the determination of the fuzzy membership function parameters. For three mixtures, which include a new mixture and two previously studied mixtures that all inhibit reproduction (via different mechanisms of action) in green freshwater algae scenedesmus vacuolatus, the approach showed better or equivalent prediction performance than either concentration addition or independent action models. Unlike QSARs for pure compounds that require large collections of data, the new approach for mixtures only requires one mixture at a particular composition to determine the necessary fuzzy membership function parameter values. These values can then be used to predict the toxicity of the mixture at any other compositions. This could potentially lead to a reduction in the frequency of bioassay tests. Use of the fuzzy membership functions and parameter Values obtained for one mixture when used to predict the toxicity of a completely different mixture is also tested and it is found that the approach also gives prediction results with good accuracy.", "paper_title": "QSAR approach for mixture toxicity prediction using independent latent descriptors and fuzzy membership functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000236110000005"}
