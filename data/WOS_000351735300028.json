A novel control entity, called an inter-domain communication control and management element (ICCME), is introduced into the architecture to achieve flexible distributed interdomain control and centralized intra-domain management by integrating with \"proactive\" and \"reactive\" stateful capabilities. Inter-domain routing and signaling are completed with the collaboration of multiple ICCMEs in a peer-to-peer manner, which decentralizes highly intensive computation and signaling to multiple ICCMEs. In addition, we put forward a unified inter-domain communication protocol to eliminate the differences in private signaling message formats of various vendors' domains. We report a successful field trial of providing inter-domain connections across a commercial three-domain three-vendor optical transport network. Also, experimental results indicate that ICCME-based architecture performs better than previous schemes in terms of scalability, i.e., low average routing load of control entities and low average delay in establishing interdomain connections, but results in higher message overhead and blocking probability.", "paper_title": "Intelligent Inter-domain Connection Provisioning for Multi-domain Multi-vendor Optical Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351735300028"}
