These data are then used for three-dimensional estimation of AHF occurrence and nuclear labeling index analysis. These are important parameters for quantitative studies of carcinogenesis, for screening and classifying carcinogens, and for risk estimation. To take such measurements, structures or cells of interest should be separated from the other components based on the difference of color and density. Common background problems seen on the captured sample image such as uneven light illumination or color shading can cause severe problems in the measurement. Two application programs (BK-Correction and Pixel-Separator) have been developed to solve these problems. With BK-Correction, common background problems such as incorrect color temperature setting, color shading, and uneven light illumination background, can be corrected. with Pixel-Separator different types of objects can be separated from each other in relation to their color, such as seen with different colors in immunohistochemically stained slides. The resultant images of such objects separated from other components are then ready for particle analysis. Objects that have the same darkness but different colors can be accurately differentiated in a grayscale image analysis system after application of these programs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
