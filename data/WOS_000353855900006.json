We consider an unmixing problem in which a mixture is represented by a point in R-n, and the sources are represented by subsets of R-n. We argue that the proportional contribution of a source of interest to that mixture can naturally be estimated by an interval estimator, as opposed to a more traditional point estimator. An interval estimator is proposed and it is shown that this estimator can be computed efficiently in a variety of cases by solving an optimization problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
