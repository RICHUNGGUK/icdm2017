In this paper we summary the ways to generate virtual sample using facial symmetry, and investigate the three strategies of using facial symmetric information in the Null Space LDA (NLDA) framework. The results of our experiments indicate that, the use of facial symmetric information can further improve the recognition accuracy of conventional NLDA.", "paper_title": "Improvement on null space LDA for face recognition: A symmetry consideration", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300011"}
