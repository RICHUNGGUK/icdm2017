Our architecture mainly pretends to enhance the performance of TCP handovers in 802.11 networks. VSPLIT includes a cross-layer TCP protocol, called VSPLIT-TCP, that adapts the congestion control during the handover, learning the new characteristics of the network after the handover using the mechanisms provided by the IEEE 802.21 Media Independent Handover (MIH) services. VSPLIT has been implemented and tested in the NS-3 simulator. We include the some of the most interesting performance evaluation results, which show a good performance of our proposal for the intended scenario.", "paper_title": "VSPLIT: A Cross-Layer Architecture for V2I TCP Services Over 802.11", "paper_id": "WOS:000328203300007"}
