The number of captured situations in the environment and quantity and variety of devices in the system produce considerable amounts of data, which should be processed, understood and followed by corresponding actions. However, fully delivered to the user regardless of their role in the system and needs, data flows cause cognitive overload and thus may compromise the safety of the system depending on the timely response of the operators. This paper addresses the problem of selective information delivery with respect to the user's role in the system, his needs and responsibilities, by proposing context-aware information management middleware. The system utilizes Semantic Web technologies by capturing relevant information in the knowledge model of the system, which decouples data from the application logics. A clear division of data and application logics enables context-awareness and facilitates the reconfiguration process, when new information should be added into the system. The chosen approach is justified with an analysis of main trends in context-aware solutions. The engineering principles of the knowledge model are described and illustrated with simple scenarios from the building automation domain. The prototype developed proves the feasibility of the approach via performance evaluation and demonstrates the reconfiguration capabilities of information flows in the system. Further work assumes the extension of the knowledge model and integration of the system with adaptive human-machine interfaces for multi-role and multi-user environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
