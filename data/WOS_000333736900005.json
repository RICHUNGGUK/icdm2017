To shed light on this unknown information, we asked 100 network operators about their routing policies, billing models, and thoughts on routing security. This short paper reports the survey's results and discusses their implications.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Interdomain Routing Policies", "paper_id": "WOS:000333736900005"}
