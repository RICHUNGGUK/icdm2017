The delays can be drawn from several distributions and the reaction rates from complex functions or from physical parameters. SGNSim can generate ensembles of GRNs, within a set of user-defined parameters, such as topology. It can also be used to model specific GRNs and systems of chemical reactions. Perturbations, e.g. gene deletion, over-expression, copy and mutation, can be modeled as well. As examples, we present a model of a toggle switch without cooperative binding subject to perturbations, a system of reactions within a compartmentalized environment where membrane crossing is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism and a simulation based on the yeast transcriptional network.", "paper_title": "SGN Sim, a stochastic genetic networks simulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000245511800020"}
