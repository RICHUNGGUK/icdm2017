The core idea of CDR is \"physical embodiment\" that enables information structuring through interactions with the environment, including other agents. The idea is shaped based on the hypothesized development model of human cognitive functions from body representation to social behavior. Along with the model, studies of CDR and related works are introduced, and discussion on the model and future issues are argued.", "paper_title": "Cognitive Developmental Robotics: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000208067800002"}
