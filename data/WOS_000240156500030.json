Our analysis takes the view of discrete signal statistical analyzing and is based on the specific process research of mesh PICA. Then we present a corrected method to improve mesh PCA effects. Such corrected method comes from the fact that the principal axes directions of 3D surface should be those in which the vertex distances are the longest among all 3D vertex distances. Corresponding experimental results on range scan data and synthetic models are provided. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
