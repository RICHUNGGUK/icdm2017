The encoder uses a shape adaptive data partitioning scheme to alleviate the effect of error propagation. An input mesh surface is coarsely divided into smooth and detailed regions, and each region is further divided into partitions of similar sizes. Then, those partitions are progressively compressed and their joint boundaries are compressed using the boundary edge collapse rule. At the decoder, the boundary edge collapse rule facilitates the seamless assembly of the partitions. When no data is available for a partition due to transmission errors, we employ a concealment scheme based on the projection onto convex sets (POCS) theory. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reconstructs 3-D mesh surfaces faithfully even in severe error prone environments.", "paper_title": "Error resilient 3-D mesh compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000241052400001"}
