A generalized grid-based overset framework is presented for the simulation of this class of problems. The equations that govern the fluid flows are cast in an integral form and are solved using a cell-centered finite volume upwind scheme. The rigid body dynamics equations are formulated using quaternion and are solved using fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK) time integration. The overset framework and the six degree of freedom (6-DOF) rigid body dynamics simulators are developed in a library form for easy incorporation into existing flow solvers. The details of the flow solver, the 6-DOF library, and the overset framework are presented in this paper along with the validation results of the developed system. (C) 2008 IMACS.
