The design of the protocol is motivated by the observation that different types of messages exchanged between sensor nodes have different security requirements, and that a single keying mechanism is not suitable for meeting these different security requirements. LEAP+ supports the establishment of four types of keys for each sensor node: an individual key shared with the base station, a pairwise key shared with another sensor node, a cluster key shared with multiple neighboring nodes, and a global key shared by all the nodes in the network. LEAP+ also supports (weak) local source authentication without precluding in-network processing. Our performance analysis shows that LEAP+ is very efficient in terms of computational, communication, and storage costs. We analyze the security of LEAP+ under various attack models and show that LEAP+ is very effective in defending against many sophisticated attacks, such as HELLO flood attacks, node cloning attacks, and wormhole attacks. A prototype implementation of LEAP+ on a sensor network testbed is also described.", "paper_title": "LEAP plus: Efficient Security Mechanisms for Large-Scale Distributed Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000205013100003"}
