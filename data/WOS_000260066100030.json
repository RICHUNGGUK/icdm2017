The classical approaches to option pricing include the Black-Scholes pricing formula and the binomial pricing model. These techniques, however, employ complex and rigid statistical formulations that are not easily comprehensible to novice investors. More recently, non-parametric and computational methods of option valuation that are able to construct a model of the pricing formula from historical data have been proposed in the literature. However, most of these models functioned as black-boxes and may not be able to efficiently and accurately capture the complex market dynamics and characteristics of the option data. This paper proposes a novel brain-inspired cerebellar associative memory model for pricing American-style call options on British pound vs. US dollar currency futures. The proposed model, named PSECMAC, constitutes a local learning model that is inspired by the neurophysiological aspects of the human cerebellum. The PSECMAC-based option-pricing model is subsequently applied in a mis-priced option arbitrage trading system. Simulation results show an encouraging return on investment of 23.1% for some of the traded options. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
