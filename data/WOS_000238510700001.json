Even worse, vocabulary conflicts and inconsistencies can be frequently found amongst the many sources and references commonly used by software measurement researchers and practitioners. This article presents an analysis of the current situation, and provides a comparison framework that can be used to identify and address the discrepancies, gaps, and terminology conflicts that current software measurement proposals present. A basic software measurement ontology is introduced, that aims at contributing to the harmonization of the different software measurement proposals and standards, by providing a coherent set of common concepts used in software measurement. The ontology is also aligned with the metrology vocabulary used in other more mature measurement engineering disciplines. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
