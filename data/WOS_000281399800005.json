A stability criterion is given through linear stability analysis of traffic flows. The mKdV equation is derived with the reductive perturbation method for headway evolution which could be used to describe the stop-and-go traffic phenomenon. The results show a good effect of anticipation driving behavior on the stabilization of car flows and the anticipation driving behavior can improve the numerical stability of the model as well. In addition, the fluctuation of kinetic energy and the consumption of average energy in congested traffic flows are systematically analyzed. The results show that the reasonable level of anticipation driving behavior can save energy consumption in deceleration process effectively and lead to an associated relation like a \"bow-tie\" between the energy-saving and the value of anticipation factor.", "paper_title": "ANTICIPATION DRIVING BEHAVIOR AND RELATED REDUCTION OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN TRAFFIC FLOW", "paper_id": "WOS:000281399800005"}
