In the present work we address the problem of typing lambda-terms in second-order DLAL. For that we give a procedure which, starting with a term typed in system F, determines whether it is typable in DLAL and outputs a concrete typing if there exists any. We show that our procedure can be run in time polynomial in the size of the original Church typed system F term.", "paper_title": "VERIFICATION OF PTIME REDUCIBILITY FOR SYSTEM F TERMS: TYPE INFERENCE IN DUAL LIGHT AFFINE LOGIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000262642600010"}
