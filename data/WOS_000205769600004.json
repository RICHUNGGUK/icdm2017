However, our research shows that current implementations of publish/subscribe systems as well as the traditional solutions for extending publish/subscribe systems to the mobile domain do not perform well in highly mobile and unreliable wireless settings. We present semi-durable subscriptions, a technique that we have developed to overcome the challenges and the performance concerns publish/subscribe systems face in mobile wireless settings. We discuss the architecture of semi-durable subscriptions and study in detail the effect of various mobility parameters on the performance of semi-durable subscriptions to demonstrate their efficacy in mobile wireless settings. We also discuss system parameters for semi-durable subscriptions and with the help of experimental results demonstrate how these parameters can be controlled to configure a system according to a set of desired characteristics.", "paper_title": "High performance publish/subscribe middleware for mobile wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000205769600004"}
