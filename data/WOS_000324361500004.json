Much research has been done in the area of human error identification; however, most existing systems focus solely on the prediction of errors, not on increasing worker accuracy. The current study examines force responses before, during and after errors in a simulated assembly line task in order to determine an optimal feedback system for error reduction. Confirming previous findings, enhanced movement speed and reduced force occurred before erroneous trials and slowing occurred after erroneous trials. Given the results, we suggest a haptic feedback system which stimulates users to exert increased force levels after completing an erroneous task in order to increase degree of control and re-build worker confidence and thereby reduce overall error rate.", "paper_title": "Post-error expression of speed and force while performing a simple, monotonous task with a haptic pen", "paper_id": "WOS:000324361500004"}
