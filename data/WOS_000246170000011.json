It is shown that the interleaving approach and the distributed approach are equivalent in this setting. This holds, both in the deterministic and in the nondeterministic case. Consequently, we obtain a particularly simple class of sequential weighted automata that already have full expressive power. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
