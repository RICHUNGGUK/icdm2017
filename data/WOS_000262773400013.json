To overcome the difficulties met by previous methods, here we propose a simple quantitative one by using a similarity matrix plus Pearson's correlation analysis. The distance root-mean-square deviation (dRMSD) is used to measure the similarity of two substructures in a protein. We applied this method to the proteins of the beta-propeller,jelly roll,and beta-trefoil families and the results show that this method cannot only detect the internal repetitive structures in proteins effectively. but also can identify their locations easily.
