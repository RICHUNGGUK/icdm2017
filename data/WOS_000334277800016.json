This study explores the structural and dynamic patterns of biomass-based bioenergy research. We measure the profile of biomass research on both macro scales (nations) and meso level (institutions) in an international context. We find that biomass publications are intensively distributed in developed regions and some emerging economies. The U.S. leads in this emerging field as evidenced by research quantity, impact, and international collaboration links. China is developing rapidly in this domain in terms of publication volume and collaborative links but suffers from low research visibility. The study also finds strong interactions are taking place both within macro-disciplines and between macro-disciplines. Research limitations are presented.", "paper_title": "Profile of developments in biomass-based bioenergy research: a 20-year perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000334277800016"}
