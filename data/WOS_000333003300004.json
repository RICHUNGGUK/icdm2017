A regularized method of fundamental solutions is employed in order to find a stable numerical solution to this ill-posed, but linear coupled inverse problem. The choice of the regularization parameter is based on the L-curve criterion. Numerical results are presented and discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
