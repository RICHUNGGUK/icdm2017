Set S = {(1 2 i), (1 i 2)vertical bar 3 <= i <= n}. The alternating group graph, denoted by AG(n), is defined as the Cayley graph on A(n) with respect to S. Jwo et al. [Networks 23 (1993) 315-326] introduced alternating group graph AG(n) as an interconnection network topology for computing systems. Conditional diagnosability, a new measure of diagnosability introduced by Lai et al. [IEEE Transactions on Computers 54(2) (2005) 165-175] can better measure the diagnosability of regular interconnection networks. This paper determines that under PMC-model the conditional diagnosability of AG(n) is 4 for n = 4 and 6n - 18 for each n >= 5.", "paper_title": "Conditional Diagnosability of Alternating Group Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000315959200015"}
