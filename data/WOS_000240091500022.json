The method deals with the problem of driving a mobile manipulator from a starting configuration to a goal configuration avoiding obstacles. It modifies planned trajectory at every sampling time using elastic force and potential field force. It puts way poses throughout a planned trajectory, and the trajectory modification is accomplished by adjusting the way poses. The way poses are adjusted subject to the elastic force and the potential field force. The procedure repeats until the robot reaches its goal configuration through the way poses. This method results in smooth and adaptive trajectory in an environment with moving as well as stationary obstacles.", "paper_title": "Trajectory modification using elastic force for collision avoidance of a mobile manipulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500022"}
