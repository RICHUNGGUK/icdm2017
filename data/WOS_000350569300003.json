The side effects include edge discontinuity and the natural insensitivity to object edges in the motion direction. X-event, a kind of artificial event is introduced to represent light intensity difference perpendicular to the motion direction of the target object. New timestamps are attached to the raw TAE data to adjust temporary resolution to the same order of magnitude with the vertical axis in the TAE representation. After removing noisy and redundant events, designed templates are used to generate X-events to renovate broken lines and reproduce perpendicular edges. It is a real-time process which is unnecessary to wait for the collection of all the raw TAE data. A behavioral model of a 2 x 256 TAE vision sensor is established in Matlab, and X-events Generation block is realized in FPGA. Experimental results show that the proposed method can patch the TAE representation effectively to obtain a one-pixel-wide, precise, closed and connected contour.", "paper_title": "A Method to Solve the Side Effects of Dual-Line Timed Address Event Vision System", "paper_id": "WOS:000350569300003"}
