In large-scale CMPs, the communication efficiency among cores is crucial for the overall system performance and energy consumption. In this article, we propose a ring-based optical network-on-chip, called SUOR, to fulfill the communication requirement of CMPs. SUOR effectively explores the distinctive properties of optical signals and photonic devices, and dynamically partitions each data channel into multiple sections. Each section can be utilized independently to boost performance as well as reduce energy consumption. We develop a set of distributed control protocols and algorithms for SUOR, but physically allocate the corresponding cluster agents close to each other to benefit from the strengths of optical interconnects at long distances as well as electrical interconnects at short distances. Simulation results show that SUOR outperforms the alternative optical networks under a wide range of traffic patterns. For example, compared with MWSR design, SUOR achieves 2.58x throughput as well as saves 64% energy consumption on average in a 256-core CMP. Compared with MWMR design, SUOR achieves 1.52x throughput and reduces 73% energy consumption on average.", "paper_title": "SUOR: Sectioned Undirectional Optical Ring for Chip Multiprocessor", "paper_id": "WOS:000336444700003"}
