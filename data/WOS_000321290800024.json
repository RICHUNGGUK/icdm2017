The paper studies efficient resource allocation to optimize objectives of cloud users, IaaS provider and SaaS provider in cloud computing. The paper proposes the composition of different layers in the cloud, such as IaaS and SaaS, and its joint optimization for efficient resource allocation. The efficient resource allocation optimization problem is conducted by subproblems. The proposed cloud resource allocation optimization algorithm is achieved through an iterative algorithm. The experiments are conducted to compare the performance of proposed joint optimization algorithm for efficient resource allocation with other related works.", "paper_title": "Efficient resource allocation for optimizing objectives of cloud users, IaaS provider and SaaS provider in cloud environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000321290800024"}
