In this paper, we propose a hierarchical routing model by using mobile agents to collect and update the dynamic changes of routing information in grid systems, which has been proved to be the only optimal solution that makes inference on the known traffic information and approximates to a unbiased distribution. Our method is fault tolerant, scalable, and relies completely on local information. Extensive simulations show the priority of our algorithm to state-of-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "A mobile agent-based routing model for grid computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000314064000007"}
