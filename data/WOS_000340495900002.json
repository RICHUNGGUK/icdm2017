Such a network may be realized over a mobile ad hoc network formed by the handheld mobile devices. Therefore, traffic in the network can be user generated and thus semantic. Unfortunately, none of the traffic management techniques proposed for the underlying network considers the semantic properties of the generated traffic. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a semantic traffic management framework which has two modules: traffic monitoring unit and traffic reduction unit. Although the first module analyzes the semantic traffic to detect an emergency, the latter module removes redundant semantic information for traffic reduction. We have supported the feasibility of the proposed semantic framework through simulation. Simulation results suggest that the framework is capable of accurate and early detection of an emergency as well as traffic reduction while keeping sufficient information to report the emergency.
