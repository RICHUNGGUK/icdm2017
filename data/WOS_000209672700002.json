In this paper, we survey Sybil attacks and defense schemes in IoT. Specifically, we first define three types Sybil attacks: SA-1, SA-2, and SA-3 according to the Sybil attacker's capabilities. We then present some Sybil defense schemes, including social graph-based Sybil detection (SGSD), behavior classification-based Sybil detection (BCSD), and mobile Sybil detection with the comprehensive comparisons. Finally, we discuss the challenging research issues and future directions for Sybil defense in IoT.", "paper_title": "Sybil Attacks and Their Defenses in the Internet of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000209672700002"}
