In LBSNs, social and geographical influences have been intensively used in location recommendations. However, human movement also exhibits spatiotemporal sequential patterns, but only a few current studies consider the spatiotemporal sequential influence of locations on users' check-in behaviors. In this article, we propose a new gravity model for location recommendations, called LORE, to exploit the spatiotemporal sequential influence on location recommendations. First, LORE extracts sequential patterns from historical check-in location sequences of all users as a Location-Location Transition Graph (L(2)TG), and utilizes the L(2)TG to predict the probability of a user visiting a new location through the developed additive Markov chain that considers the effect of all visited locations in the check-in history of the user on the new location. Furthermore, LORE applies our contrived gravity model to weigh the effect of each visited location on the new location derived from the personalized attractive force (i.e., the weight) between the visited location and the new location. The gravity model effectively integrates the spatiotemporal, social, and popularity influences by estimating a power-law distribution based on (i) the spatial distance and temporal difference between two consecutive check-in locations of the same user, (ii) the check-in frequency of social friends, and (iii) the popularity of locations from all users. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation for LORE using three large-scale real-world datasets collected from Foursquare, Gowalla, and Brightkite. Experimental results show that LORE achieves significantly superior location recommendations compared to other state-of-the-art location recommendation techniques.", "paper_title": "Spatiotemporal Sequential Influence Modeling for Location Recommendations: A Gravity-based Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000363900100011"}
