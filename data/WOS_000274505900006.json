The reconstruction protocol of our scheme is fair and stable in the rational settings, allowing all players to obtain the designated secret. Our scheme is based on RSA-OAEP with the distributed decryption. The security of our scheme relies on a computational assumption and uses the random oracles. The size of each share in our scheme is independent of the utility function and the computation cost of the reconstruction protocol is constant. Moreover, our scheme prevents the attacks with at most m - 1 coalitions.", "paper_title": "A Rational Secret-Sharing Scheme Based on RSA-OAEP", "paper_id": "WOS:000274505900006"}
