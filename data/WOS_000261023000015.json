This method is based on the spectral expansion of complex generalized eigen-oscillations for the electromagnetic fields and the Schwarz non-overlapping domain decomposition iteration method. The GeSEM takes advantages of a special real orthogonality property of the complex eigen-oscillations and a new radiation interface condition for the system of equations for the spectral expansion coefficients. Numerical results validate the high resolution and the flexibility of the method for various materials. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
