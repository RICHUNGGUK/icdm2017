However, the question of how these two apparently incompatible goals might be achieved by the same cerebellar area remains open. Here we propose a solution where the inhibition of the Inferior Olive (IO) by the cerebellar Deep Nuclei (DN) translates the motor command signal into a sensory prediction allowing a single cerebellar area to simultaneously tackle both aspects of the problem: execution and prediction. We demonstrate that having a graded error signal, the gain of the Nucleo-Olivary Inhibition (NOI) balances the generation of the response between the cerebellar and the reflexive controllers or, in other words, between the adaptive and the reactive layers of behavior. Moreover, we show that the resulting system is fully autonomous and can either acquire or erase adaptive responses according to their utility. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
