However, from the user's viewpoint, such a navigation often requires an high cost in terms of time to spend on the Web to perform a satisfying comparison of the various alternatives. From the supplier's viewpoint, it is needed to propose products in a suitable way to customers, taking into account the typology of each customer, her/his preferences, habits, etc. In this context, generally denoted as Business-to-Customer (B2C) e-commerce, the use of software agents as mediators in e-commerce activities seems to be particularly promising. In this paper, we describe and analyze the various roles agents have assumed in B2C e-commerce applications. Furthermore, we propose a Consumer Buying Behaviour model, called E-2-CBB, that considers new emergent issues, as the capability to solve semantic heterogeneity, and the adaptive presentations of Web stores. By using such a model, we classify and compare a number of agent-based approaches for managing B2C e-commerce, proposed in the literature in the last ten years.", "paper_title": "Agents' roles in B2C e-commerce", "paper_id": "WOS:000238257300001"}
