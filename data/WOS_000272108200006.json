IEML (Information Economy MetaLanguage) is a regular language that provides new methods for semantic interoperability, semantic navigation, collective categorization and self-referential collective intelligence. This research program is compatible with the major standards of the Web of data and is in tune with the current trends in social computing. The paper explains the philosophical relevance of this new language, expounds its syntactic and semantic structures and ponders its possible implications for the growth of collective intelligence in cyberspace.
