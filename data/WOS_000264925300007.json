Using the continuation theorem of coincidence degree theory, we present an easily verifiable sufficient condition on the existence of multiple periodic solutions. It is important to point out that we establish a better estimation on the difference between the supremum and infimum of a differentiable piece wise continuous periodic function. As illustrated in this paper, with the help of this estimation, many existing results can be improved. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
