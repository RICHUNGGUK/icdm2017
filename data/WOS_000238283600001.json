We identify different classes of policies for agent based component integration. We also identify the system services and mechanisms that are required for policy-driven integration of components and their management. Policies are derived from the application level requirements and axe used in dynamic configuration of agent based systems. Through case studies of two applications we demonstrate the utility of the policy-driven component integration approach in distributed agent systems.", "paper_title": "Policy-driven configuration and management of agent based distributed systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238283600001"}
