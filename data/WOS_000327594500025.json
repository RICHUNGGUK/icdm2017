The goal of this paper is to find an appropriate criterion to analyze statistical tests in this setting. A suitable model for analysis is the high-dimensional model in which both n and m increase to infinity, and n = o(m). A new performance criterion based on large deviations analysis is proposed and it generalizes the classical error exponent applicable for large sample problems (in which m = O(n)). This generalized error exponent criterion provides insights that are not available from asymptotic consistency or central limit theorem analysis. The following results are established for the uniform null distribution: 1) The best achievable probability of error P-e decays as P-e = exp{-(n(2/)m)j(1 + o(1))} for some j > 0. 2) A class of tests based on separable statistics, including the coincidence-based test, attains the optimal generalized error exponents. 3) Pearson's chi-square test has a zero generalized error exponent and thus its probability of error is asymptotically larger than the optimal test.", "paper_title": "Generalized Error Exponents for Small Sample Universal Hypothesis Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000327594500025"}
