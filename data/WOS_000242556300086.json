Small-world networks and scale-free networks are used as practical network model. The iterated prisoner's dilemma game are adopted as theoretical tool in which players are paired according to the network structure to play the ONE-SHOT prisoner's dilemma game. Computer simulation shows that TIT-FOR-TAT-like strategy pattern will emerge from initial enviroments and cooperation can be maintained even in social networks when players have little chance to play continuous repeated games.", "paper_title": "Evolution of cooperation using random pairing on social networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300086"}
