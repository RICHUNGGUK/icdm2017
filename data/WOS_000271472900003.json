In this setting, a major issue is to establish whether two services can be used interchangeably in any context. To this aim, our paper first briefly reviews the results contained in a recent article by the same authors, where a suitable notion of behavioural equivalence for Web services was introduced. Our work then extends those results, in order to account for ontology-based service specifications. Next, a concrete example scenario - a car rental system - is presented, and it is then used to illustrate how the equivalence between services can be fruitfully employed for correctly addressing two prominent, modularity-related problems: the publication of correct service specifications and the replaceability of (sub)services.", "paper_title": "A Net-based Approach to Web Services Publication and Replaceability", "paper_id": "WOS:000271472900003"}
