This improvement corresponds to a fast probabilistic model for hypothesis rejection (affine solution verification stage), which allows a large reduction in the number of false positives. The new probabilistic model is evaluated in an object recognition task using a database of 100 pairs of images.", "paper_title": "A fast probabilistic model for hypothesis rejection in SIFT-based object recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400072"}
