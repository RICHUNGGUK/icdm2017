Design/methodology/approach - An analytical approach to calculate eddy current losses in PM caused by slotting harmonics of PMSM is presented. The eddy current reaction field is taken into account as well as axial and circumferential segmentation of the magnets. Findings - The analytical model provides results comparable to 3D-FEM calculations even at high frequencies at reduced computation costs. To generalize the results the magnetic Reynold's number is introduced. Originality/value - Taking into account the axial and circumferential segmentation in the PDE; the approach is much more accurate compared to known approaches; accuracy is comparable to 3D-FEA.", "paper_title": "A new analytical approach to determine slotting based eddy current losses in permanent magnets of PMSM taking into account axial and circumferential segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000354645900001"}
