Maintaining bridges is a multi-faceted operation that requires both domain knowledge and analytics techniques over large data sources. Although most existing bridge management systems (BMS) are very efficient at data storage, they are not as effective at providing analytical capabilities or as flexible at supporting different inspection technologies. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system that extends the capability of current BMSs. Based on a nation-wide survey and our interviews with bridge managers, we designed our system to be customizable so that it can provide interactive exploration, information correlation, and domain-oriented data analysis. When tested by bridge managers of the U.S. Department of Transportation, we validated that our system provides bridge managers with the necessary features for performing in-depth analysis of bridges from a variety of perspectives that are in accordance to their typical workflow.", "paper_title": "An Interactive Visual Analytics System for Bridge Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000280991300027"}
