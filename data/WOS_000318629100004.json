This article studies the implementation, for such accelerators, of the floating-point power function x(y) as defined by the C99 and IEEE 754-2008 standards, generalized here to arbitrary exponent and mantissa sizes. Last-bit accuracy at the smallest possible cost is obtained thanks to a careful study of the various subcomponents: a floating-point logarithm, a modified floating-point exponential, and a truncated floating-point multiplier. A parameterized architecture generator in the open-source FloPoCo project is presented in details and evaluated.", "paper_title": "Floating-Point Exponentiation Units for Reconfigurable Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000318629100004"}
