We show that the validity problem is coNP-complete, even for variable-free sequents. For quasi-boolean semantics, the satisfiability problem is shown to be NP-complete (even for variable-free sequents), whereas for Kripke semantics it is shown to be coNP-complete for variable-free sequents and Sigma(p)(2)-complete in the general case. The evaluation problem is in P for quasi-boolean semantics, but coNP-complete for Kripke semantics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
