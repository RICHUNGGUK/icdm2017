In this regard, the high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) especially in the form of PEVs is another source of energy that can help the grid if optimally managed. In order to make the existence of PEVs to a suitable opportunity for the grid, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology is employed to change the PEVs from moving loads into moving sources. We also suggest a novel smart strategy to first manage the operation of PV and PEVs for providing the operator targets and second model the uncertainties generated by both PV and PEV in the system. The proposed method uses particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) along with the point estimate method (PEM) to deal with these issues. The 69-bus IEEE test system is employed as the case study to examine the high performance and ability of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Optimal management of plug-in electric vehicles in smart distribution systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000362627000008"}
