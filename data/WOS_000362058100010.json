We show that this model is very suited to describe hybrid systems that consist of a quantum component and a classical one. Indeed, hybrid systems are often encountered in quantum information processing. Thus, we further propose a model called hybrid quantum automata (HQA) that can be used to describe the hybrid systems receiving inputs (actions) from the outer world. We show the language equivalence problem of HQA is decidable in polynomial time. Furthermore, we apply this result to the trace equivalence problem of quantum Markov chains, and thus it is also decidable in polynomial time. Finally, we discuss model checking linear-time properties of quantum Markov chains, and show the quantitative analysis of regular safety properties can be addressed successfully.
