In this paper, a blind video watermarking scheme based on independent component analysis (ICA) and shot segmentation is presented. In this scheme, the global histogram comparison approach is used to segment the video, and ICA is performed on each obtained segment to get its independent component frames (ICFs). The copyright information is embedded into the principal independent component frames (PICFs) according to the single watermark embedding (SWE) scheme. The content-based shot segmentation for video sequences is used here to improve the robustness to temporal desynchronization. The watermark embedded in PICFs provides better robustness to intra-video collusion attack. And blind detection is achieved by using the SWE scheme. The simulations show the feasibility and validity of this scheme. It can resist most of the common frame-based and video-based attacks. The watermark can be detected blindly. And it is robust to temporal desynchronization and intra-video collusion.", "paper_title": "A blind video watermarking scheme based on ICA and shot segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238879900003"}
