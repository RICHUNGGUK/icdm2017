Database molecules containing such fragments are assigned cumulative scores that serve as a measure of similarity to active reference compounds. The Interaction Annotated Structural Features (IASF) method is applied to mine live high-throughput screening (FITS) data sets and often identifies more hits than conventional fragment-based similarity searching or ligand-protein docking.", "paper_title": "Ligand-Target Interaction-Based Weighting of Substructures for Virtual Screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000260428800004"}
