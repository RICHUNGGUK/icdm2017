To achieve privacy and authentication simultaneously, many anonymous authentication and key exchange protocols have been proposed for roaming services. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure password-authenticated and key exchange protocol. Our proposal provides user anonymity and untraceability,. confidentiality and fairness of session key, mutual authentication between parties and perfect forward secrecy while preventing conventional attacks. Besides, it reduces the computation cost and communication load for parties, especially the home agent, which suffices to the requirements of multiple services request concurrently. Compared with related protocols, it is more suitable and practical for roaming services in wireless environments.", "paper_title": "An Anonymous Password-Authenticated and Key Exchange Protocol for Roaming Services in Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000309894300002"}
