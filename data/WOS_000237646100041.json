These mini Grids, because of their limited scope and resource availability, may not serve the real world problem in every aspect and, hence, lead them to collaborate on demand with other grids while keeping themselves autonomous and independent. The specific problem that underlies in such collaborative Grids is resource scheduling among autonomously administrated Grids. In this paper*, we propose a distributed, scalable and reconfigurable inter-Grid resource sharing framework where Grids can dynamically join or resign the framework on a need base. This framework, based on peer-to-peer communication paradigm, enables resource sharing among autonomous Grid systems.", "paper_title": "Distributed, scalable and reconfigurable inter-grid resource sharing framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100041"}
