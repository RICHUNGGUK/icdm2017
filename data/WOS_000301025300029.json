Spam filtering poses a special problem in text categorization, in which the defining characteristic is that filters face an active adversary, which constantly attempts to evade filtering. In this paper, we present a novel approach to spam filtering based on the minimum description length principle and confidence factors. The proposed model is fast to construct and incrementally updateable. Furthermore, we have conducted an empirical experiment using three well-known, large and public e-mail databases. The results indicate that the proposed classifier outperforms the state-of-the-art spam filters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
