This paper proposes a novel approach to identifying malicious transactions. The approach concentrates on two aspects of database transactions: (1) dependencies among data items and (2) variations of each individual data item which can be considered as time-series data. The advantages are threefold. First, dependency rules among data items are extended to detect transactions that read or write data without permission. Second, a novel behaviour similarity criterion is introduced to reduce the false positive rate of the detection. Third, time-series anomaly analysis is conducted to pinpoint intrusion transactions that update data items with unexpected pattern. As a result, the proposed approach is able to track normal transactions and detect malicious ones more effectively than existing approaches.", "paper_title": "Detecting intrusion transactions in databases using data item dependencies and anomaly analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000260256300003"}
