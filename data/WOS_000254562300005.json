Therefore, to facilitate decision making in a geographic information system (GIS), the graph layer indicator and the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model must be integrated. This study aims to explain several versions of the T-S fuzzy model based on fuzzy theory and fuzzy operation. Design/methodology/approach - An inference model is constructed for GIS using the T-S fuzzy model to formulate an integrated T-S decision-making (TSDMK) system. Findings - The TSDMK system accommodates inexact, linguistic, vague and uncertain GIS data. The operator assigns most graph layer indicators by intuition. Practical implications - Simulation results for the Hualien main station show that the proposed TSDMK system is an effective approach for GIS decision making. Originality/value - This investigation assesses applications of fuzzy logic for decision making in a GIS based on TSDMK graphs focusing on model-based systems.", "paper_title": "Application of geographic information system to the allocation of disaster shelters via fuzzy models", "paper_id": "WOS:000254562300005"}
