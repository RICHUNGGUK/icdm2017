To construct such codes with better list-decoding performance explicitly, it is of interest to investigate the list-decodability of random rank metric codes. It is shown that if n/m = b is a constant, then for every rank metric code in F-q(mxn) with rate R and list-decoding radius rho must obey the Gilbert-Varshamov bound, that is, R <= (1 - rho)(1 - b rho). Otherwise, the list size can be exponential and hence no polynomial-time list decoding is possible. On the other hand, for arbitrary 0 < rho < 1 and epsilon > 0, with epsilon and rho being independent of each other, with high probability, a random rank metric code with rate R = (1 - rho)(1 - b rho) - epsilon can be efficiently list-decoded up to a fraction rho of rank errors with constant list size O(1/epsilon). We establish similar results for constant-dimension subspace codes. Moreover, we show that, with high probability, the list-decoding radius of random F-q-linear rank metric codes also achieve the Gilbert-Varshamov bound with constant list size O(exp(1/epsilon)).", "paper_title": "On List-Decodability of Random Rank Metric Codes and Subspace Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000346980400004"}
