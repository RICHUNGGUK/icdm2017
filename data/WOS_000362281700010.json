In this paper we reproduce this phenomenon and investigate in greater depth the low-level mechanisms that give rise to stale reads. We show that the staleness spikes exhibited by Cassandra are strongly correlated with garbage collection, particularly the \"stop-the-world\" phase which pauses all application threads in a Java virtual machine. We show experimentally that the staleness spikes can be virtually eliminated by delaying read operations artificially at servers immediately after a garbage collection pause. In our experiments this yields more than a 98% reduction in the number of consistency anomalies that exceed 5ms, and has negligible impact on throughput and latency.", "paper_title": "Understanding the Causes of Consistency Anomalies in Apache Cassandra", "paper_id": "WOS:000362281700010"}
