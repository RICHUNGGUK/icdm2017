In this paper, we study the informativity of the data set in a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) networked control system (NCS), which contains possible network-induced delays, packet dropout, transmission scheduling, or a combination of these factors in network transmission. Moreover, to guarantee the data set of this MIMO NCS to be informative, a group of conditions for network transmission and controller's proportional term are developed. Finally, simulation studies are given to illustrate the result.", "paper_title": "Informative conditions for the data set in an MIMO networked control system with delays, packet dropout and transmission scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000337363200003"}
