In the present study, a homology model of 5-HT1AR was built based on the latest released high-resolution crystal structure of the beta(2)AR in its active state (PDB: 3SN6). A dynamic pharmacophore model, which takes the receptor flexibility into account, was constructed, validated, and applied to our dynamic pharmacophore-based virtual screening approach with the aim to identify potential 5-HT1AR agonists. The obtained hits were subjected to 5-HT1AR binding and functional assays, and 10 compounds with medium or high K-i and EC50 values were identified. Among them, FW01 (K-i = 51.9 nM, EC50 = 7 nM) was evaluated as the strongest agonist for 5-HT1AR The active 5-HT1AR model and dynamic. pharmacophore model obtained from this study can be used for future discovery and design of novel 5-HT1AR agonists. Also, by integrating all computational and available experimental data, a stepwise 5-HT1AR signal transduction model induced by agonist FW01 was proposed.", "paper_title": "Molecular Modeling of the 3D Structure of 5-HT1AR: Discovery of Novel 5-HT1AR Agonists via Dynamic Pharmacophore-Based Virtual Screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000329137700011"}
