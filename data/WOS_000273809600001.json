In this paper, we show that in the case of Gaussian measurements, a\"\" (1) minimization recovers the signal well from inaccurate measurements, thus improving the result from Candes et al. (Commun. Pure Appl. Math. 59:1207-1223, 2006). We also show that this numerically friendly algorithm (see Candes et al., Commun. Pure Appl. Math. 59:1207-1223, 2006) with overwhelming probability recovers the signal with accuracy, comparable to the accuracy of the best k-term approximation in the Euclidean norm when k similar to d/ln N.", "paper_title": "Stability and Instance Optimality for Gaussian Measurements in Compressed Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000273809600001"}
