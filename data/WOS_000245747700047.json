The method is broadly a hybrid algorithm employing ant colony optimization ( ACO) and the simple genetic algorithm. The method first employs ACO to obtain a set of alignments, which are then further processed by an elitist genetic algorithm, which employs primitive selection and a novel multipoint crossover-mutation operator to generate accurate alignments. The resulting alignments show a fair amount of accuracy for smaller and medium size sequences. Furthermore, this algorithm can be used rather quickly and efficiently for aligning shorter sequences and also for pattern searching in both nucleic acid and amino acid sequences. Furthermore, it can be used as an effective local alignment method or as a global alignment tool. On improvement of accuracy, this method can be extended for use towards multiple sequence alignment.
