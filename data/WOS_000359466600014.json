In the paper, we construct more general forms of generalized cyclotomic binary sequences with period 2p(m+1)q(n+1). Furthermore, we establish the formula of the linear complexity of proposed sequences. The results reveal that such sequences with period 2p(m+1)q(n+1) have a good balance property and high linear complexity.", "paper_title": "Linear Complexity of Generalized Cyclotomic Binary Sequences with Period 2p(m+1)q(n+1)", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466600014"}
