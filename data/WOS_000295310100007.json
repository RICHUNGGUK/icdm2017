The proposed approach, based on a decoupling approach and sequential approximations, introduces an efficient means for estimating reliability sensitivity along with the application of a line search strategy and weighted approximations. Two examples involving non-linear structures subject to dynamic loading are presented, showing the advantages and efficiency of the proposed framework. (C) 2010 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
