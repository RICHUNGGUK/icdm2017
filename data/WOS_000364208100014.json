With the new 9-CN-MOSFET SRAM cell, the read data stability is enhanced by 99.09%, while providing similar read speed as compared with the conventional six-transistor (6T) SRAM cell in a 16-nm carbon nanotube transistor technology. The worst-case write voltage margin is increased by 4.57x and 3.90x with the proposed 9-CN-MOSFET SRAM cell as compared with the conventional 6T SRAM cell and a previously published eight-transistor (8T) SRAM cell, respectively. A 1 Kibit SRAM array with the new memory cells consumes 34.18% and 12.27% lower leakage power as compared with the memory arrays with 6T and 8T SRAM cells, respectively, in idle mode. The overall electrical quality is enhanced by up to 13.63x with the proposed 9-CN-MOSFET memory circuit as compared with the other memory cells that are evaluated in this paper.", "paper_title": "A Novel Robust and Low-Leakage SRAM Cell With Nine Carbon Nanotube Transistors", "paper_id": "WOS:000364208100014"}
