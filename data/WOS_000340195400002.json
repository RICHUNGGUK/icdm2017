Augmented reality (AR) technology can be used to seamlessly merge virtual objects with real-world images to realize immersions. Additionally, computer vision (CV) technology can recognize free-hand gestures from live images to enable intuitive interactions. Therefore, we incorporate the latest AR and CV algorithms into a Virtual English Classroom, called VECAR, to promote immersive and interactive language learning. By wearing a pair of mobile computing glasses, users can interact with virtual contents in a three-dimensional space by using intuitive free-hand gestures. We design three cultural learning activities that introduce students to authentic cultural products and new cultural practices, and allow them to examine various cultural perspectives. The objectives of the VECAR are to make cultural and language learning appealing, improve cultural learning effectiveness, and enhance interpersonal communication between teachers and students.", "paper_title": "Computer-Assisted Culture Learning in an Online Augmented Reality Environment Based on Free-Hand Gesture Interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000340195400002"}
