The ANNSim is a computer program capable of improving its performance by referring to production constraints, system's limitations and desired targets. It is a goal oriented, flexible and integrated approach and produces the optimum solution by utilizing Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks. The properties and modules of the prescribed intelligent ANNSim are: (1) parametric modeling, (2) flexibility module, (3) integrated modeling, (4) knowledge-base module, (5) integrated database and (6) learning module. The integrated ANNSim is applied to 30 distinct tandem G/G/K queue systems. Furthermore, its superiority over conventional simulation approach is shown in two dimensions which are average run time and maximum number of required iterations (scenarios). (C) 2011 IMACS.
