We will focus on two main aspects: paper production and funding by research grants. Thus, we define a network of researchers and define suitable ways of describing their interaction, either by co-publication, project-collaboration, or a combination of both. From the corresponding complex networks, we extract maps which encode in graphical terms the relevant information and numerical parameters which encode the topological properties of the network. Thousands of these maps have been created and allow us to study the similarities and differences of the co-publications and the project-collaboration networks.", "paper_title": "Analysis of academic productivity based on Complex Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000359143200003"}
