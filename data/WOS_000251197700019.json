Some of these technologies such as that from Illuminas Solexa Sequencing, produce high genomic coverage by generating a very large number of small reads (similar to 30 bp). While prior work shows that partial assembly can be performed by k-mer extension in error-free reads, this algorithm is unsuccessful with the sequencing error rates found in practice. We present VCAKE (Verified Consensus Assembly by K-mer Extension), a modification of simple k-mer extension that overcomes error by using high depth coverage. Though it is a simple modification of a previous approach, we show significant improvements in assembly results on simulated and experimental datasets that include error.", "paper_title": "Extending assembly of short DNA sequences to handle error", "paper_id": "WOS:000251197700019"}
