Also, its strong valence bonds allow gap values up to 5.4 ev. When diamond films are exposed to beta radiation, some electrons pass from the valence to the conduction band, and other stayed trapped between both bands. If the diamond is heated after beta radiation, the trap electrons could be encountered with their respectively holes or positrons emitting light at different frequencies, this phenomenon is called thermoluminescence (TL). The goal in this work is to demonstrate that the intensity of a glow curve can be adjusted by a three parameters Weibull distribution.", "paper_title": "Thermoluminescence analysis and estimation of the kinetics parameters by the Weibull distribution in a diamond like carbon Film", "paper_id": "WOS:000338630100002"}
