In both kinds of networks, the clustering coefficient C is a tunable control parameter. The network is an area of two competing contact processes, where nodes can be in two states, S or D. A node S becomes D with probability 1 if at least two its mutually linked neighbors are D. A node D becomes S with a given probability p if at least one of its neighbors is S. The competition between the processes is described by a phase diagram, where the critical probability p(c) depends on the clustering coefficient C. For p > p(c) the rate of state S increases in time, seemingly to dominate in the whole system. Below pc, the majority of nodes is in the D-state. The numerical results indicate that for the Watts-Strogatz network the D-process is activated at the finite value of the clustering coefficient C, close to 0.3. On the contrary, for the Erdos-Renyi network the transition is observed at the whole investigated range of C.", "paper_title": "COMPETING CONTACT PROCESSES ON HOMOGENEOUS NETWORKS WITH TUNABLE CLUSTERIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000316813300004"}
