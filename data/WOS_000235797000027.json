These methods have significant functional advantages over solely biometrics i.e. zero equal error rate (EER). The main drawback of the methods proposed in the literature relies in exhibiting low performance when an \"impostor\" B steals the pseudo-random numbers of A and lie tries to authenticate as A. In this paper, we show that a fusion among online signature matchers, where only half the matchers use biometric characteristics combined with the pseudo-random numbers, permits to obtain a very low EER when nobody steals the pseudo-random numbers, and good performance when an \"impostor\" B steals the pseudo-random numbers of A and lie tries to authenticate as A.
