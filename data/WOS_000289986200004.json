It appears when a high viscosity fluid flows vertically against a flat surface and may occur in industrial applications, as in injection molding of a propergol in complex-shaped cavities. These coiling or folding oscillations appear during the mold filling stage, leading to air entrapment. To understand and to model this free surface flow problem, a convected level set method is proposed. First, a sinus filter is applied to the distance function to get a smooth truncation far from the interface. Second, the reinitialization is embedded in the transport equation model, avoiding it as a separate step during calculation. In order to validate the method, numerical results are presented on classical interface capturing benchmarks. Finally, results are shown on two-dimensional and three-dimensional viscous jet buckling problems.
