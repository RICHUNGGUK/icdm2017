To solve the related problems, a novel power amplifier based on combined amplification with multi power amplifiers is proposed in this paper. In addition, a novel simplified filter look-up table predistorter is proposed. The novel predistorter connects to a memoryless predistorter subsystem with an adaptive filter subsystem in cascade, and can eliminate the nonlinear memory distortion effectively. The simulation results indicate that the power efficiency and BER performance will be improved by using the novel amplifier structure together with the novel predistorter.", "paper_title": "A novel distortion elimination method of power amplifier in wideband OFDM system", "paper_id": "WOS:000299517500015"}
