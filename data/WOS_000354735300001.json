Cooperative routing exploits the broadcast nature of wireless medium and transmits cooperatively using nearby sensor nodes as relays. It is a promising technique that utilizes cooperative communication to improve the communication quality of single-antenna sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a cooperative transmission scheme for underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) to enhance the network performance. Cooperative diversity has been introduced to combat fading. Cooperative UWSN (Co-UWSN) is proposed, which is a reliable, energy-efficient, and high throughput routing protocol for UWSN. Destination and potential relays are selected that utilize distance and signal-to-noise ratio computation of the channel conditions as cost functions. This contributes to sufficient decrease in path losses occurring in the links and transferring of data with much reduced path loss. Simulation results show that Co-UWSN protocol performs better in terms of end-to-end delay, energy consumption, and network lifetime. Selected protocols for comparison are energy-efficient depth-based routing (EEDBR), improved adaptive mobility of courier nodes in threshold-optimized depth-based routing (iAMCTD), cooperative routing protocol for UWSN, and cooperative partner node selection criteria for cooperative routing Coop (Re and dth).", "paper_title": "Co-UWSN: Cooperative Energy-Efficient Protocol for Underwater WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000354735300001"}
