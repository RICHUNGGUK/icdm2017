However, since GMM-UBM uses a common anti-model, namely UBM, for all target speakers, it tends to be weak in rejecting impostors' voices that are similar to the target speaker's voice. To overcome this limitation, we propose a discriminative feedback adaptation (DFA) framework that reinforces the discriminability between the target speaker model and the anti-model, while preserving the generalization ability of the GMM-UBM approach. This is achieved by adapting the UBM to a target speaker dependent anti-model based oil a minimum verification squared-error criterion, rather than estimating the model from scratch by applying the conventional discriminative training schemes. The results of experiments conducted on the NIST2001-SRE database show that DFA substantially improves the performance of the conventional GMM-UBM approach.
