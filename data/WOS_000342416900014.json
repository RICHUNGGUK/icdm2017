In particular, for independent identically distributed random code ensembles and for rates above the critical rate, we prove that if a regularity condition is satisfied (respectively, not satisfied), then for any epsilon > 0 a sub-exponential factor of O(N-0.5(1-epsilon+(rho) over bar *R)) respectively, O(N-0.5)) is achievable, where N and R are the blocklength and rate, respectively. The term (rho) over bar*(R) is related to the slope of the random coding exponent at rate R.", "paper_title": "Refinement of the Random Coding Bound", "paper_id": "WOS:000342416900014"}
