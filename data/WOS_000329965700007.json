The method is studied from the point of view of accuracy and numerical cost. It leads to a significative speed up over more conventional grid-based methods and allows to address challenging Schmidt numbers. In particular, theoretical predictions of universal scaling in forced homogeneous turbulence are recovered for a wide range of Schmidt numbers for large, intermediate and small scales of the scalar.
