Often the coordinate system of the metrology device has a different coordinate frame from that of the existing objects in the virtual world. To rectify these differences, a process called registration is often applied. This paper uses a case study to highlight the the differences between various registration techniques.", "paper_title": "Point cloud to CAD model registration methods in manufacturing inspection", "paper_id": "WOS:000242762800013"}
