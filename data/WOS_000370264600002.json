When computer games are developed, game design (problem domain) is usually decided in a gradual way within iterations where software prototypes are constructed and playtest are performed. In such a case, it is not practical to fit a heavyweight DA in the highly iterative process. Researchers indicated that vocabularies were expected to automate game design. Such vocabularies can be reused in another form in DA tasks. In this research, the authors developed an ontology and a DA procedure based on it. To evaluate them, theoretical analysis, case studies, and a user acceptance survey were used. The results indicated that the ontology met the general requirement as a domain vocabulary, and it enhanced the DA process in an expected way. Most of external potential users (46 in total) considered the ontology useful and easy to use.", "paper_title": "An Evaluation of Ontology Based Domain Analysis for Model Driven Development", "paper_id": "WOS:000370264600002"}
