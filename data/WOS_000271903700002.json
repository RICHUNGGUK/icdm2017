Most of the traditional clustering methods can be categorized as local or global ones. In this paper, a novel clustering method that can explore both the local and global information in the data set is proposed. The method, Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR), aims to minimize a cost function that properly trades off the local and global costs. We show that such an optimization problem can be solved by the eigenvalue decomposition of a sparse symmetric matrix; which can be done efficiently using iterative methods. Finally, the experimental results on several data sets are presented to show the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Clustering with Local and Global Regularization", "paper_id": "WOS:000271903700002"}
