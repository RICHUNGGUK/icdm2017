Specifically, due to the good stability and discriminative ability of local features, we use SIFT descriptor for video content description. However, matching based on SIFT descriptor is computationally expensive for large number of points and the high dimension. Thus, to reduce the computational complexity, we first use the dual-threshold method to segment the videos into segments with homogeneous content and extract keyframes from each segment. SIFT features are extracted from the keyframes of the segments. Then, we propose an SVD-based method to match two video frames with SIFT point set descriptors. To obtain the video sequence matching result, we propose a graph-based method. It can convert the video sequence matching into finding the longest path in the frame matching-result graph with time constraint. Experimental results demonstrate that the segmentation and graph-based video sequence matching method can detect video copies effectively. Also, the proposed method has advantages. Specifically, it can automatically find optimal sequence matching result from the disordered matching results based on spatial feature. It can also reduce the noise caused by spatial feature matching. And it is adaptive to video frame rate changes. Experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain a better tradeoff between the effectiveness and the efficiency of video copy detection.", "paper_title": "A Segmentation and Graph-Based Video Sequence Matching Method for Video Copy Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000321261000003"}
