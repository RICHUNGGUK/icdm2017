The stable line features or \"palm lines,\" which are comprised of principal lines and wrinkles, can be used to clearly describe a palm print and can be extracted in low-resolution images. This paper presents a novel approach to palm line extraction and matching for use in personal authentication. To extract palm lines, a set of directional line detectors is devised, and then these detectors are used to extract these lines in different directions. To avoid losing the details of the palm line structure, these irregular lines are represented using their chain code. To match palm lines, a matching score is defined between two palm prints according to the points of their palm lines. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively discriminate between palm prints even when the palm prints are dirty. The storage and speed of the proposed approach can satisfy the requirements of a real-time biometric system.", "paper_title": "Palm line extraction and matching for personal authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000239976700012"}
