Lacking a theory of robot-environment interaction that allows the design of robot control code based on theoretical analysis, roboticists still have to resort to trial-and-error methods in mobile robotics. The RobotMODIC project aims to develop a theoretical understanding of a robot's interaction with its environment, and uses system identification techniques to identify the system robot-task-environment. In this paper, we present two practical examples of the RobotMODIC process: mobile robot self-localisation and mobile robot training to achieve door traversal. In both examples, a transparent mathematical function is obtained that maps inputs - sensory perception in both cases - to output - location and steering velocity respectively. Analysis of the obtained models reveals further information about the way in which a task is achieved, the relevance of individual sensors, possible ways of obtaining more parsimonious models, etc. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
