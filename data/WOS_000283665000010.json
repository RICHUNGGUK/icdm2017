The processes, their activating conditions and the associated transcriptional responses are often unknown. Organism-wide modeling of network activation can reveal unique and shared mechanisms between tissues, and potentially as yet unknown processes. The same method can also be applied to cell-biological conditions in one or more tissues. Results: We introduce a novel approach for organism-wide discovery and analysis of transcriptional responses in interaction networks. The method searches for local, connected regions in a network that exhibit coordinated transcriptional response in a subset of tissues. Known interactions between genes are used to limit the search space and to guide the analysis. Validation on a human pathway network reveals physiologically coherent responses, functional relatedness between tissues and coordinated, context-specific regulation of the genes.", "paper_title": "Global modeling of transcriptional responses in interaction networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000283665000010"}
