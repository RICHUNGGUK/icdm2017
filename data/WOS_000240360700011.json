Analysis of the test results confirms the usefulness of a constant attractive force as well as of haptic fixtures to help users locate objects in a virtual environment. The 3D audio turned out to be less useful due to the design of the environment. However, user comments indicate that this type of sound feedback helps spatial understanding. Contrary to expectations, no significant tool effects were seen on spatial memory.", "paper_title": "Non visual haptic audio tools for virtual environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000240360700011"}
