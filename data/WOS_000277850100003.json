Owing to effectiveness of the ANP in allowing for complex interrelationships between attributes, this paper develops an ANP-based classifier for pattern classification problems with interdependence or independence among attributes. To deal with interdependence, this study employs genetic algorithms (GAs) to automatically determine elements in the supermatrix that are not easily user-specified, to find degrees of importance of respective attributes. Then, with the relative importance for each attribute in the limiting supermatrix, the current work determines the class label of a pattern by its synthetic evaluation. Experimental results obtained by the proposed ANP-based classifier are comparable to those obtained by other fuzzy or non-fuzzy classification methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
