The novel feature of our iterative solver is the incorporation of error control in the natural \"energy\" norm in combination with an a posteriori estimator for the PDE approximation error. This leads to a robust and optimally efficient stopping criterion: the iteration is terminated as soon as the algebraic error is insignificant compared to the approximation error. We describe a \"proof of concept\" MATLAB implementation of this algorithm, which we call EST_MINRES, and we illustrate its effectiveness when integrated into the Incompressible Flow Iterative Solution Software (IFISS) package (cf. ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software 33, Article 14, 2007).", "paper_title": "An Optimal Iterative Solver for Symmetric Indefinite Systems Stemming from Mixed Approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000287849900005"}
