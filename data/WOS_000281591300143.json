We adopted the Clustering Algorithm from the Radial Basis Function (RBF) network architecture and incorporated it into the conventional HMLP network architecture. The modified model is called Clustered-Hybrid Multilayer Perceptron (Clustered-HMLP) network. The proposed Clustered-HMLP network architecture is trained using modified training algorithm called Clustered-Modified Recursive Prediction Error (Clustered-MRPE). The capability of the Clustered HMLP network with Clustered-MRPE training algorithm is demonstrated using seven benchmark datasets from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository (i.e. Iris, Ionosphere, Pima Indian Diabetes, Wine, Lung Cancer, Hayes-Roth and Glass) and compared with the performance of other twelve classifiers reported in literature. Further, the new network is implemented to model a Transformer Fault Diagnosis System and Aggregate Shape Identification System. The results indicate that the proposed Clustered-HMLP network outperforms other eleven classifiers and provides a significant improvement to the conventional HMLP network for pattern recognition application.
