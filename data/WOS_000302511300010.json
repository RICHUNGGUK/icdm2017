Harnessing modern technologies is valuable in many contexts, in particular in home surveillance scenario, where people safety or security might be threatened. Modern home security systems endorse monitoring as well as control functions in a remote fashion, e.g. via devices as a laptops, PDAs, or cell phones, thus implementing the pervasive computing paradigma; moreover, the intelligence is now often embedded into modern applications, e.g. surveillance systems could adapt to the environment through a self-learning algorithm. This work presents an intelligent and pervasive surveillance system for home and corporate security based on the ZigBee protocol which detects and classifies intrusions discarding false positives, also providing remote control and cameras live streaming. Results of tests in different environments show the effectiveness of the proposed system.", "paper_title": "An Intelligent and Pervasive Surveillance System for Home Security", "paper_id": "WOS:000302511300010"}
