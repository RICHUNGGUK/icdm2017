We describe a context-free grammatical inference algorithm operating on positive data only, which integrates an information theoretic constituent likelihood measure together with more traditional heuristics based on substitutability and frequency. The competition is discussed from the perspective of a competitor. We discuss a class of deterministic grammars, the Non-terminally Separated (NTS) grammars, that have a property relied on by our algorithm, and consider the possibilities of extending the algorithm to larger classes of languages.", "paper_title": "Learning deterministic context free grammars: The Omphalos competition", "paper_id": "WOS:000242511900005"}
