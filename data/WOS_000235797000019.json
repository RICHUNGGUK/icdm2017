An approach combining the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with the differential inequality and linear matrix inequality techniques is taken to investigate this problem. The proposed criterion for exponential stability generalizes and improves those reported recently in the literature. Two numerical examples are also presented to illustrate our results.
