The Learning Management Systems available nowadays provides only the user authentication engine based on username/password, which increases the susceptibility to fraud, when the authentication certainty level about the actual user, given for this mechanism, is practically void. In this article we proposed the safe and fast approach for authentication system for distance learning. The certification methods of face recognition were adopted in proposed system. The high recognition rate of the implemented system in four cities of Iran shows that the distance education systems are more secure and reliable than the traditional authentication system, and as a result, promote the development of distance education, in future.(c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
