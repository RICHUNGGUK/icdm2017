Assuming an online arrival of calls, the goal is to minimize the span of frequencies used to serve all of the calls. By first considering chi-colorable networks, which is a generalization of the (3-colorable) cellular networks, we present a (chi+1)/2-competitive online algorithm. This algorithm, when applied to cellular networks, is effectively a positive solution to the open problem posed in (Caragiannis et al. in Theory Comput. Syst. 35(5):521-543, 2002) Does a 2-competitive online algorithm exist for frequency allocation in cellular networks? We further prove a matching lower bound, which shows that our 2-competitive algorithm is optimal. We discover that an interesting phenomenon occurs for the online frequency allocation problem when the number of calls considered becomes large: previously-derived optimal bounds on competitive ratios no longer hold true. For cellular networks, we show a new asymptotic lower and upper bounds of 1.5 and 1.9126, respectively, which breaks through the optimal bound of 2 shown above.", "paper_title": "Absolute and Asymptotic Bounds for Online Frequency Allocation in Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000279681700013"}
