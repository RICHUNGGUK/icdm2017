Signature based network attack detection is no longer convinced the efficiency in the diversified intrusions (Limmer and Dressler in 17th ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security, 2010). Moreover, as the various Zero-day attacks, non notified attacks cannot be detected (Wu and Banzhaf in Appl Soft Comput 10(1):1-35, 2010). This paper suggests an effective update method of data set on Machine Learning to detect non notified attacks. In addition, this paper compares and verifies the effects of Machine Learning Detection with updated data set to the former methods.", "paper_title": "Dynamic learning model update of hybrid-classifiers for intrusion detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000317662700015"}
