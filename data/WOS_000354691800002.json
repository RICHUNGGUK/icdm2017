The present paper suggests an alternative, more phenomenological approach. In line with the User Experience perspective, we focus on the experiential phenomenon and subjective feelings related to intuitive interaction. Our analysis makes use of insights from psychological research on intuitive decision-making and user research in Human-Computer Interaction. As a result, we suggest four components of intuitive interaction (Gut Feeling, Verbalizability, Effortlessness, Magical Experience) and a research framework of relevant influencing factors. Given that intuitive interaction relies on the transfer of previously acquired knowledge, one suggested influencing factor is the domain transfer distance, i.e. the distance between the application domain and the source domain of transferred prior knowledge. Our theoretical model assumes a differential effect of the domain transfer distance on the four components of intuitive interaction. An empirical study (n = 152) substantiates the suggested components and theoretical considerations on the special effect of the domain transfer distance. As assumed, Gut Feeling, Verbalizability, Effortlessness and Magical Experience were all relevant for participants' subjective understanding of intuitive interaction. In line with our model of domain transfer distance, usage scenarios with higher transfer distance were perceived as better representatives of intuitive interaction and characterized by Gut Feeling/Magical Experience, whereas lower transfer distance scenarios were characterized by Verbalizability/Effortlessness. The present paper offers a number of contributions for research and design. Besides providing a better understanding of the phenomenon of intuitive interaction and underlying mechanisms, we discuss how design can profit from these insights (e.g. specification of the desired experience, design for innovation). Limitations of the present study and implications for future research are discussed.", "paper_title": "An Experience Perspective on Intuitive Interaction: Central Components and the Special Effect of Domain Transfer Distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000354691800002"}
