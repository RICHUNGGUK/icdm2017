Velocity and thermal slip conditions are taken into account. Problem formulation is developed in the presence of thermal radiation. Governing non-linear problem is solved by a homotopy analysis method. Convergence of the derived solutions is studied. Numerical values of skin-friction coefficient and local Nusselt number are tabulated. Effects of pertinent parameters on the velocity and temperature profiles are discussed. Comparison between the present and previous limiting results is shown.
