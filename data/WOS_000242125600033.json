In recent years the specific problem of DNA sequencing by hybridization has attracted quite a lot of interest in the optimization community. However, in contrast to the development of metaheuristics, the work on simple constructive heuristics hardly received any attention. This is despite the fact that well-working constructive heuristics are often an essential component of succesful metaheuristics. It is exactly this lack of constructive heuristics that motivated the work presented in this paper. The results of our best constructive heuristic are comparable to the results of the best available metaheuristics, while using less computational resources.", "paper_title": "New constructive heuristics for DNA sequencing by hybridization", "paper_id": "WOS:000242125600033"}
