In these kinds of server environments, HDD-based storage usually becomes the bottleneck of the overall system, but it is not enough to merely replace the devices with faster ones in order to exploit their high performance. In other words, proper optimizations are needed to fully utilize their performance gains. In this work, we first adopted a DRAM-based SSD as a fast backend-storage in the existing SAN environment, and found significant performance degradation compared to its own capabilities, especially in the case of small-sized random I/O pattern, even though a high- speed network was used. We have proposed three optimizations to solve this problem: (1) removing software overhead in the SAN I/O path; (2) increasing parallelism in the procedures for handling I/ O requests; and (3) adopting the temporal merge mechanism to reduce network overheads. We have implemented them as a prototype and found that our approaches make substantial performance improvements by up to 39% and 280% in terms of both the latency and bandwidth, respectively.", "paper_title": "Towards High-Performance SAN with Fast Storage Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000334521100001"}
