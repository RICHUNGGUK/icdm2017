Classifying a structure as directional or nondirectional requires a measure to quantify the degree of directionality and a threshold, which needs to be chosen based on the statistics of the image. In order to do this, we model the image as a random field. So far, little research has been performed on analyzing directionality in random fields. In this paper, we propose a measure to quantify the degree of directionality based on the random monogenic signal, which enables a unique decomposition of a 2-D signal into local amplitude, local orientation, and local phase. We investigate the second-order statistical properties of the monogenic signal for isotropic, anisotropic, and unidirectional random fields. We analyze our measure of directionality for finite-size sample images and determine a threshold to distinguish between unidirectional and nonunidirectional random fields, which allows the automatic classification of images.", "paper_title": "Detecting Directionality in Random Fields Using the Monogenic Signal", "paper_id": "WOS:000342416900040"}
