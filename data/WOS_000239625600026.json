The problems were the ones that typically cause reasoners the most difficulty because their prior beliefs about conclusions interfere with their judgments of deductive validity. The use Euler circles reliably contributed to reasoners' inability to solve the problems. This pattern was shown for both young, university students and elderly retired people.", "paper_title": "Deduction with Euler circles: Diagrams that hurt", "paper_id": "WOS:000239625600026"}
