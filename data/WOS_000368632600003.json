We introduce the abstract transfer functions, prove their correctness and demonstrate their efficiency. One strength of the domain is its simple abstraction of non-linear operations. These affine vectors also abstract input/output relations, which allows in particular modular analysis, proofs of user-defined complex invariants and test case generation. Finally, the affine vectors like parametrization is flexible enough to allow variations that yield different interesting abstractions, such as inner-approximations or abstraction of probabilistic information.", "paper_title": "A zonotopic framework for functional abstractions", "paper_id": "WOS:000368632600003"}
