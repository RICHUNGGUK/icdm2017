Both direct cause and second generation causes have been identified. In fact, determining the second generation effects (or forgotten effects) is one of the main contributions of this study as it shows that those causes that are usually not foreseen, at least in the first instance, affect notably in the expansion strategies of hotel chains in the medium and long term.", "paper_title": "The growth strategies in the hospitality industry from the perspective of the forgotten effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000336336100005"}
