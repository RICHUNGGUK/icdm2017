This paper shows that by \"relaxing\" task isolation, it is possible to efficiently deal with overruns in soft real-time systems with highly variable task execution times and proposes Randomized Dropping (RD), a novel overrun handling mechanism. RD is able to bound task overruns in a probabilistic manner, thus providing \"soft\" task isolation. The paper shows how to combine RD with priority-driven and rate-based scheduling algorithms, and how to analyze the resulting system. Performance evaluation and comparison between simulation and analytical results are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. and Civil-Comp Ltd.
