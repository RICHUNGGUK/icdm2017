However, in order to automate processes based on problem lists, the use of controlled vocabularies is required. We developed a methodology to extract a collection of standardized problem-related terms from medical documents entered in free text by physicians. Methods: We extracted a corpus of sentences describing problems from a randomized selection of admission notes collected at the University Hospitals of Geneva. Theses sentences underwent manual and automatic normalization processes, and a statistical clustering, in order to build a set of terms. Results: We obtained 17,805 sentences from 5000 admission notes. We refined them into 1546 terms, 88.6% of which could be related to a relevant problem statement. Discussion: A clinically relevant problems terminology was derived from clinical admission notes in free-text using a few methodical steps with a reasonable investment of human resources. Such an approach will ease the development and the use of problem lists better suited to user needs. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
