However, there is a conjecture on the existence of ISTs in graphs: If a graph G is n-connected (n >= 1), then there are n ISTs rooted at an arbitrary vertex in G. This conjecture has remained open for n >= 5. The n-dimensional crossed cube CQ(n) is a n-connected graph with various desirable properties, which is an important variant of the n-dimensional hypercube. In this paper, we study the existence and construction of ISTs in crossed cubes. We first give a proof of the existence of n ISTs rooted at an arbitrary vertex in CQ(n)(n >= 1). Then, we propose an O(Nlog(2)N) constructive algorithm, where N = 2(n) is the number of vertices in CQ(n). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
