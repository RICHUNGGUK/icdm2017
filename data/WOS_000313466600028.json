Our proposal is a kind of implicit data structure that introduces synchronism in the encoded sequence without using asymptotically any extra space. We show some experiments demonstrating that the technique is not only simple, but also competitive in time and space with existing solutions in several applications, such as the representation of LCP arrays or high-order entropy-compressed sequences.
