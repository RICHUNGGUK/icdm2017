In order to achieve the goal of service innovation, this study raises concerns regarding how an innovative e-service can be a systematic service process according to the proposed service design framework. However, the framework takes into account a novel service classification and individual criteria. Design/methodology/approach - This study addresses an intelligent service design using design science. According to the proposed framework, the service systems (e-services) are implemented by simulation. In this study, either service classification or the counterparts of service performance measures emerged from the ecological symbiosis perspective through analytic and synthetic methods. The proposed service design framework defines two dimensions - continuity of co-production and mutual adaptability - characterized by the process of exchanging service/benefit and building .relationship (i.e. partnership) involved within a service. The framework indicated how the interactions and the service/benefit exchange between the service provider and the consumer can work in a service process. The aim is to build a partnership by the service participants due to mutual adaptability in adapting to the counterpart of service (i.e. the service provider or the customer). Findings - Comparing with traditional service classification and service design, a more positive niche in systematic service innovation was established than before. According to the synthetic methodology, this study classifies the six categories of service based on ecological symbiosis perspectives. Examining individual service performance is derived from a set of criteria of species performance measures in ecological mutualism including proximate response, evolved dependence, and ultimate response. The service systems comply with the characteristics and criteria in the framework to demonstrate the sets of methodology for innovative service design. Practical implications - This study has yielded findings on both managerial insight on service innovation and the impact of service system design. Originality/value - The value of the framework is demonstrated through the diverse service systems. For example, digital content, interior design, or mobile phone design is characterized by service participants who embody knowledge-intensive attributes when engaged in their service process. In order to further complete a novel framework for service design, the question of evaluation that arises concerns the extent of ensuring the necessary service performance.", "paper_title": "A service design framework for value co-production: insight from mutualism perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000254029100017"}
