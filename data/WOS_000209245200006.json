The gain-boost class-C inverter behaves as a subthreshold amplifier. By introducing a gain-boost module, the inverter DC-gain is increased from 48 dB to 67 dB. The gain-boost classC inverter consumes 57 mu W at 1.2-V supply, where the gain-boost module consumes only 3 mu W. In addition, an on-chip body bias technique is introduced to compensate the process and supply voltage variations of the class-C inverter. The proposed inverter-based Sigma Delta modulator chip is implemented in 0.13-mu m CMOS process, and achieves 86-dB peak-signal to noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) and 90-dB dynamic range (DR) over 22.05-KHz bandwidth at 1.2-V supply consuming 360 mu W, which demonstrates that the gain-boost class-C inverter is particularly suitable for micro-power high-resolution applications.", "paper_title": "A Sigma Delta MODULATOR USING GAIN-BOOST CLASS-C INVERTER FOR AUDIO APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000209245200006"}
