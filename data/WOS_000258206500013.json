The system recognizes what is written onto paper and generates the LaTeX code. Text and equations are written on a regular paper using a board marker, and a USB camera attached to a computer is used to capture and record the pen-tip positions in each consecutive image frame. Characters and symbols are represented as separate finite state machines (FSMs). They are written in an isolated manner and they are recognized on-line using the FSMs. In the last step, LaTeX code corresponding to recognized characters and symbols is generated.
