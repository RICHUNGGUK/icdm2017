The network clustering by which the nodes are hierarchically organized on the basis of the proximity relieves this performance degradation. Finding the weakly connected dominating set (WCDS) is a promising approach for clustering the wireless Ad Hoc networks. Finding the minimum WCDS in the unit disk graph is an NP-Hard problem, and a host of approximation algorithms has been proposed. In this article, we first proposed a centralized approximation algorithm called DLA-CC based on distributed learning automata (DLA) for finding a near optimal solution to the minimum WCDS problem. Then, we propose a DILA-based clustering algorithm called DLA-DC for clustering the wireless Ad Hoc networks. The proposed cluster formation algorithm is a distributed implementation of DLA-CC, in which the dominator nodes and their closed neighbors assume the role of the cluster-heads and cluster members, respectively. In this article, we compute the worst case running time and message complexity of the clustering algorithm for finding a near optimal cluster-head set. We argue that by a proper choice of the learning rate of the clustering algorithm, a trade-off between the running time and message complexity of algorithm with the cluster-head set size (clustering optimality) can be made. The simulation results show the superiority of the proposed algorithms over the existing methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
