Based on a user profile, WBIS are able to behave according the particular needs of people through the intelligent adaptation of services, content, navigation interfaces, and many more factors. Thereby, the design of an approach devoted to meet such tasks is critical for achieving the goals pursued by WBIS. Therefore, in this article an approach oriented to elicit, state, and administrate user knowledge is outlined. This work introduces a user model, which supports the selection of teaching experiences that are delivered to students in the e-Learning field. The aim is to enhance the apprenticeship of individuals that receive lectures according to the user model that a Web-based Education System (WBES) holds about them. According to a sort of empirical Outcomes, it is concluded that: \"The success of WBIS is biased by the accurately acquisition, representation, and management of user knowledge fulfilled by the approach\".
