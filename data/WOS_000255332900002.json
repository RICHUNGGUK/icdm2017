A biological wastewater treatment plant falls into this category. The paper considers modelling such processes for monitorning and control purposes by using State - Space Wavelet Neural Networks (SSWN). The modelling method is illustrated based on bioreactors of the wastewater treatment plant. The learning algorithms and basis function (multidimensional wavelets) are also proposed. The simulation results based on real data record are presented.", "paper_title": "Modelling of wastewater treatment plant for monitoring and control purposes by state - Space wavelet networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000255332900002"}
