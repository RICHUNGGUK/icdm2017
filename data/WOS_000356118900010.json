However, fuzziness due to human judgment is neglected in current methodologies for predicting subjective IQA, where the fuzziness indicates assessment uncertainty. In this article, we propose a fuzzy regression method that accounts for fuzziness introduced through human judgment and the limitations of widely-used psychometric quality scales. We demonstrate how fuzzy regression models provide fuzziness information regarding subjective IQA. We benchmark the fuzzy regression method against the commonly used explicit modeling method for subjective IQA namely statistical regression by considering three real situations involving subjective image quality experiments where: (a) the number of participants is insufficient; (b) an insufficient amount of data is used for modelling; and (c) variant fuzziness is caused by human judgment. Results indicate that fuzzy regression models achieve more effective data fitting and better generalization capability when predicting subjective IQA under different types and levels of image distortion.
