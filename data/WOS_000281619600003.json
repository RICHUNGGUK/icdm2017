In this paper, we present the formalism of the quasi-triangulation based on a quasi-world model and define primitive query operators called quasi-operators for correct and efficient topology traversal on the quasi-triangulation. Algorithms for the quasi-operators are also presented based on the extended inter-world data structure. The proposed quasi-operators have the potential to be a fundamental platform on which efficient algorithms for application problems on quasi-triangulation can be correctly and easily developed. The recently announced powerful constructs of the beta-complex and the beta-shape are such examples. (C) Elsevier Ltd.
