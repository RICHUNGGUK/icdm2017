First, we discuss the negative effects of term correlation in query expansion algorithms, and we propose a novel and simple method (query clauses) to represent expanded queries which may alleviate some of these negative effects. Second, we discuss a method to optimize local query-expansion methods using genetic algorithms, and we apply this method to improve stemming. We evaluate this method with the novel query representation method and show very significant improvements for the problem of stemming optimization. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
