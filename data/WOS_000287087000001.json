The design of a system scheduling with communication over the FlexRay static segment is not an easy task because of protocol constraints and the demand for extensibility and flexibility. We study the problem of the ECU and FlexRay bus scheduling synthesis from the perspective of the application designer, interested in optimizing the scheduling subject to timing constraints with respect to latency- or extensibility-related metric functions. We provide solutions for a task and signal scheduling problem, including different task scheduling policies based on existing industry standards. The solutions are based on the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming optimization framework. We show the results of the application of the method to case studies consisting of an X-by-wire system on actual prototype vehicles.", "paper_title": "Schedule Optimization of Time-Triggered Systems Communicating Over the FlexRay Static Segment", "paper_id": "WOS:000287087000001"}
