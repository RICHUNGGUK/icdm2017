Many researches have been proposed to provide security transmission. However, they cannot effectively and efficiently resist colluding attacks. Therefore, we propose a collaborative routing protocol (CRP) to detect and isolate colluding attackers via monitor mechanism. Monitor nodes observe and record the behavior of intermediate nodes. Based on the records of intermediate nodes, source node can distinguish malicious nodes and isolate them. Finally, security analyses and simulation verify that CRP can effectively and efficiently resist black hole attacks, gray hole attacks, modify and fake packet attacks, rushing attacks, and collusion attacks.", "paper_title": "A collaborative routing protocol against routing disruptions in MANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000323520500009"}
