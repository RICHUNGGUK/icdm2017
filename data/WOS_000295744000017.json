Three important aspects are identified and investigated by performing parametric numerical studies on a large number of beams and columns of various cross-sections. Calculations have been performed by using sharp and rounded corners, and by using the conventional and the constrained finite strip method. On the basis of the results a simple and unambiguous method is proposed for the capacity prediction which requires sharp-cornered cross-sections only. The proposal is validated by comparison to test data. (C) 2011 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
