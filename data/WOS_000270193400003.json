We present hardness results for this problem for any constants 3 <= q < Q. For q >= 4, our result is based on Khot's 2-to-1 label cover, which is conjectured to be NP-hard [S. Khot, Proceedings of the 34th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2002, pp. 767-775]. For q = 3, we base our hardness result on a certain \"x-shaped\" variant of his conjecture. Previously no hardness result was known for q = 3 and Q >= 6. At the heart of our proof are tight bounds on generalized noise-stability quantities, which extend the recent work of Mossel, O'Donnell, and Oleszkiewicz [\"Noise stability of functions with low influences: Invariance and optimality,\" Ann. of Math. (2), to appear] and should have wider applicability.", "paper_title": "CONDITIONAL HARDNESS FOR APPROXIMATE COLORING", "paper_id": "WOS:000270193400003"}
