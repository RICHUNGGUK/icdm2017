In this paper, we consider permutation automata with the property that adding any non-permutation will lead to a synchronizing word and establish bounds on the lengths of such synchronizing words. In particular, we show that permutation groups whose permutation character over the rationals splits into a sum of only two irreducible characters have the desired property. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
