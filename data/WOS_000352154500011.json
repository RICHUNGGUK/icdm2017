Our technique takes the predicted eye motion into account when watching the video. Compared to traditional motion blur recorded by a video camera our approach results in a perceptual blur that is closer to reality. This postprocess can also be used to simulate different shutter effects or for other artistic purposes. It handles real and artificial video input, is easy to compute and has a low additional cost for rendered content. We illustrate its advantages in a user study using eye tracking.", "paper_title": "Temporal Video Filtering and Exposure Control for Perceptual Motion Blur", "paper_id": "WOS:000352154500011"}
