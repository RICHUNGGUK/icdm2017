The aircraft assignment problem is an NP-complete problem. A PSO-based approach incorporating four fuzzy measures of the predominance values for solving the problem is developed to help a military planner reduce the required planning time and provide a better strategy. Several simulations are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed decision aid.", "paper_title": "A PSO-based Decision Aid for Multi-Aircraft Combat Situations", "paper_id": "WOS:000260349600004"}
