The IPC method is generated by combining an explicit three-step method and an implicit two-step method. The methods are compared with the methods discussed in [T. Allahviranloo, N. Ahmady, E. Ahmady, Numerical solution of fuzzy differential equations by predictor-corrector method, Information Sciences 177(7) (2007) 1633-1647], and are shown to be more accurate. The convergence and stability of the proposed methods are also presented in detail. These methods are illustrated by solving some examples. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
