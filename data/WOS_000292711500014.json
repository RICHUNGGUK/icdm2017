The different possibilities are analyzed in practical and technical aspects, focusing on the implementation metrics, like cost, performance, complexity and reliability. The target architectures are divided into: server based, where the main processing element is a central computer: and embedded based, where the processing is distributed on devices attached to the animals. The initial classification model identifies the activities performed by the sows using a multi-process Kalman filter having, as input, 3-axes data from accelerometers. However, the power demanding hardware resources to run the filters require frequent battery recharges, making its use unsuitable in the current state-of-the-art. It motivated the development of a heuristic classification approach, focusing on the resource constrained characteristics of embedded systems. The new approach classifies the activities performed by the sows with accuracy close to 90%. It was implemented as a hardware module that can easily be instantiated to provide preprocessed information to models in order to detect important situations in the sows' life, e.g. the onset of farrowing.
