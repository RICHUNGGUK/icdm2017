Based on the experimental data and the leader inception discharge model, the complex gap discharge development during the process of entering equipotential and its influencing factors have been analyzed with the electric filed calculation method. Moreover, considering the practical conditions in live working sites, a complex gap discharge model appropriate for side live working on EHV and UHV high-voltage transmission lines has been proposed by introducing a revision coefficient km. It has been found that km is related to the working position and the structure of high-voltage electrode. Through further research on the establishment of the functional relationship, it can provide a comparable accurate theoretical calculation method for the research on the complex gap of live working and can give a guideline for optimizing the test plans.", "paper_title": "Research on Complex Gap Discharge Model of Live Working on EHV and UHV High-Voltage Transmission Lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000339449300002"}
