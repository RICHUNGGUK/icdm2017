Non-invasive estimation of the loads in the discs remains a challenge. In this study, we proposed a new technique to estimate in vivo loads in the IVD using a subject-specific finite element (FE) model of the disc and the kinematics of the disc endplates as input boundary conditions. The technique was validated by comparing the forces and moments in the discs calculated from the FE analyses to the in vitro experiment measurements of three corresponding lumbar discs. The results showed that the forces and moments could be estimated within an average error of 20%. Therefore, this technique can be a promising tool for non-invasive estimation of the loads in the discs and may be extended to be used on living subjects.", "paper_title": "A combined numerical and experimental technique for estimation of the forces and moments in the lumbar intervertebral disc", "paper_id": "WOS:000326351000004"}
