The uncertainties are time-varying but norm-bounded. The purpose is to design state feedback fuzzy controllers such that the resulting closed-loop system is robustly stable (for the stabilization problem) and robustly stable with an H-infinity performance level (for the H-infinity control problem). respectively. Sufficient conditions for the solvability of the two problems are obtained by utilizing a Lyapunov functional together with the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. When the LMIs are feasible. an explicit expression of a desired state feedback fuzzy controller is given. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed design method. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
