We model and analyze this system, showing that the presence of such MAI results in a significant degradation in BER performance. Simulation results show that for strong signal strength of interfering MAI signals degradation in BER performance is observed for the cases where we have five and 10 distinct MAI sources present when using Walsh-Hadamard thirty two chip spreading sequences. Using simulation, we investigate the use of other sets of orthogonal spreading sequences with improved cross correlation properties and find that for some sequences a significant improvement is seen compared to Walsh-Hadamard sequences when they are similarly misaligned. We show that MAI degrades the BER performance of such systems and that selection of improved cross correlation spreading code sequence sets improves BER.
