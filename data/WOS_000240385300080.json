Using Markov model to describe the transition rule of system calls of a process, an intrusion detection model based on the maximum likelihood short system call sequence is proposed. During the training phase, the Viterbi algorithm is used to obtain the maximum likelihood short system call sequence, which forms the normal profile database of a process, during the detecting phase, the system call sequence generated by a process is compared with the maximum likelihood sequence in its normal profile database to detect the intrusions. Experiments reveal good detection performance and quick computation speed of this model.", "paper_title": "An intrusion detection model based on the maximum likelihood short system call sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300080"}
