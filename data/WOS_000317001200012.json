In addition to counterfeit microelectronics, the theft or malicious modification of designs in the foundry can result in catastrophic damage to critical systems and large projects. In this letter, we describe a 3-D architecture that splits a design into two separate tiers: one tier that contains critical security functions is manufactured in a trusted foundry; another tier is manufactured in an unsecured foundry. We argue that a split manufacturing approach to hardware trust based on 3-D integration is viable and provides several advantages over other approaches.", "paper_title": "A 3-D Split Manufacturing Approach to Trustworthy System Development", "paper_id": "WOS:000317001200012"}
