Due to an increased rate of data collection, an extremely large amount of simulated data was required to correctly analyse and understand the experimental data. In order to meet requirements, the simulated data production was distributed to remote institutions, including those associated with the Australian Belle collaborators. Resources at the Australian Partnership for Advanced Computing (APAC) and partner facilities were leveraged in this effort. As part of this effort, the group began investigating the use of Grid technologies for the Belle collaboration. This paper will detail the effort expended towards deploying the Belle Monte Carlo production on the APAC National Grid.", "paper_title": "Towards Belle Monte Carlo production on the APAC National Grid infrastructure", "paper_id": "WOS:000245929700005"}
