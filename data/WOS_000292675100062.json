We have used a Zn(20+) pseudopotential which is essential for the adequate treatment of the exchange interaction in the self-energy. The accuracy of the pseudopotential used is also discussed. The effect of the p-d hybridization on the GW corrections to the band gap is correlated by comparing the ZB and RS phase. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
