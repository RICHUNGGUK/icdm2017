A scalable and efficient data center is crucial in both the construction and operation of stable cloud services. In recent years, the growing importance of data center networking has drawn much attention to related issues including connective simplification and service stability. However, existing DCNs lack the necessary agility for multi-tenant demands in the cloud, creating poor responsiveness and limited scalability. In this paper, we present an overview of data center networks for cloud computing and evaluate construction prototypes based on these issues. We provide, specifically, detailed descriptions of several important aspects: the physical architecture, virtualized infrastructure, and DCN routing. Each section of this work discusses and evaluates resolution approaches, and presents the use cases for cloud computing service. In our attempt to build insight relevant to future research, we also present some open research issues. Based on experience gained in both research and industrial trials, the future of data center networking must include careful consideration of the interactions between the important aspects mentioned above.
