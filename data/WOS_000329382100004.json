The problem is significant because in general there are many elements that require a name, and the names given have a strong influence on the understandability of that schema. We propose a guideline for every kind of element to which a conceptual modeler may give a name in UML. The guideline comprises the grammar form of the name and a pattern sentence. A name complies with our guideline if it has that form and the sentence generated from the pattern sentence is grammatically well-formed and semantically meaningful. The main novelty of our proposal is that it is (as far as we know) the first that provides a naming guideline for each kind of element of conceptual schemas in UML. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
