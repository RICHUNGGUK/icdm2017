This paper considers a variant of the Wodarz and Nowak mathematical model, adding \"aggressiveness\" as a new state variable in order to quantify the strength of the virus and its response to drugs. Although the model proposed is relatively simple, simulation results suggest that it may be useful in predicting the impact of the effectiveness of therapy on HIV dynamics.
