The system has been designed to help the visually impaired by responding intelligently to various situations that can occur in unrestricted natural outdoor environments when walking and finding the destinations. It involves the main functions of people detection, text recognition, face recognition. In addition, added sophisticated functions of walking path guidance using Differential Global Positioning System, obstacle detection using a stereo camera and voice user, interface are included. In order to operate all functions concurrently, we develop approaches in real situations and integrate them. Finally, we experiment on a prototype system under natural environments in order to verify our approaches. The results show that our approaches are applicable to real situations.", "paper_title": "A WALKING GUIDANCE SYSTEM FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED", "paper_id": "WOS:000262598100004"}
