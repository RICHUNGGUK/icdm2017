It involves 2 studies. In the first, a user-centered sound design method is used, based on one originally applied for visually impaired users. Three panels of end users are employed to collaboratively and iteratively design the required nonspeech sounds. The method ensures that the sounds designed are not based on designers' personal or ad hoc choices and instead exploits the creativity of a user group as an application of participatory sound design. Based on the results of this study, recommendations are made for extending the sound design method to novel interfaces and sighted users. A second study involves a formative evaluation of the information system integrated with the designed auditory feedback. This evaluation confirms that the user-centered sound design method leads to the creation of auditory feedback which conveys meaningful information to users.", "paper_title": "The Design and Formative Evaluation of Nonspeech Auditory Feedback for an Information System", "paper_id": "WOS:000357817600011"}
