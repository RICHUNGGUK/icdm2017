By expressing the problem in a more probabilistic light, several improvements and one correction are made, which enables the constructed bound to be significantly tighter. Several examples are given, showing how to implement the theoretical result.", "paper_title": "On upper bounds for the tail distribution of geometric sums of subexponential random variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000268788300002"}
