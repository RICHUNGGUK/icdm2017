The core technology of a semantic web is an artefact called an ontology. The major problem in constructing an ontology is the long period of time required. Another problem is the large number of possible meanings for the knowledge in the ontology. In this paper, we present a novel ontology construction based on artificial neural networks and a Bayesian network. First, we collected web pages related to the problem domain using search engines. The system then used the labels of the HTML tags to select keywords, and used WordNet to determine the meaningful keywords, called terms. Next, it calculated the entropy value to determine the weight of the terms. After the above steps, the projective adaptive resonance theory neural network clustered the collected web pages and found the representative term of each cluster of web pages using the entropy value. The system then used a Bayesian network to insert the terms and complete the hierarchy of the ontology. Finally, the system used a resource description framework to store and express the ontology results.", "paper_title": "Automating construction of a domain ontology using a projective adaptive resonance theory neural network and Bayesian network", "paper_id": "WOS:000258443300006"}
