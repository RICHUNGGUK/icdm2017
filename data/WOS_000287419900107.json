In this approach, recourse is taken to multiple methodologies to simultaneously capture the impersonal characteristics of the financial assets as well as the personal preferences of the investors. Accordingly, the paper draws on Investors' survey to capture their preferences, cluster analysis to categorize the financial assets, the analytical hierarchy process for obtaining local weights (performance scores) of the financial assets corresponding to the four key asset allocation criteria and fuzzy multi-objective linear programming model for portfolio selection.
