We review the reason for these failures, and show that only ideals generated by binomials may give a successful cryptosystem. As a consequence, we concentrate on binomial ideals that correspond to Euclidean lattices. We show how to build a cryptosystem based on lattice ideals and their Grobner bases, and, after breaking a simple variant, we construct a more elaborate one. In this variant the trapdoor information consists in a \"small\" change of coordinates that allows one to recover a \"fat\" Grobner basis. While finding a change of coordinates giving a fat Grobner basis is a relatively easy problem, finding a small one seems to be a hard optimization problem. This paper develops the details and proofs related to computer algebra, the cryptographic details related to security, the comparison with other lattice cryptosystems and discusses the implementation.
