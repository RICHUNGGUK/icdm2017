A wavelet neural network is used to approximate the unknown model uncertainties and disturbances, and an adaptive robust compensator is given to compensate the lumped uncertainty. Based on the stability and neural network approximation theory, several sufficient conditions are provided which guarantee the convergence of the feedback error system. Both simulation and experimental results are given to show the superior performance of the proposed intelligent control method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
