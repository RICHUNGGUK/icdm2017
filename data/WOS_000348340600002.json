When , a -SCHGDD of type is equivalent to a -cyclic holey difference matrix, denoted by a -CHDM. It is shown that there is a -CHDM if and only if and with the exception of and . When , the case of odd is considered. It is established that if and , then there exists a -SCHGDD of type if and only if and with some possible exceptions of and . The main results in this paper have been used to construct optimal two-dimensional optical orthogonal codes with weight and different auto- and cross-correlation constraints by the authors recently.", "paper_title": "Semi-cyclic holey group divisible designs with block size three", "paper_id": "WOS:000348340600002"}
