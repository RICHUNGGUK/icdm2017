Its algorithm originally assumes homogeneous registers, which are all gathered in the same register file. Although this register architecture is still common in most general-purpose processors, embedded processors often contain heterogeneous registers, which are scattered in physically different register files dedicated for each dissimilar purpose and use. In this work, we show that optimistic coalescing is also useful for an embedded processor to better handle such heterogeneity of the register architecture, and developed a modified algorithm for optimal coalescing that helps a register allocator. In the experiment, an existing register allocator was able to achieve up to 13.0% reduction in code size through our coalescing, and avoid many spills that would have been generated without our scheme.", "paper_title": "Register Coalescing Techniques for Heterogeneous Register Architecture with Copy Sifting", "paper_id": "WOS:000266818400008"}
