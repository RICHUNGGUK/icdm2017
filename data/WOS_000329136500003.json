To overcome the poor performance of MLC flash memory, a system architecture has been designed to optimize chip-level parallelism. This design increases the size of the page unit and the block unit, thereby simultaneously executing operations on multiple chips. Unfortunately, its Flash Translation Layer (FTL) generates many unused sectors in each page, which leads to unnecessary write operations. Furthermore, it reuses an earlier log block scheme, although it generates many erase operations because of its low space utilization. To solve these problems, we propose a hybrid associative FTL (Hybrid-FTL) to enhance the performance of the chip-level parallel flash memory system. Hybrid-FTL reduces the number of write operations by utilizing all of the unused sectors. Furthermore, it reduces the overall number of erase operations by classifying data as hot, cold, or fragment data. Hybrid-FTL requires less mapping information in the DRAM and in the flash memory compared with previous FTL algorithms.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Associative Flash Translation Layer for the Performance Optimization of Chip-Level Parallel Flash Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000329136500003"}
