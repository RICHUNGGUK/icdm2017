Most of existing methods either require a multi-camera capture setup or a restricted mannequin pose. We address the garment modeling problem according to a single input image. We design an all-pose garment outline interpretation, and a shading-based detail modeling algorithm. Our method first estimates the mannequin pose and body shape from the input image. It further interprets the garment outline with an oriented facet decided according to the mannequin pose to generate the initial 3D garment model. Shape details such as folds and wrinkles are modeled by shape-from-shading techniques, to improve the realism of the garment model. Our method achieves similar result quality as prior methods from just a single image, significantly improving the flexibility of garment modeling.", "paper_title": "Garment Modeling from a Single Image", "paper_id": "WOS:000327310800009"}
