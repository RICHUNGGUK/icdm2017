Digital elevation models (DEMs) provide quantitative elevation data, but it is the characterisation and extraction of geomorphologically significant measures (morphometric indices) from these raw data that form more informative and useful datasets. Common to many geographical measures, morphometric measures derived from DEMs are dependent on the scale of observation. This paper reports results of employing a fuzzy c-means classification for a sample DEM from Snowdonia. Wales, with a number of morphometric measures at different resolutions as input, and morphometric classification of landforms at each resolution as output. The classifications reveal that different landscape components or morphometric classes are important at different resolutions, and that morphometric classes exhibit resolution dependency in their geographical extents. Examination of the scale dependency and behaviour of morphometric classifications of landforms at different resolutions provides a fuller and more holistic view of the classes present than a single-scale analysis.
