The authors define backward design as opposed to regular forward design. A cross-functional viewpoint emphasizing downstream knowledge and lessons learned is introduced for proactive product design management. The study proposes several approaches for backward design endeavors, including Extended Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (EFMEA), Attributes Function Deployment (AFD), Feedback Tracking and Analysis System (FeTAS), Fuzzy Decision Tree, etc. Based on the backward design concerns, a cross-functional design management system is then established to serve as an incentive system for designer to incorporate cross-functional concerns. The contributions include: (1) Proposing backward design mechanisms; (2) Establishing a cross-functional design management system which is conducive to design for excellence. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
