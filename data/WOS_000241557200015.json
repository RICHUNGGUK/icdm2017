Parallel runtime environments have to support and adapt to the underlying libraries and hardware which require a high degree of scalability in dynamic environments. This paper presents the design of a scalable and fault tolerant protocol for supporting parallel runtime environment communications. The protocol is designed to support transmission of messages across multiple nodes with in a self-healing topology to protect against recursive node and process failures. A formal protocol verification has validated the protocol for both the normal and failure cases. We have implemented multiple routing algorithms for the protocol and concluded that the variant rule-based routing algorithm yields the best overall results for damaged and incomplete topologies.", "paper_title": "Scalable fault tolerant protocol for parallel runtime environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000241557200015"}
