A crucial requirement for future cognitive radio networks is wideband spectrum sensing: secondary users reliably detect spectral opportunities across a wide frequency range. In this article, various wideband spectrum sensing algorithms are presented, together with a discussion of the pros and cons of each algorithm and the challenging issues. Special attention is paid to the use of sub-Nyquist techniques, including compressive sensing and multichannel sub-Nyquist sampling techniques.", "paper_title": "WIDEBAND SPECTRUM SENSING FOR COGNITIVE RADIO NETWORKS: A SURVEY", "paper_id": "WOS:000318518300012"}
