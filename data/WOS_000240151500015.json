According to the general form of norm, we classify the norm into three kinds of rules expressed by the logical predications. Combining with cooperative theory and speech-act theory, we first propose an organizational relationship graph of role, behavior and rule of CSCW systems and then a logical predication-based model. This model is referred to as the organizational model that is used to describe the relationship graph. In addition, we present the OSM, which can check the logical conflict among the rules and insure semantic completeness. And the dynamical changes of rules and roles can be delineated exactly by the OSM. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
