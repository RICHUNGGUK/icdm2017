Based on this definition we derive an efficient interface specification as a set of C++ classes. This interface separates the applications from the grid data structures. Thus, user implementations become independent of the underlying grid implementation. Modern C++ template techniques are used to provide an interface implementation without big performance losses. The implementation is realized as part of the software environment DUNE (http://dune-project.org/). Numerical tests demonstrate the flexibility and the efficiency of our approach.", "paper_title": "A generic grid interface for parallel and adaptive scientific computing.
