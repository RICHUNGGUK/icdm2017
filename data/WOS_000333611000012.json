Designed and simulated in 0.11 mu m CMOS technology, the oscillator provides a clock signal at the frequency of 20 kHz with a temperature coefficient of 314 ppm/ A degrees C over a range from -20 to 80 A degrees C. The oscillator's output signal frequency has a standard deviation of 7.9 % under the influence of device mismatches. It operates with a supply voltage of 1.2 V and has a dynamic power consumption of 4.9 mu W at room temperature. An integrated voltage and current reference generator was developed to provide two reference voltages at 484.6 and 663.5 mV with simulated temperature coefficients of 7.5 and 16 ppm/ A degrees C over a range from -20 to 80 A degrees C respectively, as well as a reference current of 26.84 nA with a temperature coefficient of 166 ppm/ A degrees C over the same temperature range.", "paper_title": "A low-power temperature-compensated CMOS relaxation oscillator", "paper_id": "WOS:000333611000012"}
