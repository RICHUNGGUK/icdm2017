This algorithm will work with a simple map that does not include complete information about the non-static environment. With only an initial incomplete map, a mobile robot cannot estimate its pose because of the inconsistency between the real observations from the environment and the predicted observations on the incomplete map. The proposed localization algorithm uses the approach of sampling from a non-corrupted window, which allows the mobile robot to estimate its pose more robustly in a non-static environment even when subjected to severe corruption of observations. The algorithm sequence involves identifying the corruption by comparing the real observations with the corresponding predicted observations of all particles, sampling particles from a non-corrupted window that consists of multiple non-corrupted sets, and filtering sensor measurements to provide weights to particles in the corrupted sets. After localization, the estimated path may still contain some errors due to long-term corruption. These errors can be corrected using nonlinear constrained least-squares optimization. The incomplete map is then updated using both the corrected path and the stored sensor information. The performance of the proposed algorithm was verified via simulations and experiments in various highly non-static environments. Our localization algorithm can increase the success rate of tracking its pose to more than 95% compared to estimates made without its use. After that, the initial incomplete map is updated based on the localization result.", "paper_title": "Robust mobile robot localization in highly non-static environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000277697400001"}
