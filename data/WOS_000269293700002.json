To deal with those constraints appeared in CDL documents, which cannot be captured by its meta model (XML Schema) totally, we design a machine-based constraint language based on B Method, which uses abstract machines to represent the constraints of the relations among XML nodes. After modelling the constraints, the corresponding checking algorithm can be designed to implement the static validation of CDL documents. Meanwhile, the checking algorithm is integrated into the WS-CDL editor plug-in for Eclipse project. The case studies show that our approach is effective for real examples in practice.
