This capacitor includes metallic graphene layers which are separated by an insulating medium containing a few h-BN layers. It has been observed that the elements from group IIIA of the periodic table are more suitable as dopants for heterostructures of the {metallic graphene/hBN/metallic graphene} capacitors compared to those from groups IA or IIA. In this study, we have specifically focused on the dielectric properties of different graphene/h-BN/graphene including their heterostructure counterparts, i.e., Boron-graphene/h-BN/Borongraphene, Al-graphene/h-BN/Al-graphene, Mg-graphene/hBN/Mg-graphene, and Be-graphene/h-BN/Be-graphene stacks for monolayer form of dielectrics. Moreover, we studied the multi dielectric properties of different (h-BN) n/graphene hetero-structures of Boron-graphene/(h-BN) n/Boron-graphene.", "paper_title": "Metal-doped graphene layers composed with boron nitride-graphene as an insulator: a nano-capacitor", "paper_id": "WOS:000349080300010"}
