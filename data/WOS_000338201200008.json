Using active learning, we learn a model M (R) of reference implementation R, which serves as input for a model-based testing tool that checks conformance of implementation I to M (R) . In addition, we also explore an alternative approach in which we learn a model M (I) of implementation I, which is compared to model M (R) using an equivalence checker. Our work uses a unique combination of software tools for model construction (Uppaal), active learning (LearnLib, Tomte), model-based testing (JTorX, TorXakis) and verification (CADP, MRMC). We show how these tools can be used for learning models of and revealing errors in implementations, present the new notion of a conformance oracle, and demonstrate how conformance oracles can be used to speed up conformance checking.", "paper_title": "Improving active Mealy machine learning for protocol conformance testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000338201200008"}
