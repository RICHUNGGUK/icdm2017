Such study is formulated as the pathway enrichment analysis, which identifies relevant pathways functional enriched in highthroughput data. The question faced here is how to analyze different data types in a unified and integrative way by characterizing pathways that these data simultaneously reveal. To this end, we developed integrative Pathway Enrichment Analysis Platform, iPEAP, which handles transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and GWAS data under a unified aggregation schema. iPEAP emphasizes on the ability to aggregate various pathway enrichment results generated in different high-throughput experiments, as well as the quantitative measurements of different ranking results, thus providing the first benchmark platform for integration, comparison and evaluation of multiple types of data and enrichment methods.", "paper_title": "iPEAP: integrating multiple omics and genetic data for pathway enrichment analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000332259300021"}
