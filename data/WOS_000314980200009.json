This paper presents a novel supervised structure dictionary learning (SSDL) algorithm to learn a discriminative and block structure dictionary. We associate label information with each dictionary item and make each class-specific sub-dictionary in the whole structured dictionary have good representation ability to the training samples from the associated class. More specifically, we learn a structured dictionary and a multiclass classifier simultaneously. Adding an inhomogeneous representation term to the objective function and considering the independence of the class-specific sub-dictionaries improve the discrimination capabilities of the sparse coordinates. An iteratively optimization method be proposed to solving the new formulation. Experimental results on four face databases demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms recently proposed competing sparse coding methods.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL SUPERVISED STRUCTURE DICTIONARY LEARNING FOR CLASSIFICATION BASED ON SPARSE REPRESENTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000314980200009"}
