In the linear statement and under the assumption that the support moves without inertia at a bounded velocity, a time-optimal motion of the rod from an arbitrary initial state with a nonzero velocity to a vertical unstable equilibrium position with the zero velocity of the rod at this position is found assuming that the point of support must travel a prescribed distance. The domain where a solution exists is found. Formulas for determining the switch times of the support velocity depending on the boundary conditions are obtained. A numerical example illustrating the procedure of choosing the control depending on the initial position of the rod in the absence of disturbances is considered.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of time-optimal control of inverted rod", "paper_id": "WOS:000298360400004"}
