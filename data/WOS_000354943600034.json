Among other results, the analysis reveals how combination policies influence the learning process of networked agents, and how these policies can steer the convergence point toward any of many possible Pareto optimal solutions. The results also establish that the learning process of an adaptive network undergoes three (rather than two) well-defined stages of evolution with distinctive convergence rates during the first two stages, while attaining a finite mean-square-error level in the last stage. The analysis reveals what aspects of the network topology influence performance directly and suggests design procedures that can optimize performance by adjusting the relevant topology parameters. Interestingly, it is further shown that, in the adaptation regime, each agent in a sparsely connected network is able to achieve the same performance level as that of a centralized stochastic-gradient strategy even for left-stochastic combination strategies. These results lead to a deeper understanding and useful insights on the convergence behavior of coupled distributed learners. The results also lead to effective design mechanisms to help diffuse information more thoroughly over networks.", "paper_title": "On the Learning Behavior of Adaptive Networks-Part I: Transient Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000354943600034"}
