It is interesting to find more languages like these that witness the superiority of 2QCFA over 2PFA. In this paper, we consider the language L-m = {xcy vertical bar Sigma = {a, b, c}, x, y epsilon {a, b}*, |x| = |y|} that is similar to the middle language L-middle = {xay vertical bar x, y epsilon {a, b}*, |x| = |y|}. We prove that the language L-m can be recognized by 2QCFA with one-sided error in polynomial expected time. Also,we show that Lm can be recognized by 2PFA with bounded error, but only in exponential expected time. Thus Lm is another witness of the fact that 2QCFA are more powerful than their classical counterparts.", "paper_title": "SOME LANGUAGES RECOGNIZED BY TWO-WAY FINITE AUTOMATA WITH QUANTUM AND CLASSICAL STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000309470000010"}
