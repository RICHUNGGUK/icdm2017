Little is known about the degree to which the culture of patient safety is associated with behavioral intention to use bar code medication administration. Based on the Technology Acceptance Model, this study evaluated the relationships among patient safety culture and perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention to use bar code medication administration technology among nurses in hospitals. Cross-sectional surveys with a convenience sample of 163 nurses using bar code medication administration were conducted. Feedback and communication about errors had a positive impact in predicting perceived usefulness (beta = .26, P < .01) and perceived ease of use (beta = .22, P < .05). In a multiple regression model predicting for behavioral intention, age had a negative impact (beta = -.17, P < .05); however, teamwork within hospital units (beta = .20, P < .05) and perceived usefulness (beta = .35, P < .01) both had a positive impact on behavioral intention. The overall bar code medication administration behavioral intention model explained 24% (P < .001) of the variance. Identified factors influencing bar code medication administration behavioral intention can help inform hospitals to develop tailored interventions for RNs to reduce medication administration errors and increase patient safety by using this technology.", "paper_title": "Analysis of the Technology Acceptance Model in Examining Hospital Nurses' Behavioral Intentions Toward the Use of Bar Code Medication Administration", "paper_id": "WOS:000353343500004"}
