With the HPM, the solution can be obtained in the form of a convergent power series with terms that can be easily computed. The method does not need linearization and provides an analytical solution by utilizing only the initial condition. We also show that the HPM can generate highly accurate analytical solutions.", "paper_title": "The Coupled Viscous Burgers Equations with Fractional-Time Derivative by the Homotopy Perturbation Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000288527400006"}
