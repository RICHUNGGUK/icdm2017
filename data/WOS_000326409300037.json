We find a synchronized pair of frames using edge coherence by computing the maximum number of overlapped edge pixels between the color video and depth-map video in regions of temporal frame difference. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be used for synchronization of depth-based 3D video and that it is robust against Gaussian noise with sigma = less than 30 and video compression by H.264/AVC with QP = less than 44.", "paper_title": "Frame Synchronization for Depth-Based 3D Video Using Edge Coherence", "paper_id": "WOS:000326409300037"}
