These PEC were determined using potential parameters obtained through molecular beam scattering experiments and accurate theoretical calculation, respectively. It was found that the theoretical rovibrational energies are in a good agreement (only for the lowest numbers of vibrational states) with those obtained through experimental PEC. Another important conclusions was regarding the calculated first two rovibrational energies for the H2O-Ar system, that are in a good agreement with the experimental data.", "paper_title": "Rovibrational energies and spectroscopic constants for H2O-Ng complexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000345626700002"}
