It is really hard to get the summary of a large image set without browsing through the entire collection. In this paper two different techniques of image cropping (random windows technique and sequential windows technique) have been proposed to generate effective representative sets. A ranking mechanism has been also proposed for finding the best representative set.", "paper_title": "Generating Representative Sets and Summaries for Large Collection of Images Using Image Cropping Techniques and Result Comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000369851900032"}
