We study five catalytic biomass-to-fuels strategies that rely on production of platform chemicals, such as levulinic acid and fermentable sugars. We first integrate catalytic conversion subsystems with separation subsystems to generate complete conversion strategies, and we then develop the corresponding process simulation models based on experimental results. Our analyses suggest that catalytic biomass-to-fuel conversion strategies could become economically competitive alternatives to current biofuel production approaches as a result of iterative experimental and computational efforts.
