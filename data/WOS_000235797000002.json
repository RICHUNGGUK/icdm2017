Here, We use an attractor neural-network model of the cortical circuitry and investigate the effects of patchy connectivity, both on the properties of the network and the attractor dynamics. An analysis of the network shows that the signal-to-noise ratio of the synaptic potential sums are improved by the patchy connectivity, which results in a higher storage capacity. This analysis is performed for both the Hopfield and Willshaw learning rules and the results are confirmed by simulation experiments. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
