The closed-loop source-DVR-PBC-load system is asymptotically stable at all operating points, with practically very slight constraints; its transient response is faster than with classical controllers, and does not present overshoots. These characteristics do not depend on source voltage disturbances, the kind of load, or parameter variations. The PBC uses less digital operations than the PI, and does not require dq transformations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
