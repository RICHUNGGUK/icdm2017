According to the network security impact parameters, eight security elements and classification standard are obtained. At the same time, the dynamic classification algorithm based on fuzzy theory is also presented. The experimental analysis results show that the proposed model and algorithm are feasible and effective. The model is a good way to solve a safety problem that the static defense cannot cope with tactics and lack of dynamic change.", "paper_title": "Defense Strategy of Network Security based on Dynamic Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000370180200021"}
