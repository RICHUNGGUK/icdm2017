The task of the decoder is to decide whether transmission has taken place, and if so, to decode the message. We derive the optimum detection/decoding rule in the sense of the best tradeoff among the probabilities of decoding error, false alarm, and misdetection. For this detection/decoding rule, we then derive single-letter characterizations of the exact exponential rates of these probabilities for the average code in the ensemble. It is shown that previously proposed decoders are in general strictly suboptimal.", "paper_title": "Codeword or Noise?
