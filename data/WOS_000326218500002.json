Based on data from 463 large e-retailers in the United States and Canada, interesting findings are obtained indicating that Web machine interactivity and mobile person interactivity have significantly positive impacts on e-retailers' operational performance, whereas Web person interactivity and mobile machine interactivity do not. Furthermore, machine interactivity on a Web interface (i.e., mobile machine interactivity) has a stronger impact than machine interactivity on mobile interfaces, and person interactivity is more influential on mobile interfaces (i.e., mobile person interactivity) than on Web interfaces (i.e., Web person interactivity). E-retailers' operational performance is found to have a significantly positive impact on e-retailers' financial performance. Overall, this study provides in-depth insights into the differential roles of machine and person interactivity on Web and mobile interfaces in affecting e-retailers' performance. Implications for research and practice as well as suggestions for future research are discussed.", "paper_title": "DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT OF WEB AND MOBILE INTERACTIVITY ON E-RETAILERS' PERFORMANCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000326218500002"}
