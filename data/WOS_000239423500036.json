Such requirements can not be satisfied with the conventional centralized system, due to the dynamic changes of user requirements. Autonomous Decentralized Community System (ADCS) has been proposed to realize a system that satisfies such requirements. The system realizes flexibility to cope with dynamic changes in the environment, but since ADCS is a pure decentralized system, the system has no existence that monitors the whole system to maintain timeliness, which is an essential factor for assurance. In this paper, Autonomous Construction Technology is proposed to improve the response time, which integrates and divides a community in order to achieve the optimal size depending on the changes in environment. The effectiveness is verified through simulation.", "paper_title": "Autonomous construction technology of community for achieving high assurance service", "paper_id": "WOS:000239423500036"}
