Then, the authors extract impedances between any numbers of embedded contacts. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The paper proposes a new substrate network 3D extraction technique, adapted from a transmission line method or Green kernels, but in the whole volume. Findings - Extracting impedances between any numbers of embedded contacts with variable shapes or/and through silicon via. This 3D method is much faster comparing with FEM Originality/value - Previous works consider TSVs alone, contacts onto the substrate. The authors do study entanglement between the substrate and the interconnections.", "paper_title": "Through silicon vias: from a physical point of view to a compact models initiation", "paper_id": "WOS:000341713000027"}
