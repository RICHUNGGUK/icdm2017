JPEG2000 supports ROI coding and can decode ROIs preferentially regardless of the shape and number of the regions. However, if the number of regions is quite large, the ROI coding performance of JPEG2000 declines because the code-stream includes many useless non-ROI codes. This paper proposes a wavelet-based ROI coding method suited for multiple ROIs. The proposed wavelet transform does not access any non-ROIs when transforming the ROIs. Additionally, the proposed method eliminates the need for unnecessary coding of the bits in the higher bit planes of non-ROI regions by adding an ROI map to the code-stream. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio than the ROI coding of JPEG2000. The proposed method can be applied to both max-shift and scaling-based ROI coding.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Wavelet-Based ROI Coding for Multiple Regions", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466100009"}
