Ocean temperatures determine climate and wind patterns that affect life on land. Freshwater in lakes and rivers covers less than 1%. Its contamination seriously damages ecosystems. The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) is defined as a world-wide network of smart interconnected underwater objects that enables to monitor vast unexplored water areas. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how to benefit from the IoUT to learn from, exploit and preserve the natural underwater resources. In this paper, the IoUT is introduced and its main differences with respect to the Internet of Things (IoT) are outlined. Furthermore, the proposed IoUT architecture is described. Important application scenarios that illustrate the interaction of IoUT components have been proposed. Critical challenges have been identified and addressed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
