However, little has been done by researchers to compare the performance of this test to other normality tests. This paper therefore measures the performance of the SF and other normality tests by studying the distribution of their p-values. For the purpose of this study, we selected eight well-known normality tests to compare with the SF test: (i) Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS), (ii) Anderson-Darling (AD), (iii) Cramer von Mises (CM), (iv) Lilliefors (LF), (v) Shapiro-Wilk (SW), (vi) Pearson chi-square (PC), (vii) Jarque-Bera (JB) and (viii) D'Agostino (DA). The distribution of p-values of these normality tests were obtained by generating data from normal distribution and well-known symmetric non-normal distribution at various sample sizes (small, medium and large). Our simulation results showed that the SF normality test was the best test statistic in detecting deviation from normality among the nine tests considered at all sample sizes.", "paper_title": "Shapiro-Francia test compared to other normality test using expected p-value", "paper_id": "WOS:000357936100003"}
