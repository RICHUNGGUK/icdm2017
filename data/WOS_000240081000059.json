However, RFID systems have some privacy problems. In this paper, a system for missing child location tracking in the EPC Network applications, is proposed. The proposed system improves security and privacy compared to existing applications, while also keeping in line with traditional procedures, commonly accepted by most industrial applications. The proposed MOLT (Missing Child Location Tracking) system can protect users' privacy while providing location tracking of the RFID tag.", "paper_title": "An RFID system based MOLT system with improved privacy", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000059"}
