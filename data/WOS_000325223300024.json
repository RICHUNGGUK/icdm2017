Using correlated web images significantly improves the exemplar-based SR. Given a low-resolution (LR) image, we extract local descriptors from its up-sampled version and bundle the descriptors according to their spatial relationship to retrieve correlated high-resolution (HR) images from the web. Though similar in content, the retrieved images are usually taken with different illumination, focal lengths, and shot perspectives, resulting in uncertainty for the HR detail approximation. To solve this problem, we first propose aligning these images to the up-sampled LR image through a global registration, which identifies the corresponding regions in these images and reduces the mismatching. Second, we propose a structure-aware matching criterion and adaptive block sizes to improve the mapping accuracy between LR and HR patches. Finally, these matched HR patches are blended together by solving an energy minimization problem to recover the desired HR image. Experimental results demonstrate that our SR scheme achieves significant improvement compared with four state-of-the-art schemes in terms of both subjective and objective qualities.", "paper_title": "Landmark Image Super-Resolution by Retrieving Web Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000325223300024"}
