We parallel the research in intelligibility of non-native speech, but instead of linguistic unit recognition we focus on the perception of the foreign accent strength. First, the question of type and degree of perceptual deficiencies occurring along with certain types of signal degradation is tackled. Second, we measure correlations between the accent ratings and certain candidate phenomena that may influence them, e.g., articulation rate, temporal patterning, contrasts in sound pressure levels on selected syllables and F0 variation. The impacts of different types of signal degradation help to estimate the role of segmental/suprasegmental information in assessments of foreignness in Czech English. The full appreciation of the strength of foreign accent is apparently not possible without fine phonetic detail on the segmental level. However, certain suprasegmental features of foreignness are robust enough to manifest at severe levels of signal degradation. Pair-wise variability indices of vowel durations and variation in F0 tracks seem to guide the listener even better in the degraded than in the 'clean' speech signal. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
