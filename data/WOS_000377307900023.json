The throughput of the secondary user is derived in different cases with constraints on the primary user average or instantaneous received interference power. The analysis is based on some recent results on the achievable rates of finite-length codes and shows the effect of the codeword length on the performance of spectrum sharing networks. The results indicate that, with codewords of finite length and different primary user's interference constraints, there is potential for spectrum sharing, if the transmission power is properly adapted.", "paper_title": "Finite Block-Length Analysis of Spectrum Sharing Networks: Interference-Constrained Scenario", "paper_id": "WOS:000377307900023"}
