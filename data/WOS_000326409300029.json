Therefore, this letter proposes the improved scheme for hybrid STBC systems. STBC and SM schemes are combined for the hybrid space-time block code system. Our approach effectively obtains both diversity gain and spectral efficiency gain. The proposed scheme offers improved BER performance since it uses iterative detection. Moreover, it increases the data rate effectively with a little performance loss.", "paper_title": "Improved Transmit and Detection Scheme for Hybrid STBC in MIMO-OFDM Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000326409300029"}
