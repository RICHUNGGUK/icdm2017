In the usual semantics of process algebras for modeling biological systems actions are instantaneous. When different scale levels of biological systems are considered in a single model, one should take into account that actions at a level may take much more time than actions at a lower level. Moreover, it might happen that while a component is involved in one long lasting high level action, it is involved also in several faster lower level actions. Hence, we propose a process algebra with operations and with a semantics aimed at dealing with these aspects of multiscale modeling. We give both a reduction semantics and an SOS semantics for our new algebra with a result of operational correspondence between the two. Moreover, we study behavioral equivalences for such an algebra and give some examples. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
