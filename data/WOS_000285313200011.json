We formulate this problem as a binary labeling task where we separate the salient object from the background. We propose a set of novel features, including multiscale contrast, center-surround histogram, and color spatial distribution, to describe a salient object locally, regionally, and globally. A conditional random field is learned to effectively combine these features for salient object detection. Further, we extend the proposed approach to detect a salient object from sequential images by introducing the dynamic salient features. We collected a large image database containing tens of thousands of carefully labeled images by multiple users and a video segment database, and conducted a set of experiments over them to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Learning to Detect a Salient Object", "paper_id": "WOS:000285313200011"}
