By docking a model peptide of angiotensin II in the AT(2) receptor model two plausible binding modes were identified. These binding modes were in agreement with most of the suggested ligand-receptor contact points reported in the literature. Eight active and one inactive pseuclopeptide angiotensin II analogue were also docked in the receptor and four of the active pseudopeptides were found to mimic the binding mode of angiotensin II. An alternative binding mode for the other four active pseudopeptides was found. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
