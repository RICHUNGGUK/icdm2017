Design/methodology/approach - Analytical prediction of the different reluctances in the core, the permanent magnets, and the air. These reluctances characterize the paths of both main and leakage fluxes. Then, a validation of the proposed reluctance model is carried out using FEA. An interesting application of the proposed reluctance consists in the assessment of the TFPM torque production capability. Findings - The torque yielded by the reluctance model of the TFPM and the one computed using 3D-FEA are in good agreement. This result is of great importance in so far as the CPU time required for 3D-FEA computation is much more higher than the one consumed in the resolution of the reluctance model. Research limitations/implications - Further validation of the results yielded by the proposed reluctance model through their comparison with experimental measurements shall be treated in the future. Practical implications - The proposed reluctance model is of great interest for the TFPM sizing. It could be useful in the pre-design procedure of the machine. Originality/value - The paper proposes a new reluctance model where the leakage fluxes are accurately predicted.", "paper_title": "On the modeling of a TFPM by reluctance network including the saturation effect with emphasis on the leakage fluxes", "paper_id": "WOS:000288567800011"}
