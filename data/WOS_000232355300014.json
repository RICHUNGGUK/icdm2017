In this paper, we suggest a novel query optimization scheme (Semantic Dual Query Expansion, SDQE) that makes full use of the context information supplied by the local document collection. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is used to explore the local context information. By comparing the different local context information hidden in different document collections, it is possible to solve the synonymy-polysemy problem in VSM. The experiments prove that our scheme is effective to improve the retrieval performance in P2P systems without knowing the global statistic information. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
