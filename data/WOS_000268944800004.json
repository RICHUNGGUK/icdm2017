Improved models are developed for both the interdigital capacitor and the shorted stub inductor including its ground via hole. Subsequent optimal formulas are recommended to model these components with their parasitic effects. The models and formulas are verified by both full-wave and experimental results. A CAD program with a friendly GUI, available online, is provided and its operation is described in details. This program allows a very fast design of the CRLH structure, and its synthesis parameters are proven very accurate without any full-wave optimization. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
