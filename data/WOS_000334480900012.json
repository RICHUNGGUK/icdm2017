The technique relies on constructing Green's function before establishing the recursive scheme for the solution components. In contrast to the existing recursive schemes based on the ADM, the proposed technique avoids solving a sequence of transcendental equations for the undetermined coefficients. It approximates the solution in the form of a series with easily computable components. Additionally, the convergence analysis and the error estimate of the proposed method are supplemented. The reliability and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by several numerical examples. The numerical results reveal that the proposed method is very efficient and accurate.
