In this paper, we evaluate the performance of selective space-time block coding (selective-STBC) and antenna selection diversity, and analyze the performance of both techniques under perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) available at both ends of the transmission link. Our performance analysis reveals that, under perfect or imperfect CSI and ideal feedback channel, selective-STBC yields a loss in selection diversity gains and that selecting just a single antenna at the transmitter side is the best transmission strategy. We also show that selective-STBC and antenna selection diversity have different behaviors when the feedback channel is imperfect. Indeed, it is shown that selection diversity outperforms selective-STBC when the feedback channel is of high quality, while selective-STBC yields better performance when the feedback channel is of low quality.
