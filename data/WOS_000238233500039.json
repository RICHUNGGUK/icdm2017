Employing a simple precharging scheme, IPFF provides high operating speed. MCPFF, on the other hand, provides low power operations by implementing the edge-triggering function with complementary pass transistors. Performance comparison indicates that IPFF operates at the highest speed and MCPFF consumes the lowest power among the seven LCFFs under evaluation.", "paper_title": "Level converting flip-flops for high-speed and low-power applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500039"}
