Design/methodology/approach - The research involves identifying a system architecture, testing its prototype, deciding journal selection criteria and priority publisher selection criteria, and defining metadata sets. Findings - The paper finds that production system and archiving system models are being implemented and tested. Implementation of the delivery system module is in progress. Preservation strategies will be identified. Practical implications - The KESLI electronic journal digital archive project is proceeding toward completion of its tasks by the end of 2007. Originality/value - The observations and lessons in the paper provide insights into building a digital archive of electronic journals that can be used as a basis for building similar digital archives in other countries.", "paper_title": "Korean Electronic Site License Initiative: archiving of electronic journals", "paper_id": "WOS:000243028200008"}
