We prove that, if the monoid is cancellative, then our inclusion problem is polynomially reducible to the problem of testing equivalence of straight-line programs in the same monoid. As an application, we obtain a polynomial time algorithm for testing if a context-free language is included in a Dyck language (the best previous algorithm for this problem was doubly exponential).", "paper_title": "THE INCLUSION PROBLEM OF CONTEXT-FREE LANGUAGES: SOME TRACTABLE CASES", "paper_id": "WOS:000287762800003"}
