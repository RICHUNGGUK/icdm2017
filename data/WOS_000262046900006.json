Generalized minimurn aberration (GMA) and uniformity are two important criteria for evaluating both regular and non-regular designs. The generation of GMA designs is a non-trivial problem due to the sequential optimization nature of the criterion. Based oil ail analytical expression between the generalized wordlength pattern and a uniformity measure, this paper converts the generation of GMA designs to a constrained optimization problem, and provides effective algorithms for solving this particular problem. Moreover, many new designs with GMA or near-GMA are reported. which are also (nearly) optimal under the uniformity measure.
