The OR operational cost and patients' satisfaction need to be balanced. We optimize the scheduling of surgeries with two priority levels in an integrated manner, given the OR is off-duty for a fixed period. Surgeon's accumulated tiredness during working hours, and controllable surgery durations are modeled. After deriving the NP-hardness of the problem, we first solve optimally two special cases in pseudo-polynomial time, and then design a hybrid evolutionary multi-objective algorithm for the general case. Iterated local search is embedded into the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) framework, and Pareto optimal property is utilized to guide evolution towards promising areas in solution space. Finally computational studies with data from a hospital in P.R. China are performed to verify the value of algorithm hybridization against the commercial solver and original NSGA-II, and to verify the value of integrated optimization against sequential decision-making.", "paper_title": "Prioritized surgery scheduling in face of surgeon tiredness and fixed off-duty period", "paper_id": "WOS:000363033600010"}
