One possible class of congestion control strategies predicts the departure throughput, and recommends a rate at which to release aircraft pushbacks from the gate. This paper describes the field-testing of these types of strategies at Boston Logan International Airport, focusing on the communication of the suggested rate to the air traffic controller, and additional support for its implementation. Two Android tablet computers were used for the field-tests; one to input the data and the other to display the recommended rate to the air traffic controllers. Two potential decision-support displays were tested: a rate control display that only presented a color-coded suggested pushback rate and a volume control display that provided additional support to the controllers on the number of aircraft that had called-ready and had been released. A survey of controllers showed that they had found the decision-support tool easy to use, especially the additional functionality that is provided by the aircraft volume control display. The field tests were also found to yield significant operational benefits showing that such a congestion control strategy could be effective in practice.", "paper_title": "A Decision Support Tool for the Pushback Rate Control of Airport Departures", "paper_id": "WOS:000337961300011"}
