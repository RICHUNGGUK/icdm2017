Roughly speaking, we show that every pseudorandom sequence, that is, any sequence with small correlation measure up to a sufficiently large order, cannot have a large discrete Fourier transform, ambiguity, or Hamming-autocorrelation. Conversely, there are sequences, for example the two-prime generator, with large correlation measure of order 4 but small discrete Fourier transform, ambiguity, autocorrelation, and Hamming-autocorrelation.", "paper_title": "On discrete Fourier transform, ambiguity, and Hamming-autocorrelation of pseudorandom sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000339826100004"}
