An event that needs a single actuator response is sensed by one of the sensors, which then performs the search for the closest actuator to respond by means of the iMesh cross-lookup. The basic iMesh protocol is reported to have 95% efficiency in finding the closest service. We confirmed that result, and improved the efficiency by using the localized auction aggregation protocol (k-SAAP). The actuator found by the iMesh lookup starts the auction to find if there is a closer actuator among the actuator neighbors up to k-hops away. In our simulations, we consider scenarios where the sensors are placed in a rectangular grid, while the actuators form a connected network, or have a random distribution. Simulation results show that introducing auctions gained average efficiency improvement of 4.3% compared to the basic iMesh, which brings us to 99.3% closest service hit rate. In other words, the closest service miss rate was reduced from 5% to about 0.7%, which is significant 86% reduction. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
