The small size of MAVs allows such flight operations within confined space but the control effectors must provide sufficient maneuverability, while maintaining stability, with only limited sensing capability onboard the platform. To meet these challenges, researchers have long been attracted by the amazing attributes of biological systems, such as those exhibited by birds and insects. Birds can fly in dense flocks, executing rapid maneuvers with g-loads far in excess of modern fighter aircrafts, and yet never collide with each other, despite the absence of air traffic controllers. This paper introduces a novel framework for the design and control of a Micro Air Vehicle. The vehicle's conceptual design is based on biologically-inspired principles and emulates a dragonfly (Odonata-Anisoptera). A sophisticated multi-layered Hybrid & Linear/Non-Linear controller to achieve extended flight times and improved agility compared to other Rotary and Flapping Wing MAV designs. The paper addresses the design and control features of the proposed QV design and gives an overview on the developmental efforts towards the prototyping of the flyer. The potential applications for such a high endurance vehicle are numerous, including air-deployable mass surveillance in cluster and swarm formations. The disposable nature of the vehicle would help in battle-field deployment as well, where such a MAV would be made available to soldiers for proximity sensing and threat level assessment. Other applications would include search and rescue operations and civilian law-enforcement.", "paper_title": "Inventing a Biologically Inspired, Energy Efficient Micro Aerial Vehicle", "paper_id": "WOS:000298229100030"}
