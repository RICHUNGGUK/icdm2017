The underlying reason is that using a single fuzzy membership function the FCM algorithm cannot properly represent pattern associations to all clusters. In this paper, we present a modified FCM (mFCM) algorithm by incorporating scale control spatial information for segmentation of MRI images in the presence of high levels of noise and intensity inhomogeneity. The algorithm utilizes scale controlled spatial information from the neighbourhood of each pixel under consideration in the form of a probability function. Using this probability function, a local membership function is introduced for each pixel. Finally, new clustering centre and weighted joint membership functions are introduced based on the local membership and global membership functions. The resulting mFCM algorithm is robust to the noise and intensity inhomogeneity in MRI image data and thereby improves the segmentation results. The experimental results on a synthetic image, four volumes of simulated and one volume of real-patient MRI brain images show that the mFCM algorithm outperforms k-means, FCM and some other recently proposed FCM-based algorithms for image segmentation in terms of qualitative and quantitative studies such as cluster validity functions, segmentation accuracy and tissue segmentation accuracy.
