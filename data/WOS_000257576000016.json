Automated and sensitive cell tracking is essential to cell motility studies where the tracking results can be used for diagnostic or curative decisions and where mathematical models can be developed to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying cell motility. Results: We have developed CellTrack: a self-contained, extensible, and cross-platform software package for cell tracking and motility analysis. Besides the general purpose image enhancement, object segmentation and tracking algorithms, we have implemented a novel edge-based method for sensitive tracking of the cell boundaries, and constructed an ensemble of methods that achieves refined tracking results even under large displacements or deformations of the cells.", "paper_title": "CellTrack: an open-source software for cell tracking and motility analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000257576000016"}
