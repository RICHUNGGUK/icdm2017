In real-world applications, it is unrealistic to guarantee that all sensors have the same lifetime because they have different energy consumption. Moreover, sensor redeployment also results in the heterogeneous energy capacities. In this paper, an Effective Data GAthering (EDGA) scheme for heterogeneous energy WSNs is proposed. Based on weighted election probabilities of each node's energy, EDGA selects nodes to become cluster head, which can handle better the heterogeneous energy capacities. Moreover, EDGA adopts a simple but efficient method to solve the area coverage problem in a cluster range, namely intra-cluster coverage. Finally, the collected data are forwarded to the sink node via the routing tree. EDGA is capable of achieving a good performance in terms of lifetime by minimizing energy consumption for in-network communications and balancing the energy load. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EDGA significantly outperforms LEACH and HEED in terms of network lifetime and the amount of data gathered in the heterogeneous energy network.", "paper_title": "AN EFFECTIVE DATA GATHERING SCHEME IN HETEROGENEOUS ENERGY WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000296754900002"}
