If, additionally, for given k, it is possible to prescribe l = min{k, p} vertices belonging to the first l subsets of tau, G is said to be AP + k. The paper contains the proofs that the kth power of every traceable graph of order at least k is AP + (k - 1) and that the kth power of every hamiltonian graph of order at least 2k is AP + (2k - 1), and these results are tight.
