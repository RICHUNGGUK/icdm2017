A general rate model for membrane adsorption, in which the interaction between multiple phenomena, like mass transfer and adsorption kinetics are considered, is formulated. Hereby, the implemented isotherms describe the influence of eluting agents on the adsorption behaviour, so that complete purification cycle (loading, washing and elution operation) can be simulated. Using the developed model the theoretical influence of relevant transport phenomena, operating conditions and process scale on affinity and ion exchange membrane adsorption of proteins are investigated. An example on ion exchange membrane adsorption illustrates the possibility to predict scale up effects occurring in configurations of multiple membrane adsorber modules. The obtained simulation results are in accordance with experimental observations reported in literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
