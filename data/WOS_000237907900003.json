Although the factors that consumer consider is the quality of the photographs produced. White balance is one of the methods used to improve the quality of the photographs. The basic white balance methods are, however powerless to handle all possible situations ill the captured scene. fit order to improve the white balance we divide this problem in three steps-white object purification. white point detection, and white point adjustment. The proposed method basically solves the problem of detecting the white point very well. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve superior result in both objective and subjective evaluative terms. The complexity of the proposed system is acceptable. The propose method can be easily applied to digital cameras to obtain good results.", "paper_title": "Automatic white balance for digital still cameras", "paper_id": "WOS:000237907900003"}
