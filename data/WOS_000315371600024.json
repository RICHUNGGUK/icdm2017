The actions of mobile users moving across security domains need to be specified and checked against domain and inter-domain policies. We propose a new formal security policy model for multi-domain mobile networks, called FPM-RBAC, Formal Policy Model for Mobility with Role Based Access Control. FPM-RBAC supports the specification of mobility and location constraints, role hierarchy mapping, inter-domain services, inter-domain access rights and separation of duty. Associated with FPM-RBAC, we also present a formal security policy constraint specification language for domain and inter-domain security policies. Formal policy constraint specifications are based on ambient logic and predicate logic. We also use ambient calculus to specify the current state of a mobile network and actions within security policies for evaluation of access requests according to security policies. A novel aspect of the proposed policy model is the support for formal and automated analysis of security policies related to mobility within multiple security domains. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
