Routing is a serious issue in WSN due to the use of computationally-constrained and resource-constrained micro-sensors. These constraints prohibit the deployment of traditional routing protocols designed for other ad hoc wireless networks. Any routing protocol designed for use in WSN should be reliable, energy-efficient and should increase the lifetime of the network. We propose a simple, least-time, energy-efficient routing protocol with one-level data aggregation that ensures increased life time for the network. The proposed protocol was compared with popular ad hoc and sensor network routing protocols, viz., AODV (Royer and Perkins, 1999; Das et al., 2003), DSR (Johnson et al., 2001), DSDV (Perkins and Bhagwat, 1994), DD (Intanagonwiwat et al., 2000) and MCF (Ye et al., 2001). It was observed that the proposed protocol outperformed them in throughput, latency, average energy consumption and average network lifetime. The proposed protocol uses absolute time and node energy as the criteria for routing, this ensures reliability and congestion avoidance. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
