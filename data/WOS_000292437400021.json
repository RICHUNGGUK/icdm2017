The sample size of the study was 8642 children. Latent growth curve modeling analysis was used as an analytical tool to examine the development of children's computer skills using LISREL software version 8.80. Results indicated, not surprisingly, that the availability of a computer at home and a high socio-economic status were statistically significant predictors of children's baseline computer skills in kindergarten. The availability of computers in kindergarten, however, was a statistically significant predictor of the development of children's computer skills from kindergarten to third grade. Although there was no difference between girls and boys in their baseline computer skills in kindergarten, the rate of development in computer skills was higher for girls than boys. Results suggest that the availability of an adequate level of computers in kindergarten classrooms can help close the initial gap in children's computer skills due to socio-economic status and lack of computer access prior to entering school. Supplying kindergarten classrooms with adequate computers could positively contribute to children's long-term development of computer skills. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
