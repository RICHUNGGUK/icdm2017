In this paper, we show that Liao and Wang's scheme is still vulnerable to insider's attack, masquerade attack, server spoofing attack, registration center spoofing attack and is not reparable. Furthermore, it fails to provide mutual authentication. To remedy these flaws, this paper proposes an efficient improvement over Liao-Wang's scheme with more security. The computation cost, security, and efficiency of the improved scheme are well suited to the practical applications environment. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
