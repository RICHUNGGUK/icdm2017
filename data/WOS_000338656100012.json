Usually, the length of correlation window is shorter than the period of the chosen FHS, so the study of the partial Hamming correlation of FHS is particularly important. In this paper, a class of low-hit-zone (LHZ) FHS sets with good partial Hamming correlation properties which has not yet been reported previously is constructed based on interleaving techniques. It is shown that new FHS sets are optimal with respect to the partial Hamming correlation bound of FHSs with LHZ.", "paper_title": "Low-hit-zone frequency hopping sequence sets with optimal partial Hamming correlation properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000338656100012"}
