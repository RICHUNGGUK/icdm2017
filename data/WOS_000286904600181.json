With current trends toward financial capital globalization, it is becoming more important to understand the co-movement of foreign exchange. Investors always want to get all kinds of messages to make decisions about investing. Moreover, they always look forward to making a profit. This study investigates financial investment issues related to Taiwan's financial capital. Thus, this study implements the association rules as a data mining approach to explore the co-movement between foreign exchange rates and category stock indexes in Taiwan. Transaction data, such as foreign exchange rates and stock indexes, were collected to construct a database; the Apriori algorithm was then used to generate the association rules. By doing so, this study proposes several possible portfolio alternatives in the Taiwan financial capital market including foreign exchange currencies and stock investment under different circumstances.
