This paper addresses the specification, design, and development of the CoreASM modeling framework, focusing on a set of features that any comprehensive framework and tool environment for modeling and analysis of complex distributed systems should provide. We discuss the key design features, the underlying design principles, and the lessons learned using CoreASM.
