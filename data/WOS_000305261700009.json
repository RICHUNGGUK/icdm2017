FMIPv6, a cross layer handover scheme proposed by the IETF, requires the timely link layer (L2) trigger to invoke the handover protocols of upper layer, the specified handover procedures hence can be completed before terminating the current wireless link. Generating the L2 trigger however is not always preferable by experimental analysis. The premature L2 trigger leads to a false alarm and unnecessary handover operations with serious performance loss and resources waste. By analyzing the movement behavior of the mobile node (MN), an initiative movement predictive algorithm is developed to predict the movement trend of the MN, and an adaptive handover trigger scheme (IMP-AHT) taken as the supplement for FMIPv6 is proposed accordingly. IMP-AHT addresses the investigation on rational decision of generating 12 trigger reliably. Owing to the inevitably introduced errors of the prediction process, some effective measures are also introduced to compensate the degraded performance caused by the false decisions. Simulations will compare as well as analyze IMP-AHT and FMIPv6 to evaluate the efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
