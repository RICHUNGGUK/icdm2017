This algorithm computes the unknown direction of the axis of the cylinder. The location of the axis and the radius of the cylinder are deduced analytically from this direction. Special attention is paid to the case d = 3 when n = 4 and n = 5. For the former, the minimal radius enclosing cylinder is computed algebrically from constrained minimization of a quartic form of the unknown direction of the axis. For the latter, an analytical condition of existence of the circumscribed cylinder is given, and the algorithm reduces to find the zeroes of an one unknown polynomial of degree at most 6. In both cases, the other parameters of the cylinder are deduced analytically. The minimal radius enclosing cylinder is computed analytically for the regular tetrahedron and for a trigonal bipyramids family with a symmetry axis of order 3.", "paper_title": "About the algebraic solutions of smallest enclosing cylinders problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000311495400003"}
