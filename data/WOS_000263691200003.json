We here provide a detailed experimental study of a randomized algorithm for scheduling priorities that we have developed, and also compare it with exact and approximated solutions. It turns out that for problems of reasonable size our algorithm exhibits an appealing compromise between speed and quality. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
