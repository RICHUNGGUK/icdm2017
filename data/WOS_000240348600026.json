We complement it with an almost matching lower bound by constructing matrices where the span of any k/2 epsilon rows does not \"contain\" a relative (1 + epsilon)-approximation of rank k. Our existence result leads to an algorithm that finds such rank-k approximation in time O(M((k)/(epsilon) + k(2) log k) + (m+n) ((k2)/(epsilon 2) + (k3 log k)/(epsilon) + k(4) log(2) k)), i.e., essentially O(Mk/epsilon), where M is the number of nonzero entries of A. The algorithm maintains sparsity, and in the streaming model [12, 14, 15], it can be implemented using only 2(k + 1)(log(k + 1) + 1) passes over the input matrix and O (min{m, n}((k)/(epsilon) + k(2) log k)) additional space. Previous algorithms for low-rank approximation use only one or two passes but obtain an additive approximation.", "paper_title": "Adaptive sampling and fast low-rank matrix approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240348600026"}
