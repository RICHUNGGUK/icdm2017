With the advent of software repositories containing data from heterogeneous projects, these types of models suffer from poor adjustment and predictive accuracy. One possible way to alleviate this problem is the use of a set of mathematical equations obtained through dividing of the historical project datasets according to different parameters into subdatasets called partitions. In turn, partitions are divided into clusters that serve as a tool for more accurate models. In this paper, we describe the process, tool and results of such approach through a case study using a publicly available repository, ISBSG. Results suggest the adequacy of the technique as an extension of existing single-expression models without making the estimation process much more complex that uses a single estimation model. A tool to support the process is also presented.", "paper_title": "Software project effort estimation based on multiple parametric models generated through data clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000247077900005"}
