It offers an expressive programming model that automatically handles task synchronisation - load balancing, fault tolerance, and task allocation are handled at the WebCom-G system level without burdening the application writer. These characteristics, together with the ability of its computing model to mix evaluation strategies to match the characteristics of the geographically dispersed facilities and the overall problem-solving environment, make WebCom-G a promising grid middleware candidate.", "paper_title": "WebCom-G: A candidate middleware for grid-Ireland", "paper_id": "WOS:000239512200008"}
