We analyze 104 announcements related to GSCM using an event study, and determine what causes statistically significant gain in stock prices for these firms. Manufacturing firms, firms with high R&D expenses, and early adopters show a strong increase in stock prices on the day of the announcement. At the same time, small firms, firms not well-known for taking green initiatives, as well as firms that are low in growth potential considerably surprise the market when they make such announcements.
