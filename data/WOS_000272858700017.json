An analytical-numerical formulation that transforms the governing differential equation in viscoelastic media into a set of ordinary differential equations and thereafter a discrete element model based on assumption that continuous viscoelastic beam can be replaced by a system of rigid bars and joints which resist relative rotation of attached bars. The physical properties of the joints can be found through considering the viscoelastic model of beams material. Correctness of results has been ascertained by a comparison, made between the above two techniques and good agreements has been achieved. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
