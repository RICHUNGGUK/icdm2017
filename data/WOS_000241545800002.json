In this setting, connection of components through their matching ports is indeed compositional and yields a new component or composite that respects its constituents' contracts. Thus the behaviour of the composite is computed from the behaviours of its constituents and is known to conform to the contracts without any new proof. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
