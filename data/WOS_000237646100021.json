But there are some drawbacks. Using these multimedia teachwares requires studying and training. Even after that, it is still sophisticated to search information and make it one's own useful materials. For purpose of overcoming these challenges and maximizing the access and applicability of multimedia teachware, a new system was suggested in this study which combined 2D barcode of ubiquitous technology and the URL(Uniform Resource Location) of multimedia teachware. Performance analysis demonstrates that this system is superior to existing one, and that the minimization of time for bridging the multimedia contents to 2D barcode enables the optimization of performance of the suggested system.", "paper_title": "Design and performance analysis of multimedia teachware making system using 2D barcode", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100021"}
