This activity is believed to be generated by a network of recurrently connected excitatory interneurons. A recent study found and characterized self-sustaining rhythmic activity-locomotor bouts-after brief electrical stimulation of hemisegmental preparations. The mechanisms behind the bouts are still unclear. We have developed a computational model of the hemisegmental network. The model addresses the possible involvement of NMDA, AMPA, acetylcholine, and metabotropic glutamate receptors as well as axonal delays in locomotor bouts. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
