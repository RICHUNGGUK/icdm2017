This brief presents a digital energy sensing method that requires neither a constant voltage reference nor a time reference. An energy minimizing loop uses this to find the minimum energy point and sets the supply voltage between 0.2 and 0.5 V. Energy savings up to 1275% over existing minimum energy tracking techniques in the literature is achieved.", "paper_title": "All Digital Energy Sensing for Minimum Energy Tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000351751400021"}
