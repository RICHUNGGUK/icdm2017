Its effectiveness is demonstrated by an application to the problem of allocating switches in electrical distribution networks to improve their reliability. Our approach also treats the service restoration problem, which has to be solved as a subproblem, to evaluate the reliability benefit of a given switch allocation proposal. Comparisons with other metaheuristics and with a branch-and-bound procedure evaluate its performance.
