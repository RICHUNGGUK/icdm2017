The basic principle of Doolittle Multivariate Calibration Algorithm (DMCA) was investigated, and the chromogenic system of W, Mo, Ti-SAF with overlapping absorption peaks was analyzed by DMCA. The computational relative standard deviation with DMCA is within +/- 8.0% which was better than the result of K-Matrix (within +/- 10.0%), the comparison indicated the superiority of Doolittle Decomposition Algorithm in the concentration analyzing. It was demonstrated that DDA can avoid matrix inverting, reduce the orders of matrixes and speed up the operation of matrixes. So it has bright prospects in chemometries. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
