Based on this many-valued R-S memory circuit we introduce a many-valued level-controlled memory circuit and a many-valued edge-controlled memory circuit of type \"master-slave\". We discuss problems of the stability of the circuit with respect to small errors of input and output signals as well as to small errors of the gates. We show that the stability can be preserved by restricting the set of logical values, i.e. the interval [0, 1], to a finite discrete subset of this interval. We find the set of many-valued operations which are suitable for the implementation of the many-valued R-S memory circuit.", "paper_title": "Many-valued R-S memory circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000258301400003"}
