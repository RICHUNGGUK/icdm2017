Based on the probabilistic and multi-ellipsoid convex set hybrid model, this paper presents a mathematical definition of reliability index for measuring the safety of structures in presence of parameter or load uncertainties. The optimization problem incorporating such reliability constraints is then mathematically formulated. By using the performance measure approach, the optimization problem is reformulated into a more tractable one. Moreover, the nested double-loop optimization problem is transformed into an approximate single-loop minimization problem by considering the optimality conditions and linearization of the limit-state function, which further facilitates efficient solution of the design problem. Numerical examples demonstrate the validity of the proposed formulation as well as the efficiency of the presented numerical techniques.", "paper_title": "Reliability-based structural optimization with probability and convex set hybrid models", "paper_id": "WOS:000277716700007"}
