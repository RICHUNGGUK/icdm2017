For that purpose, both the physical and the subjective point of view are considered. From a physical time-varying tonehole model a simple transition model is built, the parameters of which are adapted in order to fit with measurements obtained in normal playing situations. The model is able to reproduce the main perceptive effects, both from the listener point of view, which is a frequency glissando, loudness and brightness variations, and from the player point of view, which is a reduced ease of playing during the transition.", "paper_title": "Dynamic simulation of note transitions in reed instruments: Application to the clarinet and the saxophone", "paper_id": "WOS:000237806800001"}
