The formulation is based on a superstructure that allows the wastewater reuse in the same plant, the water exchange with different plants, and a shared set of interceptors that must be selected to determine the network configuration that satisfies process equipments and environmental constraints. The model formulation considers wastewater with several pollutants, and optimizes the network according to the minimum total annual cost, which includes the costs of fresh water, piping and regeneration. A new discretization approach is also proposed to handle the large set of bilinear terms that appear in the model in order to yield a near global optimal solution. The results obtained in several examples show considerable savings with respect to the solutions of the individual plant integration policy commonly employed for these types of problems.
