The proposed method approximates the original scene geometry with a set of tightly fitting spheres. In previous work, such spheres have been used to dynamically evaluate the visibility function to render soft shadows. In this paper, each sphere also acts as a low-frequency secondary light source, thereby providing diffuse one-bounce indirect illumination. The method is completely dynamic and proceeds in two passes: In a first pass, the light intensity distribution on each sphere is updated based on sample points on the corresponding object surface and converted into the spherical harmonics basis. In a second pass, this radiance information and the visibility are accumulated to shade final image pixels. The sphere approximation allows us to compute visibility and diffuse reflections of an object at interactive frame rates of over 20 fps for moderately complex scenes.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Indirect Illumination and Soft Shadows in Dynamic Scenes Using Spherical Lights", "paper_id": "WOS:000261137800013"}
