A more decentralised mechanism is introduced with wider use of in-network processing on a hierarchical sensor node topology resulting in a robust framework for dynamic data domains. This efficiently addresses the big data issue that is encountered in large scale industrial sensor network applications. Data vectors on each node's observation domain is first partitioned using an unsupervised approach that is adaptive regarding dynamic data streams using cumulative point-wise entropy and average relative density. Second order statistical analysis applied on average relative densities and mean entropy values is then used to differentiate anomalies through robust and adaptive thresholds that are responsive to a dynamic environment. Anomaly detection is then performed in a non-parametric and non-probabilistic manner over the different network tiers in the hierarchical topology in offering increased granularity for evaluation. Experiments were performed extensively using both real and artificial data distributions representative of different dynamic and multi-density observation domains. Results demonstrate higher accuracies in detection as more than 94 percent accompanied by a desirable reduction of more than 85 percent in communication costs when compared to existing centralized methods.", "paper_title": "Granular Evaluation of Anomalies in Wireless Sensor Networks Using Dynamic Data Partitioning with an Entropy Criteria", "paper_id": "WOS:000359236500012"}
