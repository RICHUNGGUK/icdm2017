This is referred to as community governance in this paper. The goals of this paper are to understand the nature and dimensionality of the perceptions of community governance construct, operationalize it, and examine its role in content use from wikis. Data analyses show that perceptions of community governance can be measured as a second-order construct with two first-order factors: community credibility and community vigilance. Further, perceptions of community governance are positively associated with content usefulness, which explains content use from community-governed wilds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
