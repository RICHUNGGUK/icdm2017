We present a solution to this problem that greatly improves recognition of small moving objects under the assumption of a simple linear motion model in the real-world. The presented method not only explicitly models the image acquisition system, but also the space-time variant fore-and background contributions to the \"mixed\" pixels. The latter is due to a changing local background as a result of the apparent motion. The method simultaneously estimates a subpixel precise polygon boundary as well as a high-resolution (HR) intensity description of a small moving object subject to a modified total variation constraint. Experiments on simulated and real-world data show excellent performance of the proposed multiframe SR reconstruction method.", "paper_title": "Multiframe Super-Resolution Reconstruction of Small Moving Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000283445600010"}
