Experimental data (COMDECOM) measured from DMSO/H2O solutions stored at 50 A degrees C for 105 days were used to predicted stability by applying rule-embedded na < ve Bayesian learning, based upon atom center fragment (ACF) features. To build the na < ve Bayesian classifier, we derived ACF features from 9,746 compounds in the COMDECOM dataset. By recursively applying na < ve Bayesian learning from the data set, each ACF is assigned with an expected stable probability (p (s) ) and an unstable probability (p (uns) ). 13,340 ACFs, together with their p (s) and p (uns) data, were stored in a knowledge base for use by the Bayesian classifier. For a given compound, its ACFs were derived from its structure connection table with the same protocol used to drive ACFs from the training data. Then, the Bayesian classifier assigned p (s) and p (uns) values to the compound ACFs by a structural pattern recognition algorithm, which was implemented in-house. Compound instability is calculated, with Bayes' theorem, based upon the p (s) and p (uns) values of the compound ACFs. We were able to achieve performance with an AUC value of 84 % and a tenfold cross validation accuracy of 76.5 %. To reduce false negatives, a rule-based approach has been embedded in the classifier. The rule-based module allows the program to improve its predictivity by expanding its compound instability knowledge base, thus further reducing the possibility of false negatives. To our knowledge, this is the first in silico prediction service for the prediction of the stabilities of organic compounds.", "paper_title": "ChemStable: a web server for rule-embedded na < ve Bayesian learning approach to predict compound stability", "paper_id": "WOS:000342439000005"}
