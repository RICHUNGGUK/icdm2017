Given two natural numbers g and n satisfying 2g + n - 2 > 0, the program generates all genus g stable graphs with n unordered marked points. Each such graph determines the topological type of a nodal stable curve of arithmetic genus g with n unordered marked points. Our motivation comes from the fact that the boundary of the moduli space of stable genus g, n-pointed curves can be stratified by taking loci of curves of a fixed topological type.
