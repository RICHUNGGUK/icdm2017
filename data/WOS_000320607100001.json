Both codes were developed to complement the Runge-Kutta semi-lagrangian multi-water-bag code GMWB3D-SLC described in [1]. The CYLGYR code is an eigenvalue solver performing linear stability analysis from given mean radial profiles. It features three resolution schemes and three parallel velocity response models (fluid, multi-water-bag, continuous Maxwellian). The QUALIMUWABA quasilinear code is an initial value code allowing the study of zonal flow influence on drift-waves dynamics. Cross-validation test performed between the three codes show good agreement on both temporal and spatial characteristics of unstable modes in the linear growth phase. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
