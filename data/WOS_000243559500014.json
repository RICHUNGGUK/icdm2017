We use the case of Norwegian fuel cell and related hydrogen research to explore techno-science networks. Standard bibliometric and patent indicators are presented. Then we explore different types of network maps-maps based on co-authorship, co-patenting and co-activity data. Different network configurations occur for each type of map. Actors reach different levels of prominence in the different maps, but most of them are active both in science and technology. This illustrates that to appreciate fully the range of science-technology interplay, all three analyses need to be taken into account.", "paper_title": "Tracking techno-science networks: A case study of fuel cells and related hydrogen technology R&D in Norway", "paper_id": "WOS:000243559500014"}
