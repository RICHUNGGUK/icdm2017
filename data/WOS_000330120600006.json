Choice processes of this kind in random structures are known as Achlioptas processes. m clause-pairs are presented in advance, and the algorithm chooses one clause from each pair with knowledge of all pairs. For the off-line setting, we show that the two-choice satisfiability threshold for k -SA k coincides with the standard satisfiability threshold for random 2k -SAT.
