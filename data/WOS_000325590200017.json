After providing a natural formula of solutions for the equations, we then give an existence theorem of the solutions by using the Hausdorffs measure of noncompactness and the theory of Monch. As a result, the existence theory provides a theoretical basis for exploring the solutions of such kinds of differential equations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
