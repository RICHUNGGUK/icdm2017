We systematically test microscopic mechanisms to find the set of such mechanisms that optimally explain each networks' specific properties. In the first case we formulate a model including mainly random unbiased gene duplications and mutations. In the second case, the basic moves are website generation and rapid surf-induced link creation (/destruction). The different types of mechanisms reproduce the appropriate observed network properties. We use those to show that different kinds of networks have strongly system-dependent macroscopic experimental features. The diverging properties result from dissimilar node and link basic dynamics. The main non-uniform properties include the clustering coefficient, small-scale motifs frequency, time correlations, centrality and the connectivity of outgoing links. Some other features are generic such as the large-scale connectivity distribution of incoming links (scale-free) and the network diameter (small-worlds). The common properties are just the general hallmark of autocatalysis (self-enhancing processes), while the specific properties hinge on the specific elementary mechanisms.
