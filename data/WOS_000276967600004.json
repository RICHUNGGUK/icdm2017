The method is based on a new neuro-fuzzy dynamical systems description, which uses the fuzzy partitioning of an underlying fuzzy systems outputs and high order neural networks (HONN's) associated with the centers of these partitions. Every high order neural network approximates a group of fuzzy rules associated with each center. The indirect regulation is achieved by first identifying the system around the current operation point, and then using its parameters to device the control law. Weight updating laws for the involved HONN's are provided, which guarantee that, under the presence of both parameter and dynamic uncertainties, both the identification error and the system states reach zero, while keeping all signals in the closed loop bounded. The control signal is constructed to be valid for both square and non square systems by using a pseudoinverse, in Moore-Penrose sense. The existence of the control signal is always assured by employing a novel method of parameter hopping instead of the conventional projection method. The applicability is tested on well known benchmarks.", "paper_title": "INDIRECT ADAPTIVE CONTROL OF UNKNOWN MULTI VARIABLE NONLINEAR SYSTEMS WITH PARAMETRIC AND DYNAMIC UNCERTAINTIES USING A NEW NEURO-FUZZY SYSTEM DESCRIPTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000276967600004"}
