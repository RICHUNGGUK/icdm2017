The activation functions are assumed to be unbounded, non-monotonic and non-differentiable, and the delay is assumed to be time-varying and belonging to a given interval, which means that the lower and upper bounds of the interval time-varying delay are available. By constructing a general form of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, and using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, we derive several delay-dependent stability criteria in terms of LMI. Finally, we give a number of examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Delay-dependent robust stability criteria for stochastic neural networks of neutral-type with interval time-varying delay and linear fractional uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000343644100010"}
