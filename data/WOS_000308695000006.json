The involved algebra is reduced to solving a quadratic equation. This 4-point-method appears to be more robust than the existing 5-point-algorithm for locating a totally uncalibrated camera by means of chasles conics. On the other hand, the authors' method can offer an alternative for the triangulation method if the value of the focal length is unknown or unreliable (e. g. because of autozoom).", "paper_title": "Four-point-algorithm for the recovery of the pose of a one-dimensional camera with unknown focal length", "paper_id": "WOS:000308695000006"}
