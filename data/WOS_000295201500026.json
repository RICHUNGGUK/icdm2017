This paper presents a 3D, multiresolution, approximate lunar surface model based on a subdivision-surface wavelet, as well as efficient tools for rendering the three-dimensional surface at speeds approaching real-time interaction in a general Personal Computer (PC) environment. The surface model is C-2-continuous at nearly all points. The modeling and visualization method could be applied to most other global data sets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
