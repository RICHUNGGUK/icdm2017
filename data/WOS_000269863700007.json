In the CFC approach, 'self' and 'non-self' concentrations are constructed through 'self' and 'non-self' gene libraries, respectively, to form a two-element concentration vector for expressing the e-mail efficiently. A three-layer BPNN with two-element input is then employed to classify e-mails automatically. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two public benchmark corpora PU1 and Ling to demonstrate that the proposed CFC approach based BPNN classifier not only has a very much fast speed but also achieves 97 and 99% of classification accuracy on corpora PU1 and Ling by just using a two-element concentration feature vector.", "paper_title": "A three-layer back-propagation neural network for spam detection using artificial immune concentration", "paper_id": "WOS:000269863700007"}
