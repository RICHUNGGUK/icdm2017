A two-component zero-crossing scenario, consisting of a broad-band fractal and narrow-band rhythm components, is assumed. Scaling is found in the power law distribution p(tau) similar to tau(-nu) of the crossing time interval tau of the broad-band fluctuation. In alpha dominant brain state, the alpha rhythm interval L also exhibits scaling in the form of power law distribution: P(L) similar to L-phi. Our main result is the relationship nu + phi similar to 3 that characterizes the organization of these two prominent features of the brain dynamics. The possible role of self-organized criticality of punctuated equilibrium in this organization is discussed.", "paper_title": "Scaling and organization of electroencephalographic background activity and alpha rhythm in healthy young adults", "paper_id": "WOS:000241257700001"}
