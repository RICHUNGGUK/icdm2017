We provide the libraries minerva ( with the R interface) and minepy for Python, MATLAB, Octave and C++. The C solution reduces the large memory requirement of the original Java implementation, has good upscaling properties and offers a native parallelization for the R interface. Low memory requirements are demonstrated on the MINE benchmarks as well as on large (n = 1340) microarray and Illumina GAII RNA-seq transcriptomics datasets.", "paper_title": "minerva and minepy: a C engine for the MINE suite and its R, Python and MATLAB wrappers", "paper_id": "WOS:000314892000022"}
