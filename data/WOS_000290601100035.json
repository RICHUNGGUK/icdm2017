The uncertainty is time-varying but, norm-bounded. By the switched Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, delay-dependent linear matrix inequality conditions for the delay-varying discrete-time uncertain switched system are developed to guarantee that the switched system is asymptotically stable with an l(2) gain smaller than a prescribed scalar under arbitrary switching; Switched state-feedback controller is designed to render the corresponding switched closed-loop system asymptotically stable with an l(2) gain measure. Linear matrix inequality approach is employed to the state-feedback controller design. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the validity of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "DELAY-DEPENDENT STABILITY CRITERION AND H infinity STATE-FEEDBACK CONTROL FOR UNCERTAIN DISCRETE-TIME SWITCHED SYSTEMS WITH TIME-VARYING DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601100035"}
