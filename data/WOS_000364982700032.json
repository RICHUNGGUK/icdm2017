This means that managers are unable to assign an appropriate privilege to participants according to their importance. One way to solve this problem would be to assign each share a suitable recovery capability. In this study, we propose a novel secret sharing method, the privilege-based visual secret sharing model (PVSSM), which allows participants with different privileges. It is assumed that participants having a higher privilege will have a higher ability to recover the secret image. The proposed PVSSM has the following advantages: (1) Each share has an appropriate capability to reveal the secret information corresponding to the privilege of the share holder. (2) The restored image has a better contrast than the traditional VSS method can achieve. (3) The share has the same size as the secret image. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
