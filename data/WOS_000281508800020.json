A sufficient condition that the graph G be non-hypoenergetic (i. e., E(G) >= n) is root[M(2)(G)](3)/M(4)(G) >= n. In a recent paper [Majstorovic, Klobucar, Gutman, MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 62 (2009) 509-524] necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of the latter inequality were determined for triregular graphs. These results are incorrect. We now present correct necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of root[M(2)(G)](3)/M(4)(G) >= n in the case of triregular graphs.", "paper_title": "On Triregular Graphs whose Energy Exceeds the Number of Vertices", "paper_id": "WOS:000281508800020"}
