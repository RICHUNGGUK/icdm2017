BRKGA (J Heuristics 17:487-525, 2011b) is a general search metaheuristic for finding optimal or near-optimal solutions to hard optimization problems. It is derived from the random-key genetic algorithm of Bean (ORSA J Comput 6:154-160, 1994), differing in the way solutions are combined to produce offspring. After a brief introduction to the BRKGA, including a description of the local search procedure used in its decoder, we show how to download, install, configure, and use the library through an illustrative example.", "paper_title": "A Python/C plus plus library for bound-constrained global optimization using a biased random-key genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000360388300019"}
