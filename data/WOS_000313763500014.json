However, using such a wild to create high-quality articles is not as easy as people imagine, given for instance the difficulty of reusing knowledge already available in Wildpedia. As a result, the heavy burden of upbuilding and maintaining the evergrowing online encyclopedia still rests on a small group of people. In this article, we aim at facilitating wild authoring by providing annotation recommendations, thus lightening the burden of both contributors and administrators. We leverage the collective wisdom of the users by exploiting Semantic Web technologies with Wikipedia data and adopt a unified algorithm to support link, category, and semantic relation recommendation. A prototype system named EachWiki is proposed and evaluated. The experimental results show that it has achieved considerable improvements in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and usability. The proposed approach can also be applied to other wild-based collaborative editing systems.", "paper_title": "EachWiki: Facilitating Wiki Authoring by Annotation Suggestion", "paper_id": "WOS:000313763500014"}
