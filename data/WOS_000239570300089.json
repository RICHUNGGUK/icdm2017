In addition, the adjustable radii and the number of retransmissions are considered to reduce the energy consumption. Thus, to see that the total energy consumption is minimized, we propose a mathematical model that constructs a data aggregation tree and schedules the activities of all sensors under adjustable radii and collision avoidance conditions. As the data aggregation tree has been proven to be a NP-complete problem, we adopt a LR method to determine a near-optimal solution and furthermore verify whether the proposed LR-based algorithm, LRA, achieves energy efficiency and ensures the latency within a reasonable range. The experiments show the proposed algorithm outperforms other general routing algorithms, such as SPT, CNS, and GIT algorithms. It improves energy conservation, which it does up to 9.1% over GIT. More specifically, it also improves energy conservation up to 65% over scheduling algorithms, such as S-MAC and T-MAC.", "paper_title": "Cross-layer duty cycle scheduling with data aggregation routing in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300089"}
