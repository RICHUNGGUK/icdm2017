In the proposed scheme, the threshold voltage for each comparison is divided into two parts. This results in appreciably less switching energy and less total capacitance without a substantial increase in digital complexity compared to the conventional SAR ADC. Analytical calculations and circuit level simulation results in the context of a 10-bit 100 kS/s ADC are provided to verify the usefulness of the proposed SAR ADC scheme revealing 87 % less switching power and 40 % less total capacitance in comparison with the conventional SAR ADC.", "paper_title": "An efficient threshold voltage generation for SAR ADCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000316016100015"}
