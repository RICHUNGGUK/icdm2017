The new algorithm computes each DCT coefficient in turn more independently. Hence, the new algorithm is suitable for 2D DCT pruning algorithm of pruning away any number of high-frequency components of 2D DCT. The proposed pruning algorithm is more efficient than the existing pruning 2D DCT algorithms in terms of the number of arithmetic operations, especially the number of multiplications required in the computation.", "paper_title": "Fast 2-D 8x8 discrete cosine transform algorithm for image coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000262702300007"}
