Three features are used in this system: digraph duration, keystroke latency, and keystroke duration. This system using the statistical measures of means and standard deviations with the proportionality method achieves a result of 0.0052 FAR and 0.0782 FRR in contrast to the system not using the proportionality method, which yields a result of 0.0118 FAR and 0.0813 FRR. The result serves as evidence that the proportionality method can be used to produce the critical patterns and also be applied to all related keystroke dynamics-based authentication systems to provide higher accuracy.", "paper_title": "A Simple Keystroke Dynamics-Based Authentication System Using Means and Standard Deviations", "paper_id": "WOS:000305576900006"}
