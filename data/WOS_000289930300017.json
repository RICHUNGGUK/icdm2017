This paper is concerned with the longest cycle in an n-dimensional (n-D) THLN with up to 2n - 9 faulty elements. Let G be an n-D THLN, n >= 7. Let F be a subset of V (G) boolean OR E(G), vertical bar F vertical bar <= 2n - 9. We prove that G - F contains a Hamiltonian cycle if delta(G - F) >= 2, and G - F contains a near Hamiltonian cycle if delta(G - F) <= 1. Our work extends some previously known results.
