This effort is contrasted with other IP reuse efforts. The paper reviews the current approach used by several high-level language compilers to integrate IP within their tool. The CoreLib approach for standardizing this IP integration is proposed followed by an example that demonstrates its utility. Finally, the current state of the effort and future plans are presented.
