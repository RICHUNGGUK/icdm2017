Afterwards, a universal stability result in a fuzzy quasi-beta-normed space under the strongest triangular norm T-M is established by employing the fixed point alternative theorem. Using this result, the fuzzy stability problem of a septic functional equation is examined.", "paper_title": "A fixed point approach to the stability of a septic functional equation in fuzzy quasi-beta-normed spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000348366900003"}
