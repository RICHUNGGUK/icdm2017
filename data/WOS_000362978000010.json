Every grid point has attributes as the position, colour and gradients of these quantities specified. Editing the attributes of an existing gradient mesh (such as the colour gradients) is not only non-intuitive but also time-consuming. To facilitate user-friendly colour editing, we develop an optimization-based colour transfer method for gradient meshes. The key idea is built on the fact that we can approximate a colour transfer operation on gradient meshes with a linear transfer function. In this paper, we formulate the approximation as an optimization problem, which aims to minimize the colour distribution of the example image and the transferred gradient mesh. By adding proper constraints, i.e. image gradients, to the optimization problem, the details of the gradient meshes can be better preserved. With the linear transfer function, we are able to edit the colours and colour gradients of the mesh points automatically, while preserving the structure of the gradient mesh. The experimental results show that our method can generate pleasing recoloured gradient meshes.", "paper_title": "Optimization-Based Gradient Mesh Colour Transfer", "paper_id": "WOS:000362978000010"}
