Our algorithms are recursive. For the base case, we solve efficiently Hidden Translation in Z(p)(n), whenever p is a fixed prime. For the induction step, we introduce the problem Translating Coset generalizing both Hidden Translation and Hidden Subgroup and prove a powerful self-reducibility result: Translating Coset in a finite solvable group G is reducible to instances of Translating Coset in G/N and N, for appropriate normal subgroups N of G. Our self-reducibility framework, combined with Kuperberg's subexponential quantum algorithm for solving Hidden Translation in any abelian group, leads to subexponential quantum algorithms for Hidden Translation and Hidden Subgroup in any solvable group.", "paper_title": "HIDDEN TRANSLATION AND TRANSLATING COSET IN QUANTUM COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000333538300001"}
