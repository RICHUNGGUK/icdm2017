The proposed model can (1) discover extra co-expressed genes that cannot be found by current pattern/tendency-based methods, and (2) discover inverted relationship overlooked by pattern/tendency-based methods. We also design two tree-based algorithms to mine all qualified g-Clusters. The experimental results show: (1) our approaches are effective and efficient, and (2) our approaches can find an amount of co-regulated gene clusters missed by previous models, which are potentially of high biological significance.", "paper_title": "Mining biologically significant co-regulation patterns from microarray data", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500059"}
