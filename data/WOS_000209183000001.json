This is done by restructuring the components of the software, i.e. changing the internal structure within classes or changing the structure between classes. However, this may have an impact on class and architecture stability. In this paper we assess the impact of refactoring on class and architecture stability and then propose a classification for refactoring methods based on the impact of refactoring on class and architecture stability.", "paper_title": "The Impact of Refactoring on Class and Architecture Stability", "paper_id": "WOS:000209183000001"}
