As real-time performance requirements begin to emerge, the latency involved in a handover from one access point to another becomes crucial. CAPWAP and HOKEY are two suites of protocols being defined and standardized within the IETF that include support for fast handover. IEEE 802.11r is implementing extensions to the IEEE 802.11 base specification to directly support fast handover in the MAC protocol. This article details all three protocols, and compares their relative security properties, performance, and use cases.", "paper_title": "SECURE HANDOVER IN ENTERPRISE WLANS: CAPWAP, HOKEY, AND IEEE 802.11R", "paper_id": "WOS:000260297900013"}
