For this purpose, a new floating frequency dependent negative resistor (FDNR) simulator using three CCIs is presented and employed in a third-order high-pass filter. The compensation feature of the CCI is shown for the proposed high-pass filter. As a second example, the presented compensation method is tested in a second-order band-pass filter constructed with two CCIs. Applying the proposed compensation technique, the CCI-based circuits can operate in lower biasing currents, which result in lower power consumption.", "paper_title": "Parasitic compensation in CCI-based circuits for reduced power consumption", "paper_id": "WOS:000282012800017"}
