In order to suit the very lightweight nature of RFID tags, a number of proposals have focused on the design of very efficient authentication protocols using no classical cryptographic primitives. This article presents the state of the art in this field by summarizing this family of protocols and the most important attacks against them. The contribution also consists of a passive full-disclosure attack on the SASI and Yeh-Lo-Winata ultralightweight authentication protocols. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
