To date, many studies have discussed GDM problems with heterogeneous preference structures. To provide a clear perspective on the fusion process with heterogeneous preference structures in GDM, this paper presents a review of three types of fusion approaches: the indirect approach, the optimization-based approach and the direct approach. Moreover, with respect to insights gained from prior researches, several open problems are proposed for the future research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
