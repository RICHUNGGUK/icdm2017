For DNF related problems, the complexity of the monotone case differs strongly from the arbitrary case. We show that it is DP-complete to check whether a monomial is a prime implicant for an arbitrary formula, but the equivalent problem for monotone formulas is in L. We show PP-cornpleteness of checking if the minimum size of a DNF for a monotone formula is at most k, and for k in unary, we show that the complexity of the problem drops to coNP. In Christopher Umans [Christopher Umans, The minimum equivalent DNF problem and shortest implicants, journal of Computer and System Sciences 63 (4)(2001) 597-611] a similar problem for arbitrary formulas was shown to be Sigma(p)(2)-complete. We show that calculating the minimum equivalent DNF for a monotone formula is possible in output-polynomial time if and only if P = NP. Finally, we disprove a conjecture from Steffen Reith [Steffen Reith, On the complexity of some equivalence problems for propositional calculi, in: Proceedings of the 28th International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science (MFCS), vol. 2747, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer, 2003, pp. 632-641] by showing that checking whether two formulas are isomorphic has the same complexity for arbitrary formulas as for monotone formulas.
