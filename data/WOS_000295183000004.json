We focus on three basic classes, according to the accessibility relation, of Kripke frames: the full class of frames evaluated in the residuated lattice (and so defining the minimum modal logic), the ones evaluated in the idempotent elements and the ones only evaluated in 0 and 1. We show how to expand an axiomatization, with canonical truth-constants in the language, of a finite residuated lattice into one of the modal logic, for each one of the three basic classes of Kripke frames. We also provide axiomatizations for the case of a finite MV chain but this time without canonical truth-constants in the language.", "paper_title": "On the Minimum Many-Valued Modal Logic over a Finite Residuated Lattice", "paper_id": "WOS:000295183000004"}
