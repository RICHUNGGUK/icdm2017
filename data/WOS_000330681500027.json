In this paper, we proposed a MOS-inside SCR (MISCR) showing nearly no snapback character and good ESD robustness, which is qualified for on-chip power clamp ESD protection. The stacked device achieves a series of triggering and holding voltage by altering the stacking number, which can also be used for the high voltage ESD power supply clamp applications.", "paper_title": "Novel silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) for digital and high-voltage ESD power supply clamp", "paper_id": "WOS:000330681500027"}
