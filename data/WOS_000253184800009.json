Results show that these sequences always possess good balance and linear complexity (larger than half the period). Their autocorrelation functions are shown to be three-valued if p = 3 (mod 4), and five-valued otherwise. Moreover, the distribution of patterns of length 2 are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
