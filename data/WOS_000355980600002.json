The wall is discretised by means of a set of virtual particles and is simulated by a local point symmetry approach. The extension of a previously published modified virtual boundary particle (MVBP) method guarantees that arbitrarily complex domains can be readily discretised guaranteeing approximate zeroth and first-order consistency. To achieve this, three important new modifications are introduced: (i) the complete support is ensured not only for particles within one smoothing length distance, h, from the boundary but also for particles located at a distance greater than h but still within the support of the kernel; (ii) for a non-uniform fluid particle distribution, the fictitious particles are generated with a uniform stencil (unlike the previous algorithms) that can maintain a uniform shear stress on a particle-moving parallel to the wall in a steady flow; and (iii) the particle properties (density, mass and velocity) are defined using a local point of symmetry to satisfy the hydrostatic conditions and the Cauchy boundary condition for pressure. The extended MVBP model is demonstrated for cases including hydrostatic conditions for still water in a tank with a wedge and for curved boundaries, where significant improved behaviour is obtained in comparison with the conventional boundary techniques. Finally, the capability of the numerical scheme to simulate a dam break simulation is also shown.
