Since shadows and color reflections on the wet ground pose problems for conventional video object segmentation, the proposed method combines the background construction-based video object segmentation and the foreground extraction-based video object segmentation where pixels in both the foreground and background from a video sequence are separated using histogram-based change detection from which the background can be constructed and detection of the initial moving object masks based on a frame difference mask and a background subtraction mask can be further used to obtain coarse object regions. Shadow regions and color-reflection regions on the wet ground are removed from the initial moving object masks via a diamond window mask and color analysis of the moving object. Finally, the boundary of the moving object is refined using connected component labeling and morphological operations. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs well for video object segmentation in rainy situations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
