Since the DLP assumption over inner automorphism groups does not admit sub-exponential attacks, thus the sizes of the working parameters used in our constructions are shorten significantly. This leads to remarkable gains for our proposals both in running time and in storage space. In addition, as far as we know, this is the first time to build CHF and OTS based on noncommutative groups.", "paper_title": "Chameleon Hash Functions and One-Time Signature Schemes from Inner Automorphism Groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000324968800004"}
