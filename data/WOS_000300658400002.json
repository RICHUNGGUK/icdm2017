Our approach uses cloud computing data center as the central communication and optimization infrastructure supporting a cognitive radio network of AMI meters which we label netbook advance metering infrastructure (Net-AMI). The Net-AMI is a novel low cost infrastructure of AMI meters that operate akin to netbooks with wireless transceiver that access to cloud data center energy services, cognitive radio services, and wireless communication services. Access occurs via cognitive radios channels. We claim that this solution solves the important problem in smart grid systems of how to develop an extensible, persistent, smart grid information network with a lifespan equivalent to that of most power systems (20-30 years). By persistence, we imply always operable, entirely software upgradeable, and independent of cellular networks. Our system is extensible and can easily handle thousands of variations in power systems, communication protocols, control, and energy optimization protocols. We formulate necessary link analysis and optimum scheduling of downlink and uplink Net-AMI packets in a multiuser cognitive radio environment.", "paper_title": "Persistent Net-AMI for Microgrid Infrastructure Using Cognitive Radio on Cloud Data Centers", "paper_id": "WOS:000300658400002"}
