As results, Internet and web services become core infrastructure for a company or an institute. With the explosion of Internet, the occurrence of cyber terrorism has grown very rapidly. It is difficult to find and close all security flaws in a computer system that is connected to a network. Internet worms take advantages of these security flaws, and attack a large number of hosts with self-propagating techniques. To study and analyze internet worms, one of the most feasible ways is to use simulations. It is quite challenging to simulate very large-scale worm attacks. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model for large-scale worm propagation simulations.", "paper_title": "Hybrid modeling for large-scale worm propagation Simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800059"}
