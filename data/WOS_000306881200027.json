First, we propose a new method for ranking interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy values. Based on the proposed fuzzy ranking method of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy values, we propose a new method for multicriteria fuzzy decision making. The proposed multicriteria fuzzy decision making method outperforms Ye's method (2009) due to the fact that the proposed method can overcome the drawback of Ye's method (2009), where the drawback of Ye's method is that it can not distinguish the ranking order between alternatives in some situations. The proposed method provides us with a useful way for dealing with multicriteria fuzzy decision making problems based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
