The algorithm eliminates the functional overlap of the table HASH and SHIFT, and computes the shift distances in an aggressive manner. After each test, the algorithm examines the character next to the scan window to maximize the shift distance. This idea is consistent with that of the quick-search (QS) algorithm. Experimental results on four alphabets show that the new algorithm is more efficient than Wu-Manber and other recent algorithms, particularly on short pattern sets and large alphabet.
