However, most e-learning systems force students to follow the learning course or content established by a teacher. These methods are convenient, but they limit the effectiveness of e-learning. To overcome this limitation and increase effective learning, new techniques that reflect alternative learning styles, such as adaptive learning and personalized learning, have been studied. In this study, we proposed a Personalized Learning Course Planner (PLCP) that allows students to easily select the learning course they desire. User profile data was collected from the students' initial priorities about learning contents as well as the test scores after their study. E-Learning Decision Support System (EL-DSS) in PLCP suggests an appropriate learning course organization, according to calculated results based on the user profile data. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, we implemented an English learning system consisting of PLCP. We conducted an experiment with 30 university students and evaluated students' satisfaction by questionnaire analysis. The results indicate that the proposed system improved learning effectiveness and student satisfaction. Further investigation of the participants indicated that suggesting a learning course suitable for students' previous test scores and priorities encouraged students to concentrate on the lesson.
