Therefore, it would be very useful to design knowledge representation model capable to be adjusted according to information dynamics. Aiming at this objective, a knowledge representation scheme is proposed, which is called DRFK (Dynamic Representation of Fuzzy Knowledge). This model has both the features of a fuzzy Petri net and the learning ability of evolutionary algorithms. An efficient Genetic Particle Swarm Optimization (GPSO) learning algorithm is developed to solving fuzzy knowledge representation parameters. Being trained, a DRFK model can be used for dynamic knowledge representation and inference. Finally, an example is included as an illustration.
