Most of the existing data hiding schemes, however, exploit the raw data of cover images to perform secret communications. In this paper, a novel data hiding scheme was presented with the manipulation of images based on the compression of side-match vector quantization (SMVQ). This proposed scheme provided adaptive alternatives for modulating the quantized indices in the compressed domain so that a considerable quantity of secret data could be artfully embedded. As the experimental results demonstrated, the proposed scheme indeed provided a larger payload capacity without making noticeable distortions in comparison with schemes proposed in earlier works. Furthermore, this scheme also presented a satisfactory compression performance.", "paper_title": "Hiding secret information using adaptive side-match VQ", "paper_id": "WOS:000250094800024"}
