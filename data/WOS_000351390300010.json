It is shown that the considered hexacopter is uncontrollable when one rotor fails, even though the hexacopter is over-actuated and its controllability matrix is row full rank. According to this, a fault tolerant control strategy is proposed to control a degraded system, where the yaw states of the considered hexacopter are ignored. Theoretical analysis indicates that the degraded system is controllable if and only if the maximum lift of each rotor is greater than a certain value. The simulation and experiment results on a prototype hexacopter show the feasibility of our controllability analysis and degraded control strategy.", "paper_title": "Controllability Analysis and Degraded Control for a Class of Hexacopters Subject to Rotor Failures", "paper_id": "WOS:000351390300010"}
