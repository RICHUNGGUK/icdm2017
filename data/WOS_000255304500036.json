A key component of the algorithm is a restricted additive Schwarz preconditioner defined for problems with doubly periodic boundary conditions. We show numerically that with such a preconditioned nonlinearly implicit method the time step size is no longer constrained by the CFL number or the convergence of the Newton solver. We report the parallel performance of the algorithm and software on machines with thousands of processors. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
