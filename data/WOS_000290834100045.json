The two illustrative gravity-driven problems considered address solute mixing in a continuous thin film flow and droplet migration down an inclined substrate. The computational price paid for the flexibility offered by the solver is investigated alongside the overall benefits of adaptive local mesh refinement and multigridding. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
