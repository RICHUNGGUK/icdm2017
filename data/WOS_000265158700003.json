One of the models, the one-dimensional Lebwohl-Lasher model has an exact solution and we have used this to test the performance of the mixed algorithm (WLTM). The other system we have worked on is the two-dimensional XY-model. The purpose of the present work is to test the performance of the WLTM algorithm in continuous models and to suggest methods for obtaining best results in Such systems using this algorithm.
