In this paper, we propose an adaptive Six Degrees-of-Freedom (6-DOF) haptic rendering algorithm based on virtual coupling, which can automatically adjust virtual coupling parameters according to mass values of the simulated virtual tools. The algorithm can overcome the virtual tool displacement problem caused by the large mass values of the virtual tool and can provide stable force/torque display. The force/torque magnitude is saturated to the maximum force/torque values of the haptic device automatically. The implemented algorithm is tested on the simple and complex standard benchmarks. The experimental results confirm that the proposed adaptive 6-DOF haptic rendering algorithm displays good stability and accuracy for haptic rendering of dynamic virtual objects with mass values.", "paper_title": "Stable adaptive algorithm for Six Degrees-of-Freedom haptic rendering in a dynamic environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000325115400008"}
