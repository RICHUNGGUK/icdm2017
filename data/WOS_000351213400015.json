Precisely, every polytope is linear-time representable by a local marginal polytope and every LP can be reduced in linear time to a linear optimization (allowing infinite costs) over a local marginal polytope. The reduction can be done (though with a higher time complexity) even if the local marginal polytope is restricted to have a planar structure.", "paper_title": "Universality of the Local Marginal Polytope", "paper_id": "WOS:000351213400015"}
