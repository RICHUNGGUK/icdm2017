This generalization can be used to point out a deeper regularity of certain digital sequences, which can be exploited to obtain improvements on their discrepancy bounds. Earlier Larcher and Niederreiter introduced so-called (T, s)-sequences with similar consequences. In this paper we generalize both concepts by introducing (U, e, s)-sequences, we work out relations between the concept of (U, e, s)-sequences and the concepts of (t, s)-, (u, e, s)-, and (T, s)-sequences, we introduce an explicit construction of (U, e, s)-sequences by generalizing Hofer Niederreiter sequences, we give a discrepancy bound for (U, e, s)-sequences which is based on bounds for (u, m, e, s)-nets, and we relate our results to earlier ones.
