Despite of discouraging results of studies indicating the low robustness of a signal that is transmitted through the air, our decoder successfully detected signals emitted from a loudspeaker located 77m away. Embedded bits were conveyed by white-noise in 16-bits digital (fs=44.lkHz; 1,411kbps) at 4bps using echo-hiding technique. The sound pressure level of the 77m point was as low as 46dB. Autocepstrum diagrams of the point showed that each of the embedded bits keep good \"spikes\". We also confirmed that embedded bits sequence can be detected in a whole floor of a building using its real PA system. Although, further experiments are needed, the results will encourage researchers to use \"airborne stego-sound\" to explore more practical applications.", "paper_title": "A PORTABLE ACOUSTIC CAPTION DECODER USING IH TECHNIQUES FOR ENHANCING LIVES OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAF OR HARD-OF-HEARING - SYSTEM CONFIGURATION AND ROBUSTNESS FOR AIRBORNE SOUND", "paper_id": "WOS:000267923200004"}
