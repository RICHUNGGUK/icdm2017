This equation has two associated invariants: an energy function and the L-2 norm. It is widely accepted that structure preserving methods such as invariants-preserving and multi-symplectic integrators generally yield qualitatively better numerical results. In this paper we propose five geometric integrators for this equation: energy-preserving and norm-preserving finite difference and Galerkin schemes, and a multi-symplectic integrator based on a newly found multi-symplectic formulation. A numerical comparison of these schemes is provided, which indicates that the energy-preserving finite difference schemes are more advantageous than the other schemes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
