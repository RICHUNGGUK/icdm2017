The flow equation is discretized by a multipoint flux mixed finite element method and the displacements are approximated by a continuous Galerkin finite element method. First-order convergence in space and time is established in appropriate norms for the pressure, velocity, and displacement. Numerical results are presented that illustrate the behavior of the method.", "paper_title": "Coupling multipoint flux mixed finite element methodswith continuous Galerkin methods for poroelasticity", "paper_id": "WOS:000330990100006"}
