One of the most scalable checkpoint restart techniques, the message logging approach, is the most challenged when the number of cores per node increases because of the high overhead of saving the message payload. Fortunately, for two processes on the same node, the failure probability is correlated, meaning that coordinated recovery is free. In this paper, we propose an intermediate approach that uses coordination between correlated processes but retains the scalability advantage of message logging between independent ones. The algorithm still belongs to the family of event logging protocols but eliminates the need for costly payload logging between coordinated processes.
