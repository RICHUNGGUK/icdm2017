High internet bandwidth, powerful mobile devices, and advance of video annotation techniques have raised the popularity of the rapidly growing interactive video genre. This research focuses on enabling collaboration among authors of interactive nonlinear videos that provide alternative story plots for viewers to choose as part of their interactive behaviors. We discuss the \"irrelevant navigation elements\" problem, which could occur when multiple nonlinear video authors want to reuse a shared interactive video. Then, we propose a system called MAVINS, a managed navigation element for interactive nonlinear videos, to solve the aforementioned problem. The system is implemented as a web-based authoring tool and interactive video player for user-creator and user-viewer, respectively. Experimentation in self-directed learning was conducted to demonstrate the problem that occurs in current approaches as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system to solve that particular problem. As the result, the proposed system eliminated all the irrelevant navigation elements and, on average, reduced 54.55% of the total amount of displayed navigation elements on the shared videos.", "paper_title": "Context-Aware Navigation Element for Collaborative Nonlinear Video Authoring Tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000351767400009"}
