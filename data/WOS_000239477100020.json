We evaluated these visualisations in the context of a semester long software development project course. We give a theoretical analysis of the design of our visualizations using the framework from the \"Big 5\" theory of team work as well as a qualitative study of the visualisations and the students' reflective reports. We conclude that these visualisations provide a powerful and valuable mirroring role with potential, when well used, to help groups learn to improve their effectiveness.", "paper_title": "The Big Five and visualisations of team work activity", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100020"}
