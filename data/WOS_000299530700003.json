To achieve a high throughput rate, the inner signals, such as the syndrome, error locator and error value polynomials, are computed in parallel. In addition, the key equations are solved by using the S-DCME algorithm to reduce the hardware complexity. To handle the many problems caused by applying the S-DCME algorithm to the KES block, we modify the architectures of some of the blocks in the three-parallel RS decoder. The proposed RS architecture can reduce the hardware complexity by about 80% with respect to the KES block. In addition, the proposed RS architecture has an approximately 25% shorter latency than the conventional parallel RS architectures.", "paper_title": "Three-Parallel Reed-Solomon Decoder Using S-DCME for High-Speed Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000299530700003"}
