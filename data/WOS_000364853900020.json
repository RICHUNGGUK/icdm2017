Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a promising technique to ensure the end-to-end security of big data in the cloud. However, the policy updating has always been a challenging issue when ABE is used to construct access control schemes. A trivial implementation is to let data owners retrieve the data and re-encrypt it under the new access policy, and then send it back to the cloud. This method, however, incurs a high communication overhead and heavy computation burden on data owners. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that enabling efficient access control with dynamic policy updating for big data in the cloud. We focus on developing an outsourced policy updating method for ABE systems. Our method can avoid the transmission of encrypted data and minimize the computation work of data owners, by making use of the previously encrypted data with old access policies. Moreover, we also propose policy updating algorithms for different types of access policies. Finally, we propose an efficient and secure method that allows data owner to check whether the cloud server has updated the ciphertexts correctly. The analysis shows that our policy updating outsourcing scheme is correct, complete, secure and efficient.", "paper_title": "Secure and Verifiable Policy Update Outsourcing for Big Data Access Control in the Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000364853900020"}
