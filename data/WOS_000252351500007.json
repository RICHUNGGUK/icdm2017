These schemes are designed to compute approximate solutions with relative accuracy delta. We prove that the upper complexity bound for both schemes is O((root(n ln m)/delta)ln n) iterations of a gradient-type method, where n and m (nm) are the sizes of the corresponding linear programming problems. The proposed schemes are based on preliminary computation of an ellipsoidal rounding for some polytopes in R(n). In both cases, this computation can be performed very efficiently, in O(n(2)m ln m) operations at most.", "paper_title": "Rounding of convex sets and efficient gradient methods for linear programming problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000252351500007"}
