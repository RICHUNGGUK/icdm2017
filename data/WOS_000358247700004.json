Among the benefits of HEVC over the legacy MPEG-4 Advanced Video Coding (AVC), is a staggering 40 percent or more bitrate reduction at the same visual quality. Given the bandwidth limitations, video data are compressed essentially by removing spatial and temporal correlations that exist in its uncompressed form. This causes compressed data, which are already de-correlated, to serve as a vital resource for machine learning with significantly fewer samples for training. In this paper, an efficient approach to foreground extraction/segmentation is proposed using novel spatio-temporal de-correlated block features extracted directly from the HEVC compressed video. Most related techniques, in contrast, work on uncompressed images claiming significant storage and computational resources not only for the decoding process prior to initialization but also for the feature selection/extraction and background modeling stage following it. The proposed approach has been qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated against several other state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Efficient Foreground Extraction From HEVC Compressed Video for Application to Real-Time Analysis of Surveillance 'Big' Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000358247700004"}
