Three key components are as below: (i) a discrete velocity model (DVM) by Kataoka et al. [Phys. Rev. E 69, 035701(R) (2004)]; (ii) a forcing term I-i aiming to describe the interfacial stress and recover the van der Waals (VDW) equation of state (EOS) by Gonnella et al. [Phys. Rev. E 76, 036703 (2007)] and (iii) a Windowed Fast Fourier Transform (WFFT) scheme and its inverse by our group [Phys. Rev. E 84, 046715 (2011)] for solving the spatial derivatives, together with a second-order Runge-Kutta (RK) finite difference scheme for solving the temporal derivative in the LB equation. The model is verified and validated by well-known benchmark tests. The results recovered from the present model are well consistent with previous ones [Phys. Rev. E 84, 046715 (2011)] or theoretical analysis. The usage of less discrete velocities, high-order RK algorithm and WFFT scheme with 16th-order in precision makes the model more efficient by about 10 times and more accurate than the original one.", "paper_title": "Lattice Boltzmann kinetic modeling and simulation of thermal liquid-vapor system", "paper_id": "WOS:000347229100003"}
