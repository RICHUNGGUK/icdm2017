The method does not require manual identification of landmarks on training shapes. Each training shapes can be decomposed into a set of ellipse by elliptic Fourier transformation at a different frequency level. The MDL objective function is based on elliptic Fourier descriptors and principal component analysis (EF-PCA). Experiments show that our method can get better models.", "paper_title": "Minimum description length shape model based on elliptic Fourier descriptors", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000095"}
