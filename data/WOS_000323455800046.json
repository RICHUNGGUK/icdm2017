The minimum pseudoweight of this set of linear programming pseudocodewords is also generally accepted as a good predictor of the performance of iterative message-passing decoding. Since the linear programming decoder has a natural description based on the Tanner graph of a code, linear programming pseudocodewords can be analyzed from a graphical viewpoint. In this paper, two graphical characterizations of linear programming pseudocodewords of cycle codes are provided: one for the entire set of linear programming pseudocodewords, and one for the set of minimal linear programming pseudocodewords. The first of these characterizations is used to determine a formula for the minimum degree of a graph cover necessary to realize a linear programming pseudocodeword of a cycle code, and the second is used to prove a result concerning the asymptotic performance of the linear programming decoder when considering transmission over either the additive white Gaussian noise channel or the binary symmetric channel. Finally, a discussion contrasting these two characterizations both with each other and with Horn's characterization of bad pseudocycles is provided.", "paper_title": "Graphical Characterizations of Linear Programming Pseudocodewords for Cycle Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000323455800046"}
