Traditional single sensor wavelet denoising techniques are not suitable for this application since they fail to preserve the intersensor signal correlation. We propose two correlation preserving techniques for denoising multi-sensor signals: (1) the Temporal Wavelet Array Denoising (TWAD) technique developed by Rao and Jones [IEEE Trans. Signal Processing, vol. 48, pp. 1225-1234, 2000], and (2) a new Spatial Wavelet Array Denoising (SWAD) technique. It is shown that SWAD offers the advantage of a significant reduction in computational complexity at the cost of a slight reduction in SNR gain. The denoised array data is used for DOA estimation by the MUSIC algorithm. Simulation results are presented for MUSIC (without denoising), TWAD-MUSIC, and SWAD-MUSIC, to illustrate the improvement in DOA estimation performance brought about by denoising.", "paper_title": "Improved Direction-of-Arrival estimation using wavelet based denoising techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000243559800004"}
