Here we study the potential employment of hardware accelerators like the graphics processing unit or the application-specific integrated circuit MD-GRAPE-3 for the purpose of efficient computation of ESPs. An algorithm closely coupled to the general description of molecular surfaces is ported to both specialized architectures. The high-level interface library MR1/3 is used, which greatly simplifies the porting process. Hardware-accelerated versions show significant Speed-Up factors reaching values of up to 27x. Once ESP computations have become a matter of seconds, the underlying application can be offered in the form of a web service.", "paper_title": "Fast Calculation of Electrostatic Potentials on the GPU or the ASIC MD-GRAPE-3", "paper_id": "WOS:000292339500012"}
