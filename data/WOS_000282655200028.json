In this paper, using Shenzhen City in China as a case study, a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is used to explore the scale-dependent and spatial non-stationary relationships between urban land surface temperature (LST) and environmental determinants. These determinants include the distance between city and highway, patch richness density of forestland, wetland, built-up land and unused land and topographic factors such as elevation and slope aspect. For reference, the ordinary least squares (OLS) model, a global regression technique, was also employed, using the same response variable and explanatory variables as in the GWR model. The results indicate that the GWR model not only provides a better fit than the traditional OLS model, but also provides local detailed information about the spatial variation of LST, which is affected by geographical and ecological factors. With the GWR model, the strength of the regression relationships increased significantly, with a mean of 59% of the changes in the LST values explained by the predictors, compared with only 43% using the OLS model. By computing a stationarity index, one finds that different predictors have different variational trends which tend towards the stationary state with the coarsening of the spatial scale. This implies that underlying natural processes affecting the land surface temperature and its spatial pattern may operate at different spatial scales. In conclusion, the GWR model is an alternative approach to addressing spatial non-stationary and scale-dependent problems in geography and ecology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
