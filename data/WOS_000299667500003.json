The evaluation of each BC method is investigated under the use of four statistical criteria combined into a single measure, the polygon area measure. Overall, our proposed BC approaches perform very well in terms of the proposed measure for most of the cases and provide an improved effect regarding technical noise reduction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
