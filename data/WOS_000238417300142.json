The Internet topology is dynamically evolving and growing, and then shows changing characteristics based on time flow. Studies of Internet topology have been motivated by the demands for analysis and simulation to the modeling of real networks. Hence, to develop the Internet simulator, proper characteristics to Internet topology should be studied. In this paper, we propose topology models to the Internet topology showing node addition and deletion.", "paper_title": "An evolution process model for the Internet topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300142"}
