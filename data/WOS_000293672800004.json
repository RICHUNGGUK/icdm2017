This method is using a finite element model of the structure to study in order to minimize the error between field data and data predicted by the FE model. The method is applied in the case of a laboratory experiment modelling a soil-structure interaction problem. Results stress the impact of the sensitivity of the solution to the accuracy of field measurements by simulating both different levels of measurement noise on data and using several placements of sensors.
