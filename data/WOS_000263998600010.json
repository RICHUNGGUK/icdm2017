The nonlinear behaviour is analyzed for two flowsheet alternatives and four plantwide control structures. It is shown that the system can exhibit a complex nonlinear behaviour. For the parameter values used, regions of unfeasibility. two or three multiple steady states and branches of isolated solutions were found. The undesired nonlinear phenomena can be avoided by fixing the reactor-inlet flow rates of each reactant or, when this is impossible due to the flowsheet structure, by providing sufficient cooling capacity.
