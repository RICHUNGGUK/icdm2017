In this work we obtain explicit solutions for bidimensional lagging models of heat conduction, with different types of boundary conditions, in the form of infinite series solutions, allowing the construction of analytic-numerical solutions with bounded errors. Numerical examples, showing differences between models and the influence of parameters, are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
