We also introduce a fast learning mechanism that does not require extensive training data to teach gestures to the system. We use a six-degrees-of-freedom position tracker to collect trajectory data and represent gestures as an ordered sequence of directional movements in 2D. In the learning phase, sample gesture data is filtered and processed to create gesture recognizers, which are basically finite-state machine sequence recognizers. We achieve online gesture recognition by these recognizers without needing to specify gesture start and end positions. The results of the conducted user study show that the proposed method is very promising in terms of gesture detection and recognition performance (73% accuracy) in a stream of motion. Additionally, the assessment of the user attitude survey denotes that the gestural interface is very useful and satisfactory. One of the novel parts of the proposed approach is that it gives users the freedom to create gesture commands according to their preferences for selected tasks. Thus, the presented gesture recognition approach makes the HCI process more intuitive and user specific. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
