The simulation results of Poiseuille flow at a low hematocrit reveal that particles are concentrated between the centerline and the wall. This phenomenon indicates the occurrence of the Segre-Silberberg effect. On the other hand, as the hematocrit increases, this effect disappears and the number of particles flowing near the wall and the centerline increases. In the case of bifurcation flow, at a high hematocrit, the fractional particle flux to a daughter branch is almost similar to the fractional bulk flow to the same branch. However, at a low hematocrit, the fractional particle flux against the fractional bulk flow increases. (c) 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
