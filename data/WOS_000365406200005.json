To overcome such challenges, the conceptual design phase has been adapted to the current model development process. For that, the system engineers start to define the most relevant system architecture by respecting quality and time constraints. Next, the simulation model architects design the delivered system architecture in a more formal way with a modeling and simulation point of view to support the integration of domain-level simulation models in a consistent fashion. Finally, the model architects negotiate with different simulation model providers with the aim of specifying vehicle-and domain-level simulation models and their interface connections. To improve knowledge sharing between the mentioned actors, we propose a model identity card (MIC) for classifying simulation model knowledge, including input/output parameters, method, and usage specifications. The fundamental concepts that form the basis of all simulation models are identified and typed for implementation into a computational environment. An industrial case study of the engine-after-treatment model is used to show how MICs and the integrated model design phase might be used in a given scenario. A validation protocol is conducted through a heuristic observation to estimate the rate of model rework and ambiguity reduction.", "paper_title": "A Model Identity Card to Support Simulation Model Development Process in a Collaborative Multidisciplinary Design Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000365406200005"}
