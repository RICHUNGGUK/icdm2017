In the version 2.0, Higgs decays into squarks and sleptons are included, accompanied by a calculation of the squark, gluino and slepton spectrum and tests against constraints from LEP and the Tevatron. Further radiative corrections are included in the Higgs mass calculation. A link to MicrOMEGAs allows to compute the dark matter relic density, and a rough (lowest order) calculation of BR(b -> s gamma) is performed. Finally, version 2.1 allows to integrate the RGEs for the soft terms up to the GUT scale.", "paper_title": "NMHDECAY 2.1: An updated program for sparticle masses, Higgs masses, couplings and decay widths in the NMSSM", "paper_id": "WOS:000239672800005"}
