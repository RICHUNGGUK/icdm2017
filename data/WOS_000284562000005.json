Both lower and upper bounds of modulus of eigenvalues are given by the Stein equation. Furthermore, two sequences are presented which converge to the minimal and the maximal modulus of eigenvalues, respectively. We have to point out that the two sequences are not recommendable for practical use for finding the minimal and the maximal modulus of eigenvalues.", "paper_title": "BOUNDS OF MODULUS OF EIGENVALUES BASED ON STEIN EQUATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000284562000005"}
