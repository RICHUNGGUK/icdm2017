Such angular selection has applications in parallel coordinates, time series visualizations, spatio-temporal movement data, etc. Our interaction technique specifies a region of interest in the visualization (with a position and diameter), a direction, and an angular tolerance, all with a single drag. We experimentally compared this angular selection technique with other techniques for selecting curves, and found that angular selection resulted in a higher number of trials that were successful on the first attempt and fewer incorrectly selected curves, and was also subjectively preferred by participants. We then present the design of a popup lens widget, called the VectorLens, that allows for easy angular selection and also allows the user to perform additional filtering operations based on type of curve. Multiple VectorLens widgets can also be instantiated to combine the results of their filtering operations with boolean operators.", "paper_title": "VectorLens: Angular Selection of Curves within 2D Dense Visualizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000351755700009"}
