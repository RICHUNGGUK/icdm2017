Taking into account the features of deregulation and fluctuation, this paper uses artificial neural network to forecast next-day MCP, with period-decoupled data sequence and wavelet transform. For the purpose of better performance, an improved learning algorithm of artificial fish-swarm is proposed. By simulating fish-swarm actions, in random searching for foods, artificial fish-swarm based neural network (AFNN) achieves global optimum. Comparing with traditional next-day MCP forecasting methods, the suggested method could achieve better adaptability and greater predictive accuracy, which was proved by the experimental results.", "paper_title": "Next-day power market clearing price forecasting using artificial fish-swarm based neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000187"}
