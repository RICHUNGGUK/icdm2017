In order to increase the throughput of the network, multi-radio and multi-channel technology has been put forward to address this problem, since more channels can be used simultaneously to avoid collisions. In this paper, we propose \"HIQP\", a new scheme for hidden node and interference aware channel assignment, in which both hidden terminal problem and carrier sense interference are taken into consideration. This scheme is put forward in the link layer instead of network layer, which is a pre-determined approach. Our simulation results show that this optimum channel assignment scheme which has the least carrier sense interference and hidden terminal problem will be proposed before the establishment of network infrastructure.", "paper_title": "HIQP: A HIDDEN NODE AND INTERFERENCE AWARE CHANNEL ASSIGNMENT SCHEME FOR MULTI-RADIO MULTI-CHANNEL WIRELESS MESH NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000305169200011"}
