The bound, which is expressed in terms of the cumulative distribution function of the tilted posterior hypothesis distribution given the observation with tilting parameter theta >= 1, generalizes an earlier bound due the Poor and Verdu (1995). A sufficient condition is established under which the new bound (minus a multiplicative factor) provides the exact error probability asymptotically in theta. Examples illustrating the new bound are also provided.", "paper_title": "A Generalized Poor-Verdu Error Bound for Multihypothesis Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000298989200024"}
