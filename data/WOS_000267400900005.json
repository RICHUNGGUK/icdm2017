Thus, the Study of the communication networks for distributed systems - which is the focus of this paper - is very important. In particular, we address the problem of fat-tree based interconnection networks performance modeling for multi-user heterogeneous multi-cluster computing systems. To this end, we present an analytical model and validate the model through comprehensive Simulation. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits a good degree Of accuracy for various system organizations and under different working conditions. On the basis of the validated model, we propose an adaptive assignment function based on the existing heterogeneity of the system to minimize multi-user environment overhead. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
