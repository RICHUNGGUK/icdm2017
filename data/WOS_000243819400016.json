However, the inherent variations make analysis challenging. We propose a statistical method (SRA, swapped and regression analysis) especially for dye-swapped design and small sample size. Under general assumptions about the structure of the channels, scanner, and target effects from the experiment, we prove that SRA removes bias caused by these effects. We compare our method with ANOVA, using both simulated and real data. The results show that SRA has consistent sensitivity for the identification of differentially expressed genes in dye-swapped microarrays, particularly when the sample size is small. The program for the proposed method is available at http://www.ibms.sinica.edu.tw/similar to csjfann/firstflow/program.htm.
