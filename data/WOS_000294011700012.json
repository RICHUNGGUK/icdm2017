For d=2, k-reptile simplices (triangles) exist for many values of k, and they have been completely characterized by Snover, Waiveris, and Williams. On the other hand, for da parts per thousand yen3, only one construction of k-reptile simplices is known, the Hill simplices, and it provides only k of the form m (d) , m=2,3,aEuro broken vertical bar. We prove that for d=3, k-reptile simplices (tetrahedra) exist only for k=m (3). This partially confirms a conjecture of Hertel, asserting that the only k-reptile tetrahedra are the Hill tetrahedra. Our research has been motivated by the problem of probabilistic packet marking in theoretical computer science, introduced by Adler in 2002.", "paper_title": "On the Nonexistence of k-reptile Tetrahedra", "paper_id": "WOS:000294011700012"}
