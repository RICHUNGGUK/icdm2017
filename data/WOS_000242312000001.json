A hypergraph-partitioning-based model is proposed for the adaptive screen partitioning problem in this context. The proposed model aims to balance the rendering loads of processors while trying to minimize the amount of data replication. In the parallel DVR framework we adopted, each data primitive is statically owned by its home processor, which is responsible from replicating its primitives on other processors. Two appropriate remapping models are proposed by enhancing the above model for use within this framework. These two remapping models aim to minimize the total volume of communication in data replication while balancing the rendering loads of processors. Based on the proposed models, a parallel DVR algorithm is developed. The experiments conducted on a PC cluster show that the proposed remapping models achieve better speedup values compared to the remapping models previously suggested for image-space-parallel DVR.", "paper_title": "Hypergraph-partitioning-based remapping models for image-space-parallel direct volume rendering of unstructured grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000242312000001"}
