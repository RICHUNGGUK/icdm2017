These implementations often require complex control architectures featuring microprocessors, digital signal processors, and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Whereas software implementations are feasible for most power electronics practitioners, FPGA implementations with ad-hoc digital hardware are often a challenging design task. This paper deals with the design and development of control systems for power converters using high-level synthesis tools. In particular, the Xilinx Vivado HLS tool is evaluated for the design of a computationally demanding application, the real-time load estimation for resonant power converters using parametric identification methods. The proposed methodology allows the designer to use a high-level description language, e.g., C, to describe the identification algorithm functionality, and the tool automatically generates the hardware floating-point data-path and the control unit. Besides, it allows a fast design-space exploration through synthesis directives, and pipelining and parallelization are automatically performed to meet timing constraints. The evaluation performed in the study-case control architecture shows a significant design complexity reduction. As a consequence, high-level synthesis tools should be considered as a new paradigm in accelerating digital design for power conversion systems.", "paper_title": "High-Level Synthesis for Accelerating the FPGA Implementation of Computationally Demanding Control Algorithms for Power Converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000323569900017"}
