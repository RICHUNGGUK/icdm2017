However, resource-constrained systems cannot afford traditional error correction for overhead and cost reasons. New methods are required to sustain acceptable service quality in case of errors while avoiding crashes. We present a flexible fault-tolerance approach that is able to select correction actions depending on error semantics using application annotations and static analysis approaches. We verify the validity of our approach by analyzing the vulnerability and improving the reliability of an H. 264 decoder using flexible error handling.", "paper_title": "Improving the Fault Resilience of an H.264 Decoder using Static Analysis Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000329135500006"}
