Given a set of points called terminals in , find a minimum-length network such that each pair of terminals is connected by a set of axis-parallel line segments whose total length is equal to the pair's Manhattan (that is, L (1)-) distance. The problem is NP-hard in 2D and there is no PTAS for 3D (unless ). Approximation algorithms are known for 2D, but not for 3D. We present, for any fixed dimension d and any epsilon > 0, an O(n (epsilon) )-approximation algorithm. For 3D, we also give a 4(k-1)-approximation algorithm for the case that the terminals are contained in the union of ka parts per thousand yen2 parallel planes.", "paper_title": "Approximating Minimum Manhattan Networks in Higher Dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000348206400003"}
