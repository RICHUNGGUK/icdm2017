The feature depends on Gabor energy feature in which we derive a multi-band Gabor energy feature matrix. We also prove that two Gabor energy feature matrices such that represent two corresponding textures under different illumination are related by a linear transform. Experimental results show that the model is successful in recognizing color texture independent of the change in the spectral illuminations. (C) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
