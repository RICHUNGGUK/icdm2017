Our proofs rely on the Dolev-Yao style model of Backes, Pfitzmann, and Waidner, which allows for mapping results obtained symbolically within this model to cryptographically sound proofs if certain assumptions are met. This work was the first verification at the computational level of such a complex fragment of an industrial protocol. By considering a recently fixed version of PKINIT, we extend symbolic correctness results we previously attained in the Dolev-Yao model to cryptographically sound results in the computational model.", "paper_title": "Cryptographically sound security proofs for basic and public-key Kerberos", "paper_id": "WOS:000290846800004"}
