Two cases of this problem rise depending on the availability of the side information at the encoder. The set of all feasible rate-distortion-equivocation tuples is characterized for each case. The difference between the informed and uninformed cases and the advantages of encoder side information for enhancing privacy are highlighted for a binary symmetric source with erasure side information and Hamming distortion.", "paper_title": "Discriminatory Lossy Source Coding: Side Information Privacy", "paper_id": "WOS:000323455800029"}
