Extensive measurements are performed for seven devices of different types (wireless routers, smartphones, tablets, and embedded devices) and for both UDP and TCP traffic. Experimental results unveil that a substantial fraction of energy consumption, hereafter descriptively named cross-factor, may be ascribed to each individual frame while it crosses the protocol stack (OS, driver, NIC) and is independent of the frame size. Our findings, summarized in a convenient energy consumption model, contrast traditional models that (implicitly) amortize such energy cost component in a fixed baseline cost or in a toll proportional to the frame size and raise the alert that, in some cases, conclusions drawn using traditional energy models may be fallacious.", "paper_title": "Per-Frame Energy Consumption in 802.11 Devices and Its Implication on Modeling and Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000360067600017"}
