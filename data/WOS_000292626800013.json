In their scheme, Lu et al. not only kept the advantages of Yoon et al.'s scheme, but enhanced the efficiency of mutual authentication and at the same time avoided the stolen-verifier attacks as well. However, their scheme is proven to be unable to resist the off-line password guessing attacks. Apart from that, the problem of people masquerading as a server to communicate with the other users in their scheme is also inevitable. Therefore, an ameliorative password-based authentication scheme is proposed subsequently in this paper to achieve perfect forward secrecy and to resist replay attacks, server spoofing attacks, on-line and off-line password guessing attacks and impersonation attacks. The proposed scheme is shown to be more secure and practical than those previously proposed schemes.", "paper_title": "AN ENHANCED PASSWORD-BASED USER AUTHENTICATION SCHEME FOR GRID COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000292626800013"}
