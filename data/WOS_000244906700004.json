With the support of Teamster-G, users can develop applications on computational grids by means of shared variables. When they wish to execute their applications, Teamster-G provides a transparent resource allocation service for the execution of the programs. To minimize the turnaround time, Teamster-G employs a session-oriented protocol to reduce the cost of resource allocation, and a two-level consistency protocol to minimize the cost of maintainincy data consistency over the WAN. This paper presents the framework of Teamster-G and discusses its performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
