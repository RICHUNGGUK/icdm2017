This is in contrast to a number of video steganography tools that apply outdated and highly insecure techniques such as EOF data injection. However, even OpenPuff has subtle vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited. In this paper we propose a method to detect the presence of OpenPuff video steganography across MP4 files. By exploiting modifications to a files' metadata, we successfully identify the existence of hidden content. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
