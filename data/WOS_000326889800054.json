The problem's objective is to determine the location and number of two types of capacitated facilities, the size of two different vehicle fleets, and the related routes on each echelon. Two algorithms hybrid genetic algorithm and simulated annealing are then applied to solve the problem. Results of numerical experiments show that the applied hybrid genetic and simulated annealing algorithms are much more effective than the solutions of the solved examples by the software LINGO. Finally, solutions of simulated annealing and hybrid genetic algorithms were compared with each other.", "paper_title": "Two meta-heuristic algorithms for two-echelon location-routing problem with vehicle fleet capacity and maximum route length constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000326889800054"}
