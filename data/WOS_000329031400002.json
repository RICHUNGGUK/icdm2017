We propose LAKE: a new protocol that enables amortizing servers' workload peaks by moving most of the computational burden to the clients. We provide a formal analysis of the LAKE protocol under the Canetti-Krawczyk model and prove it to be secure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most computationally efficient authenticated key-establishment ever proposed in the literature.", "paper_title": "LAKE: A Server-Side Authenticated Key-Establishment with Low Computational Workload", "paper_id": "WOS:000329031400002"}
