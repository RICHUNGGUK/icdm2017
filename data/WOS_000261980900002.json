Firstly,an extensive formalized expression of conflicts in the fuzzy matter element model is given, next, the fuzzy matter element optimization method (FMEOM) is used to change the multi-object negotiation problems to single-object negotiation problems, and the regularized correlation function is regarded as the fitness function judging the stand and fall of particle; Then, in the implementation process of the PSO algorithm, the mutation mechanics is introduced to mutate the inactive particle and the particle with the smallest fitness according to mutation probability, which can not only effectively solve the premature convergence problem, but also significantly speed up the convergence; Finally, an example of the parameter optimization design in a power train is used to show the validity of this algorithm.
