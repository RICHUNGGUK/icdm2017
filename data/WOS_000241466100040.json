The problem is formulated and several Ant Colony based approaches were proposed and tested considering different instances of the maintenance scheduling problem, including applications related to the preventive maintenance of an aircraft fleet belonging to the Brazilian Air Force. The most successful approach has shown to be the one based on ACS with a specific local search procedure and inspired on the application of ACO to the timetabling problem. Details on the problem formulation, on the proposed approaches, and on the performed tests and applications are presented.", "paper_title": "Fleet maintenance scheduling with an ant colony system approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000241466100040"}
