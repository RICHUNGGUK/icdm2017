We give a new lower bound in the query model which proves that Grover's algorithm is exactly optimal. Similar to existing methods for proving lower bounds, we bound the amount of information we can gain from a single oracle query, but we bound this information in terms of angles. This allows our proof to be simple, self-contained, based on only elementary Mathematics, capturing our intuition, while obtaining at the same time an exact bound.", "paper_title": "EXACT QUANTUM LOWER BOUND FOR GROVER'S PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000264937600012"}
