This distinction has been made precise by Gentzen's famous cut-elimination theorem stating that synthetic proofs can be transformed into analytic ones. CERES (cut-elimination by resolution) is a cut-elimination method that has the advantage of considering the original proof in its full generality which allows the extraction of different analytic arguments from it. In this paper we will use an implementation of CERES to analyze Furstenberg's topological proof of the infinity of primes. We will show that Euclid's original proof can be obtained as one of the analytic arguments from Furstenberg's proof. This constitutes a proof-of-concept example for a semi-automated analysis of realistic mathematical proofs providing new information about them. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
