In this paper we study the 2-Layer Planarization problem: Can k edges be deleted from a given graph G so that the remaining graph is biplanar? This problem is NP-complete, and remains so if the permutation of the vertices in one layer is fixed (the 1-Layer Planarization problem). We prove that these problems are fixed-parameter tractable by giving linear-time algorithms for their solution (for fixed k). In particular, we solve the 2-Layer Planarization problem in O(k . 6(k) + |G|) time and the 1-Layer Planarization problem in O(3(k) . |G|) time. We also show that there are polynomial-time constant-approximation algorithms for both problems.", "paper_title": "A fixed-parameter approach to 2-layer planarization", "paper_id": "WOS:000237333500001"}
