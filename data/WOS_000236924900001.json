The system is composed of two subsystems: human face detection subsystem, human face recognition subsystem. The face detection subsystem includes two modules: face finding, and face verification. The human face finding module finds the candidate face regions from colour sequential images according to skin colour analysis and motion analysis. The human face verification module has been developed to verify the detected human faces by judging of eclipse and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and precisely localize human faces by locating eyes and mouths based on Generalized Symmetry Transform. The features of the relation between face patterns can be extracted and selected by Principal Component Analysis. The selected features are used to train multiple SVMs which can finally classify human faces. The system structure is designed according to the following principle: Firstly simpler methods are used to reduce the search space, and then more complicated methods are used in the reduced space. So the system can have a quick response speed as well as holding high detection and recognition rate. Human face detection accuracy of the system is 97.2% under controllable lightning condition. Human face (70 persons) recognition accuracy of the system is 96.5% (with 20 eigenvectors) and 98.3% (with 30 eigenvectors).", "paper_title": "Face detection and recognition using colour sequential images", "paper_id": "WOS:000236924900001"}
