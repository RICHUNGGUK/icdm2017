The signature plays a crucial role in these fragments. If all symbols are monadic, then the problem is NP-complete, whereas it is enough to have just one binary constant to lose decidability. In thisworkwe reduce Second-Order Unification to Second-Order Unification with a signature that contains just one binary function symbol and constants. The reduction is based on partially currying the equations by using the binary function symbol for explicit application @. Our work simplifies the study of Second-Order Unification and some of its variants, like Context Unification and Bounded Second-Order Unification.", "paper_title": "Simplifying the signature in second-order unification", "paper_id": "WOS:000272118300005"}
