As a case study for the experiment we verify several averaging clock synchronization algorithms. We present a formalization of Schneider's generalized clock synchronization protocol [Sch87] in Isabelle/HOL. Then, we verify that the convergence functions used in two clock synchronization algorithms, namely, the Interactive Convergence Algorithm (ICA) of Lamport and Melliar-Smith [LMS85] and the Fault-tolerant Midpoint algorithm of Lundelius-Lynch [LL84], satisfy Schneider's general conditions for correctness. The proofs are completely formalized in Isabelle/HOL. We identify parts of the proofs which are not fully automatically proven by Isabelle built-in tactics and show that these proofs can be handled by automatic first-order provers with support for arithmetics.", "paper_title": "Verification of clock synchronization algorithms: experiments on a combination of deductive tools", "paper_id": "WOS:000248377800004"}
