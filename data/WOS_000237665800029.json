Taking Machine Translation as the application, we argue that this strategy is not appropriate, since many aspects of algorithm design, such as the sense repository, depend on the application. We present evidence for this by investigating the disambiguation of nine verbs in English-Portuguese translations.", "paper_title": "The need for application-dependent WSD strategies: A case study in NIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000237665800029"}
