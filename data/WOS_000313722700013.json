However, these amplifiers have a limited linearity due to their switching behavior and also a limited control bandwidth. To overcome these major drawbacks, this paper introduces a self-oscillating control technique based on the sliding mode theory which combines a large control bandwidth and a spread spectrum technique. A high power supply rejection, which is a crucial parameter in modules directly connected to a noisy battery, has also been achieved by introducing a variable hysteresis window. Theoretical analysis, behavioral and electrical simulations are discussed in detail in this paper. An integrated circuit using 0.13 mu m CMOS process has been realized focused on mobile phone applications (0.8 W, 3.6 V and 8 a\"broken vertical bar). The audio amplifier achieves 97 dB(A) signal-to-noise ratio, 0.02 % harmonic distortion and up to 80 dB of power supply rejection. The die area is smaller than 0.4 mm(2) while keeping more than 90 % efficiency at 1 W.", "paper_title": "Sliding mode audio class-D amplifier for portable devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000313722700013"}
