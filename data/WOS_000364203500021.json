The base layer contains tone mapped low dynamic range (LDR) image data and the residual layer contains the error signal used to reconstruct the HDR image. This paper gives the result of a study to evaluate the overall performance of tone mapping operators (TMOs) for this standard. The evaluation is performed using five HDR image datasets and six TMOs for profiles A, B, and C of the proposed JPEG XT standard. The Tone Mapped image Quality Index (TMQI) and no reference image quality assessment (NR IQA) are used for measuring the LDR image quality. The peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) is used to evaluate the overall compression performance of JPEG XT profiles A, B, and C. In TMQI and NR IQA measurements, TMOs using display adaptive tone mapping and adaptive logarithmic mapping each gave good results. A TMO using adaptive logarithmic mapping gave good PSNRs.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of Various Tone Mapping Operators for Backward Compatible JPEG Image Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000364203500021"}
