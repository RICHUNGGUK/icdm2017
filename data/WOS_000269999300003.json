All such existing conditions are only sufficient. This paper formulates a necessary and sufficient condition for the contractivity of the fractal transform operator associated to a fractal code. Furthermore, analytical results on the convergence of the fractal image decoding will be derived.", "paper_title": "A Necessary and Sufficient Contractivity Condition for the Fractal Transform Operator", "paper_id": "WOS:000269999300003"}
