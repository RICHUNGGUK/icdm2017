In this paper, we investigate TV tennis game highlight detection based on the use of both short and long term audio features and propose two approaches, decision fusion and hierarchical classifier, in order to combine these two kinds of audio features. As more information is included in decision making, the overall performance of the system is enhanced.", "paper_title": "Combining short and long term audio features for TV sports highlight detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000238083200044"}
