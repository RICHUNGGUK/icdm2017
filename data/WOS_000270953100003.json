This proposed approach utilizes the view that the more important objective has the higher desirable satisfying degree. The originally complex optimization problem is simplified and divided into two parts that are solved one by one. The decision maker can acquire satisfying solution of all the objectives under linguistic preference. Numerical example shows the efficiency, flexibility, and sensitivity of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "TWO-PHASE INTERACTIVE SATISFYING METHOD OF FUZZY MULTIPLE OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION WITH LINGUISTIC PREFERENCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000270953100003"}
