The assessment is established through a parameter analysis of both algorithms in a theoretical case, and the methodology described in this paper is applied to a complex, real case. These two applications allow us to analyse an algorithm's properties and performance by defining ORs, how an algorithm's termination/convergence criteria affect the results and the importance of decision-makers participating in the optimisation process. The former analysis reflects the need for correctly defining the important algorithm parameters to ensure an optimal result and how the greater number of termination conditions makes the algorithm an efficient tool for obtaining optimal ORs in less time. Finally, in the complex real case application, we discuss the participation value of decision-makers toward correctly defining the objectives and making decisions in the post-process.
