The decision rules are based on the use of linear discriminant models developed with data obtained through mathematical models of the dam's behaviour. The aim is to combine the physical quantities measured by the automated monitoring system of the dam, appropriately weighted, into a new single index allowing the classification of the observations into one of two classes (normal behaviour and development of a failure scenario).
