In the proposed method we first use the ranking function to convert the triangular fuzzy data into crisp one. Then by using the goal programming method we derive the fuzzy weights of criteria. We propose two new methods, and it is shown that these methods are able to derive the weights of criteria in the case of crisp elements. We compare the results of the presented method with some of the existing methods. The approach is illustrated by some numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Deriving fuzzy weights of criteria from inconsistent fuzzy comparison matrices by using goal programming method", "paper_id": "WOS:000318157000008"}
