The variational method based on dyadic Green's function is used for finding the parameters of the equivalent circuit. A cosinusoidal aperture field distribution is assumed. Considerable mathematical simplification is resulted from replacing the centered inclined slot by an equivalent magnetic dipole. Coupling slot characteristics are deduced, including resonant length, dominant mode scattering in both the waveguides. Numerical and experimental results for resonant lengths and scattering parameters are presented over a range of tilt angles, frequencies, and waveguide dimensions. These results have significant applications in linear waveguide arrays and coupler design. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
