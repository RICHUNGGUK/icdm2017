They were introduced to represent interconnection networks as an alternative to the hypercube networks. We derive a characterization of Fibonacci cubes founded on the concept of resonance graphs. The characterization is the basis for an algorithm which recognizes these graphs in O(m log n) time.", "paper_title": "Fast recognition of Fibonacci cubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000250137700001"}
