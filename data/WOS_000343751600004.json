The first is a tutoring managing tool that assists the tutor in managing the teaching material and helps him/her in monitoring the students' learning progress. The second tool is an expert system that aims at helping the tutor in determining the difficulty level of a formula's conversion process. To this end, it combines two different approaches, one based on formula's structure and the other on the conversion process steps. Experimental results show that the difficulty estimation systems perform very successfully.", "paper_title": "Teaching assistance and automatic difficulty estimation in converting first order logic to clause form", "paper_id": "WOS:000343751600004"}
