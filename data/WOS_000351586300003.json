Today's video streaming systems mostly use HTTP streaming, with users accessing video segments as HTTP requests. A frequently used strategy is to serve all user requests as fast as possible, as if the user is downloading a file. The downloading rate can often far exceed the playback rate, when the system is below the peak load. This is known as progressive downloading. Since users may quit before viewing the complete video, however, much of the downloaded video can be \"wasted.\" By studying and exploiting the predictability of users' departure behavior, the authors developed a smart streaming strategy that can significantly improve overall streaming service quality under given server bandwidth. The improvement is achieved by avoiding the waste based on predicted user departure behavior. The proposed smart streaming technique is evaluated by modeling, analysis, and simulation, as well as experimentation using a prototype implementation.", "paper_title": "Smart Streaming for Online Video Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000351586300003"}
