Unlike the ERX proposed before, the DERX divided the edge table into two parts: the right and the left adjacent edge table, which recorded the right and the left edges respectively. The operator extends the offspring tour at both ends. The right and left adjacent edges can only link to the right and the left end of the offspring respectively. Experiments show it is much better than the conventional ERX and some other crossovers, especially for the large scale ATSP.", "paper_title": "On Directed Edge recombination crossover for ATSP", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600104"}
