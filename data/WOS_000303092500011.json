This paper presents a hybrid algorithm which combines global equilibrium search, path relinking and tabu search to solve the job shop scheduling problem. The proposed algorithm used biased random sampling to have a better covering of the solution space. In addition, a new version of N6 neighborhood is applied in a tabu search framework. In order to evaluate the algorithm, comprehensive tests are applied to it using various standard benchmark sets. Computational results confirm the effectiveness of the algorithm and its high speed. Besides, 19 new upper bounds among the unsolved problems are found. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
