Spherical, platy, and needle-like particles, representing GCC, delaminated clay, and aragonite PCC pigments, were considered in this study. For each particle shape, the compression of coating structures formed by mono-sized and poly-dispersed pigments were modeled. Stress-strain behavior of the coating layers and in-plane and out-of-plane movements of the pigment particles during the compression were computed under the same maximum compressive stress. Simulation results revealed that the in-plane movements of the pigment particles during compression in the calender nip were small in magnitude (<0.35 mu m). These findings help to better understand the smoothening phenomena of coating structures during the calendering process. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
