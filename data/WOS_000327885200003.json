This case is extremely common in multivariate spectral analysis. The objective of this research is to apply SPC to near-infrared and Raman spectral calibration. SPC is similar to traditional principal components analysis except that it selects the most significant part of wavelength from the high-dimensional spectral data, which can reduce the risk of overfitting and the effect of collinearity in modeling according to a semi-supervised strategy. In this study, four conventional regression methods, including principal component regression, partial least squares regression, ridge regression, and support vector regression, were compared with SPC. Three evaluation criteria, coefficient of determination (R-2), external correlation coefficient (Q(2)), and root mean square error of prediction, were calculated to evaluate the performance of each algorithm on both near-infrared and Raman datasets. The comparison results illustrated that the SPC model had a desirable ability of regression and prediction. We believe that this method might be an alternative method for multivariate spectral analysis.
