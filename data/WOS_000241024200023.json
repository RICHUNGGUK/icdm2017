However, existing DL action formalisms fail to include general TBoxes, which are the standard tool for formalising ontologies in modern description logics. We define a DL action formalism that admits general TBoxes, propose an approach to addressing the ramification problem that is introduced in this way, show that our formalism is decidable and perform a detailed investigation of its computational complexity.", "paper_title": "Reasoning about actions using description logics with general TBoxes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241024200023"}
