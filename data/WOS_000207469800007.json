We propose a node stability-based location updating approach. In order to optimize the routing, most of the existing routing algorithms use some mechanism for determining a node's neighbors. This information is stored in a table called the Neighbor Table. The updating of the Neighbor Table is referred to as location updating. To evaluate our proposed algorithm, we simulated it and compared its performance with that of the performance of the conventional location updating algorithm, by considering different performance measures such as the number of collisions on the carrier, the number of acknowledgments received and the energy consumed. In our work, we obtained different types of results by varying different parameters such as the number of nodes and the terrain dimensions. The simulation results obtained show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the typical location updating algorithm used in existing routing protocols.", "paper_title": "Node Stability-Based Location Updating in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000207469800007"}
