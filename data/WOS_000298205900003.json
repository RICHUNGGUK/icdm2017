In particular, the paper considers previous research efforts related to modelling of snake robots, physical development of these mechanisms, and finally control design efforts for snake locomotion. The review shows that the majority of literature on snake robots so far has focused on locomotion over flat surfaces, but that there is a growing trend towards locomotion in environments that are more challenging, i.e. environments that are more in line with realistic applications of these mechanisms.
