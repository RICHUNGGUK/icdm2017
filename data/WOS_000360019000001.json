The Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is employed to represent such nonlinear nonhomogeneous MJS with norm-bounded parameter uncertainties. In order to decrease conservation, a polytope Lyapunov function which evolves as a convex function is employed, and then, under the designed mode-dependent and variation-dependent fuzzy filter which includes the membership functions, a sufficient condition is presented to ensure that the filtering error dynamic system is stochastically stable and that it has a prescribed L-2 - L-infinity performance index. Two simulated examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "Robust Filtering for Nonlinear Nonhomogeneous Markov Jump Systems by Fuzzy Approximation Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000360019000001"}
