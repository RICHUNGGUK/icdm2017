We present the fusion of an image processing algorithm with the data obtained from the inertial measurement unit (IMU). The initial aim is to filter out environmental conditions using inertial information in order to combine a video stream with onboard electronic charts. This is achieved by the detection of the horizon with an image processing algorithm in an area defined by the IMU. We then present an evaluation of the algorithm with regard to the rate of detection of the horizon and the impact of the image resolution on the computational time. The purpose of developing this method is to create an augmented reality maritime operations application. We combine the video stream with electronic charts in a single display. We use the position of the horizon in the image to split the display into different areas. Then, we use transparency to display the video, the electronic charts or both.", "paper_title": "Real-time infinite horizon tracking with data fusion for augmented reality in a maritime operations context", "paper_id": "WOS:000340622300004"}
