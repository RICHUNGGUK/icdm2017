The paper assumes the presence of a monitoring system equipped with a pervasive sensor network and a non-monotonic reasoning engine. The rich set of sensors that can be used for monitoring in home environments and their sheer number make it quite complex to provide a correct interpretation of collected data for a particular patient. For this reason, we introduce a logic-based context model for situation assessment combined with high level declarative feedback policy specification, and we use logic programming techniques to reason about different pieces of knowledge for prevention.", "paper_title": "Support for context-aware monitoring in home healthcare", "paper_id": "WOS:000287455000006"}
