In a recent work, the authors found that an optimal (n, 5, [2, 1, 1])(4)-code of constant-composition can be obtained from a Room square of side n with super-simple property. In this paper, we study the existence problem of super-simple Room squares. The problem is solved leaving only two minimal possible n undetermined.", "paper_title": "Room squares with super-simple property", "paper_id": "WOS:000334179100001"}
