In a solenoid dispensing valve the involved physical effects are electro-magnetic (coil and magnet interaction), fluid flow and fluid structure interaction. It is challenging and time consuming to establish a full model description of these different effects even by using the most up-to-date Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFDs) software tools. This article therefore presents an alternative approach using network simulation methods for modelling of a dispensing valve using the simulation software SABER (Synopsys). To create the model, the different parts of the valve and the relevant physical effects occurring therein are described by partial differential equations and implemented as lumped elements. The lumped elements are then linked together to form a complete model of the dispensing valve including electrical, mechanical and fluid dynamic properties. A comparison with experimental data obtained from a real valve is presented at the end of the paper to discuss and validate the model. In particular the correct prediction of the dispensed liquid volume in dependence of the main parameters like pressure and opening time are considered. Using ab initio simulation deviations of the predicted dispensed liquid volume from the experimental results in the range 0.65-7.4% was found for different actuating pressures at valve opening times larger than 20 ms.
