These cements harden without producing much heat, develop compressive strength, and are remodeled slowly in vivo. The main purpose of the cement is to fill voids in metaphyseal bone, thereby reducing the need for bone graft. However, such cements may also improve the holding strength around metal devices in osteoporotic bone. This paper presents the optimum mechanical behavior of calcium phosphate cement/hydroxyl group functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes/bovine serum albumin (CPC/MWCNT-OH/BSA) composites in terms of compressive strength using well-known metaheuristic optimizers. The process parameters studied were wt% of MWCNT-OH (0.2-0.5 wt%) and wt% of BSA (5-15 wt%). The obtained results from metaheuristic algorithms were compared with the results from the response surface methodology (RSM) in the literature. The results obtained from metaheuristic algorithms outperformed the results given by the RSM in terms of less error percentage and high compressive strength.", "paper_title": "Optimum mechanical behavior of calcium phosphate cement/hydroxyl group functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes/bovine serum albumin composite using metaheuristic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000329407500026"}
