A half-car model is considered, the Pade approach is used to approximate the preview delay so as to rewrite it in a finite-dimensional description. It is assumed that the forward velocity of the vehicle resides in an interval and can be measured in real time. The controller, whose gain matrix depends on the information of the velocity, is designed by utilizing the polynomial parameter-dependent idea. The design procedure is developed based on homogeneous polynomial parameter-dependent matrices with arbitrary degree, with quadratic and linear parameter-dependent frameworks as special cases of this method. As the degree increases, the proposed controller can yield less conservative result. A linear parameter-dependent (LPV) controller has also been proposed for the system under time-varying velocity. Simulation results illustrate the usefulness and the advantages of the proposed methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
