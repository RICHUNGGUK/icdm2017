The procedure is based on the use of a generic reference vocabulary, which is used for fuzzifying the ontologies to be matched. The choice of this vocabulary is problem-dependent in general, although Wikipedia represents a general-purpose source of knowledge that can be used in many cases, and even allows cross language matchings. In the first step of our approach, each domain concept is represented as a fuzzy set of reference concepts. In the next step, the fuzzified domain concepts are matched to one another, resulting in fuzzy descriptions of the matches of the original concepts. Based on these concept matches, we propose an algorithm that produces a merged fuzzy ontology that captures what is common to the source ontologies. The paper describes experiments in the domain of multimedia by using ontologies containing tagged images, as well as an evaluation of the approach in an information retrieval setting. The undertaken fuzzy approach has been compared to a classical crisp alignment by the help of a ground truth that was created based on human judgment.", "paper_title": "FUZZY ONTOLOGY ALIGNMENT USING BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE", "paper_id": "WOS:000332729900004"}
