In this paper, we study a related problem called MaxBRNN: find an optimal region that maximizes the size of BRNNs for L (p) -norm in two- and three- dimensional spaces. Such a problem has many real-life applications, including the problem of finding a new server point that attracts as many customers as possible by proximity. A straightforward approach is to determine the BRNNs for all possible points that are not feasible since there are a large (or infinite) number of possible points. To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing algorithms which solve MaxBRNN for any L (p) -norm space of two- and three-dimensionality. Based on some interesting properties of the problem, we come up with an efficient algorithm called MaxOverlap for to solve this problem. Extensive experiments are conducted to show that our algorithm is efficient.", "paper_title": "Maximizing bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor for L-p -norm in two- and three-dimensional spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000297123000005"}
