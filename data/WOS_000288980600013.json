Accounting for strong discontinuities is presently of particular interest to the finite element research community with for example the development of cohesive and enriched elements to cater for material separation. Although strong discontinuities are of importance, of equal if not of greater interest and the focus in this paper, are weak discontinuities, which are present at any material change. A recent innovation for accounting for weak discontinuities has been the discovery of non-physical variables which are founded and defined using transport equations. This paper is concerned with the application of the non-physical approach to solidification modelling in the presence of more than one material discontinuity. A typical feature of the enthalpy-temperature response in solidification is discontinuities at phase transition temperatures as a consequence of phase change and latent heat release. In these circumstances, depending on the conditions that prevail, an element in a finite element mesh can have more than one discontinuity present. Presented in the paper is a methodology that can cater for multiple discontinuities. The non-physical approach permits the precise removal of weak discontinuities arising in the governing transport equations. In order to facilitate the application of the approach the finite element equations are presented in the form of weighted transport equations. The method utilises a non-physical form of enthalpy that possesses a remarkable source distribution like property at a discontinuity. It is demonstrated in the paper that it is through this property that multiple discontinuities can be exactly removed from an element so facilitating the use of continuous approximations. The new methodology is applied to a range of simple problems to provide an in-depth treatment and for ease of understanding to demonstrate the methods remarkable accuracy and stability.
