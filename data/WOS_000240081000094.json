After implementing proposed system, we verify the system using various sizes of video data. We get the fact that proposed system can reduce the delay time of encryption and decryption at the replay of video data.", "paper_title": "Multimedia contents security by wireless authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000094"}
