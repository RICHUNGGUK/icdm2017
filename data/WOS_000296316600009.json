Continuous casting of steel uses different configurations of magnetic fields to optimize turbulent flows in rectangular cross-sections to minimize defects in the solidified steel product. Realizing the importance of a magnetic field on turbulent flows in rectangular cross-sections, the present work is aimed at understanding the effect of a magnetic field on the turbulent metal flow at a nominal bulk Reynolds number of similar to 5300 (based upon full duct height) (Re(tau) = 170, based upon half duct height) and Hartmann numbers (based upon half duct height) of 0, 6.0 and 8.25 in a 2:1 aspect ratio rectangular duct. Direct numerical simulations in a non-MHD 2:1 aspect ratio duct followed by simulations with transverse and span-wise magnetic fields have been performed with 224 x 120 x 512 cells (similar to 13.7 million cells). The fractional step method with second order space and time discretization schemes has been used to solve the coupled Navier-Stokes-MHD equations. Instantaneous and time-averaged natures of the flow have been examined through distribution of velocities, various turbulence parameters and budget terms. Spanwise (horizontal) magnetic field reorganizes and suppresses secondary flows more strongly. Turbulence suppression and velocity flattening effects are stronger with transverse (vertical) magnetic field. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
