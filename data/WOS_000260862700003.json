For IP-over-optical networks in particular, automatic optical switching allows provisioning of on-demand lightpaths serving as capacity for IP/multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) links, allowing online reconfiguration of the IP/MPLS layer logical topology. Multilayer traffic engineering builds on the interaction between IP/MPLS routing and logical topology configuration. Technical issues in the IP/MPLS layer limit traffic measurement accuracy as well as routing flexibility and number of allowable topology updates. Through simulation, we examine the extent to which both measurement inaccuracies and routing granularity degrade multilayer traffic engineering performance.
