We also use these approximations to verify the validity of well-known approximate models, in particular the rapid binding model (Mager and Krzyzanski, Pharm Res 22:1589-1596, 2005) and the quasi-steady state model (Gibiansky et al., J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn 35:573-591, 2008).", "paper_title": "Dynamics of target-mediated drug disposition: how a drug reaches its target", "paper_id": "WOS:000318501700011"}
