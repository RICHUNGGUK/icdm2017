A relaxation procedure is developed in order to increase the rate of convergence of the algorithm and two selection criteria for the variable relaxation factors are provided. The boundary element method is used in order to implement numerically the constructing algorithm. We discuss this implementation, mention the use of Krylov methods to solve the obtained linear algebraic systems of equations and investigate the convergence and the stability when the data is perturbed by noise.
