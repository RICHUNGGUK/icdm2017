It is critical in maintaining the normal physiological processes such as development, differentiation, and apoptosis in many organisms. With increasing miRNA data, it is desirable to design methods to identify guide strand based on machine learning algorithms. In this study, the random forest models based on local sequence-structure features were proposed to identify miRNA in four species. The accuracies achieved were 86.51% for Homo sapiens, 81.66% for Ornithorhynchus anatinus, 82.33% for Mus musculus and 85.71% for Schmidtea mediterranea, respectively. Furthermore, the important analysis of feature elements was carried out by using the conditional feature importance strategy. The analysis results revealed that most of the significant elements were related to guanine-cytosine (GC) base pair. We believed that our method could be beneficial to annotate the function of miRNA and help the further understanding of the RNA interference mechanism. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
