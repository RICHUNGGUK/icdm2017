The algorithms LRU, FIFO, FWF, and FAR are compared using the path, star, and cycle access graphs. In this model, some of the results obtained are not surprising. However, although LRU is found to be strictly better than FIFO on paths, it has worse performance on stars, cycles, and complete graphs, in this model. We solve an open question from Dorrigiv et al. (2009) [13], obtaining tight bounds on the relationship between LRU and FIFO with relative interval analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
