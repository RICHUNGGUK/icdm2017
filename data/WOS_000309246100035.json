This paper considers the design of robust control schemes based on a sliding mode control to deal with the reference tracking problem for the loop voltage of a Tokamak by means of a control-oriented ASTRA-Matlab integration. The proposed controller stabilizes the system in spite of model uncertainties and the stability analysis of the closed-loop system dynamics is guaranteed by the Lyapunov stability theorem. The simulation results show the high-performance dynamic characteristics of the proposed method. The comparison of the simulation results provided by the sliding mode technique with those obtained from a traditionally used PID-based controller verifies that the proposed control scheme not only provides better tracking performance, but also faster and smoother response for the nonlinear system subject to model uncertainties and disturbances.", "paper_title": "SLIDING-MODE LOOP VOLTAGE CONTROL USING ASTRA-MATLAB INTEGRATION IN TOKAMAK REACTORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000309246100035"}
