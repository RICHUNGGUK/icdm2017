Their ability to deal with unobserved variables and to integrate data and expert knowledge make them an appropriate technique for modeling eye functionality measurements in glaucoma. In this study, a set of BNs is used to simultaneously perform classification of early glaucoma and cluster data into different stages of disease. A novel learning algorithm that combines clustering and quasi-greedy search is also proposed. The classification performances of the models are evaluated on an independent dataset, while the clusters are compared to K-means, previous publications, and direct knowledge. The use of clustering and structure learning enabled the exploration of the visual field patterns of the diseasewhile obtaining good results both on pre-(50% sensitivity at 90% specificity) and post-(85% sensitivity at 90% specificity) diagnosis data. Clusters obtained were insightful and in conformity with consolidated knowledge in the field.", "paper_title": "Exploring Early Glaucoma and the Visual Field Test: Classification and Clustering Using Bayesian Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000336050400033"}
