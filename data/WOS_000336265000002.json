The main function of quality function deployment is conversion of VOC to technical characteristics or voice of designer. However, it is not always easy to prioritize and assess technical characteristics during the total mass of information from the different customer attitudes. This article provides a methodology for the development of an intelligent quality function deployment based on fuzzy inference system in order to capture information through house of quality. As quality function deployment integrates different components of design and development, intelligent quality function deployment would be the best replacement for human expertise and can support decision-makers in wide range of design and development. This methodology applied on a classic sample for the design of a new undergraduate curriculum in an engineering department of a university as an illustrative example shows capability of this method. This article is composed of the background of quality function deployment, review of related research works, and representation of an intelligent system for analyzing it.", "paper_title": "An intelligent fuzzy logic-based system to support quality function deployment analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000336265000002"}
