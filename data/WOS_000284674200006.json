In the proposed system, the central authority delegates its authorization right to the local manager in a home network by issuing a proxy certificate, and the local manager flexibly controls the access rights of home devices on digital contents with its proxy certificate. Furthermore, the proposed system provides a temporary accessing facility for external devices and achieves strong privacy for home devices. For the validation of delegated rights and the revocation of compromised local managers, a hybrid mechanism combining OCSP validation and periodic renewal of proxy certificates is also presented.
