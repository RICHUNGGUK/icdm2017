IPv6 is used over low power WPAN (wireless personal area network) which is run by 6LoWPAN technology on the LoWPAN devices. In order to establish seamless connection of two heterogeneous networks, that is, WSN and IPv6 network, this paper proposes an improved energy conservation and interconnection scheme (ECIS) based on the analysis of the current schemes. Detailed design of each functional component in the new scheme is proposed, and an expansion of the SSCS module in NS2 802.15.4 simulator is examined. Comprehensive experiments on the simulation platform show that the newly proposed scheme is advantageous over existing results.", "paper_title": "A Study on an Energy Conservation and Interconnection Scheme between WSN and Internet Based on the 6LoWPAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000351077300001"}
