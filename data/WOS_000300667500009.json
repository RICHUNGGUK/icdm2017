Let V subset of R-k be the real algebraic variety defined by the polynomials in Q and suppose that the real dimension of V is bounded by k'. We prove that the number of semi-algebraically connected components of the realizations of all realizable sign conditions of the family P on V is bounded by [GRAPHICS] (in this form the bound was suggested by Matousek 2011). Our result improves in certain cases (when d(0) << d) the best known bound of Sigma 1 <= j <= k' ((s)(j)) 4(j) d(2d - 1)(k-1) on the same number proved in Basu et al. (Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 133( 4): 965-974, 2005) in the case d = d(0). The distinction between the bound d(0) on the degrees of the polynomials defining the variety V and the bound d on the degrees of the polynomials in P that appears in the new bound is motivated by several applications in discrete geometry (Guth and Katz in arXiv: 1011.4105v1 [math.
