Specifically, we prove that for every edge-weighted graph G = (V, E, w) and a subset of terminals T subset of V, there is a graph G' = (T, E', w') that is isomorphic to a minor of G such that for every two terminals u, v is an element of T, the shortest-path distances between them in G and in G' satisfy d(G), (w) (u, v) <= d(G'), (w') (u, v) <= O (log(5) broken vertical bar T broken vertical bar) . d(G, w) (u, v). Our existence proof actually gives a randomized polynomial-time algorithm. Our proof features a new variant of metric decomposition. It is well known that every finite metric space (X, d) admits a beta-separating decomposition for beta = O (log broken vertical bar X broken vertical bar), which means that for every Delta > 0 there is a randomized partitioning of X into clusters of diameter at most Delta, satisfying the following separation property: for every x, y is an element of X, the probability that they lie in different clusters of the partition is at most beta d(x, y)/Delta. We introduce an additional requirement in the form of a tail bound: for every shortest-path P of length d(P) = Delta/beta, the number of clusters of the partition that meet the path P, denoted by Z(P), satisfies Pr[Z(P) > t] <= 2e(-Omega(t)) for all t > 0.", "paper_title": "CUTTING CORNERS CHEAPLY, OR HOW TO REMOVE STEINER POINTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000360654100004"}
