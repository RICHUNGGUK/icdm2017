There are more digital devices and home appliances which compliance to the protocols. The proposed protocols are different and they are usually unable to communicate with each other; we design and implement a Service-Oriented Smart-Home Architecture to integrate protocols which are popular such as UPnP, Jini, DPWS on OSGi framework and collaborating Tmote, Zigbee and Bluetooth to converge various service oriented applications. Furthermore, with the well-developed Tmote, Zigbee and Bluetooth technology, majority of devices has been developed to support these technologies, we propose three new base drivers to integrate different devices communication protocol on our platform. Additionally, we propose a Service Resolving Bundle to complement the drawbacks of OSGi mechanisms. However, OSGi services with constructs of additional description are stored in our proposed Service Resolving XML (SRXML). Also, the service user may invoke the service of this bundle to get additional information of the aimed services. The architecture utilized with service-oriented mechanisms to accommodate applications which are implemented across different domains and allows the system components to interact with one another.
