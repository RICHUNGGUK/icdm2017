We start with identifying planar regions in depth images obtained with a SLAM system. Our main contribution is an approach which identifies constraints such as incidence and orthogonality of planar surfaces and uses them in an incremental optimization framework to extract high-level structural models. The result is a manifold mesh with a low number of polygons, immediately useful in many Augmented Reality applications such as inspection, interior design or spatial interaction.", "paper_title": "Structural Modeling from Depth Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000362355100006"}
