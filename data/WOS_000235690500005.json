Multi-trend simulating transfer functions were first introduced to exemplify the relationship between wave heights and each conceivable input factor by regressive fitting. The proposed NN-MT model can accurately forecast wave peak with an error of less 1.2 m and with time delay within 3 h and can be extended to cover the station besides the original station of interest.
