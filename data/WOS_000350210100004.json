Although many approaches consider particular preference representation models to be used as input for algorithms to address these tasks, there is a need for identifying a model that provides adequate constructions for users to express their preferences. In this paper, we propose a preference meta-model that provides various preference constructs, which include end-user expressions. We start by describing an exploratory study of how people express their preferences in natural language, which provides the basis for the meta-model. After describing the meta-model, we evaluate it with two user studies in different domains. The results of this evaluation indicate that the preference statements that can be expressed with the meta-model are adequate for allowing users to indicate their preferences to a computational system.", "paper_title": "Natural Language-based Representation of User Preferences", "paper_id": "WOS:000350210100004"}
