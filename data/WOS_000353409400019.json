The study is performed using 2D particle image velocimetry (PIV). The experiment clearly visualizes the changes in flow pattern with this arrangement and gives insight into the new flow pattern.", "paper_title": "Juncture flows around cylinders of unequal finite-height and diameter in tandem arrangement", "paper_id": "WOS:000353409400019"}
