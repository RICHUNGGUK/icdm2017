A numerical model taking all the facts into account, i.e., the kinetics of release and pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug, makes it possible to calculate the plasma drug level. Diagrams are built which connect the half life times obtained either through i.v. or with these dosage forms as a function of the full time of erosion of the polymer. Thus, it is possible to determine the right dosage form matrix associated with the desired therapy. Their interest stands for possible bioadhesion extending the gastrointestinal tract time.
