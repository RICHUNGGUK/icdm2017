This is facilitated by recent design contributions from the IEEE and the IETF, where the former developed a highly efficient deterministic time-frequency scheduled medium access control protocol in the form of IEEE 802.15.4e timeslotted channel hopping (TSCH) and the latter IPv6 networking paradigms in the form of 6LoWPAN/ROLL, and scheduling approaches in the form of 6TiSCH. The focus of the present work is on advancing the state-of-the-art of deterministic 6TiSCH schedules toward more flexible but equally reliable distributed approaches. In addition, this paper aims to introduce the first implementation of 6TiSCH networks for factory automation environments: it outlines the challenges faced to overcome the scalability issues inherent to multihop dense low-power networks; the experimental results confirm that the naturally unreliable radio medium can support time-critical and reliable applications. These developments pave the way for wireless industry-grade monitoring approaches.", "paper_title": "Decentralized Traffic Aware Scheduling in 6TiSCH Networks: Design and Experimental Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000373098800002"}
