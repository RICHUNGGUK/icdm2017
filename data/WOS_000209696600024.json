We formulate an offline optimization problem which can be solved optimally by the generalized Bender's decomposition. For real-time implementation with low computational complexity, we propose two suboptimal online power allocation schemes. The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated via simulations.", "paper_title": "Joint Power Allocation and Relay Selection in Energy Harvesting AF Relay Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696600024"}
