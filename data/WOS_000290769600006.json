In the present article, we consider a situation where n experimental units under investigation receive shocks at several time points. The parameter values of the lifelength distribution may change due to each shock, resulting in the generation of outliers. We derive the likelihood ratio test statistic to investigate if the shocks have significantly altered the parameter values. We also derive a likelihood ratio test under the labelled slippage alternative with multiple contaminations. Monte Carlo studies have been carried out to investigate the power of the proposed test statistics.", "paper_title": "Likelihood ratio tests for testing for multiple contaminants in the shocks and labelled slippage models", "paper_id": "WOS:000290769600006"}
