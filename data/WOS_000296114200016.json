Transient seepage analyses using finite element method (FEM) were performed to examine the accuracy of the derived SWCCs and SPFs, with a special focus on the wetting front propagation. Results show that the proposed new integrated system consisting of experimental and analytical techniques works well, in the sense that the soil moisture responses at specific depths of soil mimic those measured in constant-head seepage tests.
