Our method is able to distinguish between similar actions by only considering the body parts having major contribution to the actions, for example, legs for walking, jogging and running; arms for boxing, waving and clapping. We apply HMMs to model the stochastic movement of the body parts for action recognition. The HMM construction uses an ensemble of body-part detectors, followed by grouping of part detections, to perform human identification. Three example-based body-part detectors are trained to detect three components of the human body: the head, legs and arms. These detectors cope with viewpoint changes and self-occlusions through the use of ten sub-classifiers that detect body parts over a specific range of viewpoints. Each sub-classifier is a support vector machine trained on features selected for the discriminative power for each particular part/viewpoint combination. Grouping of these detections is performed using a simple geometric constraint model that yields a viewpoint-invariant human detector. We test our approach on three publicly available action datasets: the KTH dataset, Weizmann dataset and HumanEva dataset. Our results illustrate that with a simple and compact representation we can achieve robust recognition of human actions comparable to the most complex, state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Human action recognition using an ensemble of body-part detectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000318702500002"}
