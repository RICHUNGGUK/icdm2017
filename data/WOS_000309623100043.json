New move evaluation techniques are proposed, accounting for penalized infeasible solutions with respect to time-window and duration constraints, and allowing to evaluate moves from any classical neighbourhood based on arc or node exchanges in amortized constant time. Furthermore, geometric and structural problem decompositions are developed to address efficiently large problems. The proposed algorithm outperforms all current state-of-the-art approaches on classical literature benchmark instances for any combination of periodic, multi-depot, site-dependent, and duration-constrained vehicle routing problem with time windows.
