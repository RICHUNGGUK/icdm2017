In an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system, a cooperative communication that each user shares their allocated sub-channels instead of the MIMO system has been proposed to improve the throughput. But the cooperative communication has a problem as the decreased throughput because it is necessary that users send and receive the information to each other to improve reliability. In this letter, the modified cooperative transmission scheme is proposed to improve reliability in the fading channel, and it can solve the problem for BER performance that is dependent on the errors in the first phase that exchanges the information between both users during the first time.", "paper_title": "An Improved Cooperative Technique Sharing the Channel in OFDMA-Based System", "paper_id": "WOS:000348141600026"}
