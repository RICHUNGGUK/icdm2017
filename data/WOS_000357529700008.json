In this paper, we investigate the impact of these novel features in DCN optimization by providing a comprehensive mathematical formulation and a repeated matching heuristic for its resolution. We show, in particular, how virtual bridging and multipath forwarding impact common DCN optimization goals, traffic engineering (TE) and energy efficiency (EE), and assess their utility in the various cases of four different DCN topologies. We show that virtual bridging brings a high performance gain when TE is the primary goal and should be deactivated when EE becomes important. Moreover, we show that multipath forwarding can bring relevant gains only when EE is the primary goal and virtual bridging is not enabled.", "paper_title": "Striking a Balance Between Traffic Engineering and Energy Efficiency in Virtual Machine Placement", "paper_id": "WOS:000357529700008"}
