CoRe learning is an unsupervised, soft-competitive [1] model with conscience [2] that can be used for self-generating compact neural representations of the input stimuli. The key idea underlying the development of CoRe learning is to exploit the temporal distribution of neurons activations as a source of training information and to drive memory formation. As a case study, the paper reports the CoRe learning rules that have been derived for the unsupervised training of a Radial Basis Function network.", "paper_title": "Competitive repetition-suppression (CoRe) learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100014"}
