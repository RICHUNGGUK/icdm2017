This arises as a result of the time gap in between the time of estimation and the starting time of the EOQ system, and a permissible delay in payment will affect the inventory total cost. Moreover, the political instability or uncertainty of a country ( as well as the whole world) leads to a much more unstable situation in the present world economy. Thus, a change in inflation takes place, and the inflation rate is uncertain in nature. This study develops an EOQ model with a fuzzy inflation rate and fuzzy deterioration rate, and a delay in payment is also permissible. We have derived the corresponding fuzzy cost function, and the solution procedure has been explained with the help of a numerical example. A sensitivity analysis has also been carried out.", "paper_title": "An EOQ model with fuzzy inflation rate and fuzzy deterioration rate when a delay in payment is permissible", "paper_id": "WOS:000238617700006"}
