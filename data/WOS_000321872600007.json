Two most important results are the calculation of the sensitivity and spatial resolution of a BOS system, which allows for the determination of the experiment design space. A set of relations that characterize the performance of a BOS measurement is given, with emphasis on the design of background pattern and spatial placement of optical components.", "paper_title": "Measurement sensitivity and resolution for background oriented schlieren during image recording", "paper_id": "WOS:000321872600007"}
