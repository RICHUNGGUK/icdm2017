Target tracking is one of the important research issues, where sensors are deployed in many applications such as campus security, surveillance, habitat and battle field monitoring. Information can be forwarded in an ad hoc multi-hop fashion via internet to monitor a specific region and can form a ubiquitous network for several internet services. In this paper, Sequential Boundary Node Selection (SBNS) and Distributed Boundary Node Selection (DBNS) algorithms are proposed to find out the boundary nodes of the wireless sensor network. Besides, a target tracking protocol is proposed to detect the entry and exit of the targets using those boundary nodes. Simulation results show that the selection of boundary nodes in our protocol is almost close to the optimal one and the time of selecting boundary nodes would not increase rapidly, with increase in the size of the deployed nodes.
