To achieve this, the weight of all 5-variable functions, has been tabulated in a compressed table, which is used extensively in our approach and speeds-up computation time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper dealing with exact solutions of incompletely specified functions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
