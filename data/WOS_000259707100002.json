Due to EHRs' complexity, the usability of these systems is crucial to ensure safety and to enable clinicians (users) to focus on their patients rather than the technology. This case study presents experiences from the implementation of a commercial EHR in a large pediatric hospital system. This case discusses how a predictive evaluation method, Heuristic Walkthrough, was used to evaluate and improve the usability of the EHR system. Outcomes from the evaluation resulted in immediate changes in the system configuration and training materials, which helped to avoid usability problems at rollout, as well as change requests to the vendor to improve overall system usability in the long term. Design trade-offs and lessons learned for future EHR implementations and other healthcare applications are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
