Their runtime is polynomial in the number of equivalence classes of problem-specific equivalence relations on subsets of vertices, defined on a given decomposition tree of G. Using these algorithms all these problems become solvable in polynomial time for many well-known graph classes like interval graphs and permutation graphs (Belmonte and Vatshelle (2013) [1]). Given a decomposition of boolean-width k we show that the algorithms will have runtime O(n(4)2(O(k2))), providing the first large class of problems solvable in fixed-parameter single-exponential time in boolean-width.
