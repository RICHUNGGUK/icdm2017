In order to find a musically appropriate sequence of chords. we propose the principle of \"harmony cost\", which is defined as the sum of two different costs: one is the \"local cost\" which indicates the unlikelihood of a certain chord allocation and the other is the \"transition cost\", which indicates the unlikelihood of a certain connection between two chords. Automatic basso continuo playing is realised by searching for the optimal chord sequence, which minimises the accumulated harmony cost. The proposed method is evaluated by three experiments. Each experiment verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
