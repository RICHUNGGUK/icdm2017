AMIA's 2013 Health Policy Invitational was focused on examining existing challenges surrounding full engagement of the patient and crafting a research agenda and policy framework encouraging the use of informatics solutions to achieve this goal. The group tackled this challenge from educational, technical, and research perspectives. Recommendations include the need for consumer education regarding rights to data access, the need for consumers to access their health information in real time, and further research on effective methods to engage patients. This paper summarizes the meeting as well as the research agenda and policy recommendations prioritized among the invited experts and stakeholders.", "paper_title": "Patient-centered care, collaboration, communication, and coordination: a report from AMIA's 2013 Policy Meeting", "paper_id": "WOS:000356719000002"}
