In this paper we present the concept of concern-sensitive navigation, a useful conceptual tool to improve navigation by profiting from the nature of application's concerns. Concern sensitive navigation allows enriching Web pages with information, services or links related with the context in which pages are accessed. We show how our ideas are applied during the development process (e.g. by applying wise design strategies for separation of concerns) and can also be used by final users while adapting an application (e.g. by modding). Some examples of Web 2.0 sites are used to illustrate this last possibility. We also compare our research with other similar approaches such as the construction of adaptive Web applications.", "paper_title": "ENGINEERING CONCERN-SENSITIVE NAVIGATION STRUCTURES, CONCEPTS, TOOLS AND EXAMPLES", "paper_id": "WOS:000280504600004"}
