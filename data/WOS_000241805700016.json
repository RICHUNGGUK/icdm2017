Specifically, we consider partial feedback from the receiver to the sender as well as partial feedback from the relay to the sender. These achievable rates are calculated for the general Gaussian and the Z relay channels and are shown to improve on the known one-way achievable rates.", "paper_title": "Achievable rates for the discrete memoryless relay channel with partial feedback configuration", "paper_id": "WOS:000241805700016"}
