These three different tools include: a context diagram, which depicts the process flow at the highest level; all emotion transition diagram or a state transition diagram, which describes a service delivery process that provides customers a delightful experience; and ail action specification in a textual form. With this new approach, different stakeholders have a common communication tool that shows a service delivery process from various angles including the scope, the operations flow, and the emotion flow between customers and service personnel. More importantly, it gives practitioners a new insight of how to create a delightful experience in service delivery. It is believed that the input of a structured service description call contribute further to the recent application of artificial intelligence (AI) in identifying the hidden pattern of the customer's needs.
