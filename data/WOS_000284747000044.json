However, facility location theory and guidelines for N2C firms are sparse. In this paper, with regard to the customer characteristics peculiar to B2C e-commerce and the turbulence of the competitive market, a new fuzzy location model is proposed to optimize the distribution system design in B2C e-commerce. The model adopts a hierarchical agglomerative clustering method to classify customers and estimate the fuzzy delivery cost. At the same time, due to the turbulence of competitive market, both market supply and customer demand are treated as fuzzy variables in the model. Afterward, the credibility measure and Hurwicz criterion are introduced to convert the model into a crisp one which has NP-hard complexity. In order to solve the crisp model, an improved genetic algorithm with particle swarm optimization is developed. Finally, the computational results of some numerical examples are used to illustrate the application and performance of the proposed model and algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
