This method produces at each iteration a descent direction, and this property is independent of the line search adopted. Under standard assumptions, we prove that the MPRP method using strong Wolfe conditions is globally convergent. The results of computational experiments are reported and show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A modified Polak-Ribiere-Polyak descent method for unconstrained optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000326068500011"}
