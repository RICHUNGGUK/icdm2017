The control system is extended to include biasing by emotional valence, with qualitative analysis given of a range of emotion paradigms. Application of the model is made to a recent paradigm underlining the need for attention in emotional influences. The paper ends with conclusion and discussion of further work. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
