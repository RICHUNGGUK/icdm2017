Trimmed NURBS surfaces, the de facto standard in commercial mechanical CAD modeling packages, are currently being tessellated into triangles before being sent to the graphics card for display since there is no native hardware support for NURBS. Other GPU-based NURBS evaluation and display methods either approximated the NURBS patches with lower degree patches or relied on specific hard-coded programs for evaluating NURBS surfaces of different degrees. Our method uses a unified GPU fragment program to evaluate the surface point coordinates of any arbitrary degree NURBS patch directly, from the control points and knot vectors stored as textures in graphics memory. This evaluated surface is trimmed during display using a dynamically generated trim-texture calculated via alpha blending. The display also incorporates dynamic Level of Detail (LOD) for real-time interaction at different resolutions of the NURBS surfaces. Different data representations and access patterns are compared for efficiency and the optimized evaluation method is chosen. Our GPU evaluation and rendering speeds are more than 40 times faster than evaluation using the CPU. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
