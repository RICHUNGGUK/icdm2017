Design/methodology/approach - The paper considers how new web technologies have impacted the role of time in scientometric indicators. Findings - The paper suggests that it is important to be aware of the limitations of scientometrics indicators in an increasingly complicated information environment, although without a more developed semantic web there is little that can be done. Practical implications - Users of scientometric indicators should refrain from claiming too much confidence in them. Originality/value - The paper considers scientometric indicators at a finer granularity that usual, and will be of interest to anyone concerned the application of bibliometric indicators and the changing nature of scientific discourse.", "paper_title": "Metrics for an increasingly complicated information ecosystem", "paper_id": "WOS:000369387900006"}
