Meanwhile, an operator marching method, a one-way re-formulation based on the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, is improved to solve the equation. Numerical examples show that our treatment is more efficient.", "paper_title": "New computational treatment of optical wave propagation in lossy waveguides", "paper_id": "WOS:000359399700003"}
