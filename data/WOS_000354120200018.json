Unlike previous approaches which bootstrap the moving grid from a lower-order, finite-difference discretization, this work uses a consistent spectral collocation discretization for both the grid movement problem and the underlying, physical partial differential equation. Additionally, this work develops an error monitor function based on filtering in the spectral domain, which concentrates grid points in areas of locally poor resolution without relying on an assumption of locally steep gradients. This makes the MMPDE method more robust in the presence of rarefaction waves which feature rapid change in higher-order derivatives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
