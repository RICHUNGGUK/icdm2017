Version 2.0 of MSstats supports label-free and label-based experimental workflows and data-dependent, targeted and data-independent spectral acquisition. It takes as input identified and quantified spectral peaks, and outputs a list of differentially abundant peptides or proteins, or summaries of peptide or protein relative abundance. MSstats relies on a flexible family of linear mixed models.", "paper_title": "MSstats: an R package for statistical analysis of quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000342912400067"}
