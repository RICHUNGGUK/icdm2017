The difference image data computed from multi-temporal satellite images of the same scene is modelled by using N components GMM. GA is used to estimate the parameters of the GMM. Then, the GMM of the difference image data is partitioned into two sets of distributions representing data distributions of \"changed\" and \"unchanged\" pixels by minimizing a cost function using GA. Bayesian inference is exploited together with the estimated data distributions of \"changed\" and \"unchanged\" pixels to achieve the final change detection result. The proposed method does not need any parameter tuning process, and is completely automatic. As a case study for the unsupervised change detection, multi-temporal advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) images acquired by ESA Envisat on the recent flooding area in Bangladesh and parts of India brought on by two weeks of persistent rain and multi-temporal optical images acquired by Landsat 5 TM on a part of Alaska are considered. Change detection results are shown on real data and comparisons with the state-of-the-art techniques are provided. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
