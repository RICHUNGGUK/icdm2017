Previous research has focused on two approaches, one related to hashing and the other to pseudorandom generators. A third view, regarding extractors as good error correcting codes, was noticed before. Yet, researchers had failed to build extractors directly from a good code without using other tools from pseudorandomness. We succeed in constructing an extractor directly from a Reed-Muller code. To do this, we develop a novel proof technique. Furthermore, our construction is the first to achieve degree close to linear. In contrast, the best previous constructions brought the log of the degree within a constant of optimal, which gives polynomial degree. This improvement is important for certain applications. For example, it was used LE. Mossel, C. Umans, On the complexity of approximating the VC dimension, J. Comput. System Sci. 65 (2002) 660-671] to show that approximating VC dimension to within a factor of N1-delta is AM-hard for any positive delta. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
