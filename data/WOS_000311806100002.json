Cloud services also provide a variety of services for users, including virtual hosting services, storage services, and Web application services. Distributed computing and the peer-to-peer (P2P) network are two important elements in cloud computing. However, the huge numbers of information devices currently in use present some new problems, such as the lack of IPv4 protocol addresses. Therefore, the IPv6 protocol was proposed. During the transition period from pure IPv4 to pure IPv6, IPv4 and IPv6 will coexist on the Internet. To link independent dual-stack P2P networks around the world, we herein propose a mechanism to improve the service discovery in dual-stack cloud file service, thus decreasing the amount of protocol translation and improving the efficiency of the bandwidth and load balance. From the simulation results, we conclude that the proposed mechanism can achieve higher connection success rate, efficient bandwidth, and a lower connection build time. Our paper indicates that the connection success rate and efficient bandwidth outperforms the other schemes by approximately 20% and 24%, respectively.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Service Discovery System for Dual-Stack Cloud File Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000311806100002"}
