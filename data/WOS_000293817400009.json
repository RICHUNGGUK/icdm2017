The proposed algorithm returns a bug rule in a program by receiving new rules from oracles (oracle rules). We construct theory about correctness of the proposed algorithm, present two strategies with respect to the requests of oracle rules, report examples to show the property of the proposed algorithm, and compare the proposed algorithm with the other debugging algorithms in the ET model.", "paper_title": "ALGORITHMIC DEBUGGING OF EQUIVALENT TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMS USING ORACLE RULES", "paper_id": "WOS:000293817400009"}
