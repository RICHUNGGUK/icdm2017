As we are entering into a \"big data\" era, it is imperative to migrate scientific workflow management systems into the cloud to manage the ever increasing data scale and analysis complexity. We propose a reference service framework for integrating scientific workflow management systems into various cloud platforms, which consists of eight major components, including Cloud Workflow Management Service, Cloud Resource Manager, etc., and six interfaces between them. We also present a reference framework for the implementation of Cloud Resource Manager, which is responsible for the provisioning and management of virtual resources in the cloud. We discuss our implementation of the framework by integrating the Swift scientific workflow management system with the OpenNebula and Eucalyptus cloud platforms, and demonstrate the capability of the solution using a NASA MODIS image processing workflow and a production deployment on the Science@Guoshi network with support for the Montage image mosaic workflow.", "paper_title": "A Service Framework for Scientific Workflow Management in the Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000367007100010"}
