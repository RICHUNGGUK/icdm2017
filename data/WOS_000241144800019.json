Several mass storage systems have been developed by different institutions access their own data repositories. These systems expose native interfaces with no interoperability among them. In order to deal with this requirement, OGSA-DAI has emerged to provide uniform access to data sources. However, this initiative is not focused on the performance of the I/O operations. This paper describes MAPFS-DAI, an approach which tries to combine both ideas: performance and interoperability. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
