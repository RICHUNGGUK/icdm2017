Through analyzing the movement characteristics of the real insects, it is easy to generate kinds of gait patterns and achieve their smooth transition if we employ a series of oscillations with adjustable phase lag. Based on this concept, a CPG model is proposed, which is constructed by an isochronous oscillators and several first-order low-pass filters. As an application, a hexapod robot and its locomotion control are introduced by converting the CPG signal to robot's joint space. Simulation and real world experiment are completed to demonstrate the validity of the proposed CPG model. Through measuring the position of the body center and the distance between footpoints and ground, the smooth gait transition can be achieved so that the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified.", "paper_title": "Smooth transition between different gaits of a hexapod robot via a central pattern generators algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000307716700006"}
