In this article, the related topics of measurement and construct validity are summarized and discussed, with particular focus on formative and reflective indicators and common method bias, and, where relevant, a number of allied issues are considered. The perspective taken is an eclectic and holistic one and attempts to address conceptual and philosophical essentials, raise salient questions, and pose plausible solutions to critical measurement dilemmas occurring in the managerial, behavioral, and social sciences.", "paper_title": "MEASUREMENT AND MEANING IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND ORGANIZATIONAL RESEARCH: METHODOLOGICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000290842900003"}
