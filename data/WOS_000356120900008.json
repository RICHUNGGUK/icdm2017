Two crucial aspects, local integration of the constitutive equations (the local problem) and forming tangent operators for Newton-Raphson iteration (the global problem), are investigated. For solving the local problem, different integration algorithms, including explicit and implicit methods, are examined using tri-axial compression tests and incremental stress response envelopes, as well as typical boundary value problems. For solving global problems, three different ways of generating the tangent operator are compared. The numerical evidences indicate that, in terms of accuracy, efficiency and robustness, explicit methods with substepping and error control are the best choices for constitutive integration of hypoplastic models while the so-called continuum tangent operators have certain advantages over two other types of numerically-generated consistent tangent operators.
