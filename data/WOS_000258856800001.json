The obtained antenna bandwidth is in the order of 10:1. The directional behavior is gotten by slating a planar monopole antenna with respect to the ground plane. The UWB and directional characteristics of this antenna was obtained by optimizing four parameters: bevelling and slating angles, the size of the matching impedance hole, and the ratio between the height and width of the radiating element. The relatively easy construction of the antenna is one of its main features along with its gain, which goes from 0 to 8.1 dB in the band from 2.6 to 20 GHz. Results obtained by simulation and measurements are in close agreement.
