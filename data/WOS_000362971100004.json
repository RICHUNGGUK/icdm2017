Heinrich et al.(1999) showed that P-4 decomposes a connected 4-regular graph G if and only if vertical bar E(G)vertical bar is divisible by 3. We show that P-4 decomposes a connected 4-regular multigraph G with mu(G) <= 2 if and only if no 3 vertices of G induce more than 4 edges and vertical bar E(G)vertical bar is divisible by 3. Oksimets (2003) proved that for all integers k >= 3, P-4 decomposes a connected 2 k-regular graph G if and only if vertical bar E(G)vertical bar is divisible by 3. We prove that for all integers k >= 2, the problem of determining if P-4 decomposes a (2 k + 1)-regular graph is NP-Complete. El-Zanati et al.(2014) showed that for all integers k >= 1, every 6 k-regular multigraph with mu(G) <= 2 k has a P-4-decomposition. We show that unless P = NP, this result is best possible with respect to mu(G) by proving that for all integers k >= 3 the problem of determining if P-4 decomposes a 2 k-regular multigraph with mu(G) <= left perpendicular2k/3right perpendicular + 1 is NP-Complete.", "paper_title": "The complexity of P-4-decomposition of regular graphs and multigraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000362971100004"}
