The QR decomposition hardware is constructed using the coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) algorithm operating with fewer gate counts and lower power consumption than do triangular systolic array (TSA) structures. Accurate signal transmission is essential to wireless communication systems. Thus, a more effective data detection algorithm and precise channel estimation method play vital roles in MIMO systems. Implementing data detection with QR decomposition helps reduce the complexity of MIMO-OFDM detection. Implementation results reveal that the proposed recursive QR decomposition (RQRD) architecture has lower clock latency than do TSA structures, and has a smaller hardware area than do Gram-Schmidt structures.", "paper_title": "RECURSIVE QR DECOMPOSITION ARCHITECTURE FOR MIMO-OFDM DETECTION SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000316911200001"}
