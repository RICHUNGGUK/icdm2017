For this supply chain several commodities with defined items is produced. The model is categorized as a capacitated facility location model. The hierarchical approach is used to modeling and based on decision types the model is divided into two levels. The solution approach is based on the Lagrangian Relaxation approach, improved by an efficient heuristic to solve complex sub-problems. Computational results indicated that the proposed method yields high-quality solutions within a reasonable computational time for various real size problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
