The new method improves the ITAM by iterating directly on the non-stationary autocorrelation function. The existing ITAM requires estimation of the evolutionary spectrum from the autocorrelation function for which no unique relation exists. Consequently, computationally expensive estimates or simplifying assumptions/approximations reduced the ITAM performance for non-stationary processes. The proposed method improves the accuracy of the resulting process while maintaining computational efficiency. Several examples are provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
