The main result is that there is a sequence of sets of clauses Pi(1), Pi(2), ... ,Pi(i), ... for which the minimum regular resolution refutation of Pi(i) has size 2(Omega(Ri/(log Ri)7 log log Ri)), where R(i) is the minimum size of an unrestricted resolution refutation of Pi(i). This improves earlier lower bounds for which the separations proved were of the form 2(Omega(3 root R)) and 2(Omega(4 root R/(log R)3)).", "paper_title": "A NEAR-OPTIMAL SEPARATION OF REGULAR AND GENERAL RESOLUTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000287697400006"}
