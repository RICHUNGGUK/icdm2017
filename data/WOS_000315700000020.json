The concept of S*-coiivergence and quasi-liminf convergence generalize the S-convergence and and the liminf convergence on domain, respectively. The main result is that for a dcpo L the S*-convergence is topological if and only if L is quasi-continuous and the topology generated by it coincides with the Scott topology. And under an assumption, the quasi-liminf convergence is topological if and only if L is quasi-continuous and the topology generated by it coincides with the Lawson topology.", "paper_title": "Convergence On Quasi-continuous Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000315700000020"}
