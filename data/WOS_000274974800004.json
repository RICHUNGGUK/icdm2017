The infrastructure is implemented using a communications router, based on an event-driven routing scheme, on each multicore processing node in the system. The design considerations emphasize the difference between the requirements of neural network communications and those of conventional computer networks and on-chip networks. The focus of the design is on neural modelling flexibility, power-efficiency, fault-tolerance and the communication throughput of the router.", "paper_title": "A Multicast Routing Scheme for a Universal Spiking Neural Network Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000274974800004"}
