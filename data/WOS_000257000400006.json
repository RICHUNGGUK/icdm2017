Thus, the direction relations between overlapping and contained regions cannot be effectively described and derived. To resolve this problem, a new model of direction relations, namely interior-boundary direction relations, is proposed in this study to describe direction concepts relative to the interior or boundary of a region, such as \"east part of a region\", \"west border of a region\", \"a line goes through east part of a region\", and etc. By combining the interior and exterior direction relations, three types of compositions of direction relations are investigated: (1) composing two interior direction relations which can be used to derive the interior or exterior direction relations between two regions with the same parent region; (2) composing an interior direction relation with an exterior direction relation; and (3) composing an interior with an exterior direction relation. The results indicate that the new interior-boundary direction relations and its compositions with exterior direction relations are powerful in describing and deriving direction relations between overlapped and contained regions.
