The electric force in such systems acts only at the interface and is zero elsewhere in the two fluids. Continuum surface force representations are derived for the electric field force in a system of dielectric-dielectric and conducting-conducting fluids. On the basis of analytical calculations for simple flow problems we propose a weighted harmonic mean interpolation scheme to smoothen the electric properties in the diffused transition region (interface). It is shown that a wrong choice of interpolation scheme (weighted arithmetic mean) may lead to a transition region thickness dependent electric field in the bulk. We simulate a set of problems with exact or approximate analytical solutions to validate the numerical model proposed. A coupled level set and volume-of-fluid (CLSVOF) algorithm has been used for simulations presented here. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
