We propose a personalised search approach for web service recommendation. First, interests are extracted from users' records. Second, interest-similar users are selected using the criterion of cosine distance. Third, services are ranked in decreasing order based on the recommendation from interest-similar users. At the end of this paper, we conduct three groups' experiments to verify the effect of this approach.", "paper_title": "A personalised search approach for web service recommendation", "paper_id": "WOS:000319507500002"}
