For this purpose one can use undeniable signatures, designated confirmer signatures or designated verifier signatures. We introduce a model of new kind of signatures, called dedicated digital signatures (or dds for short). The core idea is that a designated verifier can present a standard signature of the signer derived from dds to a third party, but at the price of revealing the privatekey of the designated verifier or at the price of revealing the designated verifier's signature of a particular message. Therefore the verifier will show the signature only in very special situations. We present a construction of a dds based on ElGamal signatures and its modifications that allow to obtain additional important features.", "paper_title": "How to protect a signature from being shown to a third party", "paper_id": "WOS:000241622700020"}
