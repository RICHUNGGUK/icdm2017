The cost function is designed so that both the far-field radiated noise and the aerodynamic forces are controlled. The surrogate model is based on the Kriging optimal interpolation technique. In order to increase the efficiency of the method, a dynamic Kriging method is developed, which can be interpreted as an Adaptive Mesh Refinement method in the shape optimization parameters.
