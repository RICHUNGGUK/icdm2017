A tree-network model was proposed to depict the characteristics of SMS seed users who have such three features as \"ahead of time\", \"mass texting\" and \"numerous retransmissions\". For acquiring the established network model's width and depth, a clustering algorithm based on density was adopted and a recursion algorithm was designed to solve such problems. An objective, comprehensive and scale-free evaluation function was further presented to rank the potential seed users by using the width and the depth obtained above. Furthermore, the model's empirical analysis was made based on part of the Shenzhen's cell phone SMS data in February of 2012. The model is effective and applicable as a powerful tool to solve the SMS seed users' mining problem. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.
