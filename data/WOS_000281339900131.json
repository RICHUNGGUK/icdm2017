A new approach, AT method, has been suggested to combine the results of two techniques to find the final ranking. Besides, we propose a developing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model as a basis for comparing the reliability of results of the MCDM techniques, which depicts AT is more reliable than AHP and TOPSIS. Our results have certified that safety and then price are the customers' most important criteria for automobile selection. After comparing the internal and external products, and ranking them based on the criteria and sub-criteria, the necessity to improve internal automobiles on various fields has been prioritized.
