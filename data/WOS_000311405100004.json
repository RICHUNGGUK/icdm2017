Staircase tableaux were introduced by Corteel and Williams in the connection with Asymmetric Exclusion Process and has since found interesting connections with AskeyWilson polynomials. We develop a probabilistic approach that allows us to analyze several parameters of a randomly chosen staircase tableau of a given size. In particular, we obtain limiting distributions for statistics associated with appearances of Greek letters in staircase tableaux. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
