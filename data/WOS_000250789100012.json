An NN is used to approximate the time-varying cost function using the method of least squares on a predefined region. The result is an NN nearly-constrained feedback controller that has time-varying coefficients found by a priori offline tuning. Convergence results are shown. The results of this paper are demonstrated in two examples, including a nonholonomic system.", "paper_title": "Fixed-final-time-constrained optimal control, of Nonlinear systems using neural network HJB approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000250789100012"}
