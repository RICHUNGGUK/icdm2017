To counter the deficiency of practice training in some graduates' courses a new curriculum \"'Hardware/Software integrated design of embedded systems\" is given, at Tsinghna University. The course's main contents, teaching activities' arrangements, basic/research experiments, and a few kinds of embedded, teaching experimental platforms are introduced. The merits and differences between the course and existing courses are indicated, and the necessity to build a powerful experimental environment for graduates to get practice skill is stressed.", "paper_title": "Hardware/software integrated training on embedded systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242255300015"}
