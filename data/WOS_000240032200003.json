In this study, a mathematical model, which was originally established by Bailon-Plaza and van der Meulen (J Theor Biol 212: 191-209, 2001), was applied to an experimental model of a semi-stabilized murine tibial fracture. The mathematical model was implemented in a custom finite volumes code, specialized in dealing with the model's requirements of mass conservation and non-negativity of the variables. A qualitative agreement between the experimentally measured and numerically simulated evolution in the cartilage and bone content was observed. Additionally, an extensive parametric study was conducted to assess the influence of the model parameters on the simulation outcome. Finally, a case of pathological fracture healing and its treatment by administration of growth factors was modeled to demonstrate the potential therapeutic value of this mathematical model.", "paper_title": "Mathematical modeling of fracture healing in mice: comparison between experimental data and numerical simulation results", "paper_id": "WOS:000240032200003"}
