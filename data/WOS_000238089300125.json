A special case of Navier-Stokes equations is explored and particles are employed to model fountain geometry. Music intensity is used to synchronize the motion of fountain particles, and simple dynamics equations of particles are used to simulate realistic fountain behavior. The proposed algorithm can be easily integrated into interactive applications for real-time fountain simulation.", "paper_title": "Physically-based real-time music fountain simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300125"}
