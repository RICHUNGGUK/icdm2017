This paper proposes a comprehensive deep learning framework to jointly learn face representation using multimodal information. The proposed deep learning structure is composed of a set of elaborately designed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a three-layer stacked auto-encoder (SAE). The set of CNNs extracts complementary facial features from multimodal data. Then, the extracted features are concatenated to form a high-dimensional feature vector, whose dimension is compressed by SAE. All of the CNNs are trained using a subset of 9,000 subjects from the publicly available CASIA-WebFace database, which ensures the reproducibility of this work. Using the proposed single CNN architecture and limited training data, 98.43% verification rate is achieved on the LFW database. Benefitting from the complementary information contained in multimodal data, our small ensemble system achieves higher than 99.0% recognition rate on LFW using publicly available training set.", "paper_title": "Robust Face Recognition via Multimodal Deep Face Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000364102400017"}
