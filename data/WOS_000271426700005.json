The system is able to constantly supervise the activities of the servers and, at the same time, realise backup distribution to safeguard the data in e-learning contexts. It also interacts with a Private Automatic Branch eXchange (PABX) for the management of the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone system. This system has been conceived as support for the management of web sections and, in particular, web-learning (w-learning) platforms. The purpose is to be able to watch the platform's activity all the time to immediately 'warn' when there are problems deriving from the platform contents and warn the technical area in case of failures in the server system that contains the w-learning platform. In addition, the backup system guarantees having a frequently updated file of the data present on the various servers on which the e-learning platform leans so that safety can be guaranteed in case of the permanent loss of the data present on the servers.", "paper_title": "An integrated system for data backup and supervision of activities (with management of the natural language) in e-learning contexts", "paper_id": "WOS:000271426700005"}
