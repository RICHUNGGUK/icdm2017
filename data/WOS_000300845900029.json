This paper examines the use of these matrices, which we call locally invertible encoders, for generating multidimensional convolutional codes. We discuss a novel method of encoding and inverting multidimensional sequences using the subsequence map. We also show that the overlapping symbols between consecutive input subsequences obtained during the sequence inversion can be used to determine if the received sequence is the same as the transmitted codeword.", "paper_title": "Locally Invertible Multidimensional Convolutional Encoders", "paper_id": "WOS:000300845900029"}
