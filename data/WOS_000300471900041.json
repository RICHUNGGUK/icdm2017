An ideal observation model should have both high ability to accurately distinguish objects from the background and high reliability to identify the detected objects. Traditional features are better at solving the former problem but weak in solving the latter one. To overcome that, we adopt a robust and dynamic feature called Grayscale Arranging Pairs (GAP), which has high discriminative ability even under conditions of severe illumination variation and dynamic background elements. Together with the GAP feature, we also adopt the color histogram feature in order to take advantage of traditional features in resolving the first problem. At the same time, an efficient and simple integration method is used to combine the GAP feature with color information. Comparative experiments demonstrate that object tracking with our integrated features performs well even when objects go across complex backgrounds.", "paper_title": "Robust Tracking Using Particle Filter with a Hybrid Feature", "paper_id": "WOS:000300471900041"}
