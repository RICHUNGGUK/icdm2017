We study the ordered variants of MAST where the trees are uniformly or non-uniformly ordered. We provide the first known polynomial-time algorithms for the uniformly and non-uniformly ordered homeomorphic variants as well as the uniformly and non-uniformly ordered isomorphic variants of MAST. Our algorithms run in time O(kn(3)), O (n(3) min{kn, n + log(k-1) n}), O(kn(3)), and O(n(3) min{kn, n + log(k-1) n)), respectively, where n is the number of leaf labels and k is the number of input trees.", "paper_title": "Polynomial-time algorithms for the ordered maximum agreement subtree problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000247872000002"}
