It aims to maximize the quality of coverage of a wireless sensor network while deploying a minimum number of sensors on a 3-D surface. For this purpose, a probabilistic sensing model and Bresenham's line of sight algorithm are utilized. The WT is realized by an adaptive thresholding approach for the generation of the initial population. Another novel aspect of the paper is that the method followed utilizes a Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) algorithm, which mimics the behavior of cats. We have modified the CSO algorithm so that it can be used for sensor deployment problems on 3-D terrains. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the Delaunay Triangulation and Genetic Algorithm based methods. The results reveal that CSO based sensor deployment which utilizes the wavelet transform method is a powerful and successful method for sensor deployment on 3-D terrains.", "paper_title": "On Deployment of Wireless Sensors on 3-D Terrains to Maximize Sensing Coverage by Utilizing Cat Swarm Optimization with Wavelet Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000329055600009"}
