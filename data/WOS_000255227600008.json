The computational complexity of this problem is not known only upper and lower bounds have been determined. This paper provides a characterisation of the two-stripe case. Instances where the minimum cost of a tour is equal to either the upper or lower bound are recognised. A new construction providing a tour is proposed for the remaining instances, and this leads to a new upper bound that is closer than the previous one.", "paper_title": "The Travelling Salesman Problem in symmetric circulant matrices with two stripes", "paper_id": "WOS:000255227600008"}
