The statistical sequential labeling method has been successfully applied to SLU tasks; however, most sequential labeling approaches lack long-distance dependency information handling method. In this paper, we exploit non-local features as an estimate of long-distance dependencies to improve performance of the statistical SLU problem. A method we propose is to use trigger pairs automatically extracted by a feature induction algorithm. We describe a light practical version of the feature inducer for which a simple modification is efficient and successful. We evaluate our method on three SLU tasks and show an improvement of performance over the baseline local model. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
