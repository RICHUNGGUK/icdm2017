The production planning model for multiple companies under uncertain demand situation is developed to represent actual planning environments where demand variances in the future periods are gradually available with respect to the progress of time steps. We examine the bullwhip effect caused by the inventory control method in consideration of safety stock. The relationship between the total profit and bullwhip effects is investigated from numerical simulations.", "paper_title": "Effects of inventory control on bullwhip in supply chain planning for multiple companies", "paper_id": "WOS:000254028000004"}
