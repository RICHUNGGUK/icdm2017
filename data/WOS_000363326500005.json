In the past few years, the research in this area has focused mostly on the automation of black-box approaches to improve applicability and scalability. This chapter surveys the recent advances in automatic black-box testing, covering contributions from 2010 to 2014, presenting the main research results and discussing the research trends.", "paper_title": "Recent Advances in Automatic Black-Box Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000363326500005"}
