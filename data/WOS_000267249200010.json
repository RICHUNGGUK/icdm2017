Uncertainty modeling with high-dimensional random variables and random fields motivates the adoption of advanced Monte Carlo methods for reliability analysis. On the implementation side, object-orientation and parallelization have been embraced to ensure flexibility and performance. A novel, Matlab-based toolkit, COSSAN-X, embodying these characteristics, is presented. The application to a satellite under harmonic excitation and a turbine blade under centrifugal loading indicates the importance of considering spatial fluctuations and the scalability with respect to realistic FE models.
