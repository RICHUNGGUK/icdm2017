Determination of DRs for product development is very important because these requirements are the vital keys to successful products. The methods used to evaluate DRs in the literature can be categorized into multicriteria evaluation methods such as scoring methods, the analytic hierarchy method, analytic network process, and so forth. There are few papers using fuzzy multi-attribute outranking methods to evaluate DRs. This article aims to compare the results of three different fuzzy outranking methods to evaluate the DRs in the PVC windows industry. A sensitivity analysis is also made by using the software, FOuR.
