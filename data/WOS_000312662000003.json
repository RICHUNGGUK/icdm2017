Transform domain equalizer has much faster convergence than its time domain counterpart for practical hardware realization having nonzero adaptation delay. Here running DFT is employed as the transform, and CORDIC is used for realization of running DFT. Pipelining is applied throughout the architecture, thus limiting the critical path delay to the propagation delay of a single 16 bit adder for 16 bit arithmetic. For N tap equalizer, primary clock speed is N times of the sample clock speed, so that on arrival of each sample, the computation of whole transform and weight update is possible. In the proposed architecture, hardware complexity is reduced by fully utilizing the pipeline without using parallel structures. The adaptation delay is only 2 sample clock periods resulting in fast convergence. The proposed architecture is suitable for VLSI implementation with primary clock speed limited by the binary adder propagation delay which could be as low as 2 ns in the present state-of-the-art technology.", "paper_title": "Pipelined VLSI Architecture using CORDIC for Transform Domain Equalizer", "paper_id": "WOS:000312662000003"}
