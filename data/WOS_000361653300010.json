Generally, a sub-region, rather than the whole network region, may be interested by a certain application in a certain time duration. To address this challenge, a sub-region query processing mechanism is proposed. Specifically, a routing tree is constructed where a sensor node corresponds to a tree node. A sensor node acknowledges the fact that whether it lies within the sub-region of interest or not through the localisation techniques. Sensory data are routed to the sink node leveraging the parent-child relation of sensor nodes specified in the routing tree. Experimental evaluation shows that our technique is more energy efficient when the network topology is relatively steady.", "paper_title": "A three-dimensional sub-region query processing mechanism in underwater WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000361653300010"}
