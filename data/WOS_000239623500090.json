To realize the environments, it is important to reduce the cost to develop various pervasive computing applications by encapsulating complex issues in middleware infrastructures. We propose a multi-agent-based middleware infrastructure suitable for the smart space: MASBM (Multi-Agent Service Bundle Middleware) which is capable of making it easy to develop pervasive computing applications. We conclude with the initial implementation results and lessons learned from MASAM.", "paper_title": "Research on multi-agent service bundle middleware for smart space", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500090"}
