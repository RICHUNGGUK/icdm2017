This paper studies parameterized computational complexity of five control problems in the Maximin election. We obtain the following results: constructive control by adding candidates is W[2]-hard with respect to the parameter \"number of added candidates\"; both constructive and destructive control by adding/deleting voters are W[1]-hard with respect to the parameter \"number of added/deleted voters\".
