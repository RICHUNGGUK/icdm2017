The proposed controller not only guaranties the stability and robustness against the lumped uncertainties caused by unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances, but also significantly reduces the control chattering inherent in conventional sliding mode control. The chaos synchronization is obtained by optimal proper choice of the control parameters including the sliding surface and the reaching law parameters. To achieve this, a bio-mimetic algorithm namely bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA) is employed. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the validity and confirm the performance of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control for synchronization of uncertain non-identical chaotic systems using bacterial foraging optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000334211500043"}
