LineKing consists of a smartphone component that provides automatic and accurate wait-time detection, and a cloud backend that uses the collected data to provide accurate wait-time estimation. LineKing is used on a daily basis by hundreds of users to monitor the wait-times of a coffee shop in the University at Buffalo, SUNY. The novel wait-time estimation algorithms of LineKing deployed at the cloud backend provide median absolute errors of less than 3 minutes.", "paper_title": "LineKing: Coffee Shop Wait-Time Monitoring Using Smartphones", "paper_id": "WOS:000360744700006"}
