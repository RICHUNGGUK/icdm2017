This technique is general enough to be applied to any type of logic function and programmable circuit; thus, it has many applications to FPGAs. The application demonstrated is the FPGA programmable logic block evaluation and the results show that this tool allows radical new features of FPGA logic blocks to be evaluated in a rigorous scientific way.", "paper_title": "FPGA programmable logic block evaluation using quantified Boolean satisfiability", "paper_id": "WOS:000237934800005"}
