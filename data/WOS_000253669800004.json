We discuss the problem of fitting a B-spline curve to a point cloud by squared distance minimization in the case that both the point cloud and the fitting curve are constrained to lie on a smooth manifold. The on-manifold constraint is included by using the first fundamental form of the surface for squared distance computations between the point cloud and the fitting curve. For the solution we employ a constrained optimization algorithm that allows us to include further constraints such as one-sided fitting or surface regions that have to be avoided by the fitting curve. We illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by means of several examples showing different applications. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
