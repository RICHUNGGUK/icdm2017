The examples of problem statements of long-term investment in security are given. A survey of solution methods for stochastic optimal control problems is proposed. It is shown that these problems can be reduced to finite-dimensional stochastic programming problems and can be solved by the stochastic quasigradient method.", "paper_title": "MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF DISTRIBUTED CATASTROPHIC AND TERRORIST RISKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000366801700011"}
