Appropriate classification of one-, two- and three-parameter density matrices is obtained, based on the sameness of the characteristic polynomial of density matrices belonging to a given type. It is found that in the one parameter case of 15 different density matrices only three distinct types exist, while in the two parameter case 105 different density matrices group into 11 distinct types. In the three parameter case appropriate classification of 455 different density matrices into 44 types is determined. Two- and three-dimensional cross sections of the space of generalized Bloch vectors are illustrated by randomly drawing matrices for several types of density matrices, providing some insight into the intricate and complex structure of the space of density matrices for a four-state system. Positions of the representative points corresponding to the pure states are found for all types. Global properties of observables are determined by generating, by the Monte Carlo sampling method, and averaging over nearly all density matrices pertaining to a given type.", "paper_title": "CLASSIFICATION OF DENSITY MATRICES FOR A FOUR-STATE SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000263630600006"}
