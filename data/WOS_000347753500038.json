That is, they depend on different jumping modes. In addition, the derivatives of the mode-dependent time-varying delays are no longer required to be smaller than one. By constructing new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and combining with a convex polyhedron method, several delay-dependent stability conditions are formulated based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The usefulness of the proposed approach are finally demonstrated by two numerical examples. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
