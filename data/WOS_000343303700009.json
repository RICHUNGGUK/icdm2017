The filtering error system obtained from augmenting a continuous-time LPV system and the sampled-data filter is a hybrid system. The sampled-data filter design objective is to ensure the error system stability and a prescribed level of the induced energy-to-energy gain (or [GRAPHICS] norm) from the disturbance input to the estimation error. To this purpose, we employ a lifting method to derive an equivalent discrete-time LPV representation for the continuous-time LPV system. In the present study, the sampled-data filter synthesis conditions are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequality optimisation problems. The viability of the proposed design method to cope with variable sampling rates is illustrated through numerical examples, where reliable estimation of the LPV system outputs is achieved.", "paper_title": "Sampled-data H-infinity filtering for linear parameter varying systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000343303700009"}
