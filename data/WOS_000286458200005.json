This paper develops a procedure for performing a sensitivity analysis of the inefficient decision making units (DMUs). The procedure yields an exact \"Necessary Change Region'' in which the efficiency score of a specific inefficient DMU changes to a defined efficiency score. In what follows, we identify a new frontier, and prove the efficiency score of each arbitrary unit on it which is defined as the efficiency score.
