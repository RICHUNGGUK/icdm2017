In this paper we introduce a novel structural approach to automatically generate large scale PoP level maps using traceroute measurement from multiple locations. The PoPs are first identified based on their structure, and are then assigned a location using information from several geo-location databases. We discuss the tradeoffs in this approach and provide extensive validation details. The generated maps can be widely used for research, and we provide some possible directions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
