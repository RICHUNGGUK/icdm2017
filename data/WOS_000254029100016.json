Design/methodology/approach - Mulej's dialectical systems theory is applied.. Findings - Currently, the many existing systems theories are applied in separation rather than in synergy. Here, a fourth attempt to make a new systems theory in Slovenia is presented: after the dialectical system theory, the dialectical network thinking, and the business cybernetics this is the control systems theory. Research limitation/implications - Research was limited to management of public health care and attainment of the requisite holism in it. Practical implications - Managerial efficiency and processes in organizations with a rather small influence of the market pressure can be innovated more easily. Originality/value - This is the first attempt, to the best of one's knowledge, to make a new synergy of the dialectical systems, living systems, and viable systems theories as potentially complementary systems theories and three methodologies supporting informal requisite holism of thinking, decision making and action.", "paper_title": "On the concept of the \"control systems theory\" as a new model of systemic consideration", "paper_id": "WOS:000254029100016"}
