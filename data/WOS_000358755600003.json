Uncertain set is a fundamental concept to describe unsharp concepts in uncertain set theory. The moments are important characteristics of an uncertain set. This paper studies the moments and central moments of uncertain set and gives some formulas to calculate the moments and central moments by membership function. In addition, some examples are provided to calculate the moments and central moments of uncertain set.", "paper_title": "Some results of moments of uncertain set", "paper_id": "WOS:000358755600003"}
