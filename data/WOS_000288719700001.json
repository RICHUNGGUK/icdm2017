This study proposes Enhancive Request Management (ERM), a method of managing enhancive requests from multiple stakeholders. The proposed method, based on hermeneutics, includes request formation, feedback, and conflict resolution processes. The request formation process is designed to handle the maintenance requests. The feedback process controls the changes of request formation results. And the conflict resolution process deals with diverse opinions. Besides, this work introduces a blog-based tool to support ERM. Two companies have tried this tool and provided some usage opinions. The empirical data reveals that the ERM methodology can improve request management works.", "paper_title": "A SYSTEM MAINTENANCE PROCESS FOR FACILIATING REQUESTS MANAGEMENT AND CONFLICTS RESOLUTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000288719700001"}
