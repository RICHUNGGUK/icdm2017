The proposed transform can enable AVS1-P7 to share the same quantization/dequantization table with AVS1-P2. As the bases of the proposed transform coefficients are very close, the transform normalization can be implemented only on the encoder side and the dequantization table size can be reduced compared with the transform used in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. Along with the feature of the proposed transform, adaptive dead-zone quantization optimization for the proposed transform is studied. Experimental results show that the proposed integer transform has similar coding performance compared with the transform used in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, and would gain near 0.1dB with the adaptive dead-zone quantization optimization.", "paper_title": "Low complexity integer transform and adaptive quantization optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000238079200008"}
