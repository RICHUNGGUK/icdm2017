In this paper, we propose an ontology-based trust negotiation framework for establishing trust between entities in these environments without possession sensitive information leakage. The prevention of possession sensitive information leakage is ensured by the incorporation of improved policy databases. The policy database is improved by enforcing a concept of the strictness relationship between access control policies. Regularly, the notion of the strictness is on the basis of the syntax of credentials. However, this makes it impossible to automatically determine whether attributes belonging to different credentials are semantically related or not. Therefore, we propose a novel intelligent notion of strictness relationship based on the semantics of the access control policies after the formalization of resource ontology presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "An Ontology-Based Trust Negotiation Framework in Advanced Communications and Computing Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000271592800009"}
