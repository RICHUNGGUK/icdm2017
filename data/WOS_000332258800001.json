However, the detection mechanisms of such systems impact the effectiveness of the entire network. In this paper, we propose a lightweight ontology-based wireless intrusion detection system (OWIDS). The system applies an ontology to a patrol intrusion detection system (PIDS). A PIDS is used to detect anomalies via detection knowledge. The system constructs the relationship of the sensor nodes in an ontology to enhance PIDS robustness. The sensor nodes preload comparison methods without detection knowledge. The system transfers a portion of the detection knowledge to detect anomalies. The memory requirement of a PIDS is lower than that of other methods which preload entire IDS. Finally, the isolation tables prevent repeated detection of an anomaly. The system adjusts detection knowledge until it converges. The experimental results show that OWIDS can reduce IDS ( intrusion detection system) energy consumption.", "paper_title": "Applying an Ontology to a Patrol Intrusion Detection System for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000332258800001"}
