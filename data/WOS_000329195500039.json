The method is based on the spectrum of the blurred images and is supported on a weak assumption, which is valid for the most natural images: the power-spectrum is approximately isotropic and has a power-law decay with the spatial frequency. We introduce two modifications to the radon transform, which allow the identification of the blur spectrum pattern of the two types of blurs above mentioned. The blur parameters are identified by fitting an appropriate function that accounts separately for the natural image spectrum and the blur frequency response. The accuracy of the proposed method is validated by simulations, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed by testing the algorithm on real natural blurred images and comparing it with state-of-the-art blind deconvolution methods.", "paper_title": "Parametric Blur Estimation for Blind Restoration of Natural Images: Linear Motion and Out-of-Focus", "paper_id": "WOS:000329195500039"}
