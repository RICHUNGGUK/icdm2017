To alpha-coagnostic learn C from H, the leamer seeks a hypothesis h is an element of H whose probability of agreement (rather than disagreement as in agnostic learning) with a labeled example is within a factor a of the best agreement probability achieved by any f is an element of C. Although 1-coagnostic learning is equivalent to agnostic learning, this is not true for alpha-coagnostic learning for (1)/(2) < alpha < 1. It can be seen that alpha-coagnostic learnability is equivalent to the alpha-approximability of the maximum agreement problems. For these problems we are given a labeled sample S and must find an h is an element of H that agrees with as many examples in S as the best f is an element of C does. Many studies have been done on maximum agreement problems, for classes such as monomials, monotone monomials, antimonotone monomials, halfspaces and balls. We further the study of these problems and some extensions of them. For the above classes we improve the best previously known factors alpha for the hardness of alpha-coagnostic learning. We also find the first constant lower bounds for decision lists, exclusive-or, halfspaces (over the Boolean domain), 2-term DNF and 2-term multivariate polynomials. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
