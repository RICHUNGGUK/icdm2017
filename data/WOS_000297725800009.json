In our adult image-recognition algorithm, we model skin patches rather than skin pixels, resulting in better results than state-of-the-art algorithms which model skin pixels. In our adult video-recognition algorithm, information from the accompanying audio section around an image in an adult video is used to obtain a prior classification of the image. The algorithm achieves a better performance than the ones which use image information alone or audio information alone. The adult Web page bag recognition is carried out using multi-instance learning based on the combination of classifying texts, images and videos in Web pages. Both the speed and the accuracy for recognizing the Web adult content are increased, in contrast to recognizing Web pages one-by-one.", "paper_title": "Recognition of Adult Images, Videos, and Web Page Bags", "paper_id": "WOS:000297725800009"}
