By investigating the topography influence on subsidence under simplified mining conditions, this study attempts to improve the original influence function method to take topographic variations into account. New asymmetrical influence functions are used to simulate element subsidence. Integrating this asymmetrical approach into the influence function method increases the realism of subsidence computation when compared to the numerical simulation results. The maximum subsidence value and influence angle got from field data are introduced into the improved method, then two field subsidence cases are studied and acceptable comparison results are achieved. This improved method should serve as the foundation for future work. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
