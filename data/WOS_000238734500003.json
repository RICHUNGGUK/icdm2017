ATTIC assesses information collected during the preliminary stage of an investigation and assists with the risk assessment process, with the prediction of potential contaminants, hazards and risk to neighbouring areas. In addition to the development of the prototype system, a database was also developed to store preliminary investigation information. The data structures were implemented using Microsoft Access relational database management system software. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
