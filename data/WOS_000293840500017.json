The six-phase induction motor is supplied by Space Vector PWM (SVPWM) and voltage source inverter. Adaptive flux search controller is fast than ordinary search control technique and easy to implement. Adaptive flux Search Control (SC) technique decreases the convergence time by proper change of flux variation steps and increases accuracy of the SC technique. A proper loss model of 6PIM in conjunction with the proposed method is used. The six-phase induction machine has large zero sequence harmonic currents that can be reduced by SVPWM technique. Simulation and experimental results are carried out and they verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Energy Optimization of Field Oriented Six-Phase Induction Motor Drive", "paper_id": "WOS:000293840500017"}
