Based on general basis expansion model, two expectation maximization-type channel estimation methods are proposed for subband OFDMA in order to overcome channel time-frequency selectivity. The proposed method is compared with conventional approach and is shown to be superior to the conventional one.", "paper_title": "Doubly selective channel estimation for subband OFDMA using basis expansion models", "paper_id": "WOS:000297023300011"}
