A wide spectrum of context-aware schemes have been proposed over the last decade. However, most of them provide partial functionalities of context-awareness in ubiquitous media applications. They are specified to a certain task and lack of systematic research on context-awareness. To this end, this survey aims at answering how close we are to developing context-aware applications in ubiquitous media in a systematic manner. This survey proposes a reference framework to identify key functionalities of context-awareness. Then, it investigates the state-of-the-art advances in every functionality of context-awareness. Finally, it points out potential directions in context-awareness research and tools for building and measuring context-aware ubiquitous media systems.", "paper_title": "Survey on context-awareness in ubiquitous media", "paper_id": "WOS:000322787800010"}
