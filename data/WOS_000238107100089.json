In order to create a lightweight scheduling system, we investigated the potential of auctions for resource allocation. Each resource provider runs an agent bidding on the execution of software with respect to local restrictions. This way, the information system becomes obsolete. In addition, each provider can implement different bidding strategies in order to reflect his preferences.", "paper_title": "Agent-based grid scheduling with Calana", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100089"}
