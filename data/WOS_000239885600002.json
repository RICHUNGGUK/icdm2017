Kamae, Y.M. Xue, Two dimensional word with 2k maximal pattern complexity, Osaka J. Math. 41(2) (2004) 257-265]. We study the maximal pattern complexity p(alpha)*(k) of two-dimensional words alpha. A two-dimensional version of the notion of strong recurrence is introduced. It is shown that if a is strongly recurrent, then either alpha is doubly periodic or p(alpha)* (k) >= 2k (k = 1, 2....). Accordingly, we define a two-dimensional pattern Sturmian word as a strongly recurrent word alpha with p(alpha)*(k) = 2k. Examples of pattern Sturmian words are given. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
