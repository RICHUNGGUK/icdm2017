The suggested solution method combines the strengths of well-known threshold accepting and guided local search metaheuristics to guide a set of four local search heuristics. The computational tests were done using the benchmarks of [Liu, F.-H., & Shen, S.-Y. (1999). The fleet size and mix vehicle routing problem with time windows. Journal of the Operational Research Society, 50(7), 721-732] and 600 new benchmark problems suggested in this paper. The results indicate that the suggested method is competitive and scales almost linearly up to instances with 1000 customers. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
