Recently presented results suggesting spurious causality in such circumstances are shown to be highly dependent upon the absence of deterministic terms from the causality testing equations. The analysis is completed by the examination of an alternative non-parametric causality test. (C) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
