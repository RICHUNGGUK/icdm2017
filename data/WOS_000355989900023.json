This is based on the property that the proposed (n symbols, k symbols) t-symbol error correcting code uses the same H matrix as an (n bits, k bits) binary t-bit error correcting OLS code. The new codes are shown to have a shorter check bit length and better probability in encoding/decoding than conventional binary OLS codes. Extensive results are provided for assessment and comparison. The proposed codes are also shown to be always better than the matrix codes, i.e. independently of the metric and the parameters employed in the comparison.", "paper_title": "Non-Binary Orthogonal Latin Square Codes for a Multilevel Phase Charge Memory (PCM)", "paper_id": "WOS:000355989900023"}
