The well-known problem of handling time-derivatives of membership functions (MFs) as to obtain conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is overcome by reducing global goals to the estimation of a region of attraction. Instead of parallel distributed compensation (PDC), a non-PDC control law is proposed according to the non-quadratic nature of the Lyapunov function. Examples are provided to show the advantages over the quadratic and some non-quadratic approaches. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
