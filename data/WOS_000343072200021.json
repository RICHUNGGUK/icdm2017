SDN, often referred to as a \"radical new idea in networking\", promises to dramatically simplify network management and enable innovation through network programmability. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art in programmable networks with an emphasis on SDN. We provide a historic perspective of programmable networks from early ideas to recent developments. Then we present the SDN architecture and the OpenFlow standard in particular, discuss current alternatives for implementation and testing of SDN-based protocols and services, examine current and future SDN applications, and explore promising research directions based on the SDN paradigm.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Software-Defined Networking: Past, Present, and Future of Programmable Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000343072200021"}
