With the usual Robust Optimization paradigm, one looks for the decisions ensuring a required performance for all realizations of the data from a given bounded uncertainty set, whereas with the proposed approach, we require also a controlled deterioration in performance when the data is outside the uncertainty set. The extension of Robust Optimization methodology developed in this paper opens up new possibilities to solve efficiently multi-stage finite-horizon uncertain optimization problems, in particular, to analyze and to synthesize linear controllers for discrete time dynamical systems.", "paper_title": "Extending scope of robust optimization: Comprehensive robust counterparts of uncertain problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235808200004"}
