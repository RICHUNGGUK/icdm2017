It is well known that the key challenge in KFD lies in the selection of free parameters such as kernel parameters and regularization parameters. Here we focus on the feature-scaling kernel where each feature individually associates with a scaling factor. A novel algorithm, named FS-KFD, is developed to tune the scaling factors and regularization parameters for the feature-scaling kernel. The proposed algorithm is based on optimizing the smooth leave-one-out error via a gradient-descent method and has been demonstrated to be computationally feasible. FS-KFD is motivated by the following two fundamental facts: the leave-one-out error of KFD can be expressed in closed form and the step function can be approximated by a sigmoid function. Empirical comparisons on artificial and benchmark data sets suggest that FS-KFD improves KFD in terms of classification accuracy.", "paper_title": "Feature scaling for kernel fisher discriminant analysis using leave-one-out cross validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000235684600009"}
