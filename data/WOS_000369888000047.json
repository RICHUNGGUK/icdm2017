The functionality encompasses: (a) basic infrastructure for representing trees (inferred by any algorithm) so that unified print/plot/predict methods are available; (b) dedicated methods for trees with constant fits in the leaves (or terminal nodes) along with suitable coercion functions to create such trees (e.g., by rpart, RWeka, PMML); (c) a reimplementation of conditional inference trees (ctree, originally provided in the party package); (d) an extended reimplementation of model-based recursive partitioning (mob, also originally in party) along with dedicated methods for trees with parametric models in the leaves. Here, a brief overview of the package and its design is given while more detailed discussions of items (a) (d) are available in vignettes accompanying the package.", "paper_title": "partykit: A Modular Toolkit for Recursive Partytioning in R", "paper_id": "WOS:000369888000047"}
