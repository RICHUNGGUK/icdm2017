It utilizes the MapReduce computing model created by Google to conduct the classification calculation. Specially, the Sogou news data with various data amounts which simulated the massive data set was used for testing effectiveness and a comparative evaluation on execution time and speedup was accomplished on the experimental circumstance. The results obtained shows that the classification course obviously reduces the execution times greatly and gains the ideal speedup ratio when increasing data amounts, achieves the better performance.", "paper_title": "An Improved Classification Course Based on Mapreduce", "paper_id": "WOS:000366968300006"}
