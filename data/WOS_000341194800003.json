This statement was proved, independently, by Fountoulakis and Reed. Our proof follows from a structure result for these graphs which is interesting in its own right. We show that these graphs are \"decorated expanders\" - an expander glued to graphs whose size has constant expectation and exponential tail, and such that each vertex in the expander is glued to no more than a constant number of decorations.
