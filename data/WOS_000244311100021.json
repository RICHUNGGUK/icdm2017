In this paper, by proposing an adaptive Rao-Blackwellized particle filter for tracking in surveillance, we show how to exploit the analytical relationship among state variables to improve the efficiency and accuracy of a regular particle filter. Essentially, the distributions of the linear variables are updated analytically using a Kalman filter which is associated with each particle in a particle filtering framework. Experiments and detailed performance analysis using both simulated data and real video sequences reveal that the proposed method results in more accurate tracking than a regular particle filter.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Rao-Blackwellized particle filter and its evaluation for tracking in surveillance", "paper_id": "WOS:000244311100021"}
