In this paper, we present the state-of-the-art research from the ubiquity perspective, and discuss the insights as well as vision of future directions in WSN-based healthcare systems. First, we propose a novel tiered architecture that can be generally applied to WSN-based healthcare systems. Then, we analyze the IEEE 802 series standards in the access layer on their capabilities in setting up WSNs for healthcare. We also explore some of the up-to-date work in the application layer, mostly on the smartphone platforms. Furthermore, in order to develop and integrate effective ubiquitous sensing for healthcare (USH), we highlight four important design goals (i.e., proactiveness, transparency, awareness, and trustworthiness) that should be taken into account in future systems.", "paper_title": "Ubiquitous WSN for Healthcare: Recent Advances and Future Prospects", "paper_id": "WOS:000209672500003"}
