For trace monoids the natural extension obtained by adapting the successor to the partial order underlying the traces is insufficient to capture the family of their rational subsets. We show that these subsets can be expressed by formulas of the form there exists Gamma phi where phi is a first-order formula over the structure of traces and Gamma is an n-ary predicate semantically restricted, where n is the cardinality of the alphabet.", "paper_title": "A Note on the Logical Definability of Rational Trace Languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000304190900006"}
