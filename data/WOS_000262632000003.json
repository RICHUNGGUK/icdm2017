The article proposes system optimisation scheduling (SOS) that provides a potential solution of joint optimisation of objectives for both the resource and application layer, which combine both application-oriented and resource-oriented scheduling benefits. Grid systems will strive to find an optimal relation between user satisfaction and resource utilisation. Utility functions are used to express grid user's Quality of Service requirement, resource provider's benefit function and system's objectives. In order to verify the efficiency of the proposed scheduling algorithm, we compare the performance of application optimisation scheduling, resource optimisation scheduling, SOS with a traditional Round-Robin algorithm. The simulations study the effect of the request rate and task-to-resource ratio on the different scheduling algorithm.", "paper_title": "A new optimal approach for multiple optimisation objectives grid resource allocation and scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000262632000003"}
