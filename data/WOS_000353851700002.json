Partial words are sequences in which some positions may be undefined, represented with a \"hole\" symbol lozenge. If we restrict what the symbol lozenge can represent, we can use partial,words to compress the representation of regular languages. Doing so allows the creation of so-called lozenge-DFAs, smaller than the DFAs recognizing the original language L, which recognize the compressed language. However, the lozenge-DFAs may be larger than the NFAs recognizing L. In this paper, we investigate a question of Dassow et al. as to how these sizes are related. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
