Our results generalize the corresponding results about almost periodic sequence solution in common sense. Finally, computer simulations illustrate the dynamic behavior of discrete-time bidirectional neural networks. It is shown that discretization step kappa affects dynamical characteristics of bidirectional neural networks and our results on kappa-almost periodic sequence solution lead to effective estimates of continuous-time neural networks during real-time computations.
