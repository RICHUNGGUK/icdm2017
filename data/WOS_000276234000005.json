Existing interoperability solutions are suitable only for large enterprises, however, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) lack cheap, easy to integrate and easy to customize solutions. This paper proposes a methodology that provides a guide on how to establish interoperability between enterprises through a federated approach. An interoperability service platform is designed and delivered in the form of Software as a Service (SaaS). This paper introduces the specifications of the service platform and proposes an interactive framework which is used to establish interoperability between the service platform and other on-premise applications.", "paper_title": "Service-oriented Enterprise Interoperability in Automobile Supply Chain Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000276234000005"}
