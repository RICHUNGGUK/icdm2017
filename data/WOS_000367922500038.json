Meanwhile, we propose a novel algorithm to process private image data. Our experimental results show that (1) our algorithm achieves data privacy but only takes about 1/1000, time of the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm and (2) the delay of our hybrid cloud approach (including the private and public cloud communications) is only 3%- 5% more compared with the traditional public cloud- only approach.
