Setting A(lozenge) = A boolean OR{lozenge}, A(lozenge)* denotes the set of all partial words over A. In this paper, we investigate the border correlation function beta : A(lozenge)* -> {a, b}* that specifies which conjugates ( cyclic shifts) of a given partial word w of length n are bordered, that is, beta(w) = c(0)c(1) ... c(n-1) where c(i) = a or ci = b according to whether the ith cyclic shift si( w) of w is unbordered or bordered. A partial word w is bordered if a proper prefix x(1) of w is compatible with a proper suffix x(2) of w, in which case any partial word x containing both x(1) and x(2) is called a border of w. In addition to beta, we investigate an extension beta' : A lozenge* -> N* that maps a partial word w of length n to m(0)m(1) ... m(n-1) where m(i) is the length of a shortest border of sigma(i)(w). Our results extend those of Harju and Nowotka.", "paper_title": "Border Correlations of Partial Words", "paper_id": "WOS:000276746800009"}
