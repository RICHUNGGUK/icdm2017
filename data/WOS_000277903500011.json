Almost all of them put stress on analyzing nucleic acid sequences or protein primary structures. In this paper, we take the physicochemical properties of amino acids into account and introduce the protein feature sequences into phylogenetic analysis by using conditional LZ complexity. We find that this method is effectual and feasible.", "paper_title": "Phylogenetic Analysis of Protein Sequences Based on Conditional LZ Complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000277903500011"}
