AdaBoost algorithm selects a set of weak classifiers and combines them into a final strong classifier. However, conventional AdaBoost is a sequential forward search procedure using the greedy selection strategy, the weights of weak classifiers may not be optimized. To address this issue, we proposed a novel Genetic Algorithm post optimization procedure for a given boosted classifier, which yields better generalization performance.", "paper_title": "Cascade AdaBoost classifiers with stage optimization for face detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300017"}
