The very features of packet traffic, like packet lengths statistics, inter-packet times, volumes of exchanged traffic, communication patterns, leak information. Leakage ranges from the kind of-application that generates the information flow carried into the supposedly secure connection to parts of its content. We propose traffic masking as a countermeasure. Full confidentiality protection is discussed and the traffic masking framework is introduced and motivated. The optimization and performance assessment of the masking device is evaluated both through a general analytical model, mainly useful to gain basic insight, and by a real network emulation of a distributed secure multiparty computation application, where confidentiality requirements are key to the application itself. It is shown that essentially full confidentiality can be attained for a practical distributed security application by accepting an increase of the traffic volume by a factor 2.4 and an increase of the task completion time of 30%. Hence, (almost) full privacy appears to be more appealing for contexts where delay constraints are more valuable than bandwidth. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
