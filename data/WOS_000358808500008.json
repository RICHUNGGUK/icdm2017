HAR is a very challenging task that has been applied in different areas such as rehabilitation and localization. During the past ten years, plenty of models, number of sensors and sensor placements, and feature transformations have been reported for this task. From this bunch of previous ideas, what seems to be clear is that the very specific applications drive to the selection of the best choices for each case. Present research is focused on early diagnosis of stroke, what involves reducing the feature space of gathered data and subsequent MAR, among other tasks. In this study, an Information Correlation Coefficient (ICC) analysis was carried out followed by a wrapper Feature Selection (FS) method on the reduced input space. Additionally, a novel MAR method is proposed for this specific problem of stroke early diagnosing, comprising an adaptation of the well-known Genetic Fuzzy Finite State Machine (GFFSM) method. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the very first analysis of the feature space concerning all the previously published feature transformations on raw acceleration data. The main contributions of this study are the optimization of the sample rate, selection of the best feature subset, and learning of a suitable HAR method based on GFFSM to be applied to the HAR problem.
